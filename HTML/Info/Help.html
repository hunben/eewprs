<h2>The home page</h2>

<p>When you insert the CD, or when you open the
Electronic Edition from the start menu,
you land on the "home page" of EE7.5.

<p>&nbsp;
<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_startingpage.png" width=491 height=313
 alt="Screenshot of the home page"></td></tr></table></p>
<p>&nbsp;

<p>You can return to the home page at any
time by clicking on the "Home" link at the
top left corner of the browser window.</p>

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_homelink.png" width=114 height=99
 alt="Home link"></td></tr></table></p>

<p>Every page of EE7.5 is accessible from the
home page with a few clicks.

<h2>The quick navigation links</h2>

<p>At the top left of the screen, next to the Home link,
there are three more links that quickly take you to the
desired position in the navigation bar:

<p><b>Books</b> takes you to the list of books and discourses.
<br><b>Words</b> takes you to the list of pre-indexed words.
<br><b>Help</b> takes you to the list of help pages.

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_quicklinks.png" width=186 height=112
 alt="Quick navigation links"></td></tr></table></p>

<p>The same items &ndash; books, discourses,
help pages &ndash; can also be accessed
by scrolling the navigation bar.


<h2>The navigation bar</h2>

<p>The vertical navigation bar on the left contains
the links to the main areas of the program. You will
start most of your searches there:

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_navigationbar.png" width=195 height=213
  alt="Navigation bar"></td></tr></table></p>

<p>The navigation bar includes the following
sections:

<p><b>Books</b> contains the list of books.

<br><b>Discourses</b> contains the alphabetical
and chronological list of documents and discourses.

<br><b>Words</b> contains the
list of all words used throughout EE7.5.

<br><b>Help</b> contains the
list of help pages such as this one.








<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name=books></a><h2>The books</h2>

<p>The first group of links in the navigation bar
takes you to the books area.

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_books.png"  width=367 height=112
  alt="List of books"></td></tr></table></p>

<h3>Finding a book</h3>

<p>The books are listed by title in alphabetical order.

<p>You can click on the word "Books" in the
navigation bar and scroll down until you find
the book you are looking for.

<p>You can also click on the first letter of the
title and reach that position in the list of titles.

<h3>Opening a book</h3>

<p>In the list, each title is followed by the list of
its chapters. You can click on the title to open the
book at the beginning, or you can click on a particular
chapter to go straight there.</p>

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_books_toc.png" width=533 height=229
  alt="Book title and chapters"></td></tr></table></p>

<h3>Inside a book</h3>

<p>Each book is contained in a single,
long HTML page.

<p>At the top of the book page is the title
and a list of the chapters.
You can click on a chapter to go straight there,
or use the scroll bar to scroll down.

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_book_top.png" width=413 height=354
  alt="Inside a book"></td></tr></table></p>

<h3>Inside a chapter</h3>

<p>At the top of each chapter or book section
there are a few navigation controls:

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_book_chapter.png"  width=345 height=350></td></tr></table>

<p>At the bottom of each chapter you find additional
information related to the specific chapter:

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_book_chapter_bottom.png" width=498 height=218></td></tr></table>


<h2>Discourses</h2>

<p>Below the books links in the navigation bar are
the links to the individual discourses. The
discourses are listed twice, in alphabetical
and in chronological order.

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_discourses.png"  width=389 height=294></td></tr></table>

<p>Click on the "Alphabetical" link
to open the list at the beginning,
or click on a letter to jump to
the titles starting with it.

<p>Similarly, click on "Chronological" to
open the list at the beginning, or on
a number (representing the year, i.e. 55 = 1955, etc.)

<p>Discourses with no available date
are listed under "Undated".

<p>From the discourse lists you can
go to each individual discourse
(click on the title) or go
to the books in which the
discourse is included (click
on the book titles)

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_disc_list.png"  width=551 height=216></td></tr></table></p>







<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name=words></a>
<h2>Words index</h2>

<p>All the words used in the Electronic
Edition have been indexed and with a few
clicks you can find any word and all the
discourses in which it is used.

<p>For example, to look up the word
"Ananda":

<p>Step 1: Locate the first two letters
of the word in the navigation bar,
(In this case "An") and click on the link...

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_words_1.png"  width=186 height=172></td></tr></table>

<p>Step 2: Locate the word you are looking
for and click on it....

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_words_2.png"  width=456 height=234></td></tr></table>

<p>Step 3: Examine the results
and follow the desired links:

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_words_3.png"  width=511 height=476></td></tr></table>

<p>NOTE: Because there are about 60,000 words
listed and the total size of these pre-indexed
word files is over 400 MB, if you install
EE7.5 on your computer the installer will let
you choose whether or not to include the word
index. Installation is explained later
in this page.</p>







<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name=search></a>
<h2>The EE7.5 Search application</h2>

<p>EE7.5 includes a Windows program for advanced text
search. You can use it to search the entire Electronic
Edition for exact phrases, partial words, etc.

<p>You can use the search program from
the CD itself or install it on your
computer with the text.

<p>In the CD, the search program is in the
<b>X:\Windows\Search</b> folder,
where X is the letter of your CD drive.

<p>If your computer has the
CD Autorun feature enabled,
a EE7.5 welcome menu appears
automatically when you insert
the CD, and you can click the
"Search Text on CD" button
to run the search program.

<p>If you install the EE7.5 Search
program on your computer you can
then run it from the
Start menu:  Start\Programs\Electronic&nbsp;Edition&nbsp;7\Search

<p>See the program's own help page for
detailed instructions on how to conduct
searches.</p>

<a name=autorun></a>
<h2>Autorun application</h2>

<p>If your computer has the
CD Autorun feature enabled,
a EE7.5 welcome menu appears
automatically when you insert
the CD in the drive.

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src="../images/help_autorun.png"  width=213 height=299></td></tr></table>

<p>From there you can open the EE7.5 home
page, launch the search program, or
start installing the EE7.5 files and
programs on your computer.</p>





<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name=install></a>
<h2>Install EE7.5 on your computer</h2>

<p><b>Windows:</b>

<p><li>Open the CD with Windows Explorer and
open the folder <b>X:\Windows\Setup</b>
(where X is the letter of your CD drive).

<p><li>Run the <b>Install</b> program (file Install.exe)

<p><li>The installer will give you the option
to choose exactly what you want to install.
You can run the installation again later
to add components.

<p><li>After the installer program finishes
copying the files you will be able to access
the Electronic Edition from Windows' the Start menu
(Start\Programs\Electronic Edition 7)

<p><b>Mac, Linux, and other Operating Systems</b>

<p><li>Insert the CD and browse into
the folder named <b>HTML</b>. You will
find a single file there, named index.html,
and several subfolders (Books, Discourses,
Images, etc.)

<p><li>Create an empty folder on your
computer into which you'll install EE7.5.

<p><li>(A) If you want a complete installation,
which will take about 500 MB of disk space,
copy the entire content of the CD's
HTML folder into your new folder.

<p><li>(B) If you want to use less than 100 MB
of disk space on your computer, copy the entire
content of the HTML folder,
<font color=red>except the sub-folder
named Words</font>. You will still have
all books and discourses and navigation
files, but you will not have the pre-indexed
words' files, which take over 400 MB of
disk space.

<p><li>Open the Electronic Edition by
opening the <b>index.html</b> file.
You may create a shortcut to this file to
open EE7.5 without having to browse to
this folder every time.

<p><li>For advanced text search, use any text
indexing and search application available
for your operating system.

<h2>Ucis and Nicis</h2>

<p>P.R. Sarkar's "Roman Sanskrit" system
of writing Sanskrit with Roman letters,
two types of diacritical marks are used:
the <i>Uci</i> and the <i>Nici</i>.

<p><b><i>Uci</i></b> stands for "<u>U</u>rdhva <u>ci</u>hna"
which means "mark above". It's a small sign,
similar to an acute accent, placed above letters
a, u, r, t, d, n and s, turning them into
a&#x301; u&#x301; r&#x301; t&#x301; d&#x301;
n&#x301; m&#x301; s&#x301;.

<p>In this edition the Unicode character U+0301
has been used as the uci mark. When writing
in plain ASCII (e.g. in an email) an apostrophe
can be used in lieu of the uci: a', u', r',
t', d', n', m', s'. This is also how Roman
Sanskrit used to be written in prior versions
of the Electronic Edition.

<p><b><i>Nici</i></b> stands for
"<u>Ni</u>mna <u>ci</u>hna", which means
"mark below". The nici is only used below
the letter N, and it has the shape of
a circumflex accent: N&#x32D;, n&#x32D;.

<p>When writing in plain ASCII the
nici is usually omitted, and it can usually
be inferred from the context. For example,
the word "Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na" would
be written "<font face="courier new, courier, fixed">Jina'na</font>".
When one must indicate a of a nici,
the ASCII character "^" may be
used after the n, in which case the word
"Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na" would be written
"<font face="courier new, courier, fixed">Jin^a'na</font>".

<p>Using only these two simple signs, uci and nici,
it is possible to romanize correctly and
without ambiguity not only the Sanskrit vocabulary,
but also other Indic scripts such as
Bengali, Devanagari, Urdu, etc.





<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name=fonts></a>
<h2>Fonts</h2>

<p>Do the following characters...<br><br>
a&#x301; u&#x301; r&#x301; t&#x301; d&#x301; n&#x301; n&#x32D; m&#x301; s&#x301;<br>
A&#x301; U&#x301; R&#x301; T&#x301; D&#x301; N&#x301; N&#x32D; M&#x301; S&#x301;</p>

<p>...look like this?<br>
<img src="../images/help_TahomaUciNici.png"  width=153 height=59>

<p>And do the following characters...<br><br>
<span class=Bengali>&#x0986;&#x09A8;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A6;
&#x09AE;&#x09BE;&#x09B0;&#x09CD;&#x0997;</span>

<p>...look like this?<br>
<img src="../images/help_RupaliBangla.png"  width=156 height=62>

<P>If the characters above look like
those on the yellow background (small
differences in the position of the
marks or in the shape of the letters are OK)
then you already have all the necessary
fonts installed, and you don't need to
do anything.

<p>If however some of the above characters
are not displayed properly, you need to
install (or upgrade) the proper fonts.

<p>The fonts needed are two: Tahoma,
for Roman letters, and Rupali, for
Indic (Bengali and Devanagari) letters.

<p>These fonts are included on the CD
and here is how to install them:

<p><b>Windows</b>

<p>Open the folder named "Fonts" in
the main Windows folder. Usually
it will be C:\WINDOWS\FONTS

<p>If you have a font named Tahoma,
delete it first. (You need to first
delete the old version before you install
a new one).

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src=../images/help_fonts_delete_tahoma.png  width=286 height=376></td></tr></table>

<p>(You may have to do the same for
other fonts if an older version is present
on your system and Windows gives you a warning.)

<p>Then click on File | Install new font...

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src=../images/help_fonts_install_new.png  width=174 height=234></td></tr></table>

<p>Then browse to the CD drive, open the folder Fonts,
select all the fonts listed there, make sure
the option Copy fonts to Fonts folder is selected,
and click on OK.

<p style=help_img><table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 bordercolor=silver><tr><td>
<img src=../images/help_fonts_select.png  width=402 height=321></td></tr></table>

<p>Once the fonts are installed you may refresh
this page (F5) and you should be able to see
all characters properly. (In some cases the
proper characters may only show up after you
restart Windows)

<p><b>MacIntosh</b>

<p>Insert the CD.

<p>Open the Fonts folder on the CD

<p>Open the Fonts folder on the Mac.

<p>Search for the Tahoma font on your Mac,
and if you find it, delete it.

<p>Copy the font files from the CD to
the Mac, and they will be installed.

<p>Note: If you do not delete an older
version of Tahoma or other fonts,
OSX will not replace it with the new
one, but will add the new one with the
name Tahoma2. After that there will be
two fonts with the same name, and the
system may or may not choose the right
one to display the characters. Therefore
it's necessary to delete the old font
before installing the new one.





<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name=copy_paste></a>
<h2>Copy and Paste</h2>

<p>You can do common clipboard
copy-and-paste operations from these
pages to word processors, spreadsheets,
etc.

<p>If however in the selected text there
are characters with ucis (A&#x301;, U&#x301; etc.)
and nicis (n&#x32D; and N&#x32D;),
then, after you paste the text into
a word processor, you will have to select
a proper Unicode font (Tahoma, Arial Unicode, etc.)
capable of rendering these diacritical marks.




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name=small_screen></a>
<h2>EE7.5 on mobile phones and other devices with small screens</h2>

<p>Mobile phones, smartphones, PDAs, and other devices
equipped with a web browser can be used to read this
edition of P.R. Sarkar's  books and discourses.

<p>Because these devices have small screens, a simplified 
page layout is available, so that the full width of the
screen is available for reading while a thin, 
simplified navigation bar remais visible at the   
top of the screen.

<p>You can access the simplified layout from the home
page, clicking the link
<a href=../small_screen.html>Small screen view</a>

<p>You can return to the full layout by clicking on
<a href=../index.html>Full screen view</a> in the
simplified layout's home page.
