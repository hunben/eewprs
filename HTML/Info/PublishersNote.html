<h1>Publisher's Note</h1>

<p><b>The Works of P.R. Sarkar</b></p>

<p>Between 1955 and 1990 Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, whose spiritual
name was Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti, through his discourses and dictations
produced material for what has now become a total of 269 books in  Bengali,
English and Hindi. He wrote in the name Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar when
treating sociology, economics, philology and various other subjects, and
when writing children's tales; and in the name Shrii  Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti
when focusing on spiritual topics. Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar was the name in
which his 5018 Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita songs were published. Those songs,
mostly in Bengali, were first published
in a series of small booklets, and have
now been compiled into ten large Bengali volumes. Translation of those ten volumes
into a 25-volume English series
is under way, hence Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita (though for
the most part not yet available in English) is counted as 25 books
in the reckoning of 269.</p>

<p>128 of the 269 books are now available in English. All of them
except the two available Prabha&#x301;ta  Sam&#x301;giita volumes have been compiled into
this Electronic Edition. (Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita, text and audio,
will in future be  presented
separately on another CD.) For more specific remarks about the contents of
the various books, see  their respective Publisher's Notes within this
edition.</p>

<p>The figures of 269 and 128 are for books originally published by
Ananda Marga Central Publications.  Seven English compilations not
originally published by Ananda Marga Central Publications, rather by Ananda
Marga Publications at other levels but now the property of Ananda Marga
Central Publications and also  included in the ElEdit, are Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;'s Grace,
The Great Universe, Supreme Expression Volume 1, Supreme  Expression Volume
2, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Taiwan and Universal Humanism. Virtually all
of their contents duplicates material that has been included among the 128.
</p>

<p><b>ElEdit 7</b></p>

<p>The ElEdit 7 contains all the 1224 discourses and articles by Shrii
P.R. Sarkar that have ever been  published in English. ("Discourse" here means that the author  originally
delivered it as a speech before an audience. "Article" means that the author
gave it as dictation  to one or a few persons. "Published in English" means
that the discourse/article was either originally given  in English, or
subsequently translated from the original Bengali or Hindi.) The count of
1224 includes as one discourse or article each the long discourses Problems of the Day
and To the Patriots; Discourses on Prout, which was  really a series of
discourses; A Guide to Human Conduct, which is divided into sections; and
Sarkar's English  Grammar. Many book chapters in the count of
discourses/articles/chapters are really excerpts or compilations  of
excerpts from other discourses; to pare the figure of 1224
to an exact count of original discourses/articles would require
a very detailed calculation. Light Comes, a collection of short excerpts
published as a book, is  counted as one discourse; and The Thoughts of P.R.
Sarkar, a similar book, is counted as two discourses  ("Spiritual
Discourses" and "Social Discourses").</p>

<p><b>DMC</b></p>
<p>Normally the most important of the author's discourses
on spiritual topics were given on the occasions of DMC.
Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra was a special spiritual gathering addressed by the
author as preceptor of Ananda Marga. The inclusion of the September, 1979
Haifa and Kingston DMC's in this ElEdit 7 finally completes the publication
in English of all the DMC's that the author gave (all of them in English)
outside of India.</p>

<p><b>Tables of Contents</b></p>

<p>All of the discourses/articles/chapters are listed under the link
Discourses on the home page, and  all of the books under the link Books.
Both the discourses and the books are listed, along with certain
clarifications, in "The Complete Tables of
Contents of all the English-Language Books of PR Sarkar". "The Complete Tables of
Contents . . ." is a file
(<a href="../../Documents/Engl-toc.doc">engl-toc.doc</a>)
available in the <b>Documents</b> folder of the CD.

<p><b>Not Yet Translated</b></p>

<p>As of this version of the ElEdit, around 700 discourses/articles
of Shrii P.R. Sarkar remain untranslated from the Bengali or Hindi.</p>

<p><b>Corrections</b></p>

<p>Only the latest printed versions (as of May 2006)
of all the discourses/articles
have been reproduced in this Electronic Edition. Moreover,
as compared to the printed books,
corrections of mistakes in translation or in tape
transcription have been made in many
discourses/articles. All such changes have been flagged by enclosing them in double
square brackets [[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]]. In addition to such significant
changes that have been flagged, obvious spelling, punctuation and
typographical mistakes may have been corrected without any such flagging.
If apart from corrections of obvious spelling, punctuation and typographical
mistakes, any discrepancies between the ElEdit and the printed books are
noticed which have not been flagged, the printed books should be  taken as
authoritative. Please report any such discrepancies to us at
<a href="mailto:support@eledit.net">support@eledit.net</a>,
preferably with a copy to
<a href="mailto:translat@cal3.vsnl.net.in">translat@cal3.vsnl.net.in</a>
<!-- (translat@cal3.vsnl.net.in). -->

<p><b>Source Information</b></p>
<!-- [source inform] -->
<p>For information about the publication history of any
discourse, click (at the top or bottom of the discourse)
on the title of the book in which that discourse was
published;
this will take you to the table of contents of that book. Then see if there is a
Publisher's Note for that book. If there is, it may contain source
information.

<p><b>Etymologies of Words</b></p>

<p>The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the
etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (-)
follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix.
Thus <i>ava - tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra</i> can be read, "the root
<i>tr</i> prefixed by <i>ava</i> and suffixed by <i>ghain&#x32D;</i> becomes <i>avata&#x301;ra</i>."


<p><b>Acknowledgements</b></p>

<p>The English translation and editing of the works of Shrii P.R.
Sarkar accomplished to date has been  made possible by a great number of
persons, almost all of whom volunteered their time and energy, over a
period of fifty-one years. It would not be practical to name all such
persons here; nor would it even be  possible, because full records have not
been kept of this history of dedication. Despite the exhausting  labour
sometimes involved in producing publications materials of good quality, all
such persons felt that it  was a rare privilege to be allowed to do this
work. Perhaps they felt that it was they who owed an  acknowledgement to the
author. But society should acknowledge its debt to these persons, even if
they remain nameless, and heedless of recognition.</p>


<p><b>Some English Translation Statistics (updated 22 June 06)</b></p>

<p>As of April '91, we calculated the writings of Ba'ba' (as
Shrii P.R. Sarkar is affectionately known), published or scheduled for publication (scheduled, that is, on the basis of known discourses as yet unpublished in book form), to come to 420 titles.* (Of course between some titles there was considerable repetition of material.)</p>

<p>* The 420 included P.R. Sarkar on History, A'darsh Bhojpuri Vya'ka'ran' [Ideal Bhojpuri Grammar] and a book on Angika grammar. P.R. Sarkar on History was originally included among the Ba'ba' books scheduled for publication, and is now, though it eventually came out in Da'da' Raghuna'th's name, included in the 420 as one of Ba'ba''s published books. A'darsh Bhojpuri Vya'ka'ran', though written by Da'da' Shraddha'nanda, was written basically according to instructions given by Ba'ba', hence is also included. A book on Angika grammar similarly commissioned by Ba'ba' has not been written yet, but was inadvertently included when these statistics were first compiled, hence continues to be included for statistical convenience.</p>

<p>That 420 base began to expand in October '94, based partly on rediscovered darshans -- some from tapes, some from old magazines and notes -- and partly on new compilation of existing material. Based on rediscovered darshans, we now have A'nanda Vacana'mrtam Part 24 (Bengali), Parts 25-29 and 32 (Hindi), and Parts 30, 31, 33 and 34 (English); Subha's'ita Sam'graha Parts 22, 23 and 25 (Hindi) and Part 24 (English); and Jiivana Diipika' (Bengali). Based on new compilation, we have (in Bengali) the books Bhaktirasa o Kiirtana-Mahima' [The Flow of Bhakti and the Bliss of Kiirtana], Ba'm'la'r Man'ipradiip Barendrabhu'mi [Barendrabhu'mi: The Jewel-Lamp of Bengal], Prakrta Guru Ke? [The Criteria of a Guru], Dravyagun'e Roga'rogya [Herbal Cures for Disease] and Pra'ut'er Ru'parekha' [An Outline of Prout]; (in Bengali and English) the books Krs'n'atattva o Giita'sa'ra (Discourses on Krs'n'a and the Giita') and Na'riir Marya'da' (The Awakening of Women); and (in English) the books Discourses on Neohumanist Education and Prabha'ta Sam'giita Selected Songs Part 1.
     420 + 25 = in all 445 titles.
     7 of the original 420 were considered untranslatable (there would be no purpose in translating them) -- e.g., Ba'ba''s Bengali dictionary. So regarding English, the base of books already available in English, or scheduled ultimately for English publication, was 413 and has now grown to 438.
     The following table shows the translation progress, such as it has been, between April '91 in the left column and June 2006 in the right, for those 438 books (413 of which we calculated for in '91 and 25 of which we didn't):</p>

<p>* P.R. Sarkar on History was originally included among the 19 Ba'ba' books due for original publication in English, and is now, though it came out in Da'da' Raghuna'th's name, included among the figure of 139 in English.</p>

<p>So the total still to come out in English is 296 + 3 = 299.</p>

<p>The above figures count the 201 small Bengali booklets in which Prabha'ta
Sam'giita originally came out as one book each. However,
see below.

<p><b>Calculating the Pace of the English Work</b></p>

<p>26 new English titles (translations or original English) have come out since April '91: Proutist Economics, Tantra 1 and 2, Discourses on Prout, SS 11, 12, 18, 19, 21 and 24, A'V 23, 30, 31, 33 and 34, P.R. Sarkar on History, The Awakening of Women, Shabda Cayanika' 1-3, Neohumanist Education, Discourses on Krs'n'a and the Giita', Varn'a Vijina'na, Strange Experiences, Ra'r'h: The Cradle of Civilization, Prabha'ta Sam'giita Selected Songs Part 1.
     (Of course as far as work during that 15-year period, there have also been many reprints/retranslations -- Problems of the Day, To the Patriots, Yoga Psychology (twice revised), I&I, English Grammar, Namah Shiva'ya Sha'nta'ya, CC1, A'nanda Su'tram, Nama'mi Krs'n'asundaram, A'nanda Ma'rga: Elementary Philosophy, Human Society 1 and 2, Liberation of Intellect, Neohumanism in a Nutshell 1, Yogic Treatments -- but these have not affected the statistics.)
     For purposes of a future projection, it would be best
     to remember that out of the overall total of 445
     titles, 201, as mentioned above, are small Bengali Prabha'ta Sam'giita
     booklets; and therefore to adjust the figures in terms of the full-size books that will appear in English. The PS booklets will be published in English eight to a volume (a full-size book); they will constitute 25 full-size books. In these terms the overall total comes to 445 - 201 + 25 = 269 books (7 of them untranslatable), and in these terms the above table (which focuses on the English) would appear as follows:</p>

<p>     * P.R. Sarkar on History was originally included among the 19 Ba'ba' books due for original publication in English, and is now, though it came out in Da'da' Raghuna'th's name, included among the figure of 128 in English.</p>

<p>141 + 19 = 160 full-size books still to come out in English as of '91. 26 have actually come out in those 15 years, so at the rate of 26 every 15 years, with 134 books (full-size books) still to go, it will take about 77 years to complete the work.
     This is a strict calculation according to number of
     untranslated titles. But many of the individual
     articles in those books have come out in different
     English compilations; and as mentioned, among some
     titles there is considerable repetition of material
     (it would be very detailed to calculate just how
     much); and we expect the time spent on
     reprints/retranslations to decrease somewhat. So
     perhaps 65 years to complete the work, if we maintained
     the pace of the past fifteen years.</p>
     
<p>However, under an accelerated-translation project initiated
in July of 2005, the translation of six new books is well under way, and we now expect the pace of the past fifteen years to be greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>Here are the 134 books still to come out in English (131 to be translated from the Bengali or Hindi, 3 to be published originally in English). Subtotals are indicated in { }:</p>
