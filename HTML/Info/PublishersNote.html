<h1>Publisher's Note</h1>

<p><b>The Works of P.R. Sarkar</b></p>

<p>Between 1955 and 1990 Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, whose spiritual
name was Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti, through his discourses and dictations
produced material for what has now become a total of 268 books, some of them orginally
published in Bengali, some in
English, and some in Hindi. He wrote in the name Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar when
treating sociology, economics, philology, history and various other subjects, and
when writing children's tales; and in the name Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti
when focusing on spiritual topics. Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar was the name in
which his 5018 Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita songs were published. Those songs,
mostly in Bengali, were first published
in a series of small booklets, and have
now been compiled into ten large Bengali volumes. Translation of those ten volumes
into a 25-volume English series
is under way, hence Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita (though for
the most part not yet available in English) is counted as 25 books
in the reckoning of 268.</p>

<p>138 of the 268 books are now available in English. All of them except the five most recent
and the two available books that contain Prabha&#x301;ta  Sam&#x301;giita songs have been compiled into
this Electronic Edition. (Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita, text and audio,
will in future be presented
separately on another CD.) For more specific remarks about the contents of
the various books, see  their respective Publisher's Notes within this
edition.</p>

<p>The figures of 268 and 138 are for books originally published by
Ananda Marga Central Publications. Seven English compilations not
originally published by Ananda Marga Central Publications, rather by Ananda
Marga Publications at other levels but now the property of Ananda Marga
Central Publications and also  included in the ElEdit, are Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;'s Grace,
The Great Universe, Supreme Expression Volume 1, Supreme  Expression Volume
2, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Taiwan and Universal Humanism. Virtually all
of their contents duplicates material that has been included among the 138.
</p>

<p><b>ElEdit 7.5</b></p>

<p>The ElEdit 7 contained all the 1207 discourses and articles by Shrii
P.R. Sarkar that had, as of that time, ever been  published in English. ("Discourse" here means that the author  originally
delivered it as a speech before an audience. "Article" means that the author
gave it as dictation  to one or a few persons. "Published in English" means
that the discourse/article was either originally given  in English, or
subsequently translated from the original Bengali or Hindi. The Publisher's Note
of the ElEdit 7 gave a figure of 1224 discourses and articles; but 17 Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita songs
had mistakenly been counted as discourses, so the figure should have been 1207.)
This Version 7.5 includes five books newly-published since Version 7,
bringing the count of discourses/articles to 1266; and one book that was
being reprinted included, as a
new article, a portion of an article already existing in another
book, bringing the count to 1267. The 7.5 also includes five new
discourses or articles never before published
in any language, bringing the count to 1272; and meanwhile, one
article was dropped from a book that was being reprinted, since the material was
duplicated elsewhere, and hence has been dropped from
the ElEdit also. So the final count of discourses/articles in this ElEdit 7.5 is 1271.

<p>The five new discourses or articles never before published
in any language: "The Vital Energy of Students", "Subtler than the Subtlest Mind", "Movement Is the Order of the Day",
"The Philosophical Interpretation of Progress" and "August 2nd, 1988".

<p>The count of
1271 includes as one discourse or article each the long discourses Problems of the Day
and To the Patriots; Discourses on Prout, which was  really a series of
discourses; A Guide to Human Conduct, which is divided into sections; and
Sarkar's English  Grammar. Many book chapters in the count of
discourses/articles/chapters are really excerpts or compilations  of
excerpts from other discourses; to pare the figure of 1271
to an exact count of original discourses/articles would require
a very detailed calculation. Light Comes, a collection of short excerpts
published as a book, is counted as one discourse; and The Thoughts of P.R.
Sarkar, a similar book, is counted as two discourses  ("Spiritual
Discourses" and "Social Discourses").</p>

<p><b>DMC and RU</b></p>
<p>Normally the most important of the author's discourses
on spiritual topics were given on the occasions of dharma maha&#x301;cakra.
Dharma maha&#x301;cakra was a special spiritual gathering addressed by the
author as preceptor of Ananda Marga. And often the most important of
the author's discourses on topics related more to the physical universe
than to the spiritual, were
his addresses as the president of the organization Renaissance Universal.
Dharma maha&#x301;cakra discourses and Renaissance Universal addresses can
be identified by the codes "DMC" and "RU" among the notes at the bottom of
each article or discourse.</p>

<p><b>Tables of Contents</b></p>

<p>All of the discourses/articles/chapters are listed under the link
Discourses on the home page, and  all of the books under the link Books.
Both the discourses and the books are listed, along with certain
clarifications, in "The Complete Tables of
Contents of all the English-Language Books of PR Sarkar". "The Complete Tables of
Contents . . ." is a file
(<a href="../../Documents/Engl-toc.doc">engl-toc.doc</a>)
available in the <b>Documents</b> folder of the CD.

<p><b>Not Yet Translated</b></p>

<p>As of this version of the ElEdit, around 600 discourses/articles
of Shrii P.R. Sarkar remain untranslated from the Bengali or Hindi.</p>

<p><b>Corrections</b></p>

<p>Only the latest printed versions (as of October 2009)
of all the discourses/articles
have been reproduced in this Electronic Edition. Moreover,
as compared to the printed books,
corrections of mistakes in translation or in tape
transcription have been made in many
discourses/articles. All such changes have been flagged by enclosing them in double
square brackets [[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]]. In addition to such significant
changes that have been flagged, obvious spelling, punctuation and
typographical mistakes may have been corrected without any such flagging.
If apart from corrections of obvious spelling, punctuation and typographical
mistakes, any discrepancies between the ElEdit and the printed books are
noticed which have not been flagged, the printed books should be  taken as
authoritative. Please report any such discrepancies to us at
<a href="mailto:support@eledit.net">support@eledit.net</a>,
preferably with a copy to
<a href="mailto:translat@cal3.vsnl.net.in">translat@cal3.vsnl.net.in</a>
<!-- (translat@cal3.vsnl.net.in). -->

<p><b>Source Information</b></p>
<!-- [source inform] -->
<p>For information about the publication history of any
discourse, click (at the top or bottom of the discourse)
on the title of the book in which that discourse was
published;
this will take you to the table of contents of that book. Then see if there is a
Publisher's Note for that book. If there is, it may contain source
information.

<p><b>Notes</b></p>

<p>In the Notes at the top of a discourse or article, you will often
see that the discourse/article has appeared in a number of books,
and that some of the books are compilations of articles
from other books. In such cases, the book which is not described as a
compilation is considered to be the official source of that
discourse/article.

<p><b>Etymologies of Words</b></p>

<p>The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the
etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (-)
follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix.
Thus <i>ava - tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra</i> can be read, "the root
<i>tr</i> prefixed by <i>ava</i> and suffixed by <i>ghain&#x32D;</i> becomes <i>avata&#x301;ra</i>."</p>


<p><b>Acknowledgements</b></p>

<p>The English translation and editing of the works of Shrii P.R.
Sarkar accomplished to date has been  made possible by a great number of
persons, almost all of whom volunteered their time and energy, over a
period of fifty-four years. It would not be practical to name all such
persons here; nor would it even be  possible, because full records have not
been kept of this history of dedication. Despite the exhausting labour
sometimes involved in producing publications materials of good quality, all
such persons felt that it  was a rare privilege to be allowed to do this
work. Perhaps they felt that it was they who owed an acknowledgement to the
author. But society should acknowledge its debt to these persons, even if
they remain nameless, and heedless of recognition.</p>


<p><b>Some English Translation Statistics (updated 1 October 09)</b></p>

<p>As of April '91, we calculated the writings of Ba'ba' (as
Shrii P.R. Sarkar is affectionately known), published or scheduled for publication (scheduled, that is, on the basis of known discourses as yet unpublished in book form), to come to 419 titles.* (Between some titles there was considerable repetition of material.)</p>

<p>* The 419 included P.R. Sarkar on History, A'darsh Bhojpuri Vya'ka'ran' [Ideal Bhojpuri Grammar] and a book on Angika grammar. P.R. Sarkar on History was originally included among the Ba'ba' books scheduled for publication, and is now, though it eventually came out in Da'da' Raghuna'th's name, included in the 419 as one of Ba'ba''s published books. A'darsh Bhojpuri Vya'ka'ran', though written by Da'da' Shraddha'nanda, was written basically according to instructions given by Ba'ba', hence is also included. A book on Angika grammar similarly commissioned by Ba'ba' has not been written yet, but was inadvertently included when these statistics were first compiled, hence continues to be included for statistical convenience.</p>

<p>That 419 base began to expand in October '94, based partly on rediscovered darshans --
some from tapes, some from old magazines and notes -- and partly on new compilation of
existing material. Based on rediscovered darshans, we now have A'nanda Vacana'mrtam Part 24
(Bengali), Parts 25-29 and 32 (Hindi), and Parts 30, 31, 33 and 34 (English); Subha's'ita
Sam'graha Parts 22, 23 and 25 (Hindi) and Part 24 (English); and Jiivana Diipika' (Bengali).
Based on new compilation, we have (in Bengali) the books Bhaktirasa o Kiirtana-Mahima' [The
Flow of Bhakti and the Bliss of Kiirtana], Ba'm'la'r Man'ipradiip Barendrabhu'mi
[Barendrabhu'mi: The Jewel-Lamp of Bengal], Prakrt Guru Ke? [The Criteria of a Guru],
Dravyagun'e Roga'rogya [Natural Medicine] and Pra'ut'er Ru'parekha' [An Outline of
Prout]; (in Bengali and English) the books Krs'n'atattva o Giita'sa'ra (Discourses on
Krs'n'a and the Giita'), Na'riir Marya'da' (The Awakening of Women) and Discourses on Neohumanist Education
(Navyama'navata'va'd Shiks'a'); and (in English) the book Prabha'ta Sam'giita Selected Songs Part 1.
     419 + 25 = in all 444 titles.
     7 of the original 419 were considered untranslatable (there would be no purpose in translating them) -- e.g., Ba'ba''s Bengali dictionary. So regarding English, the base of books already available in English, or scheduled ultimately for English publication, was 412 and has now grown to 437.
     The following table shows the translation progress, such as it has been, between April '91 in the left column and September 2009 in the right, for those 437 books (412 of which we calculated for in '91 and 25 of which we didn't):</p>

<p>* P.R. Sarkar on History was originally included among the 18 Ba'ba' books due for original publication in English, and is now, though it came out in Da'da' Raghuna'th's name, included among the figure of 149 in English.</p>

<p>So the total still to come out in English is 286 + 2 = 288.</p>

<p>The above figures count the 201 small Bengali booklets in which Prabha'ta
Sam'giita originally came out as one book each. However,
see below.

<p><b>Calculating the Pace of the English Work</b></p>

<p>36 new English titles (translations or original English) have come out since April '91:
Proutist Economics, Tantra 1 and 2, Discourses on Prout, SS 11, 12, 18, 19, 21 and 24, A'nanda
Vacana'mrtam 9-11, 23, 30, 31, 33 and 34,
P.R. Sarkar on History, The Awakening of Women, Shabda Cayanika' 1-5, Neohumanist
Education, Discourses on Krs'n'a and the Giita', Varn'a Vijina'na, Strange
Experiences, Ra'r'h: The Cradle of Civilization, Prabha'ta Sam'giita Selected
Songs Part 1,
Sam'giita: Song, Dance and Instrumental Music, Birds and Animals Our Neighbours,
 and Histories along the Way 1-3.
     (Of course as far as work during that 18-1/2-year period, there have also been many
     reprints/retranslations -- Problems of the Day, To the Patriots, Yoga Psychology
     (three times revised), Idea & Ideology, English Grammar, Namah Shiva'ya Sha'nta'ya, Carya'carya 1, A'nanda Su'tram,
     Nama'mi Krs'n'asundaram, A'nanda Ma'rga: Elementary Philosophy, Human Society 1 and 2,
     Liberation of Intellect, Neohumanism in a Nutshell 1, Yogic Treatments (twice revised),
     A'nanda Vacana'mrtam 12 -- but these have not affected the statistics.)
     For purposes of a future projection, it would be best
     to remember that out of the overall total of 444
     titles, 201, as mentioned above, are small Bengali Prabha'ta Sam'giita
     booklets; and therefore to adjust the figures in terms of the full-size books that will appear in English. The PS booklets will be published in English eight to a volume (a full-size book); they will constitute 25 full-size books.
     In these terms the overall total comes to 444 - 201 + 25 = 268 books (7 of them untranslatable), and in these terms the above table (which focuses on the English) would appear as follows:</p>

<p>     * P.R. Sarkar on History was originally included among the 18 Ba'ba' books due for
original publication in English, and is now, though it came out in Da'da' Raghuna'th's
name, included among the figure of 138 in English.</p>

<p>141 + 18 = 159 full-size books still to come out in English as of '91. 36 have actually
come out in those 18-1/2 years, leaving 123 still to go.
     123 is a strict figure according to number of
     untranslated titles. But many of the individual
     articles in those books have come out in different
     English compilations; and as mentioned, among some
     titles there is considerable repetition of material
     (it would be very detailed to calculate just how
     much); so a realistic figure would be much smaller.
     And we expect the time spent on
     reprints/retranslations to decrease somewhat.</p>
     
<p>Under an accelerated-translation project initiated
in July of 2005, the pace of work has been one book every five months.</p>
