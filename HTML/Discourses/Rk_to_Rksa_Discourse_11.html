<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Rc + kvip = Rk. The meaning of the verbal root rc is &ldquo;to glorify&rdquo; (through song or through ordinary language). Rk means &ldquo;hymn&rdquo;. In ancient times, with the beginning of civilization, the sages used to look upon the various manifestations of nature as the play of one God and they composed hymns for that god. When they used to sing in the name of U&#x301;s&#x301;a, Indra, Parjanya, Ma&#x301;tarishva&#x301;, Varun&#x301;a, that singing was called sa&#x301;ma. At that time script had not yet been invented, so the disciples used to learn by listening to the verbal teachings of the guru. These were all words of truth, words of knowledge and since they were words of knowledge, since they elevated the uncultured human beings towards the light of culture, they were called veda, or knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root vid is &ldquo;to know&rdquo;. The word veda is derived by adding the suffix al to the verbal root vid; it means &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. Seeing the written form of the word veda many phoneticians are of the opinion that it is derived with the suffix ghain&#x32D;; nevertheless it is derived with the suffix al and it is masculine. And due to the fact that there was no script and it had to be learned by hearing it from the mouth of the guru, its other name was shruti (shru + ktin). The verbal root shru means &ldquo;to hear&rdquo;. One meaning of the word shruti is &ldquo;ear&rdquo;; its other meaning is &ldquo;that which is learned by hearing with one&#146;s ear&rdquo;, or veda. Each shloka of the oldest portion of the Vedas was called a rk. When many rks were collected together to create a certain idea or expression, it was called su&#x301;kta. Many su&#x301;ktas together would comprise one man&#x301;d&#x301;ala.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Rgveda<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Rgveda is very old. Moreover, it is certain that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yan&#x301;a Vya&#x301;sa had divided the Vedas into three separate parts &ndash; the oldest portion, the middle-age portion, and the late-era portion &ndash; well before the Jain era. Here I use the words &ldquo;well before the Jain era&rdquo; because the Vedas are mentioned in the Jain scriptures, which were written in the Pra&#x301;krta language. The propounder of the Jain religion, Varddhaman Maha&#x301;viir, was born a little over 2500 years ago, and the Pra&#x301;krta language originated between four thousand and five thousand years ago. Thus, whatever portion of the Vedas is considered to be the most recent, it is certainly more than five thousand years old. And in regard to the Jain scriptures, certain portions of it were composed before the era of Varddhaman Maha&#x301;viir by certain other Jain saints; still they are in no way more than five thousand years old.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The time of the composition of the Rgveda was approximately between fifteen thousand years ago and ten thousand years ago, that of the Yajurveda between ten thousand years ago and seven thousand years ago, and that of the Atharvaveda between seven thousand years ago and five thousand years ago. The Sa&#x301;maveda is not a Veda at all. The word sa&#x301;ma means &ldquo;song&rdquo;. The Sa&#x301;maveda was made later on from the music portions of the three Vedas, that is, the Sa&#x301;maveda is found within the Rgveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. When the Vedas were first divided they were divided into the Rk, Yajuh, and Atharva &ndash; these three parts. But the Sa&#x301;maveda is mentioned in the Jain scriptures, that is, the Vedas had already been divided into three parts at the time of the origin of the Jain scriptures, and the Sa&#x301;maveda had already been created from the music portions of the three Vedas. Just as the Vedas could not be written down due to the lack of written script, it may also be that the early Jain saints, however old they may have been, were not able to record their teachings through the medium of written script. Varddhaman Maha&#x301;viir&#146;s time was after the discovery of script, thus in his time the Jain scriptures were written down and they were written down in the Pra&#x301;krta language of that time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Varddhaman Maha&#x301;viir&#146;s birthplace was Vaeshali in eastern India. Magadha and Rarh are the lands of spiritual propagation. Thus, it is an easily discovered fact that whatever he spoke or wrote was in the prevalent Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta language of the day. So it will not be enough to say that the language of the Jain scriptures was Pra&#x301;krta &ndash; there were seven main Pra&#x301;krta languages. The language of the Jain scriptures was one among them, that is, Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There was no script during the time of the Rgveda, so it was not written down. Nor was there any script during the time of the Yajurveda, so it could also not be written down. Written script was invented during the time of the Atharvaveda. But since the Rk and Yajuh portions of the Vedas could not be written down, during the time of the composition of the Atharvaveda, that is, at the time of the composition of the last portion of the Vedas, people thought that the Vedas should perhaps not be written. Thus the Atharva portion remained unwritten like the Rk and Yajuh portions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The Atharvaveda&#146;s a&#x301;darsha purus&#x301;a (the first propounder or main propounder was called a&#x301;darsha purus&#x301;a at that time) was Brahmars&#x301;i Atharva. He was most likely from Central Asia, but this is not to say that one can say for certain that he was not an original inhabitant of India. Still, there is no doubt that the propounders of the later portions of the Atharvaveda were inhabitants of India, especially Mahars&#x301;i Vaedarbhi because Vidarbha was the name of a settlement in the central-western portion of India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yan&#x301;a Vya&#x301;sa is renowned as Vedavya&#x301;sa for having divided the Vedas into three main portions (Rk, Yajuh, and Atharva). There is a great  difference of opinion about this word vya&#x301;sa. There are many historical figures named Vya&#x301;sa, however, careful observation shows us that Vya&#x301;sa is not a name; it is a hereditary title. Va&#x301;dara&#x301;yan&#x301;a Vya&#x301;sa, Sain&#x32D;jaya Vya&#x301;sa, Vivasvata Vya&#x301;sa &ndash; their titles were all Vya&#x301;sa, not their name.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The name of the Vya&#x301;sa who divided the Vedas was Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yan&#x301;a Vya&#x301;sa. He was born in a fisherman&#146;s family (Kaevarta [a fishing caste]) on a blackish island<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> that rose out of the waters of the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna at Prayag, and for this reason the people gave him the name Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  This Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yan&#x301;a or Vedavya&#x301;sa was the composer of the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata was composed long, long, long after the Vedas, but nonetheless it is undoubtedly more than three thousand years old.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Although the Rgveda is mainly concerned with hymns, it also contains various tales and anecdotes. While not all of these stories and tales carry equal spiritual value, they are representative of the cultural heritage of those ancient humans. They paint a portrait of the gradual advancement of human thinking and the structure of society. When considered from this point of view, the language, literature and expression of the Rgveda is of special value to the world. While it is true that there was no script during the Rgvedic age, phonemes and phonetic expression as well as the order of the sounds, interpolation and placement (the method of arranging the sounds) were in existence. The different Rgvedic styles of pronunciation for the various letters were in vogue which the followers of the Rgveda would learn orally from the guru in subsequent times. I have talked about this to some extent here and there in our language books. If time permits I will discuss the subject further at a later date.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In the Vedas, especially in the Rgveda, a special rule can be seen for the naming of the rks and su&#x301;ktas. Normally the rk is named according to the name by which the Supreme Consciousness is addressed. Where the Supreme Consciousness is not addressed by any particular name, then that su&#x301;kta, or in certain cases that rk also, is named with the help of the first word. The third characteristic is that in most cases the rks were composed in certain metres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->There are seven main metres: ga&#x301;yattrii, us&#x301;n&#x301;ika, tris&#x301;t&#x301;upa, anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa, brhatii, jagatii and pam&#x301;kti. Besides this, because there was no authoritative grammar in that language (that is, the Vedic language)  whereby differences between the metre and the prevalent unwritten grammar of the day could be resolved according to rules, the custom was in vogue of violating the grammar according to one&#146;s convenience by cutting, reducing, increasing or even changing sounds in order to keep the metre intact. One accepted name of the rk 310/62 that we generally call the ga&#x301;yattrii mantra is savitr rk &ndash; not ga&#x301;yattrii mantra. Ga&#x301;yattrii is the name of a particular metre, not the name of a mantra or a rk. In the concerning rk, Parama Purus&#x301;a is addressed as &ldquo;Savita&#x301;&rdquo; (the word is derived by adding the suffix trn&#x301;/trc to the verbal root su&#x301;). Thus the rk&#146;s name is &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo;. At the beginning of one su&#x301;kta in the first man&#x301;d&#x301;ala of the Rgveda we find:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;sada&#x301;siinno sada&#x301;siitada&#x301;niim&#x301;;<br>Na&#x301;siidrajo na vyoma&#x301; paro yat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->At the beginning of the su&#x301;kta the word na&#x301;sada has been used, thus the name of the su&#x301;kta is na&#x301;sadiiya su&#x301;kta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The aforementioned &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo; has been composed in the ga&#x301;yattrii metre. Each line of the ga&#x301;yattrii metre contains eight syllables. It has three lines, thus it is composed of twenty-four syllables. The rk is as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Tatsaviturvaren&#x301;yam&#x301;<br>Bhargo devasya dhiimahi<br>Dhiyo yo nah pracodaya&#x301;t<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[The Supreme Father who did create the seven strata of manifestation &ndash; we meditate on His divine effulgence so that He may guide our intellect towards the path of blessedness.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->If we analyse the rk we find eight syllables in the second line: bhar, go, de, va, sya, dhii, ma and hi. In the third line there are: dhi, yo, yo, nah, pra, co, da and ya&#x301;t. But in the first line we see only seven syllables: tat, sa, vi, tur, va, re and n&#x301;yam&#x301;, that is, it is one syllable shorter. Thus, in this case, at the time of pronouncing it, the pronunciation of that time, and of today also, will be in violation of the current unwritten grammatical rules of that day &ndash; tat, sa, vi, tur,  va, re, n&#x301;i and am&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->At the beginning of the mantra, (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om&#x301; bhu&#x301;rbhuvah-svah (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om&#x301; is added and after the mantra (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om&#x301; is again added. These are not originally from the Rgveda; they are from the Atharvaveda. The mantra is the collective expression of the seven-layered manifestation of Parama Brahma &ndash; bhu&#x301;rbhuvah-svah-maha-jana-tapa-satya. But where the crude, subtle and causal worlds are used as a short form of the seven lokas then only bhu&#x301;rbhuvah-svah, the names of these three lokas are used; for them the word maha&#x301;vya&#x301;hrti [supreme utterance] used to be used. They are not a portion or a part of the original Rgvedic &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo;. For purposes of practice the pronunciation of the &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo; is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->(<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om&#x301; bhu&#x301;rbhuva-svah (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om&#x301; tatsaviturvaren&#x301;yam&#x301;<br>Bhargo devasya dhiimahi<br>Dhiyo yo nah pracodaya&#x301;t (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->By adding this maha&#x301;vya&#x301;hrti the meaning of the &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo; is strengthened. It was added for this reason. By adding the maha&#x301;vya&#x301;hrti the meaning of the mantra becomes clearer. &ldquo;In this bhu&#x301;r-bhuvah-svah, that is, crude, subtle and causal worlds, we are meditating on the excellent effulgence of Savita&#x301;, or the father, so that he might guide our dhii, or intellect, to the path of truth.&rdquo; Awakening the inspiration to get spiritual direction from Parama Purus&#x301;a with the help of this mantra is called &ldquo;Vedic initiation&rdquo;. Later on, when the person gets proper instructions in spiritual practice for moving on the spiritual path then that is called &ldquo;Tantric initiation&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The Rgveda was considered the chief Veda in ancient times, not only because of the value of its antiquity, but because Vedic initiation was more or less based on the &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo; of the Rgveda, although as regards the adjustment between the spiritual world with the material world for a spiritual aspirant, the Yajurveda surpasses the Rgveda in importance. In terms of pronunciation and phonetics the Yajurveda is quite different from the Rgveda. The Yajurveda had closer contact with Tantra. And the Atharva was mixed with Tantra at nearly every step. At one time the orthodox priests declared the followers of the Atharvaveda to be socially outcast; they said atharva&#x301;nnam&#x301; ma&#x301; bhuin&#x32D;jiitha&#x301;h, that is, the food of the followers of the Atharvaveda should not be accepted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Rktha<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix thak to the verbal root rc we get the word rktha. The etymological meaning of the word rktha is &ldquo;one who is praised by people repeatedly&rdquo;. Colloquially rk means &ldquo;transferable wealth&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;gold&rdquo;. Gold is also a transferable, highly praiseworthy form of wealth. For this reason rktha also means &ldquo;gold&rdquo;. Pitrrktha means &ldquo;paternal wealth&rdquo;. The etymological meaning of rktha&#x301;siina is &ldquo;one who is sitting on money&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;one who possesses much wealth but does not engage in charity and meditation, who does not want to be generous even in regards to his own needs&rdquo;. It is as if one had taken the vow: &ldquo;hands closed forever, open-handed never, never, never.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The word rktha&#x301;siina reminds me of a small anecdote. There was a certain Shethji [merchant] who suddenly started suffering severe stomach pains. At the time he was seated on his gaddi [cushion] (in business gaddi means &ldquo;the establishment&#146;s throne&rdquo;). He called his scribe [munsii] and said: &ldquo;Munsiji, my stomach aches terribly. Munsiji, mar gayo, mar gayo, mar gayo [dying, dying, dying]. &rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root rn&#x301;j is &ldquo;to move straight ahead&rdquo; or &ldquo;to move with ever-accelerated speed&rdquo;. By adding the suffix uku to rn&#x301;j we get the word rju. The meaning of the word rju is &ldquo;one who moves straight ahead&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is straightforward&rdquo;. If a room has a window in the eastern wall and directly across from it is a window in the western wall, then we say that the two windows are rju-rju. In many places in Bengal rju-rju is pronounced &ldquo;roojoo-roojoo&rdquo;. This is not a mistake. The Atharvavedic pronunciation of the letter r is &ldquo;roo&rdquo;. Thus it is not to be condemned if one writes rju-rju and pronounces it &ldquo;roojoo-roojoo&rdquo;. But there is no need to spell it ruju-ruju; it can be spelled rju-rju.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Rju path means &ldquo;straight path&rdquo;, one that does not bend right and left. In yogic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practice] rju-ma&#x301;rga also means sus&#x301;umna&#x301;-ma&#x301;rga.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Among the three principal nad&#x301;iis [psychic-energy channels], the sus&#x301;umna&#x301; is straight while the two on either side of it, the id&#x301;a&#x301; and the piun&#x32D;gala&#x301;, curve right and left. Just as in practical life, a straight life, a rju life,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is beneficial and leads to welfare, in spiritual life also the straight path is the path of welfare.

<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->[Do not leave the straight path and take the crooked one. When the pond is nearby why do you go far?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Here uju means rju. Rju/ruju/uju. This verbal root rn&#x301;j also used to be written with the long rr in ancient times, that is, both rrnj and rn&#x301;j were correct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Rn&#x301;a<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->One meaning of the verbal root rn&#x301;j is &ldquo;to move with increasing speed&rdquo;.  Rn&#x301;j/rrn&#x301;j + kta gives us the word rn&#x301;a. The etymological meaning of rn&#x301;a is &ldquo;that which entangles a person in net after net in each moment&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;debt&rdquo;. One who gives a loan is called uttamarn&#x301;a (uttama + rn&#x301;a) and one who takes a loan is called adhamarn&#x301;a (adhama + rn&#x301;a). In ancient times rn&#x301;a used to be spelled with a long rr but both spellings are correct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->According to the scriptures there are four kinds of debts which cannot be paid back. They are: debt to one&#146;s father, debt to one&#146;s mother, debt to one&#146;s a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya and debt to one&#146;s guru. The debt of affection that binds a person to his or her father as the source of his or her birth and as the person who rears them cannot be discharged. The saints and sages have said: &ldquo;If one dedicates oneself to the welfare of every man on earth then the debt to one&#146;s father can be paid back a little, but not completely. Similarly, if one dedicates oneself to the welfare of every woman on earth then one&#146;s debt to one&#146;s mother can be paid back a little, but not completely. If one tries without discrimination to bring knowledge to all human beings then one&#146;s debt to one&#146;s a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> can be paid back a little, not completely. As regards one&#146;s debt to guru, if one tries to propagate spiritual ideology amongst all people of the world then one can, to a very small extent (like a bubble in the sea), pay back one&#146;s debt to the Tantra guru<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  from whom one has received instructions in the path of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.&rdquo; This debt is almost completely non-dischargeable. Bengal&#146;s poet, Satyendranath, has written at the end of one of his poems:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Milaner maha&#x301;mantre ma&#x301; nave diiks&#x301;ita kari dhiire;<br>Mukta haiba deva-rn&#x301;e mora&#x301; muktaven&#x301;iir tiire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->[I initiate humanity steadily into the great mantra for union with the Supreme; I will free myself from my debt to the guru and attain salvation by the bank of the river of liberation. ]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Rta<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root r is &ldquo;to move rhythmically&rdquo;, &ldquo;to advance without resistance&rdquo;. By adding the suffix kta to r we get the word rta. Rta means &ldquo;influential&rdquo;, &ldquo;enriching&rdquo;, &ldquo;revealing the fact&rdquo;, &ldquo;truth&rdquo;. That over which the influence of vyatha&#x301; [pain] has spread is vyatha&#x301; + rta = vyatha&#x301;rta. That over which the influence of shoka [grief] has spread is shoka + rta = shoka&#x301;rta. That over which the influence of vanya&#x301; [flood] has spread is vanya&#x301; + rta = vanya&#x301;rta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->In the opinion of the yogic scriptures there is an ideological difference between rta and satya. That which is a fact, which has happened or happens, is called rta. And the ideation used for the welfare of the people is called satya. Parahita&#x301;rtham&#x301; va&#x301;unmanaso yatha&#x301;rthatvam&#x301; satyam. &ldquo;Using one&#146;s mind or speech out of a spirit of welfare for others is satya.&rdquo; It is said that one should take the shelter of satya, not rta. If a person takes shelter in your house out of fear of a wicked person and afterwards that wicked person comes up to you and asks: &ldquo;Is that fellow here?&rdquo;, in that case, an innocent person&#146;s life is endangered. Here, if one is to follow satya then one will have to say: &ldquo;No, he is not here.&rdquo; In this way an innocent person will be saved from being murdered or tortured at the hands of a wicked person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->If, by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a person can elevate his or her unit existence and bring the crude, or conscious mind to the level of the subtle, or subconscious mind, and thereafter, going even higher, elevate the subtle or subconscious mind to the level of the causal, or unconscious mind, then in that condition the person gains full awareness of the past, present and future. This experience or realization in the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; comprises a state similar to the stance of the supreme attainment of intuition. About this state it has been said: rtambhara&#x301; tatra prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> I have just said that this state is very close to the state of supreme thought, supreme ideation. In this supreme state all mind, all consciousness, is merged in the Supreme Cognitive Force [Citishakti]. They become one. This state is the supreme attainment, the supreme stage, or unbounded conciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Rta is spelled correctly with a short r, but both short r and long rr were used to spell naerta [southwest], that is, both naerta and naerrta are correct. According to a old Puranic tale, Naerta was the name of a demon.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->Rtu<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix tu to the verbal root r we get the word rtu. Generally, words derived with the suffix tu are masculine. The import of the word rtu is &ldquo;one who comes in one&#146;s own rhythmic motion, in one&#146;s self-rhythm, whether others want it or not&rdquo;. Thus the etymological meaning of the word rtu is &ldquo;any characteristic division of time&rdquo;, whether it be age, year, season, month, fortnight, week, day, hour, minute or second. But colloquially, rtu means &ldquo;that measure of time which is distinguished by specific characteristics&rdquo; such as griis&#x301;ma rtu [summer season], vars&#x301;a&#x301; rtu [rainy season], and so forth. Generally, in the equatorial and tropical regions of the earth one rtu [season] is two months.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Rs&#x301;i<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->The verbal root rs&#x301; has many meanings, one of which is &ldquo;to rise upwards&rdquo;. This verbal root rs&#x301; is used for moving up from one floor of a house to one above it. By adding the suffix in to the verbal root rs&#x301; we get the word rs&#x301;i whose etymological meaning is &ldquo;one who rises upwards&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;a person of elevated mind, elevated intellect, elevated thought&rdquo;. Although the feminine form of the word rs&#x301;i is rs&#x301;ya&#x301;, the word rs&#x301;i can also be used as common gender. That is, a woman can be called rs&#x301;i just as a man can. And rs&#x301;ya&#x301; can also be used. Persons of elevated consciousness have been called rs&#x301;i since Rgvedic times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->Just as every mantra is composed in a certain metre, and just as most of the mantras address Parama Purus&#x301;a with a special name, similarly each mantra had its dras&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;-rs&#x301;i [seer-rs&#x301;i]<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> who, after realizing the truth in his or her sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, or meditation and concentration, would then teach it orally to his or her disciples.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Since the Rgvedic age, rs&#x301;is have been mainly divided into four categories: mahars&#x301;i, devars&#x301;i, ra&#x301;jars&#x301;i and brahmars&#x301;i. Those persons who executed their worldly duties as required and at the same time cultivated meditation, concentration, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, philosophy (a&#x301;ran&#x301;yak and upanis&#x301;ad) and so on in search of a higher world, and having attained perfection in that spiritual path, would do service to the world, were called mahars&#x301;i (for example, Mahars&#x301;i Vishva&#x301;mitra).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->Those who, having taken birth in the race of devas (Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean sub-races and the Caucasian race), had established themselves in spiritual consciousness through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, were called devars&#x301;i (for example, Devars&#x301;i Na&#x301;rada).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->Those who had to take care of great social responsibilities (such as a king) but at the same time were able to saturate the urges of their heart and their intellect with spiritual consciousness were called ra&#x301;jars&#x301;i (for example, Ra&#x301;jars&#x301;i Janaka).<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn9"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn9">9</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->Those who infused their existence with a current of spiritual inspiration throughout their lives were called brahmars&#x301;i (for example, Brahmars&#x301;i Kan&#x301;va, Brahmars&#x301;i Atharva).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->During the time of the Atharvaveda, its propounder or originator (in the Vedic language a&#x301;darsha purus&#x301;a), Atharva&#x301;, was honoured as brahmars&#x301;i. A number of rs&#x301;is were revered as mahars&#x301;i, some of whom deserve special mention. They were Mahars&#x301;is Atri, Aungira&#x301;, Aungirasa, Pulaha, Pulasta, Satyava&#x301;ha, Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha and Vaedarbhi. Those who believe that the Vedas were composed entirely outside of India cannot go unopposed. At least not in the case of the Atharvaveda. There is clear proof that the rs&#x301;i named Vaedarbhi was a man of Vidarbha, that is, the Nagpur-Amaravatii region. It is hard to imagine Mahars&#x301;i Vaedarbhi travelling all the way to Central Asia and staying there to compose the Atharvaveda. On the other hand it may well be that the entire Atharvaveda was not composed in India. Mahars&#x301;i Atharva&#x301; was the a&#x301;darsha purus&#x301;a of the Atharvaveda. He was also respected as an elderly person. Even today we say about very aged people: &ldquo;He has become Atharva&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->Bear in mind that rs&#x301;i and muni are not the same thing. I have already said quite a lot about rs&#x301;i. The word muni has two primary meanings. One meaning of muni is &ldquo;contemplative entity&rdquo;, or &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;. The second meaning of muni is &ldquo;one who has dissolved one&#146;s mind into Parama Purus&#x301;a&rdquo;. Na munirdugdhaba&#x301;lakah munih sam&#x301;liinama&#x301;nasah. (Muni does not mean &ldquo;small child&rdquo;; muni is one who has merged his or her mind in the Macrocosmic mind.)<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->Another meaning of the verbal root rs&#x301; is &ldquo;to scratch&rdquo;, &ldquo;to bite&rdquo;, &ldquo;to cut into pieces&rdquo;. By adding the suffix sa to the verbal root rs&#x301; we get the word rks&#x301;a. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;bear&rdquo;. If we climb a mountain which is bare, or bereft of plants and trees, and full of stones, then we will scratch and cut our hands and feet. Thus another colloquial meaning of rks&#x301;a is &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;. If any particular country is cut and bitten until it sheds blood and is forced to the brink of destruction, then we can say about that country: &ldquo;At one time this was a golden land but nowadays it is destitute, ruined, rks&#x301;a.&rdquo; It is only fitting that every righteous person in the world make efforts to increase the wealth of the world&#146;s rks&#x301;a countries.<!-- /block --></p>
