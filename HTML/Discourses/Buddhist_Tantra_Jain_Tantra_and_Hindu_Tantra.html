<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There are certain deities which are recognized in more than one school of Tantra. Some of them are recognized by both Buddhist Tantra and Jain Tantra, some by both Buddhist and Shaeva Tantra [Shiva Tantra], some by both Jain Tantra and A&#x301;rs&#x301;a [Hindu] Tantra. The number of such deities is not negligible. Originally the deity Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; of Sha&#x301;kta Tantra [Shakti Tantra] was recognized by Buddhist Tantra. There is a place called Kalka near the hill town of Simla. The place has been named after the deity Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;. There is a particular place named Ka&#x301;lka&#x301;jii in Delhi. That area has been named after the goddess Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;, who has a temple there. Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is primarily a Buddhist deity, but in Sha&#x301;kta Tantra also Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is a recognized deity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the Buddhist period there were four variations of the Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; deity: (1) Bhra&#x301;marii Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;, whose complexion was like that of a black bee; (2) Niila Sarasvatii, who was blue-complexioned; (3) Vajrata&#x301;ra&#x301;, worshipped by the Vajraya&#x301;nii Buddhists;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (4) Ugrata&#x301;ra&#x301;, a terrible blood-thirsty deity. In those days Bhra&#x301;marii Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; was worshipped in China, a Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii Buddhist country. Niila Sarasvatii was worshipped in Tibet. Ugrata&#x301;ra&#x301; was worshipped in eastern India, particularly in Gaod&#x301;adesh [approximately equivalent to Bengal]. When Vajraya&#x301;na was popular in eastern India, the deity Vajrata&#x301;ra&#x301; was worshipped. Each and every Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; deity has been recognized as a deity by Sha&#x301;kta Tantra as well as Puranic Tantra. It is claimed that all of them are Shiva&#146;s consorts. The Niila Sarasvatii of Tibet was later changed into the all-white Puranic deity Sarasvatii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Another deity of the Vajraya&#x301;na school is Vajraba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii. This deity was widely popular in the Bhulua (or Noakhali) District of Bangladesh. Even today effigies of the old Vajraba&#x301;ra&#x301;hi deity are sometimes recovered from the earth or from the artificial ponds of that region.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii deity of Sha&#x301;kta Tantra has in some places been changed into the Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii Devii of Puranic Tantra, in other places into Jagaddha&#x301;trii. But in certain fundamental ways all three deities  S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii, Jagaddha&#x301;trii and Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii are one. For instance, each of them has four hands; from the face of each deity a reddish glow is exuded; all the deities are three-eyed; then again all three have ropes, goads, bows and arrows. Here Buddhist Tantra, Sha&#x301;kta Tantra and Puranic [Hindu] Tantra are existing side-by-side, sometimes intermixed.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The complexion of Niila Sarasvatii is blue. Developing a golden colour, she became Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; Pa&#x301;ramita&#x301;, and then becoming all white, she turned into the Puranic goddess Sarasvatii. The deity which originally had the peacock as its mount became the deity with the swan as its mount. When Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii Sanskrit became transformed into laokik [comparatively recent] Sanskrit, Sarasvatii&#146;s dhya&#x301;na mantra was also changed.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->There is a Puranic deity called Kuvera who is still worshipped in Jain Tantra and Puranic Tantra. From kuv plus erak comes the word kuvera, meaning &ldquo;one possessed of enormous wealth&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
