<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Until recently there was a defective idea in all the corners and amongst all the groups of people on the earth, that males are blessed beings, and not females. In your family life you know, you feel, that the parents cannot have any sense of disparity in their mind regarding their sons and daughters. Both are equally important, both are equally loving. I said my sons and my daughters are just like two hands of mine. They are just like wings of a bird. A bird having one wing cannot fly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now the days of those defective ideas are gone. All are equally blessed human beings, and those ideas cherished by those intellectuals, that by dint of one&#146;s intellect, one will get Him, are not only defective but foolish ideas. Similarly, the idea that by dint of actional cult one is to attain Him &ndash; this is also a defective idea, because in the realm of actionality all have not got equal status. A weak boy, or say a weak girl, physically weak or mentally weak or even weak in spiritual vitality, has also got the birthright to attain salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->First, what is the meaning of salvation? Salvation means becoming one with Him, and each and every child of the Cosmic Father has equal right to sit on His lap. There cannot be any differentiation.<!-- /block --></p>
