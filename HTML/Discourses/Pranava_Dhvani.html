<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; was sitting as usual, very gracefully, on a cot, and started with these words:] This is Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; Year, next year will be Seminar Year. [Then he added:] Of course, Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; Year will be continued for an indefinite period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->[He then ordered the doors and windows to be closed so that the external sounds might not disturb people in any way. At his command, all the sa&#x301;dhakas (spiritual aspirants) sat in one dhya&#x301;na&#x301;sana (meditation posture) or other. Those who had been imparted the lesson of Dhya&#x301;na were told to sit in siddha&#x301;sana,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and those who had not received that lesson were told to sit in padma&#x301;sana.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  All were told to fix their minds at their prescribed Is&#x301;t&#x301;a cakra,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  but not to start sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. After some time, all but a few started to hear a sound such as that produced by crickets.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[After some time, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; told the sa&#x301;dhakas to open their eyes and look at him. He next told the sa&#x301;dhakas to concentrate at their trikut&#x301;is (the mid-point between the eyebrows) and to enjoy the pran&#x301;ava dhvani (also called the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra sound). The sound that everyone had been hearing became more intense and changed slowly into the nupur dhvani [sound of ankle bells]. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; repeated many times, &ldquo;Enjoy this sound, this is the divine sound, the pran&#x301;ava dhvani.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[In the third stage, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; told the sa&#x301;dhakas to take their minds and concentrate at the vishuddha cakra (situated at the throat). He then said:] Open your eyes and look at me for a second or two and then again concentrate. [The sa&#x301;dhakas then felt that the sound had become fainter and had changed slightly. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; said:] It is now more madhur [sweet] than what you heard at the other two points.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[At the end of this, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; said:] All of you have experienced the sound excepting a few. Those who have not heard it should do more intensive sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for a few days, and in their normal sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; they will also hear this sound. [He assured everyone:] Those to whom I give the experience of this sound once, will be able to listen to this sound even while walking on the road only by remembering me for a few seconds. I will complete the course of one and all who will only follow the Supreme Command.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[He then finally explained that this was the &ldquo;sound of silence&rdquo;, the &ldquo;divine sound&rdquo;, or the pran&#x301;ava dhvani:] This sound is caused by the process of thinking of the Creator when He thinks of creation. The entire universe is within His mind.  Every action produces a particular sound. The average of all sounds produced within Him, is this sound: the sound caused by the creation of a thing, the sound due to the existence of a thing, and the sound due to the destruction of a thing &ndash; as everything is happening only within Him. Everything has its own individual vibration, and every individual possesses different vibrations for different points, and the average vibration is at the nucleus of the entire body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; then told a young sa&#x301;dhaka to sit in any dhya&#x301;na&#x301;sana, as per his own choice, with his spinal cord in the proper position. He also told him to keep his navel exposed. He then touched the boy&#146;s navel point  with a stick. Some movement in his body could be noticed. His ana&#x301;hata (at the mid-point of the chest) was then touched, and the boy started crying out. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; explained:] The ana&#x301;hata is the seat of all sentiments, so by a touch to it, all the sentiments are touched &ndash; so this cry occurred in him. [The boy&#146;s vishuddha cakra was touched, and the boy became completely silent now (as the vishuddha cakra controls the vocal cord).]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[Finally Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; touched the trikut&#x301;i of the boy and said:] The average individual vibration of the boy is now merged into the Cosmic vibration, so he will enjoy the constant flow of bliss. [The boy fell flat on the ground. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; commanded:] Enjoy now the supreme bliss &ndash; enjoy. [He pointed out that one should always sit for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in a proper position.]<!-- /block --></p>
