<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->WORDS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR MEANING<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The word gan&#x301;ika&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  has lost its original meaning. Gan&#x301;aka + t&#x301;a&#x301; = gan&#x301;ika&#x301;. A gan&#x301;ika&#x301; was a woman who distinguished herself by her beauty, her gifts and accomplishments in the fine arts, music and drama, and by her personal behaviour. She was far above the ordinary woman; she was exceptional. In very ancient times the men would have bloody fights to marry such accomplished women. In order to maintain social peace, the leaders of the day would approach the king with a petition to give these beautiful, gifted women a status far above the common women &ndash; the state should recognize them as gan&#x301;ika&#x301;s. It would consent to allow a gan&#x301;ika&#x301; to remain unmarried. Normally, it was not permitted for any woman to remain unmarried except those that chose to become sannya&#x301;siniis [renunciants].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The devada&#x301;siis [temple dancers] were also treated as gan&#x301;ika&#x301;s; they too received the state&#146;s consent to remain unmarried. The state would take full responsibility for their security and upkeep. As the ba&#x301;ijiis [court dancers] under the Mughals were engaged in singing and dancing, they attained a certain amount of social prestige and were considered as a different class than prostitutes. But the prestige of the gan&#x301;ika&#x301;s was a thousand times higher than that of the ba&#x301;ijiis. While [fallen] women were not permitted to enter the inner shrines of temples, the gan&#x301;ika&#x301;s enjoyed that right.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In my younger days, I noticed in some old temples in Burdwan District there were still some devada&#x301;siis. In most cases, they were girls from Brahman families. I have not heard of any devada&#x301;siis in any temples these days.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The institution of gan&#x301;ika&#x301;s continued until the last part of the Buddhist period. It cannot be said that all of them led pure lives. Those who could not maintain sanctity in their personal lives were permitted by the king to be concubines.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In the post-Buddhist Puranic Age a perverse trend arose. Whatever was positive in the Buddhist and Jain period was ignored and distorted in the following age. Thus many beautiful words with a positive meaning came to be used in a negative sense in the Puranic age. The word gan&#x301;ika&#x301; also lost its positive meaning and gained a negative implication.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  So you should not use this word gan&#x301;ika&#x301; in Bengali. Today some people are still using this word, but for that there are many alternative words available in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
