<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhapisha&#x301;ca</b>.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The word &ldquo;pisha&#x301;ca&rdquo; means &ldquo;a kind of pretayoni&rdquo;. Whether or not human beings become devayonis after their demise depends upon their nature or mentality. Only those human beings who were elevated during their lifetimes become devayonis after they die. On the other hand, disembodied souls attain the status of pretayonis until they are reborn in other forms. That is, when people with many demerits die, they become pretayonis according to their defective mentality. These pretayonis are divided into several categories &ndash; durmukha, kabandha, madhyakapa&#x301;la, maha&#x301;kapa&#x301;la, brahmadaetya or brahmapisha&#x301;ca, a&#x301;ka&#x301;shiipreta, and pisha&#x301;ca.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Durmukha pretayonis. There are people who give mental clash to others due to their lack of education or for some other reason. After death they want to continue giving mental clash to others as durmukha pretayonis.  These pretayonis are reborn as human beings after undergoing the consequences of their actions for a long, long time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Kabandha. People who commit suicide due to humiliation, psychic distortion, frustration or the overpowering influence of excessive attachment, anger, greed, vanity, jealousy, etc. get the status of kabandha yoni after death. Wherever these entities happen to see other human beings under the spell of psychic derangement, they incite them to commit suicide.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Madhyakapa&#x301;la. People who are mentally restless or who have an unstable nature say one thing in the morning, something else at midday and something different again in the evening.  Due to their restlessness, they not only cause trouble for themselves, they also cause trouble for others. They get the status of madhyakapa&#x301;la after their demise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Maha&#x301;kapa&#x301;la. Those who harm others while trying to fulfil their own selfish ends, those who practise Avidya&#x301; Tantra in the name of Vidya&#x301; Tantra, and those with a sinister, sadistic nature who mercilessly kill millions of innocent people by manufacturing lethal weapons get the status of maha&#x301;kapa&#x301;la after their demise. They always keep trying to destroy the living world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Brahmadaetya or Brahmapisha&#x301;ca. Those intellectuals who do not utilize their intellect for constructive purposes, but rather misuse their intellect to suppress others or create inferiority complexes in others get this status after their demise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;ka&#x301;shiipreta. Those who always engage in destructive activities goaded by their ambition, regardless of their ability, and those who are not averse to committing any heinous crime to fulfill their ambition get this status after their demise.  They are reborn as human beings after reaping the consequences of their actions for a long period of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Pisha&#x301;ca. Those who look upon everything as their object of enjoyment without considering whether or not they are edible, get this status after their demise.  They are a kind of negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It has already been stated that microvita move through tanma&#x301;tras, that is, the inferences of sound, touch, form, taste and smell.  These five inferences are the carriers of these microvita. The movement from sound to smell represents movement towards crudity, and the movement from smell to sound represents movement towards subtlety. Negative microvita prefer the smell tanma&#x301;tra&#x301; more than the sound tanma&#x301;tra&#x301;, and in the same way positive microvita prefer the sound tanma&#x301;tra&#x301; more than the smell tanma&#x301;tra&#x301;. In other words, negative microvita do not like the sound tanma&#x301;tra&#x301; as much as they like the smell tanma&#x301;tra&#x301;, and similarly positive microvita do not like the smell tanma&#x301;tra&#x301; as much as negative microvita do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Previously, in another context, I said that various kinds of negative microvita which have, up to now, been called a &ldquo;virus&rdquo;, damage human beings. Different diseases take the help of different kinds of tanma&#x301;tras.  From country to country, from planet to planet, and from the far distant frontiers of the universe, these negative microvita carry the seeds of destructive diseases. These varieties of negative microvita also spread mean-mindedness and negative psychic complexes.  Similarly, from various planets and distant nebula, varieties of positive microvita bring pious, sentient thoughts and elevating sentiments. Likewise, the pious aspirations and sentiments of a mighty personality and those of many individuals penetrate into the cosmic wave and spread throughout the universe with the help of these positive microvita.  Positive microvita convert milk into curd and thereby serve humanity. They also guide human sentiments and ideas along the path of synthesis so that these sentiments and ideas are eventually transmuted into pinnacled intellect. You may say that these positive microvita are the emanations of Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; the effulgence of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There are some diseases &ndash; and their number is not negligible &ndash; which are carried by the inference  of smell.  Most of the skin diseases and boils which have a bad smell are carried by the smell inference.  The disease of the laryngitis (in which the voice becomes hoarse and ulcers in the throat emit a foul smell) is invariably carried by the inference of smell. Those who sing for long periods of time or deliver lengthy speeches are likely to be attacked by laryngitis which is carried by negative microvita. This disease can be avoided or cured if sarvaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sana (shoulder stand) and matsyamudra&#x301; (fish pose) are practised regularly in ascending and descending order, then cloves and betel leaves are boiled together and the warm water is drunk through the nose, and the portion of the tongue near the uvula is then cleaned with the middle finger of the hand  while the water is still in the throat. Finally, the water should be ejected from the mouth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Negative microvita also attack the human mind through the smell inference. If a person sits in a wine bar or pub and the smell of different alcoholic beverages enters one&#146;s nose, the smell will influence one&#146;s mind. One may also order a drink from the bar! The scriptures say:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Satsaungena bhavenmuktirasatsaunges&#x301;u bandhanam&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->[Good company leads to emancipation. Conversely, evil company leads to bondages.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Although the human mind and body are attacked via all the five inferences, virulent attacks come from the smell inference, and then next from the form inference.  Even if a decent man visits an area which is not usually frequently by decent gentlemen, his mind is bound to degenerate. When referring to &ldquo;evil company&rdquo;, good people include bad places. Negative microvita carried by the smell inference cannot easily influence the minds of those who are engaged in elevating their minds through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, those whose minds mostly roam in the upper plexii, or those who are keen to roam in the upper plexii.  Even if negative microvita do influence the minds of such people, they cannot influence the mind as easily as the body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Negative microvita cannot influence a person&#146;s mind at all when one&#146;s mind is moving in the higher cakras. They cannot even fully control the body, although they can have a negative influence to some extent.  If a person in a state of meditation keeps his or her mind concentrated at a higher cakra for a long time, and immediately after that negative microvita carried by the smell inference enter the body, these negative microvita cannot overpower the person, but they can do so partially. But if the mind moves towards crude objects, at that time the negative microvita do not spare the person &ndash; they will attack the person severely. This sort of negative microvita about which we are talking is called &ldquo;gandhapisha&#x301;ca.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Ghosts or elves are not really ghosts and elves &ndash; they are gandhapisha&#x301;cas.  With the dawning of reason and intellect on the dogma infected minds of the people of the past, the clouds of ignorance began to disappear from the human mind. So-called ghosts, elves, goblins, demons, etc. are disappearing into nothingness. The disembodied minds of diseased persons who have certain merits or demerits were sometimes wrongly called &ldquo;pretayonis&rdquo;. In fact, they are the entities which are the carriers of so-called merits or demerits. Of all the varieties of negative microvita, those which are carried by the senses and are harmful are known as &ldquo;gandhapisha&#x301;ca.&rdquo; These gandhapisha&#x301;cas have their different categories.<!-- /block --></p>
