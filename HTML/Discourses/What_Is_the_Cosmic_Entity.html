<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->It has been established that Brahma exists and also that It is Parama&#x301;tman, Bhu&#x301;ma&#x301;caetanya, Universal Consciousness or Consciousness in its totality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Bhu&#x301;ma&#x301;caetanya or Cosmic Consciousness or Consciousness in its totality is also known as Citishakti or Purus&#x301;a. It was also explained earlier that Prakrti is a principle or a unique energy or force of Purus&#x301;a (Consciousness) and that She also qualifies Purus&#x301;a. Prakrti is a principle of Purus&#x301;a and She is always so intimately bound up with him that it is impossible to separate the two. They are inseparable like fire and its burning property. Just as these two cannot be separated, Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti can also never be separated. Prakrti is the unique force, the qualifying principle of Purus&#x301;a. A force or principle which gives something a characteristic or property, cannot be separated from it. Similarly although Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are two distinct entities, they cannot be separated. So Purus&#x301;a is bound to be present wherever there is Prakrti, and the collective term for them is Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a we know is Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, Caetanya or Consciousness. From these terms we can understand the existence of something but cannot visualize any figure or form. We can only form an idea of Purus&#x301;a or Caetanya with the help of our bha&#x301;vana&#x301; (introversial flow of our objective mind). So Purus&#x301;a or Caetanya is an abstract entity and can be appreciated by our mind only in objective expression. Prakrti, the qualifying principle of this abstract entity, can also only be understood as an energy, force or principle which cannot be seen even though it qualifies the crudest of things. Its form or shape cannot be described. Fire is a crude object and its attribute, the burning principle, is also a crude quality. Yet even this attribute cannot be seen. However crude the attribute of a thing may be, it will always be subtle in form. An energy or principle can  never have a shape. It cannot be seen or heard. Prakrti, also a unique force, a principle, is a subtle entity. Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are both subtle. Brahma, the collective name for these two, is also subtle and can only be appreciated in the final stage of the mind&#146;s merger in its source. Brahma could not, therefore, have any form or shape. It would not be possible to describe It or even to say what It looks like. Brahma must be shapeless or formless. It really cannot have a form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It was said earlier that buddhitattva comes into being as a result of the influence of the sattvagun&#x301;a of Prakrti on the unit consciousness or a&#x301;tman. Aham&#x301;tattva is formed due to influence of rajogun&#x301;a on buddhitattva, and lastly, citta is the result of the influence of tamogun&#x301;a on aham&#x301;tattva. The formation of citta is dependent on aham&#x301;tattva, as it comes into being only as a result of the influence of tamogun&#x301;a  on aham&#x301;tattva. The existence of citta is, therefore, not independent. If the tamogun&#x301;a of Prakrti does not influence aham&#x301;tattva or if aham&#x301;tattva ceases to exist, citta cannot be formed. But the absence of citta would not mean the absence of aham&#x301;tattva and Prakrti. It only means that the tamogun&#x301;a of Prakrti is not influencing aham&#x301;tattva and that the existence of aham&#x301;tattva does not depend on the presence or absence of citta. It is independent of citta. If we apply the same reasoning to aham&#x301;tattva we can see that it is dependent on the influence of the rajogun&#x301;a of Prakrti over buddhitattva. But the existence of buddhitattva does not depend on the presence or absence of aham&#x301;tattva. Buddhitattva is independent of aham&#x301;tattva. Similarly, the existence of buddhitattva depends on the influence of the sattvagun&#x301;a of Prakrti on unit consciousness. But the existence of unit consciousness is independent of buddhitattva. For example, steel can be moulded to form a steel pan, but that does not mean that, if the pan does not exist, steel will also not exist. As the pan is made of steel it is dependent on steel, but steel would exist even if there were no pan. The existence of steel is therefore independent of the existence of the pan. Similarly unit consciousness is independent of buddhitattva. All the different forms from citta to buddhitattva are dependent on unit consciousness, as the existence of each one of these is dependent on the other. But when we come to consciousness we can see that its existence is not dependent on any of these forms. In fact we cannot find anything on which the existence of consciousness depends. Consciousness is therefore absolutely independent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Consciousness or Purus&#x301;a is absolutely independent. It was seen in the preceding paragraph that it is not dependent on anything and has no beginning or root cause. It is non-causal. Prakrti is the qualifying principle of Purus&#x301;a and is bound to be present wherever Purus&#x301;a exists. This, however, does not mean that Prakrti has been created by Purus&#x301;a. The burning quality of fire is its qualifying principle and always exists wherever there is fire. Yet this quality has not been created by fire. Just as fire cannot create its qualifying principle, Purus&#x301;a also cannot create Prakrti, His qualifying principle. Purus&#x301;a is even incapable of realizing His own existence without the qualifying influence of Prakrti. Such a Purus&#x301;a can surely never create Prakrti. Just as in the case of Purus&#x301;a, the origin of or cause for the creation of Prakrti cannot be found. Prakrti is also non-casual. Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are thus both non-causal. Brahma is the combined name for  Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. Hence Brahma is certainly non-causal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Brahma is without any beginning or root cause. It has no origin.  But does Brahma have an end? If It does, we should find out how big it is. In order to find this out we will have to measure Brahma. Different instruments are required to measure different things. For instance, to measure land we need rods and chains; to measure food-grains we require scales and weights. We have to use a thermometre to measure temperature and a barometre to measure atmospheric pressure. The instrument required depends on the nature of the thing to be measured. Brahma is subtle and is only an ideological expression as we already have seen. The instrument required to measure Brahma has to be subtle. Something subtler than Brahma must be found to measure it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->All matter in this world can be classified into five rudimental factors or tattvas. It may exist as a&#x301;ka&#x301;sha (ethereal), va&#x301;yu (aerial), agni (luminous), jala (liquid), or ks&#x301;iti (solid). The presence of  tanma&#x301;tras distinguishes something crude from something subtle. A crude thing will always have tanma&#x301;tras, while a subtle thing will not have any. So anything containing a larger number of tanma&#x301;tras will be cruder. There are five tanma&#x301;tras: shabda (sound), sparsha (touch), ru&#x301;pa (form), rasa (taste) and gandha (smell). A&#x301;ka&#x301;sha or the ethereal factor or the supposed subtle atmosphere beyond the atmospheres of the planets, etc., contains nothing which can be visualized. Yet it carries shabda tanma&#x301;tra and is called crude. Va&#x301;yu has two tanma&#x301;tras &ndash; shabda and sparsha. That is, va&#x301;yu carries sound and may also be felt. Va&#x301;yu is thus cruder than a&#x301;ka&#x301;sha. Agni, jala and ks&#x301;iti are all still cruder, as they can be seen; they have ru&#x301;pa tanma&#x301;tra in addition to the other tanma&#x301;tras. Therefore all the five rudimental factors or tattvas in which matter can exist are crude. None of these could make an instrument subtle enough to measure Brahma, which is a subtle entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In these five rudimental factors, that is, a&#x301;ka&#x301;sha, va&#x301;yu, agni, jala and ks&#x301;iti, there is another element present apart from matter. This other element is mind or antahkaran&#x301;a (introversial psychic force). Applying the same test to mind as we did to tanma&#x301;tras, we find that mind is subtle. Only mind can be abstract; it cannot be found to contain any tanma&#x301;tras. That is, mind alone is subtle and everything else in this universe is crude. Mind, therefore, is the only thing out of which an instrument for measuring Brahma can be prepared, but since mind has no tanma&#x301;tras, no crude or physical form can be attributed to it. It cannot be heard, touched, seen, tasted or even smelt. In the absence of these qualities an instrument cannot be made out of mind. Mind is subtle and only has the qualities of grasping an idea, thinking and feeling. These are the ways mind can measure Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Mind is made up of buddhitattva, aham&#x301;tattva and citta. Buddhitattva is formed by Prakrti qualifying unit consciousness; aham&#x301;tattva comes into being due to the further influence of Prakrti over buddhitattva. Similarly citta comes into existence being qualified by Prakrti.  Aham&#x301;tattva is that part of the mind which works. The capacity to perform any action is only in aham&#x301;tattva. Hence if Brahma is to be measured by the mind it will have to be done by aham&#x301;tattva. Buddhitattva separates unit consciousness and aham&#x301;tattva.  Aham&#x301;tattva will thus not be able to reach unit consciousness unless it passes through buddhitattva. But aham&#x301;tattva is only a functional form of buddhitattva. The &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; of buddhitattva, becomes aham&#x301;tattva when it adopts the function of &ldquo;I work.&rdquo; The moment Aham&#x301;tattva reverts to buddhitattva, the functional identity of &ldquo;I work&rdquo; of aham&#x301;tattva ceases to exist.  Aham&#x301;tattva cannot merge in unit consciousness as aham&#x301;tattva. It must be converted into buddhitattva before coming into contact with unit consciousness, and in that state it cannot perform any function, far less that of measuring unit consciousness. As mind is incapable of coming in contact with unit consciousness, it can never measure it. Brahma is the collective name for all the unit consciousnesses. Mind cannot measure a single unit consciousness; so the question of measuring the supreme multiple of all the multiplicities of unit consciousness does not arise. Mind can never think, feel or grasp any idea of the size of Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Mind can only determine the boundaries of something which is within its scope. It cannot set limits to a thing which is beyond its reach. The creation is only a part of Brahma. (This will be explained in the following chapter). Mind exists within this creation. On withdrawing mind (aham&#x301;tattva) to its limits we still find something left beyond it, which it has no capacity to comprehend. Creation thus extends beyond the limits of mind. It is infinite. Creation is only a part of it, and if a part can be infinite, Brahma, the whole, is bound to be infinite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The combined name for Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti is Brahma. It was seen earlier that both Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are non-causal. Naturally if they are both non-causal it means that they are also independent of each other. Neither of them is subordinate to the other. The state of Brahma where both Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are independent, because they are non-causal, is the supreme state of Brahma or Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa. Prakrti is a principle or a unique force, the function of which is to attribute gun&#x301;a or to qualify Purus&#x301;a. Gun&#x301;a ordinarily means an attribute or a qualification. In Sanskrit, gun&#x301;a means a rope used for tying something. To attribute gun&#x301;a means to bind with a rope. Prakrti qualifying or attributing gun&#x301;a to Purus&#x301;a means Prakrti is binding Purus&#x301;a with a rope and driving Purus&#x301;a according to Her designs and wishes. But in the supreme state of Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa, Purus&#x301;a is independent. Hence Prakrti cannot qualify or bring Purus&#x301;a under bondage; still Prakrti exists there with Purus&#x301;a, as Brahma is a combined name for  them. Those asleep are incapable of using their facilities or capacity to work. They are inactive in that stage. Yet they still have capacity to work. Similarly, Prakrti is inactive in Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa. She does not perform functions or is unable to perform them. The function of Prakrti is to qualify or to attribute gun&#x301;a to Purus&#x301;a. Purus&#x301;a  does not acquire any attributes or qualifications when Prakrti does not function.  Then He is beyond gun&#x301;a or without gun&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->How is it that Prakrti, whose only function is to qualify Purus&#x301;a, does not influence or is unable to qualify Purus&#x301;a in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma? There can be only two reasons for this: Prakrti is either asleep and hence inactive or is weaker than Purus&#x301;a and is thus unable to bind Purus&#x301;a. If we accept the first probability, we will have to admit that Prakrti is asleep in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma or Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa. But Prakrti does qualify Brahma at some stage. If She is in the state of sleep in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, someone will have to wake Her up so that She may qualify Purus&#x301;a. In Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma there are only Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. There is no other entity, so only Purus&#x301;a can do it. But Purus&#x301;a, we know, is even incapable of realizing His own existence without being qualified by Prakrti. How can He then perform the function of awakening Prakrti? We have, therefore, to dismiss the possibility of Prakrti being asleep in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, otherwise in the absence of any other entity, it would not be possible to rouse Prakrti to qualify Purus&#x301;a and to manifest   him   as   buddhitattva.   Prakrti  is  awake  even  in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. She is not  asleep. The quality, dharma or function of Prakrti is to qualify Purus&#x301;a, and if She is awake in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, She must qualify Purus&#x301;a. Purus&#x301;a in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma is not qualified in spite of the presence of Prakrti, fully awake. That Prakrti is weaker than Purus&#x301;a in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma can be the only reason for this. She is less powerful and so is unable to qualify Purus&#x301;a. This is how Prakrti and Purus&#x301;a have existed in Brahma for eternity. Purus&#x301;a, therefore, is by nature more powerful than Prakrti and is the transcendental entity and Prakrti is the innate principle. The state where Prakrti is feebler than Purus&#x301;a and is incapable of influencing or qualifying Purus&#x301;a, is the state of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma or Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa, that is, the state where Purus&#x301;a in Brahma is not metamorphosed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In the state of Brahma where Purus&#x301;a is not influenced or qualified by Prakrti and hence Purus&#x301;a in Brahma remains unexpressed, Purus&#x301;a is called Nirgun&#x301;a Purus&#x301;a &ndash; Non-Qualified Consciousness &ndash; and where Purus&#x301;a is influenced and qualified by Prakrti He is called Sagun&#x301;a or Gun&#x301;ayukta Purus&#x301;a or the Qualified Consciousness. Sagun&#x301;a  Brahma is therefore that stage of Brahma where Purus&#x301;a  is influenced and qualified by Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->This gives rise to two questions: First, if Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma is the Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa or the supreme stage of Brahma then what could be Sagun&#x301;a Brahma? Secondly, if Purus&#x301;a is more powerful by nature, how could He be influenced and qualified by Prakrti in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma? In other words, the question is how Sagun&#x301;a Brahma came into being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Nirgun&#x301;a and Sagun&#x301;a are only two different states of Brahma. In the nirgun&#x301;a state Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti both exist together, but Prakrti is not able to qualify Purus&#x301;a. In the sagun&#x301;a state also Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti exist together, but here Prakrti influences and qualifies Purus&#x301;a. It is because of this difference in the relationship between Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti that the former is called Nirgun&#x301;a and the latter is called Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. Rama asleep and Rama awake only indicate the two different states of existence of the same person. It does not mean that they are two different persons. Similarly Nirgun&#x301;a and Sagun&#x301;a Brahma are two different states of the same Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->It was concluded earlier that buddhitattva comes into being as soon as unit consciousness is qualified by Prakrti. Bhu&#x301;ma&#x301;caetanya, Parama Purus&#x301;a or Cosmic Consciousness is only a collective name for an infinite number of unit consciousnesses. Parama Purus&#x301;a must also follow the same principles or dharma as unit consciousness. The properties of the two must be the same, the only difference being that the scope of unit consciousness is finite, while that of Cosmic Consciousness is infinite. This must, therefore, mean that creation comes into existence as soon as Cosmic Consciousness or Parama Purus&#x301;a is influenced and qualified by Prakrti. The stage where Purus&#x301;a is qualified by Prakrti is Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. The universe is created because of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->We have to accept the existence of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, as this creation which is formed from or which comes into being because of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, can be seen at every moment of one&#146;s existence. This also shows that Prakrti influences and qualifies Purus&#x301;a in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. There can be only two conditions under which Prakrti might influence Purus&#x301;a. Either Prakrti in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is stronger than in Nirgun&#x301;a or Purus&#x301;a in sagun&#x301;a is feebler than Prakrti. Prakrti, we know, is a special principle or unique force. She is present with the same intensity everywhere. She can be compared to any crude energy, for example, electricity. An electric current running though a mile-long wire will measure 440 volts at every point on the wire. The voltage will not be different at different points. Similarly Prakrti as a unique force, will always be present with the same strength everywhere. The question of Her being more powerful in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma does not arise. Purus&#x301;a in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma must then be weaker than Prakrti or else He could not be influenced by Prakrti. Purus&#x301;a is condensed as well as less condensed in the infinite Brahma. The consciousness of the infinite Brahma is not the same everywhere. Prakrti qualifies Purus&#x301;a finding Him feeble wherever consciousness or Purus&#x301;a is less condensed, and as a result of this creation springs forth.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Prakrti is helpless and cannot qualify Purus&#x301;a where consciousness is condensed. Purus&#x301;a is unqualified there and is called Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma &ndash; the Unqualified Cosmic Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Brahma is infinite and Its supreme state is Nirgun&#x301;a. Wherever the infinite Purus&#x301;a (Consciousness) in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma is less condensed, he is influenced by Prakrti and we find Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. Surely then Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is within Nirgun&#x301;a. Aham&#x301;tattva is like a huge iceberg in an ocean. Due to imbalance in climatic conditions, a part of the ocean gets frozen into an iceberg, but the rest of the water remains in its original state. In the same way, wherever, owing to the influence of Prakrti over Purus&#x301;a, He is less condensed in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, He is qualified and becomes Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, but the rest remains Nirgun&#x301;a. Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, therefore, is within Nirgun&#x301;a  Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Sagun&#x301;a Purus&#x301;a or Qualified Consciousness is within Nirgun&#x301;a or Non-Qualified Consciousness. Where Purus&#x301;a is qualified by Prakrti it is called Sagun&#x301;a. We have seen earlier that the supreme state of Brahma or Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa is Unqualified Consciousness. Sagun&#x301;a Brahma or Qualified Consciousness is therefore not the supreme state of  Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa, yet It has to be called Brahma as both Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are present. What Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is can be explained by taking again the example of an iceberg in an ocean. Due to variation in the climatic conditions some of the water of the ocean changes into an iceberg. If we compare the ocean with Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, the iceberg may be compared with Sagun&#x301;a  Brahma. The ice is comparable to Purus&#x301;a in  Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, and the climate which freezes the water to Prakrti. The unfrozen water of the ocean stands for Purus&#x301;a in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. The ice and the unchanged water of the ocean are two different forms of water only, the only difference being  that climate at some places is able to change it into ice, while in other parts of the ocean the climate cannot change it into ice. Ice is only a changed form of water, but we cannot call it water; it has to be accepted as a changed form of water only. Similarly we cannot call Sagun&#x301;a Brahma the supreme state of Brahma or Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa. It is only another state of Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa. Hence for the realization of Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa or the supreme state of Brahma we shall have to know Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. The mere realization of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma will not lead us to the realization of the supreme state, for it is only another status of the supreme rank.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->What then is Bhagava&#x301;n, Sagun&#x301;a or Nirgun&#x301;a? Bhagava&#x301;n is a Sanskrit word derived bhaga + matup; that is, the one who has bhaga is Bhagava&#x301;n. Bhaga means absolute power, benevolence and light. Bhagava&#x301;n therefore is that which is the most luminous, benevolent and omnipotent (jyotirmaya, maun&#x32D;galamaya and sarvashaktima&#x301;n). So Bhagava&#x301;n has these attributes or qualifications. Bhagava&#x301;n thus is qualified Purus&#x301;a (Gun&#x301;ayukta). In Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, Purus&#x301;a is not qualified. He is qualified in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. Thus Bhagava&#x301;n is only Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. It is Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma which is the supreme state of Brahma or Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa. Brahma is only Its other status. Hence Bhagava&#x301;n is not the realization of Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa or the supreme state. To know Brahmasvaru&#x301;pa one has to step beyond Bhagava&#x301;n and has to realize Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. It is that entity which is to be attained.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  The question why Purus&#x301;a is in a less condensed state or how long Prakrti has been wanting to influence Purus&#x301;a does not arise. This is so because causal relation is only a mental action. Neither Cosmic Mind nor unit mind existed before Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. No Mahattattva, Aham&#x301;tattva, etc., were created. Hence the law of cause and effect (causal relation) did not exist. To investigate the cause of the creation of Brahma is thus beyond the scope of mind. It has been said in the Veda (Na&#x301;sadiiya Su&#x301;kta) that even Brahma does not know the reason why It came into existence. This is absolutely true. We could not call Brahma non-causal if Brahma had known the cause of Its creation. Had Brahma not been causeless, It would have come within the scope of the law of cause and effect (causal relation) and It would have had to create other foregoing things which would have only marred Its infinite character.</p>
