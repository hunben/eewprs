Notes: <p class="Para_Notes">official source: <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12</i></p>
<p class="Para_Notes">this version: is the printed <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 11 &amp; 12</i>, 1st edition, 2008, version (obvious spelling, punctuation and typographical mistakes only may have been corrected). I.e., this is the most up-to-date version as of the present Electronic Edition.</p>
<p class="Para_Notes"><i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch,</i> which was published in December, 1979, and <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12,</i> which was published in 1980, each contained a version of this discourse. There were slight differences between the versions. The two versions may have resulted from two independent transcriptions of the same tape when the tape was available. The <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12</i> version was reprinted in <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 11 &amp; 12</i>. Words in double square brackets [[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]] here in the Electronic Edition are corrections that did not appear in the printed <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 11 &amp; 12;</i> they are mostly words incorporated from the <i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch</i> version where that version seemed more logical.</p>
<p class="Para_Notes">Published in <i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch</i> as &ldquo;Dance &ndash; An Artistic Science&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Notes">Published in <i>Sam&#x301;giita: Song, Dance and Instrumental Music</i> as &ldquo;What I Said in Switzerland&rdquo;.</p>

<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know that even before Sada&#x301;shiva there was dance, there was music; people used to sing, also; but everything was in a disorderly manner. The dexterous hands of Sada&#x301;shiva made it a science &ndash; rather, an artistic science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is not an easy job to dance properly and correctly. The fundamental requirements, or the fundamental spirit, of dance, instrumental music, and song were brought within the framework of science by Sada&#x301;shiva, and that is why He is also known as &ldquo;Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja&rdquo;: &ldquo;Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja&rdquo; means &ldquo;King of the Dancers&rdquo;. (And another name of Sada&#x301;shiva is &ldquo;Na&#x301;datanu&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;music personified&rdquo;.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Dance is a highly-developed art. In the Oriental variety of music, you know, three items come within the fold of <i>sam&#x301;giita,</i> or music: dance, song, and instrumental music. The collective name in Sanskrit is <i>sam&#x301;giita</i>. Lord Sada&#x301;shiva brought everything within the framework of science, and just now I called it &ldquo;artistic science&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the Oriental variety of dance there are several <i>mudra&#x301;s,</i> that is, postures. When giving something to a living being, the <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this [demonstrates]. When giving something to something past, not present in the world, the <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this [demonstrates]. The &ldquo;don&#146;t fear&rdquo; <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this. The &ldquo;take what you want&rdquo; <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this. The &ldquo;come forward&rdquo; <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this. The &ldquo;be serpentine&rdquo; <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this. &ldquo;Be subtle, maintain a link with the earth&rdquo; is like this. There are so many <i>mudra&#x301;s</i> used in the Oriental variety of dance. It is not an easy job to learn it, but rather a very difficult job.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now the fundamentality, or rather the primordial phase of Oriental dance, is <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>. It is not a very easy job either. The knees must cross the navel. When they cross the navel it is called <i>Brahma ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>. When they cross the <i>ana&#x301;hata</i> [mid-point of the chest] it is called <i>Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>. When they cross this portion [indicates the throat], it is called <i>Rudra ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>. It is very difficult to dance <i>Rudra ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>. It requires long practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->That is why Lord Sada&#x301;shiva is known as Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja. And when these boys [indicates them] were dancing, it was just like a picture of Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja in <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava mudra&#x301;</i>. It is called <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava; ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> is a <i>mudra&#x301;</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Why is it called <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>? In Sanskrit <i>tan&#x301;d&#x301;</i> means &ldquo;to jump&rdquo;. <i>Tan&#x301;d&#x301;u</i> means &ldquo;of jumping habit&rdquo;. <i>Ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> means &ldquo;having the use of <i>tan&#x301;d&#x301;u,</i> the use of jumping&rdquo;. But jumping in the proper style, not in a disorderly manner. You should learn it properly in a disciplined way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> represents life; you know Tantra is a cult of life, it is not a cult of death. For Tantra you should be strong physically, mentally and spiritually. First in the present tense; Lord Shiva says all your expressions, all your manifestations, must be based on the present tense. So this <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> is the starting phase of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> I said represents life, it represents vitality. There are so many forces that want to destroy you, so many forces forces that are inimical to you by nature. Say a snake &ndash; a snake is a born enemy. There are many such born enemies. As Tantra represents life, <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> says that one&#146;s spirit should be based on vitality, based on the principle of survival.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->This human skull represents death. You are surrounded by death, but you must not be defeated, you must not develop the psychology of fear or defeatism. So the knife is with you to fight against death.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Yours is a fight for survival. In the daytime one may also use a snake to represent death &ndash; not an ordinary snake, but a venomous snake. In India our boys dance with a snake. But at nighttime neither a skull nor a snake will be visible. Here there is light, they will be visible, but in a burial ground, in a cremation ground, where there is darkness, a snake or skull will not be visible. There you may use fire to represent death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This is the spirit of Tantra. To fight, to fight for survival. [[It is the normal wont of all living beings to fight for survival.]] It is normal life moving towards the supreme state of abnormality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Lord Shiva started this <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> dance, and his spouse, Pa&#x301;rvatii, started the <i>lalita</i> dance, <i>lalita ma&#x301;rmika</i>. What you did just at present while singing <i>kiirtana,</i> that is called <i>lalita. Lalita</i> represents that now we are enjoying bliss, we are in a happy mood. We are in a happy mood, and the hands should be above ninety degrees. Do you follow? I think you followed me. Lalita represents a happy mood, and it was invented by Pa&#x301;rvatii, Lord Shiva&#146;s spouse. <i>Lalita</i> helps people in their spiritual progress and psychic expansion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now the <i>devas,</i> the Tantrics of that era, about seven thousand years ago, learned <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> and <i>lalita</i> and wanted there to be a musical expression for the general public. That is your RAWA.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->For the general public there was the middle course. This middle course is called <i>madhyama ma&#x301;rga</i> in Sanskrit, <i>majhjhima&#x301; ma&#x301;gga</i> in Buddhist scriptures. And that path, where the subtle aspects of spirituality combined with the subtle aspects of vitality, was represented by [<i>ta&#x301;la</i>].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->A middle course was invented, and in Oriental music it is called <i>ta&#x301;la</i>. Oriental music is based on <i>ta&#x301;la. Ta&#x301;la</i> means &ndash; the first sound of <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> is <i>ta&#x301;,</i> and the first sound of <i>lalita</i> is <i>la</i> &ndash; <i>ta&#x301;</i> plus <i>la</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Yes, this was the origin. And on the basis of <i>ta&#x301;la,</i> Oriental music invented so many <i>ra&#x301;gas</i> and <i>ra&#x301;giniis,</i> so many tunes and sub-tunes, in the hoary past.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now in all of South Asia and Southeast Asia the music is based on this <i>ta&#x301;la</i>. It is the happy blending of <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> and <i>lalita,</i> and in it there are two main offshoots. One is known as the A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta offshoot, from Persia to Vietnam, and the other is the Da&#x301;ks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;tya offshoot of all South India, Ceylon, Indonesia, Malaysia and up to Australia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->This is the science, and this science was invented by Sada&#x301;shiva. It is to be learned with proper care and proper respect. These boys displayed excellently what I am trying to say. I am extremely pleased with the sweetness they displayed.<!-- /block --></p>
