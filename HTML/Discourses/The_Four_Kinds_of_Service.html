<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What should a person do? Life is a mission. I have said that human life is an ideological flow. That is, human life is a mission; life itself is a mission; one&#146;s very existence is a mission. A&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca &ndash; &ldquo;Whatever one is to do one is to do for a&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a &ndash; for his or her own liberation &ndash; and for the elevation of the entire world, elevation of the entire human society.&rdquo; One is to do both these things: that is, these two things are one&#146;s mission.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301;. Now you know, everything is moving in this world. It will have to move. And suppose a person says, &ldquo;No, I won&#146;t move.&rdquo; Even then, he or she cannot remain stationary, he or she will have to move downwards. So you should try to move upwards, otherwise you will have to move downwards, because nothing in this world is fixed, nothing in this world is stationary; everything is moving, everything moves. If you do not move this way [up], then you will have to move this way [down]. So, A&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;Whatever one is to do, one is to do for his or her own moks&#x301;a.&rdquo; Moks&#x301;a means [non-qualified] liberation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Then, jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca. A person is doing everything for his or her own spiritual elevation, own liberation, for complete emancipation. That he or she is doing for his or her liberation is well and good, but is he or she not a selfish person? Whatever one is doing, one is doing for one&#146;s own liberation &ndash; but one is not doing anything for others. You say &ndash; is it not a fact? The person is selfish. So while one is doing something for one&#146;s own liberation, one is to serve others also. And how is one to serve others? The best service is viprocita seva&#x301; [intellectual service].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->You know seva&#x301;, that is, service. Service is of four kinds: <ol> <li>Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301; is serving with your physical body, rendering physical service, rendering medical service. Service rendered by a shu&#x301;dra is shu&#x301;drocita service. <li>Then ks&#x301;atriyocita [martial service] is security service, helping the weak. <li>Then vaeshyocita seva&#x301; [economic service] is relief work, feeding the poor, helping the needy. <li>Then viprocita seva&#x301; is preaching morality, teaching, preaching the ideology, doing dharma praca&#x301;ra [spiritual propagation]. They are all viprocita seva&#x301;. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now the best seva&#x301; &ndash; all the seva&#x301;s are of equal standard, but the result of viprocita seva&#x301; is of permanent nature, while the results of the other three seva&#x301;s &ndash; shu&#x301;drocita, ks&#x301;atriyocita, and vaeshyocita &ndash; are of temporary nature: not less important, but of temporary nature. For a hungry man, what will be the best seva&#x301;? To feed him. That seva&#x301; will not be of permanent nature, but for the time being, it will be the most valuable seva&#x301;. If a man is hungry, if he is crying, if he is dying, will you say to him, &ldquo;Just do [half-bath] and start Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na [meditation]&rdquo;? No, no, no &ndash; give him food. Yes, it has got temporary importance. But viprocita seva&#x301; is of permanent importance. That is why it is called the best seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, all these four items come within the scope of hita [welfare]. That is why it has been said, jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca. Jagat means &ldquo;world&rdquo;, hita means &ldquo;benevolent service&rdquo;. So whatever you are to do, you are to do for your own liberation &ndash; a&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301;. Then, jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca &ndash; &ldquo;for the hita of the jagat.&rdquo; Hita includes all the four seva&#x301;s &ndash; shu&#x301;drocita, ks&#x301;atriyocita, vaeshyocita, and viprocita. But you should remember that viprocita seva&#x301; is of permanent nature.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So a good person should follow this principle: that his or her life is for [self-realization and the welfare of the universe:] a&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; and jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca.<!-- /block --></p>
