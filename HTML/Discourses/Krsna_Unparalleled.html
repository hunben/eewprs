<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Yesterday I told you something about nerve fibres, nerve cells, and the positions of various cakras; about the relation of the cakras to the propensities and how people establish control over these propensities. The highest point in the human body is the controlling point of the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra and is called Shiva, Purus&#x301;ottama or &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It will be better if I say something more about Krs&#x301;n&#x301;atattva [the inner meaning of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a]. I have told you that in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra the last bone of the vertebral column is called kula. [Here resides the serpentine coil.] In Tantra it is called kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, while in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra it is called &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;, and Paramashiva [Purus&#x301;ottama] is called &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. Through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; we raise the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii upwards, and in the end the union of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a takes place. There is a secret technique to raise this serpentine coil. Previously this technique was not clearly given. At that time some people thought it proper to keep it secret. If something harmful to individual or collective life is not given, that is good; but the useful things have to be given. People will be more attracted to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The first thing is that this kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii rises slowly from the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra to the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra in eight steps, it passes through eight cakras, and the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra is the ninth. Just below the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra is the guru cakra. When one meditates at the guru cakra, the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii takes one jump upwards, and the mind goes to the other side of the cakra [i.e., to the sahasra&#x301;ra.] This is the technique of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but it has previously neither been explained nor written in books.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii rises upward in eight jumps or phases, so with two syllables in a siddha mantra,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii will jump four times. But a general, or publicly-given, siddha mantra will make the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii jump eight times or in eight phases. That is why such a siddha mantra has eight syllables. So you should understand that a proper kiirtana must have eight syllables, never seven or nine syllables.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The jiivabha&#x301;va [microcosmic bearing] moves towards Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Paramashiva, the pineal gland in the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, as a result of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and the mind also becomes introverted in gradual steps. When the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii reaches the navel cakra, or man&#x301;ipura cakra, that is called vraja bha&#x301;va in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra. And when it moves from the navel cakra to the trikut&#x301;i, or a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra, that is known as gopii bha&#x301;va. And when it rises past the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra, that is known as advaya bha&#x301;va or Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va. Thus there are these three stages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->During this process, one will hear the eternal sound of pran&#x301;ava [the on&#x32D;m sound] in the vast maha&#x301;ka&#x301;sha [void] in different ways, according to the different levels which the mind has reached. Sometimes one first hears the sound of rumbling clouds, sometimes ankle bells, sometimes the roar of the sea. When after hearing different sounds in this way the mind reaches the trikut&#x301;i, one hears the sweet and harmonious sound of the flute. These are various expressions of the pran&#x301;ava sound. The pran&#x301;ava sound is heard as the trikut&#x301;i or a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra is crossed, but then when the mind merges with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a or Paramashiva there is no sound, the silence itself is the sound.  There is no expression. These are some of the secrets of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The spiritual aspirant hears the various sounds of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra or pran&#x301;ava at various stages, during deep sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, during sweet sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The sound is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s muraliidhvani. The sa&#x301;dhaka becomes mad because of this sound and goes deeper and attains Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va more and more, and rushes headlong forward.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Chot&#x301;e ye jan ba&#x301;nshiir t&#x301;a&#x301;ne<br>Se ki ta&#x301;ka&#x301;y pather pa&#x301;ne?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[Can a person who rushes headlong at the sound of the flute ever think about the path he or she is treading?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->At that time one does not think at all about what people will say. One knows only that &ldquo;I and my Is&#x301;t&#x301;a exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii resides in the kula, that is, in the last bone of the vertebral column. In Sanskrit kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii means &ldquo;coiled&rdquo;, &ldquo;serpentine loop&rdquo;, &ldquo;serpentine coil&rdquo;. Jilipii [a fried sweet] is also called kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii in Sanskrit because it is coiled. The poet Vidya&#x301;pati has said: Hari gela&#x301; Madhupura&#x301; ha&#x301;ma kulaba&#x301;la&#x301; [&ldquo;The Lord is in Madhupur, that is, in the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra; I am kulaba&#x301;la&#x301;&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Where is Hari [the Lord]? He is in Madhupur. &ldquo;Madhupur&rdquo; means the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra. In Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, the sahasra&#x301;ra is &ldquo;Madhupur&rdquo;. From &ldquo;Madhupur&rdquo;, &ldquo;Madhura&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mathura&rdquo; have been derived. So Mathura is not only the town in Uttar Pradesh, it is also the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra. Ha&#x301;ma kulaba&#x301;la&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;I am kulaba&#x301;la&#x301;,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;I am the jiivashakti [divinity of the individual] sleeping in the last vertebra.&rdquo; Kulaba&#x301;la&#x301; does not here mean &ldquo;the daughter of a family&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301;pati has said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Nayanak nind gel gaya&#x301;nak ha&#x301;s<br>Sukh gel piya&#x301;saun&#x32D;ga dukh mora&#x301; pa&#x301;sh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Hari lives very far above, Parama Purus&#x301;a or Paramashiva is so far above, and the jiivabha&#x301;va is so far below, at the lowermost point. For that reason it has no sleep, no happiness. It has only suffering, pain and suffering.&rdquo; When will this suffering come to an end? When the jiivabha&#x301;va merges in the Shivabha&#x301;va. This is the ultimate end of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the sweetest end. The separate existence of the individual is no more.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The reality of things has to be understood. The above kind of suffering is known philosophically as spiritual suffering. The jiiva experiences three types of suffering &ndash; a&#x301;dhibhaotika, a&#x301;dhidaevika, and a&#x301;dhya&#x301;tmika. A&#x301;dhibhaotika suffering is mundane, that is, it derives from shortages of food, clothing, medicine, education, shelter, etc. If we change the structure of society this misery will be ended. So we must do this, we should do this. Regarding a&#x301;dhidaevika suffering &ndash; if we prepare our minds through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, all the mental cares and worries that result from a defective mental structure will come to an end. And the a&#x301;dhya&#x301;tmika, or spiritual, suffering is that Hari or Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, who is my own and my dearest, is far off, far away from me. He is in the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, the pineal gland. And the sleeping jiivashakti is in the lowest cakra, the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra. This feeling of separation is a&#x301;dhya&#x301;tmika suffering. This can be eliminated by spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, that is, by dhya&#x301;na, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->In Vaishnavite philosophy the controlling point of the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra is known as &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. This Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is not only the nucleus of the universe, He is the nucleus of each and every unit, so all Krs&#x301;n&#x301;as are one and the same. However we try to explain Him, we will arrive at the same point. 3500 years ago in Dva&#x301;para Yuga there was another Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. You may say, &ldquo;Purus&#x301;ottama, Parama Purus&#x301;a, Shiva and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; on the spiritual level, all Krs&#x301;n&#x301;as are one and the same. Is the historical Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a different from these?&rdquo; No, He is not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->I raise this topic because I want to emphasize that human society moves ahead through clash and cohesion. It moves ahead through ideological unity and disunity, through ideological clash. It has moved ahead, it is moving ahead, and it will move ahead. To stop this movement means destruction, a great destruction &ndash; hence we have to advance with great speed. When the speed of this advancement gets slowed down, people will face trouble at every step. (Human beings do not want any such undesirable action, for which they may later have to repent, to be taken individually or collectively.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->But if the time does come when the advancement becomes too slow, someone will be needed who can give society a hard hammering. Whether people like this person or not, love him or not &ndash; whether they feel love, devotion, respect or fear &ndash; under his fast-tempoed hammering the society will move ahead. People basically want to feel the blow that will move them ahead. The blow will be painful, people fear it, but in their minds they want it, because only under this hammering will they decide to move forward. It is a strange condition &ndash; &ldquo;I feel afraid, yet at the same time this is what I want. Or, no, I don&#146;t want to move ahead &ndash; I&#146;ll go a little later&rdquo; &ndash; but then one is forcibly pulled ahead. The feet do not want to move ahead, they tremble, but the minds want to move ahead. The need for this kind of treatment arises when people collectively are not able to advance towards the goal under their own internal power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Everything is created by Parama Purus&#x301;a. The root bhu&#x301; plus the suffix ktin equals bhu&#x301;ti &ndash; &ldquo;existence&rdquo; or &ldquo;entity&rdquo;. The Sanskrit word for &ldquo;entity&rdquo; or &ldquo;being&rdquo; comes from the root bhu&#x301;. And the root bhu&#x301; plus the suffix kta equals bhu&#x301;ta. Bhu&#x301;ta means that which is created. But when for the benefit of human society, for human welfare, something has to be done which is not so easy to do, which is rarely done, which will deliver the necessary blow to the human race &ndash; when the right entity or being is needed to do this work &ndash; what will Parama Purus&#x301;a do? He will create a body for Himself with the help of the five fundamental factors, and He will come. He will say, &ldquo;I will awaken the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a [vital energy] of these dying people with a timely slap, I will stir up their pra&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rdquo; He will create vibrations in their pra&#x301;n&#x301;a. He will not tolerate idleness. He will not allow us to waste this valuable human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->When He comes, after creating His own body with the help of the five fundamental factors &ndash; solid, liquid, luminous, aerial and ethereal &ndash; to create an ideological tidal wave, that stage is called Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti. Maha&#x301; means &ldquo;great&rdquo;, &ldquo;having a form which is supra-natural&rdquo;. And bhu&#x301; plus ktin equals bhu&#x301;ti. Hence Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti means &ldquo;The Great Creation&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Great Appearance&rdquo;. Whenever in the past Parama Purus&#x301;a thought it necessary, He came in the form of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti. In that way came Sada&#x301;shiva, in that way came Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. To push human society forward, to resuscitate the half-dead human race, to awaken society, they came. They came to create a wave in the field of ideology, in the social field and in the field of humanity; they came to create a tidal wave in every dimension and on every level. They delivered hammer blows to the various human social structures of the world. For this they received both the highest praise and the most scathing condemnation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Because Parama Purus&#x301;a is Purus&#x301;ottama, the nucleus of the universe, the nucleus of all living entities, His Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti is also Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->And that Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti is also Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. All the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;as &ndash; historical, biological, social, scriptural &ndash; come together at one point. That is why it is said that Tulana&#x301; va&#x301; upama&#x301; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asya na&#x301;sti &ndash; &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a cannot be compared with any other object on earth.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;You can be compared only with Yourself.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
