<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Human existence is trifarious. That is, it has three strata &ndash; physical, psychic and spiritual. None of these strata should be neglected. Although the psychic stratum is more important than the physical stratum, even so the physical stratum cannot be ignored. Likewise, the spiritual stratum is more important than the psychic stratum, but the psychic stratum must not be neglected on that account. Cultivation of the psychic stratum also is essential. The mentality of those who do not practise spirituality, but only look after their physical and psychic development, will become crude. Those who are concerned only about their physical development and spiritual elevation but do not work for their mental progress will gradually become psychically inert. The collective intellectual progress of the society will be checked forever. If people do not make an effort to develop physically, the society as a whole will suffer for the lack of strong, healthy men and women. Since that is not desirable at all, there should be equal emphasis to develop in every stratum of life, and there should be a perfect balance in the three strata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Proper attention should be paid to the physical, psychic and spiritual development of small boys and girls. Just as they sit and study to develop their intellectual capabilities, they should also sit to do their spiritual practices with their parents. That is the way they will develop their spiritual practices. They should take diiks&#x301;a&#x301; [spiritual initiation] from an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya(a&#x301;) [spiritual teacher] when they grow up. They should practice the lessons of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; japa, dhya&#x301;na, a&#x301;sana, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, etc. &ndash; along with their regular academic lessons. All that is necessary for their trifarious development, and it must be perfectly balanced. One should remember that the absence of a proper balance will harm not only the individuals, but also the society as a whole.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The practice of ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava that is prescribed for you [men] is conducive for physical and spiritual progress. In my opinion, as many people as possible should practise ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava. Those who are a bit old should practise it twice a day at the time of their spiritual practices. As far as young people are concerned, they may practise it as much as they can. There should be healthy competitions for them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The practice of ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava is not suitable for women because of certain physiological constraints. But they need something too. When in Patna, I invented a new type of dance-exercise for women, which I have called kaos&#x301;ikii nrtya. As for the benefits, kaos&#x301;ikii is as important as ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Kaos&#x301;ikii is beneficial for both men and women. Competition in ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava and kaos&#x301;ikii is very good and encouraging. I strongly support it. There should be competitions wherever there are Ananda Margis. There should be competitions even where there are no Ananda Margis. There is no harm in it; rather it is beneficial in all respects.<!-- /block --></p>
