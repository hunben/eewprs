<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The system of inheritance should ordinarily be as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->(1)	Sons and daughters will inherit in equal shares the movable and/or immovable property of their parents. The daughter will enjoy the immovable property during her lifetime, but will not have the right to transfer it to others. The property will revert to her father&#146;s family after her death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->(2)	The widow will inherit the entire property of her husband, and the property of her father-in-law and mother-in-law, in equal share with her brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. She will not have the right to transfer the immovable properties inherited from her husband or parents-in-law. In case she remarries or dies, that immovable property will devolve to her sons and daughters, and in their absence, to her husband&#146;s brothers and sisters, and in their absence, to the descendants of her husband&#146;s brothers. In the absence of her husband&#146;s brothers or their descendants, the widow will have every right to utilize that property &ndash; including the right of transfer &ndash; in any way she likes. In case she re-marries, she will forfeit the right to that property. In this case, the property will revert to the nearest relation of her father-in-law.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->(3)	In case a widow remarries and keeps the minor children by her previous husband with her, she can look after the paternal properties of those children as their de facto guardian, but in no case will her new husband (or the children by her new husband) have any claim to that property. If the children by her previous husband desire to remain in their father&#146;s family, in that case the nearest relation of their father will be entrusted with the charge of looking after the property.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->(4)	The movable and/or immovable property acquired by a woman herself will be shared equally by all her sons and daughters (regardless of who their father is). Presents, ornaments, or other materials received during her marriage, or anything movable or immovable offered to her as gifts, will be considered as her self-acquired property.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->(5)	A woman who has divorced her husband will have no right to his property. The financial burden for the bringing up of the children of that woman rests with their father (and those children are also the inheritors of their paternal property). However, she can keep the children by her former husband with her as long as she pleases. At that time also, her divorced husband will have the financial responsibility to maintain those children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In case a woman remarries and wants to keep the children by her previous husband with her, whether she can do so depends on whether or not the previous husband gives permission. In the event that the previous husband agrees to her being the custodian of his children after her remarriage, he will not be financially liable for the maintenance of the children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->(6)	The property of one family usually will not pass on to the family of the married daughter except by will or by gift. But if the daughter has no brother or his descendants, she will have the absolute right to that property, including the right of transfer. After her demise, her sons and daughters will inherit the self-acquired property of their mother.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->(7)	The property of an unmarried person or childless couple will pass on to their nearest relation(s).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->(8)	If necessary, you shall amend the system of inheritance according to the demands of the age.<!-- /block --></p>
