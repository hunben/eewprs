<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Bhajahari was the name of a rich landlord&#146;s newly appointed domestic assistant. One day at noon the landlord told him, &ldquo;Hey, Bhaja, go and prepare my bath.&rdquo; After a while Bhajahari returned and declared, &ldquo;Everything&#146;s ready, sir.&rdquo; The landlord went to the bathroom and was astonished to see that all Bhajahari had done was to put a few buckets of water on the floor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhaja, come here,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Listen to me carefully. You must be more methodical when you do something. You must plan ahead, do you understand?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; he replied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tell me what you&#146;ve understood,&rdquo; said the landlord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When I do something I must plan ahead and be methodical,&rdquo; replied Bhajahari.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That&#146;s right,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;Let me give you an example. Let&#146;s take the case of preparing my bath. First you have to fetch some water. Then you have to decide where I&#146;ll sit. I&#146;ll probably sit on a wooden stool so you&#146;ll have to fetch that too. Next you should think about my soap and oil and place it conveniently by the stool. After the bath I&#146;ll dry myself, so I&#146;ll need a towel. Then I&#146;ll need freshly-pressed clothes, a mirror, comb, and so on. After bathing and dressing I&#146;ll eat, so my wife should be ready with the food. Then I&#146;ll wash my face, so a jug and towel should be kept nearby, and finally I&#146;ll have a smoke, for which tobacco will be required. Do you understand?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes sir, it&#146;s perfectly clear sir.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->That same day in the afternoon the landlord had a splitting headache. He called Bhajahari to his bedside and said, &ldquo;Bhaja, I have a terrible headache. Bring me some tablets from the pharmacy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Bhajahari left the house on what should have been a quick errand, but he didn&#146;t come back when expected. The day passed, the evening passed, darkness descended upon the world, and still there was no sign of Bhajahari. Finally, early next morning, when the landlord&#146;s head was reeling under the heat of the early rays of the sun, Bhajahari made his appearance. He was accompanied by a crowd of people carrying bamboo sticks, machetes, ropes and wooden logs. Many of them had tied towels around their waists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; demanded the irate landlord. &ldquo;All I asked you to do was bring a few tablets to cure my headache. Did you forget?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; replied Bhajahari, &ldquo;I didn&#146;t forget. I bought the tablets as you instructed. But then I remembered what you told me about planning ahead. I thought that if the tablets don&#146;t cure my master what will happen? Perhaps my master will pass away. So first I bought some pots from the potter, then I consulted the almanac, then I went to the funeral shop and bought everything needed for a cremation. I bought some ghee, but I wasn&#146;t sure if I had enough, so I bought some oil just to make sure. Then I purchased the wooden logs and had someone cut bamboo sticks from a bamboo grove. Finally I invited many people to join the funeral procession. They said the night was too cold and would only leave their houses in the morning after a hot cup of tea in bed. So here we are sir.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Your understanding of planning ahead is quite remarkable,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;But you left out an important event from this long sequence. If your master passes away he won&#146;t be able to employ you any more, will he? Get out of my sight, you idiot. You&#146;re fired!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
