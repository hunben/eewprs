<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Last Sunday I said something about the root verb <I>kup</I>, did I not? Different verbal forms of the root verb <I>kup</I> are used with different meanings. For instance, if <I>ti</I> is added, forming the present tense <I>kupyati</I>, it means &ldquo;to get angry&rdquo;. On rare occasions <I>kupyate</I> can also be seen in Sanskrit literature; in other words, the verbal root is used in both types of conjugation. If one says <I>kopayati</I>, it means &ldquo;that which glitters&rdquo;. Then its form becomes similar to the root verb <I>bhaks&#x301;</I> in causative form &ndash; <I>kopayayati</I> in causative form. If the verbal root <I>kup</I> changes to <I>kumpati</I> or <I>kumpayati</I>, <I>kumpayayati</I> in the causative, then it means &ldquo;to spray&rdquo;, &ldquo;to sprinkle&rdquo;, &ldquo;to remember&rdquo;, &ldquo;to retain in one&#146;s memory&rdquo;, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->People attempt to pass off cheap items by copying valuable items, that is, they want to sell cheap goods as expensive goods in the community or in the market. Greedy people want to pass off inferior metals as gold or silver. That is why all relatively cheap metals, excluding gold and silver, are called <I>kupya (kup + kyap)</I>. They want to substitute gold tinsel for gold and silver tinsel for silver. So we can call gold tinsel <I>svarn&#x301;akupya</I> and silver tinsel <I>rajatakupya</I>. In olden times those who practiced idol worship used to make clay or stone ornaments at the time they were making their icons. That is why you find ear ornaments, nose ornaments, head ornaments, hand ornaments, waist ornaments and foot ornaments alongside the icons found from olden times. You will find similar ornaments on many clay images of today. There is a story about a sahib named Dock. He told the artisans of this country in his mispronounced Bengali: &ldquo;Why are you decorating with clay ornaments? Why don&#146;t you decorate with gold or silver tinsel instead? That will make them all the more beautiful.&rdquo; From that time onwards many artisans began decorating the images with gold and silver tinsel and other such cheap things. Such types of ornamentation were named <I>d&#x301;a&#x301;k</I> decorations or the <I>d&#x301;a&#x301;k</I> ornaments after Mr. Dock.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><I>Ku + rat&#x301; = kurat&#x301;</I>. The meaning of the root verb <I>rat&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;to spread certain words around&rdquo; or &ldquo;to circulate&rdquo;. <I>Rat&#x301;antii</I> means &ldquo;that woman&#146;s words which are circulated all around&rdquo; (in a eulogistic or a pejorative sense) or &ldquo;that woman who circulates words all around&rdquo; (in a eulogistic or pejorative sense). The etymological meaning of <I>kurat&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;one whose words are not proper&rdquo;, &ldquo;one whose words are uncultured&rdquo;. The colloquial meaning of <I>kurat&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;one who sells tanned (cured) leather&rdquo; or &ldquo;one who manufactures consumer goods from tanned or cured leather&rdquo; or &ldquo;one who gets such things made and sells them&rdquo;. Most of you must be aware that, as long as the leather is on the body of the animals it is called <I>ga&#x301;tracarma</I>, in English &ldquo;skin&rdquo;. When the skin is removed from the body of a dead animal (<I>kha&#x301;l khicna&#x301;</I> in Urdu, in English &ldquo;flaying&rdquo;), then that separated skin is called &ldquo;raw leather&rdquo; or &ldquo;hide&rdquo;. When this leather is processed or tanned, then it is called cured <I>ca&#x301;mr&#x301;a</I> in Bengali, in English &ldquo;leather&rdquo;. In olden days these jobs were performed by the people who belonged to the cobbler class. Those who manufactured or got consumer leather goods manufactured and sold them were known as <I>kurat&#x301;a.</I><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><I>Ku + rava = kurava</I>. The etymological meaning of <I>kurava</I> is &ldquo;cacophonous or harsh sound.&rdquo; The colloquial meanings of <I>kurava</I> are: <ol> <li>Cacophonous or harsh sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><li>The sound of the crow is quite harsh, so another meaning of <I>kurava</I> is &ldquo;crow&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><li>If <I>ku</I> is taken in the sense of &ldquo;world&rdquo;, then <I>kurava</I> refers to the <I>vaka</I> flower [heron; <I>Sesbania grandiflora</I>] in the sense that it is the flower that has filled the world with sound. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><I>Ku + rava + kan. Kuravaka</I> means &ldquo;raven&rdquo; because the sound of the raven is very harsh. The heron [<I>vaka</I>] flower is somewhat curved. The heron&#146;s beak is also somewhat crooked, that is, the heron accomplishes its aims by bending its beak somewhat. That is why we derive the word <I>vaka</I> by adding the suffix <I>ac</I> to <I>vak</I>. That flower which is curved or bent is called <I>kuravaka</I>. However, <I>kuravaka</I> does not refer to all <I>vaka</I> flowers, only to the flower that is deep red in colour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><i>Kura&#x301;la</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><I>Kura + alac (kalac) = kura&#x301;la</I>. Etymologically <I>kura&#x301;la</I> means &ldquo;a speical kind of fast animal&rdquo;. Colloquially <I>kura&#x301;la</I> refers to a rare kind of horse (<I>as&#x301;va: ash+van</I>) which used to inhabit central Asia and northwest India in olden times. These rare horses were very expensive. They were tall and golden-coloured with dark black legs. These <I>kura&#x301;la</I> horses are not found in today&#146;s world. Nowadays they are as extinct as the dodo.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The <I>kura&#x301;la</I> horse was a high-bred species. The sheen of their coat was dazzling. So the aristocratic ladies of those days used to make petticoats of the same colour. Those petticoats were very long; they used to reach to the soles of their feet. The upper part was golden and the lower part, that is, the border, was jet black. After that, in the language of those days, <I>kura&#x301;la</I> used to mean &ldquo;petticoat&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><i>Kurpara</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><I>Kur + kvip + para = kurpara</I>. The etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which helps a person to walk&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which must be swung frequently&rdquo;. The colloquial meanings of <I>kurpara</I> are: <ol> <li>Knee. That which helps one walk [<I>ha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;</I>] is called <I>ha&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;u</I> [knee] in Bengali. In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali the word <I>hen&#x32D;t&#x301;o</I> is used with the same meaning. However, you should not confuse the words <I>hen&#x32D;t&#x301;o</I> and <I>het&#x301;o</I>. <I>Hen&#x32D;t&#x301;o</I> means &ldquo;knee&rdquo; and <I>heto</I> means &ldquo;connected with the market&rdquo; &ndash; one who goes to market for buying and selling or is engaged in market-connected work. If the nasal sign [in writing] is used carelessly, then the meaning may be distorted. So you must be careful when you say or write the word.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><li>The other meaning of the word <I>kurpara</I> is &ldquo;elbow&rdquo;. While walking, the elbow moves whether one wishes it or not. If somebody vows not to move elbow while walking, then they will be quite cramped. In that condition they cannot run or even walk properly. Another proper word for &ldquo;elbow&rdquo; is <I>kiila</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><li>That dress or inner garment which does not cross the knee, such as shorts, underwear, <I>ijer</I> (the word <I>ijer</I> is orignally Farsi), is properly known as <I>kurpara</I>. You can use the word freely. In Sanskrit, underpants are called <I>kurparaka</I> and the loincloth is called <I>kaupiina</I>. A woman&#146;s panties are called <I>kurparika&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><li>Shirts or jackets which are worn on the upper part of the body and whose sleeves do not cross the elbow are called <I>kurpara</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><p>In the same sense <I>kurpara</I> also means a short sleeve vest or t-shirt. In order to make a distinction between a <I>phatuya&#x301;</I> [loose cotton waistcoat] and underwear, a <I>phatuya&#x301;</I> was also called <I>u&#x301;rdhva kurpara</I>. You can also use the word <I>u&#x301;rdhva-kurpara</I> if necessary. However, if there is no possibility of confusing <I>phatuya&#x301;</I> and underwear, it is fine to simply use <I>kurpara</I> instead of the compound word <I>u&#x301;rdhva-kurpara.</I> </ol><!-- /block --></p>

Colloquially <I>kuru</I> refers to: <ol> <li>An old town in the northern part of North India, the area known as Kuruks&#x301;etra situated in the northwest corner of Delhi, adjoining the Dvaipa&#x301;yana Lake.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><p>The inner meaning of the word <I>kuruks&#x301;etra</I> is &ldquo;that <I>ks&#x301;etra</I> or land which always says <I>kuru-kuru-kuru</I> [do, do, do]&rdquo;; in other words, that supplies inspiration for action. The colloquial meaning of the word <I>kuruks&#x301;etra</I> is &ldquo;this battlefield of a world where you cannot rest even for a moment&rdquo;. You have to work all the time. Whoever does not want to work becomes an outcaste. They lose sight of the purpose of life and are banished beyond the curtain of oblivion. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

Colloquially <I>kuruvilva</I> refers to any of the nine gems, but more specifically the ruby.<!-- /block --></p>

Colloquially <I>kurumba</I> refers to a large type of orange. Another proper name for the orange known as Sylheti orange in the market is <I>kurumba</I>. Similarly, <I>kut&#x301;umba</I> [kinsman] is derived by adding the suffix <I>umbac</I> to the verbal root <I>kut&#x301;</I>, <I></I>and <I>hud&#x301;umba</I> [puffed rice] by adding it to the verbal root <I>hud&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

The meaning of the root verb <I>vind</I> is &ldquo;to get something&rdquo;, or &ldquo;to benefit&rdquo; or &ldquo;to manifest&rdquo;. So the etymological meaning of the word <I>kuruvinda</I> is &ldquo;that which is manifest through action&rdquo;. For instance, the meaning of the word <I>arabinda</I> or <I>aravinda</I> is &ldquo;that which is manifest through spokes [<I>ara</I>]&rdquo;, that is, the wheel. The other meaning of <I>ara</I> is &ldquo;petal&rdquo;. So another meaning of the word <I>arabinda</I> is &ldquo;that which is manifest through petals&rdquo;, that is, the lotus. <I>Caran&#x301;a&#x301;ravinda</I> means &ldquo;lotus-foot&rdquo;. <I>Go</I> means &ldquo;organ&rdquo;. So <I>govinda</I> means <I>jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> [unit consciousness] or <I>Pratyaga&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> [supreme consciousness], that is, the one due to whose presence the organs are manifest. Despite a dead body having eyes, ears, and nose, these organs cannot function because there is no consciousness or <I>a&#x301;tman</I>. The meaning of the expression <I>ra&#x301;dha&#x301;govinda</I> is &ldquo;one who worships&rdquo; and &ldquo;one who is worshipped&rdquo;, both the unit being [<I>jiivbha&#x301;va</I>] and the Supreme Being [<I>shivbha&#x301;va</I>] who resides near the unit-being. The meaning of the word <I>ra&#x301;dha&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;one who worships&rdquo; and the meaning of <I>govinda</I> is <I>pratyaga&#x301;tma</I>, that is, &ldquo;that which is worshipped&rdquo;. The colloquial meanings of <I>kuruvinda</I> are: <ol> <li>Fragrant grass. We find this fragrant grass in many different countries, in different kinds of soil, in different varieties. The juice extracted from different kinds of fragrant grass and the oil derived from that juice are used in different kinds of medicine. This oil is also used in the cosmetic industry. Some varieties of fragrant grass smell like camphor, some like light sandalwood, some like the <I>ka&#x301;gjii</I> [scented] variety of lemon, and some like onion. This grass can be cultivated in a systematic manner. Not much water is needed to cultivate it. Attempts can be made to cultivate lemon grass in the dry, elevated tracts of land in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h that remain fallow due to lack of water or fertility. That may generate additional income for the farmers. The word <I>kuruvinda</I> can definitely be used for this fragrant grass, especially lemon grass.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph --><li>Barley is generally not particular about the type of soil. In moderately cold climates barley can be cultivated in arid and even rocky soil. In comparison to many other grains barely ears are hard and somewhat thorny. By comparison it is also somewhat difficult to thrash and winnow. This is probably the reason why it is said, &ldquo;to get the goat to thrash the barley&rdquo;. The idea is that how can a goat be made to do this when it is difficult even for a cow? Be that as it may, <I>kuruvinda</I> refers to a kind of barley that grows even in poor soil. Its ears are long and more thorny. Its husk is somewhat puffy and much longer than it is wide. Even though this barley may not be very good or tempting as a food, it makes an excellent drink for stomach ailments. This type of barley can be cultivated in the dry, elevated lands of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h if arrangements are made for just a little bit of irrigation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->I was sitting down flipping through the pages of a newspaper and found myself reading the same news over again. I held out some faint hope that I might come across any new piece of news. But where could any new news come from, I thought? How could any important piece of news surface, when even a small particle could not avoid the censor&#146;s scissors?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->Then I ran into our local Sergeant-Major. He was working in the military. It was the year 1942.

<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->The trumpets of the Second World War were sounding then in different corners of the globe. That sound of the kettle drum could also be heard in different parts of India if one paid attention. Part of India had become a battlefield at that time with the Indian National Army crossing the border into India. We used to listen with bated breath to the Indian National Army Radio news broadcasts behind closed doors and windows. The mechanism they had in place for collecting and broadcasting the news was quite efficient. Though we had not yet received any local news of a skirmish that had taken place between the army and the public only an hour earlier a scant twenty miles from the city, we found out about it from the Indian National Army Radio broadcast from Germany. I made enquiries and came to know that the news was entirely correct. The Indian National Army had conquered the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and had, I believe, given them the names Svara&#x301;ja Dviipa [Freedom Island] and Shahiid Dviipa [Martyrs&#146; Island]. The army had also entered Manipur and hoisted the tricolour flag. The Indian National Army submarines could also be seen off the Indian coast. The situation was grave. India had openly turned into the Kuruks&#x301;etra of the twentieth century.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->A certain judge made our colleagues swear allegiance anew in Bengali to British India.

<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->The suffering of the people reached its zenith point. Food, clothes and consumer goods were not only costly but hard to come by. Millions of poor people were dying of starvation, their knees buckling as they fell headlong to the ground. No one had time to shed salty tears over them when seeing their suffering. Such incidents were so frequent; people saw so much of this, that their tears dried up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The transport system had completely broken down. Cycles and boats had been confiscated in rural Bengal. Buses were running on kerosene. Even that was scarce. People were somehow making their way here and there, crowding on the tops of buses. Regular train service was curtailed, and instead the number of military trains was increased. Soldiers were also crowding into the regular trains. Occasionally for urgent work, people were undergoing great hardship by holding on to the handles of the wagons and hanging like bats in order to travel to their required destination. The suffering was extreme. Such suffering had not been seen even in the battle of Kuruks&#x301;etra, nor during the battle of Lanka, the Trojan war, nor even the First World War. Everyone is compelled to admit that Gandhijii brought a new consciousness to the public mind, whether one supported his role in India&#146;s freedom struggle or not. Even those in whom this consciousness had not awakened under the influence of Gandhijii were looking for some kind of change to find relief from that unbearable situation.

The small group of people in whose hands a large part of these notes fell became the <I>nouveau riche</I>, their bellies swollen with affluence. On the one hand there were scenes of extreme poverty and scarcity, and on the other the abundance of wealth. As a result, the lives of millions of people were reduced to the level of slaves. The dignity of women was trampled in the dirt due to the economic might of greedy people. Poverty was destroying middle-class families.

There is a new public awareness, yet a large number of unwilling people in this vast country are being driven to war to further the interests of the imperialists. There is a new consciousness in the public mind, popular unrest has gathered momentum, and an explosion is inevitable. Even if the Allies win this war, they can no longer deny India her freedom. If they try to keep her subjugated, they will only be throwing out the baby with the bathwater. To govern the country by driving a steamroller over the bodies of discontented people needs such an investment in manpower and wealth that the remedy will be worse than the disease. The price won&#146;t be worth it. So whether the Allies win or lose the war, imperialism has to quit India. Rather it would be fruitful for them if India was granted her freedom and some secret understanding reached with a few top leaders. In that case India would be reduced to a satellite of the affluent countries. It would supply the raw materials and then buy the finished goods from the factories of those countries. So, willingly or unwillingly, the imperialists have to leave India, and they will try for a peaceful transfer of power.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

There will certainly be nothing of the kind for our Shyamal Shasmal. How many such Shyamal Shasmals have come and gone? Can we afford to think about them? Perhaps only the names of those leaders who were prisoners (not convicts) of the highest class will be written in the caskets of history, while the Shyamal Shasmals will sink into darkness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
