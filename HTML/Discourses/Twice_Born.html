<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->[By birth everybody is a shu&#x301;dra, i.e., with an animal-like mentality. Going through a [[renewal]], the person becomes a dvija, i.e., expresses the desire to become human. By studying scriptures, a person next becomes a vipra, an intellectual. And finally, when the person realizes Brahma (through psycho-spiritual initiation), he or she becomes a bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->You know about vipra, ks&#x301;atriya, vaeshya and shu&#x301;dra. Vipra means an intellectual who helps the society with the help of his or her intellect, who teaches others, guides others; he or she is a vipra. A ks&#x301;atriya protects the society, protects the weak. How? With his or her valour, with his or her strength. A ks&#x301;atriya utilizes his or her strength and courage in protecting the society. And vaeshya means &ndash; ? [to a sa&#x301;dhaka] You &ndash; vaeshya means &ndash; ?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[Sa&#x301;dhaka replies, &ldquo;Capitalist.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Vaeshya means producer, manufacturer. That is, agriculturists (a farmer is an agriculturist), factory labourers, technicians &ndash; they are all vaeshyas. And shu&#x301;dra &ndash; the unskilled labourer, or one who does nothing, or wastes his or her time, or depends on others. They are all shu&#x301;dras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now you see, so far as mental colour is concerned &ndash; according to the mental tendency, the mind has colour, and that colour is according to the wavelengths of thoughts. For a vipra it will be whitish, for a ks&#x301;atriya reddish, for a vaeshya yellowish, and for a shu&#x301;dra blackish. Black here means not the colour of the skin, not the complexion, you know, but the mental colour. Actually it concerns &ndash; what? Mental colours. And one may change one&#146;s mental colour by dint of one&#146;s sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->There are certain misunderstandings in India regarding these shu&#x301;dras. Some people used to think that those non-Aryan people &ndash; Austrics, Mongoloids, and the Negroid population of India, Austrico-Negroid &ndash; that they were the shu&#x301;dras because of their black skin. No, it&#146;s not a matter of black skin, but of a black mind. The son of an intellectual may be a shu&#x301;dra if he is mentally black. A person may be a vipra even if he or she is physically black.<!-- /block --></p>

A newborn babe just after taking birth is a shu&#x301;dra. All newborn babes are shu&#x301;dras, because they do nothing and they depend solely on their parents. So a babe is a shu&#x301;dra &ndash; certainly a shu&#x301;dra &ndash; depending on the mother.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra&#x301;t dvija ucyate [&ldquo;going through a renewal, the person becomes dvija&rdquo;] &ndash; and after a few years, after five years, when one is initiated, one becomes dvija.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit, dvi means &ldquo;two&rdquo; and ja means &ldquo;born&rdquo;, so dvija means &ldquo;twice born&rdquo;, &ldquo;born twice&rdquo;. In Sanskrit the word dvija has several meanings. The actual meaning or derivative meaning is &ldquo;born twice&rdquo;. But in the practical field, it has three other meanings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->One meaning is an initiated person &ndash; because the first birth was the physical birth, and the second birth was the spiritual birth, during initiation. Such a person is dvija, born twice: First, you are born simply as an animal being. But this second time, as a human being. So unless and until one is initiated one is not, one cannot be, treated as a human being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The second meaning of dvija is birds or reptiles &ndash; the first birth in the form of an egg and the second birth in its proper form &ndash; so dvija.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And the third meaning of dvija is &ldquo;tooth&rdquo;. It is born twice. So teeth are also dvija.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->But don&#146;t be dvija like teeth or birds or snakes. (They are also dvija.) A snake is &ndash; what?<!-- /block --></p>
