<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[One day Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; was talking about the dilemma of the sense organ. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; said incidentally that there are certain aquatic animals unknown even to biologists, from whose bodies some kind of light emits. With the reflection of their light, they can see other creatures and objects around them. There are also, in less deep seas, some animals that generate electric lights to catch hold of their prey.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In this context, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; asked one sa&#x301;dhaka (spiritual practitioner) whether the human body can generate electric current or not. The sa&#x301;dhaka having failed to give a correct reply, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; explained that it was quite possible. He explained that in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; human vital energy is converted into spiritual energy. In our daily life we exhaust our vital energy and compensate the same by taking food, drink, light, air, etc. While working, vital energy is transformed into mechanical energy. The same vital energy can be transformed into electric energy also, but in that case, the body will be electrocuted and the person will die. Human vital energy can be converted into magnetic energy as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[The process of conversion can involve many possible effects.] In the case of conversion of vital energy into spiritual force, it does not affect the body and mind. But in the case of conversion of vital energy into magnetic energy, it does affect body, mind, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Demonstration<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; told one sa&#x301;dhaka to take off his garments and sit on his woollen cloth without touching the ground (woollen cloth is a non-conductor). Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; touched his right and left ribs and navel and told him to concentrate his mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->After a few minutes, his palm was trembling. Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; asked another sa&#x301;dhaka to [touch the left rib of the first sa&#x301;dhaka.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The second sa&#x301;dhaka did so and felt an electric shock. Then three sa&#x301;dhakas more touched the first sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s body and felt the same kind of shock. Next Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; took the sa&#x301;dhaka on his lap and rubbed his sweet hand on his body, hand, etc. Next Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; touched him on the trikut&#x301;i (between the eyebrows) and helped him to go into a trance. This time his vital energy was reconverted into spiritual energy.]<!-- /block --></p>
