<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The spiritual potentiality in all human beings is the same; it is wrong to say that one person is developed and another is underdeveloped or undeveloped. There is equal potentiality in all, only some have aroused it and others have not aroused it yet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Everything in this universe is the expression of the Divine, so you have no right to hate anybody. Even the Nucleus of this vast universe [Parama Purus&#x301;a] has no right to hate anybody. He cannot do two things: He cannot hate anybody, and He cannot create another Parama Purus&#x301;a! There is spiritual potentiality in all people. Some people have harnessed it, and these people are able to help other people to arouse it. Some people will arouse it if they are in the company of those who have already awakened it; this is the importance of satsaun&#x32D;ga [good company]. Your duty is to awaken yourself and help others to awaken. I find that divine effulgence in the face of everyone here. No one is inferior, no one is degraded! You are committing a sin if you think you are a sinner or degraded! You cannot hate anyone. Do you have the right to hate anyone, to hate yourself? No.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->My work is not to look towards the past of anyone. I only see how much one is advancing towards his or her destiny, and I help that person. You are to look ahead, you are to look forward. If you look back, if you look behind, you are wasting your valuable time. Fools, not wise people, do that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The nature of a human is to think of the so-called sweet memories of the past. People think more of the past and less of the future. But the sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual aspirant] thinks of the Lord who is the [Terminus]. When he  or she starts thinking of the Terminus of life, the very goal of life, the past with all its glory becomes pale.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The ordinary person is one who thinks of the past and also of the future. The medium person is one who thinks only of the future. But the siddha [perfect] person is one who thinks neither of the past nor of the future. He or she thinks only of the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; called one avadhu&#x301;ta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> to come near and meditate. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; touched the back of his head above his neck &ndash; the place which, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; explained, is the seat of the superconscious, all-knowing mind. Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; asked that avadhu&#x301;ta to look towards one Margi sitting in the room.] What do you see around his head?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[The avadhu&#x301;ta answered, &ldquo;I see a beautiful light, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; continued:] Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; [the Supreme Soul] does not hate anybody, do you understand? He does not see your hands, your feet, your face, etc. He sees that light only. [Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; looked around the room at everyone sitting there.] All are good boys. A person can make others good by his or her own power. If I give some power to this boy [pointing to the avadhu&#x301;ta], he can also help others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->[Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; told that avadhu&#x301;ta to meditate again, and while he was meditating, everyone in the room heard a divine and very sweet spiritual sound.] No one is negligible, no one is unimportant. The Lord can do anything and everything through these machines. Be a perfect machine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->[Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; performed another demonstration using that avadhu&#x301;ta. He told him to meditate again and look around the room and see the past lives of the people in the room, thousands of years ago. He then asked the avadhu&#x301;ta what he saw. The avadhu&#x301;ta replied that he saw that different people were tigers or other animals, some were insects, some uncivilized humans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; continued:] You were the children of the Lord and you are still. Human existence is a completely mental structure which is according to the psychic momenta due to sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta]. In this world everything is cinmaya [composed of consciousness], nothing is mrnmaya [composed of matter (literally, &ldquo;earth&rdquo;)]. According to the way the Lord controls one&#146;s mind, so the person gets his or her physical body. Whatever you have got is good for you. Parama Purus&#x301;a is never to be guided by your reason, by your logic, and your justifications. You are to be guided by His whims.<!-- /block --></p>
