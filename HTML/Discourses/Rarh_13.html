<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The question remains as to the origin of the Utkal Brahmans in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. They live in large numbers in the south-west part of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Did lakhs of people, batch after batch, sail across the seven seas and thirteen rivers and settle down in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h? It is not possible. The fact is different. I have already mentioned that caste division was present in the Buddhist age. But it was not as strict as it had been in the pre-Buddhist age. Many elements were combined together in a confused way. So advocates of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma, and their Praya&#x301;giiya Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a Sabha&#x301; [Prayag Brahman Conference], accepted and thereafter formally recognized a conglomerate of five branches of North Indian Brahmans, and another conglomerate of South Indian Brahmans, all of them followers of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma, in the names Pain&#x32D;ca Gaor&#x301;ii and Pain&#x32D;ca Dra&#x301;vid&#x301;ii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  respectively. As the Brahmans of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h represented a more developed culture, they found it hard to accept the dominance of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma (which teaches the supremacy of the Vedas, Brahmans, cows and kings). Besides that, there was an unwillingness to study the Vedas that was deep-rooted in their nature. For this reason they did not get the recognition of the Prayag conference. The Brahmans living in that part of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h which was under the rule of the king of Gaor&#x301;a at that time accepted that non-recognition. But as a mark of their own speciality, they introduced a beautiful social system, the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga system, and thus displayed an example of their own originality of thought. But the Brahmans living in those parts of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h which were not under the rule of the king of Gaor&#x301;a began to call themselves Utkal [Orissa] or post-Utkal Brahmans with a view to getting recognition from the Praya&#x301;giiya system. They went on with the old Mita&#x301;ks&#x301;ara&#x301; system. So none of them came from outside. Their lifestyle, customs and physical structures &ndash; all bear the stamp of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Does this mean that no Brahmans came from Utkal? No, a good many did come [later]. They were brought for their scholarly capacity. These invited Brahmans called themselves Da&#x301;ks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;tya Vaedika (Southern, or Deccan, Vedics). They follow the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga system. Shibnath Shastri, M.N. Ray and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were all Deccan Vedic. (According to some, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was Western Vedic.) They live in the districts of Midnapore, Burdwan, Howrah, Hooghly, 24 Parganas, Jessore, etc. Some of them use common surnames such as Chakravorty and Bhattacharya, but some of course use the old Utkal Brahman surnames such as Panigrahi, Panda, Sarangi, Patra, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
