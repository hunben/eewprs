<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[Moks&#x301;aka&#x301;ran&#x301;asamagrya&#x301;m&#x301;] bhaktireva gariiyasii [&ldquo;Of all the ways to attain salvation, bhakti is the greatest&rdquo;]. What is moks&#x301;a? Moks&#x301;a is suspension of individual physical feeling in the crude mind; suspension of the crude mind, merger of the crude mind, in the subtle mind; merger of the subtle mind in the pure &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling; and suspension of the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling in the a&#x301;tman. When the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is suspended within the scope of, within the jurisdiction of, the pure cognition,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> that stance is called salvation, or moks&#x301;a. Moks&#x301;aka&#x301;ran&#x301;asamagrya&#x301;m&#x301; bhaktireva gariiyasii. For the attainment of moks&#x301;a, one should follow certain processes. There are certain practices. &ldquo;Amongst those processes or practices,&rdquo; the sa&#x301;dhakas say, &ldquo;the best one is bhakti [devotion]; that is, the suspension of the cruder self into the subtler self is done best by bhakti.&rdquo; And bhakti is the best process. In shruti [scripture] it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Yacched va&#x301;un&#x32D;manasi prajin&#x32D;astad yacchejjin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tmani;<br>Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati niyacchet tadyaccheccha&#x301;nta a&#x301;tmani.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[Wise persons first merge their indriyas, sense organs, into their citta, then their citta into aham, then aham into mahat, then mahat into jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;, and finally their jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; into Supreme Consciousness.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The zealous and intelligent spiritual aspirant is to suspend his sensory feelings into the crude mind; those of the crude mind are to be guided, are to be diverted, unto the subtle mind, the working mind, the individual ego; those of the individual ego are to be guided, are to be diverted, towards the pure &lsquo;I&rsquo; feeling; and the pure &lsquo;I&rsquo; feeling should become one with the pure cognition.&rdquo; This process of merger may be effected with the help of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, karma and bhakti.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the first phase the sa&#x301;dhaka is to know what to do, how to do, why to do. This getting the reply of what to do, how to do, why to do, is the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. It is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. And after acquiring the elementary knowledge &ndash; you know, in jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na there are two classes, two varieties. One is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, another is vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam and vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam. Knowledge regarding mundane entities &ndash; engineering science, medical science, art, architecture, literature &ndash; these are all mundane knowledge, worldly knowledge. Such knowledge is called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam. And knowledge regarding spiritual science is called vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, after acquiring knowledge, one is to do accordingly. One is to do something practical. That doing something practical is karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. So after jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam, after knowing what to do, how to do, the sa&#x301;dhaka, the spiritual aspirant, is to do accordingly. This doing is karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And the resultant of the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and the karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is bhakti. So bhakti is not a sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, bhakti is not a practice. It is the resultant of two practices &ndash; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So in the basic stage, in the primordial stage, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam has a certain value for a sa&#x301;dhaka, for a spiritual aspirant. In the next stage karma has a certain value. But in the final stage, bhakti<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  is the guiding factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Just now I said that bhakti is the resultant of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam and karma. But it may so happen that a little boy, a boy of five or six, has developed bhakti. Developed bhakti: but he did not acquire any jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam and did not do any karma. How is it possible? It is possible because bhakti is the resultant of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. That child did jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in his past life. That&#146;s why in this life, in the present life, he developed bhakti from very childhood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, Moks&#x301;aka&#x301;ran&#x301;asamagrya&#x301;m&#x301; bhaktireva gariiyasii. These three factors are the three requisite factors for the attainment of moks&#x301;a &ndash; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam, karma and bhakti. But bhaktireva gariiyasii &ndash; &ldquo;bhakti is the best,&rdquo; because it is the final, it is the subtlest factor. That&#146;s why the sa&#x301;dhaka says: Moks&#x301;aka&#x301;ran&#x301;asamagrya&#x301;m&#x301; bhaktireva gariiyasii. You sa&#x301;dhakas, you must remember this factor, you must remember this point. Here, all your karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and all your jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; are finally to become pinnacled factors, pinnacled into bhakti sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Without bhakti, one cannot come in contact with the Lord. And you must remember that bhakti is not a sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, it is not a practice; it is the resultant of two practices, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam and karma. Be bhaktima&#x301;na and enjoy His bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
