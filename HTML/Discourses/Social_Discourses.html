<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Today you have to create the Great Universe, and the guiding principle behind it will be that all humans are the progeny of the Supreme Progenitor, God.  Thus all are His children, all should live together &ndash; all will have to live together.  Black or white, literate or illiterate, small or tall, all are the children of the same Father and all will have to live together. There will be unity in the physical realm and also in the psychic realms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->But to strengthen this unity still further, there should be a common goal for all the children of the Supreme Father &ndash; the merger of all in Him.  All have come from Him, and therefore all will remain together.  But this is not sufficient.  All have come from Him, are in Him, and will merge in Him, therefore all people will have to live together.  For you, unity is the natural course, and division is unnatural.  You well know that the Cosmic Energy will not long tolerate what is unnatural.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So it is natural for human beings to live together and to make a Great Universe.  By not doing so, by mutual fight, all will be destroyed.  This is the law of the universe (Prakrti).  Thus you will have to remain united; you must create the Great Universe as soon as possible.  There will be peace and happiness in the universe, and with one indivisible ideology, humanity will march ahead.  Victory be with you!<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In our present environment there are many divisive tendencies splitting humanity into mutually belligerent groups. Spirituality must foster a natural affinity among people, to unite all humanity.  The approach to spirituality should be psychological.  Through rational analysis, humanity should appreciate its relationship with God and recognize the most benevolent kindness of that most beloved Entity.  Spirituality should lead human beings to that one Cosmic Truth from Whom they have derived their souls and who is their ultimate destiny.  That ultimate and absolute ideal is the Cosmic Ideal &ndash; an ideal beyond the scope of time, place and person.  It is the Absolute, without and beyond relativity.  It stands with Its own radiance for all time and for every entity of the cosmos, whether human being or less evolved soul.  The Cosmic Ideal alone can be the unifying force which will strengthen humanity to smash its bondages and abolish the narrow domestic walls of divisive tendencies.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Spirituality provides humanity with that subtle and tremendous power with which no other power can be compared.  Therefore, with spirituality as the base, a rational philosophy should be evolved to deal with the physical, psychological and socio-philosophical problems of the day.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As people become more generous and broad-minded, they rise above the feelings of casteism, tribalism, provincialism and nationalism, which evoke narrowness, violence, hatred and meanness.  Those who enter the field of social welfare with feelings of &ldquo;mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;yours&rdquo; actually create divisions in human society.  Those who wish to foster the welfare of living beings as a whole have to embrace universalism as the only alternative. If we look upon everything as our own, the question of &ldquo;mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;yours&rdquo; will dissolve; in universalism there is no opportunity for violence, hatred or narrowness.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Society is like a company of pedestrians going on a pilgrimage. Suppose one among them is attacked by cholera, do the rest go on their way, leaving him behind?  No, they cannot.  Rather, they break their journey at the place for a day or two, relieve him from the disease and help him to acquire strength in his legs. Or, they start out anew, carrying him on their shoulders.  If anyone runs short of his subsistence, others give him their own. Together, they share everything with all.  Together, they stream ahead, singing their leading chorus.  In their eagerness to go ahead with others, they forget their trifling differences which in their families might have lead to negative exchanges and court cases, even down to three generations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The essence of cooperation born of moving together, aims at widening or expanding the mental being of a person by striking down one&#146;s barriers of meanness again and again.  And hence, I reiterate that society is like such a batch of pilgrims gathering a strange power of mind in travelling together and with its help, solving all the problems of their individual and social life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->From the first expression of moralism, to the establishment in cosmic humanity, there is a gap.

<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The entire humanity of this universe constitutes one singular people.  The whole humanity is bound in fraternity: those who are apt to remain oblivious to this very simple truth, those who are prone to distort it, are the deadliest enemies of humanity. Today&#146;s humanity should identify these foes fully well and build a healthy human society totally neglecting all obstacles and difficulties.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->It must be borne in mind that as long as a magnificent, healthy and universalistic human society is not well established, humanity&#146;s entire culture and civilization, its sacrifice, service and spiritual endeavour (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;) will not be of any worth whatsoever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->(A&#x301;nanda Va&#x301;nii, January 1973)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Lack of unity among the members of society, because of too much self-interest in the individual members, formation of sects for economic or social advantages, lack of understanding of others, not only brings the downfall of society, but also will wipe it completely from the face of the earth.  Instances of so many sects and empires disappearing altogether are not rare in the history of this world.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->NATIONALISM AND UNIVERSALISM<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Nationalism is fast becoming outdated.  Not only has the national sentiment given humanity rude shocks in the world wars of this century, but the social and cultural blending of the present age also shows the growing domination of cosmopolitanism in world affairs.  Vested interests, however, continue to cause certain divisive tendencies.  Despite these obstacles, a social blending of humanity is in progress and needs a common constitutional structure to cement the solidarity of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->A world government is also essential to exercise effective control in certain spheres.  For example, there should be only one world military force.  The world government should form certain autonomous units (not necessarily national) to deal with problems such as education, food supply, and flood control.  The boundaries of these units may be readjusted to reflect the development of more sophisticated communication techniques.  Such development brings the remote parts of the world nearer and the world therefore grows smaller.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->(Idea and Ideology, 92)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->It will have to be explained to all that there will be clash between different nations as long as national feelings exist. Some may talk of disarmament, but military preparation will go on underground.  If people dedicate themselves to the cause of the welfare of the entire human race, their respective nations will also be benefited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The one Cosmic Ideology will have to be preached; that one Supreme Father, the Cosmic Entity, is the goal of all living beings.  This spiritual sentiment will keep humanity united for all time to come.  It will form the entire planetary world and even the universe into a nation. Then there will be only one nation &ndash; a World Nation.  No other theory can save the human race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->(To the Patriots, 32)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->A language must also be evolved as the lingua franca of the world.  At present English is most suitable for the purpose and no national sentiment should be encouraged to oppose it.  But local languages must also be encouraged to help indigenous literatures develop and thereby contribute to world progress and the common family of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->(Idea and Ideology, 93)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Every atom of this universe is the joint property of all living beings.  This has to be adopted as a matter of policy; and after its recognition, the idea that this is national and that is foreign, that a particular person is fit for the citizenship of a particular country while others are not or have no rights at all, cannot stand.  In reality, only vested interests appear intensely interested in such illusory matters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->All people are world citizens by birth.  Every human being has the right to go and settle anywhere and to live like a human being.  If any group of people of any country is not ready to accept this fundamental right of living beings, then it should be understood that their utterances for &ldquo;peace&rdquo; are only meant to cheat and bluff others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Humanity has a right to live not only in this small world, but also on every planet and satellite, meteorite, nebula and every particle of this vast creation.  If anyone wants to deprive human beings of this very birthright, then people will have to establish it by force.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The human society is continually striving to arrive at a synthesis through analysis, some sort of unity through diversity. The natural obstructions of small clans, narrow communal interests, geographical distances and intractable customs and usages barriers &ndash; none of these obstacles could hinder the steady and silent movement towards a supreme goal.  That is why the policy of apartheid, the vanity of racial superiority, national chauvinism or regionalism &ndash; these relative doctrines or social philosophies could not thwart the progress of human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The outdated ideals of nationalism are crumbling to pieces today. The newly awakened humanity today is anxious to herald the advent of one Universal Society under a vast blue sky.  The noble and righteous people of all countries, bound by fraternal ties, are eager to assert in one voice with one mind, in the same tune, that human society is one and indivisible.  In this voice of total unity and magnanimity lies the value and message of eternal humanism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->(&ldquo;Human Society is One and Indivisible&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->It is often heard that a particular country was never so united as during the war.  This is due to love of motherland, but more due to all the individuals having a common ideal &ndash; a goal to face the peril of war.  This common ideal is, however, very temporary, and disappears with the danger of war becoming less.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->In our Ananda Marga, the seed for a common ideal is sown from the very beginning of a child&#146;s life.  At the age of five, when the child has acquired only a preliminary understanding of his or her surroundings, s/he is given the ideal of Cosmic Consciousness.  The entire society of Ananda Marga is then founded on a common ideal &ndash; the goal being the Supreme Consciousness.  Such an ideal will not disappear like the common ideal for facing the dangers of war, and the unity in a society founded on an ideal of the Cosmic Consciousness will be everlasting.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->In our Ananda Marga, even in the economic field there is a common ideal, as the whole property of the earth is common property and is to be shared by all members of the society.  This is instilled in every member by the chant recited at the commencement of the functions held by the members of A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->The fact that the fortune of every individual, not only of this earth, but of the entire cosmos, has been wreathed together, will have to be admitted one day by humanity.  The spiritual aspirants have to fetch that auspicious moment sooner by their pauseless effort, service and propagation of the great ideology.  This alone is the supreme task for the present humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->(A&#x301;nanda Va&#x301;nii, January 1969)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Humanity has only one culture.  I am not prepared to admit that there are various cultures.  The dances, songs, pronunciation and ceremonial celebrations of different sections of humanity may have their local peculiarities, but these cannot be considered cultural differences.  The variations in local customs cannot be removed by legal force or by dictatorial rule.  If an attempt is made to destroy common practices, languages, and various local manners and customs in the name of national or human unity, violence and mutual distrust will result and collective life will be doomed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->I am in favour of social synthesis.  In my opinion, as people come more intimately in contact with one another, and the corners of the world come nearer, local customs will assume newer forms as a result of frequent interchange.  The flowers of different gardens will unite into a bouquet which will be more, not less, beautiful than the individual flowers themselves.  If different countries or communities are anxious to establish social blending through marriages, then social synthesis can be achieved within a very short time.  Its concrete reflections are already apparent to some extent in cosmopolitan cities.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->Members of one particular race considering themselves superior to others, also very frequently inflict injustice on the other portions of society.  The expulsion of the Jews from Germany by the so-called superior races has caused a tremendous amount of disruption in society.  In Ananda Marga the first step that a person takes is to forget one&#146;s race or sect and to no longer identify oneself with one&#146;s race, caste or sect, whether it was superior or inferior.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->In social functions based on racial considerations, racial prejudices figure very prominently.  In our collective functions, members of all races, castes or creeds take part as equals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The caste, race or nation is often the main consideration in arranging marriages.  In our Ma&#x301;rga, there is no such consideration.  These petty differences between human beings are not given any importance.  Humanity as a whole is considered as one family belonging to the race of human race.  In such a society, injustice due either to economic background, sex or racial considerations will be unknown.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->I often say that the caste system is hypocrisy &ndash; unreal.  If you analyse the caste of human beings you will find that the ancestors of every human being were monkeys.  In that case everybody&#146;s caste is monkey caste.  All this hypocrisy is to be given up.  Is it that the ancestor of a Brahman-caste human being was a Brahman-caste monkey and that of a Rajput-caste person a Rajput-caste monkey?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->Human society comprises various races.  There is no reason whatever to recognize one race as superior to another race.  The external differences in constitutions among these human groups cannot alter their basic human traits &ndash; love and affection, pleasure and pain, hunger and thirst.  These basic biological instincts and mental propensities equally predominate in human beings of all complexions in all countries and in all ages.  A mere rustic, illiterate, half-naked tribal mother of an unknown hamlet of Chotanagpur hills in India bears deep maternal affections for her young children; in the same way, a well-educated mother of a locality of New York pours out of her heart a great love for her own children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The subterranean flow of love and affection exists in all hearts alike.  Every person cries out in pain, everyone feels pleasure when there are occasions of joy and happiness.  Maybe in different geographical, cultural, social and other environments, the lifestyle of different human groups may vary; maybe, a few special psychic traits in those groups may assert themselves, but fundamentally, their mental existences flow along the same channels of ideas and consciousness.  Containing the same cosmic momentum and under the same cosmic inspiration, they all have set out for a tryst with the same Destiny.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->Feelings of differentiation are a great impediment in the spiritual practice for the Infinite.  The feelings that a particular person is a Muslim, another a Hindu, yet another a Brahmin-caste, and the fourth a capitalist, are mean thoughts. When every living being is a manifestation of the Supreme Consciousness, how can you know yourself without shedding these differentiating feelings?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->No one is high and no one low.  Of course, according to one&#146;s virtues or vices one is happy, one is miserable, one is rich, one is poor, one is a fool, and another is learned.  But all are human beings.  Feelings of differentiation are the principle obstacles on the path of spiritual practice.  For this reason, elevation cannot be attained without annihilating them.<!-- /block --></p>

The people of Asia and America are approaching one another, touching and understanding each other&#146;s minds; they have learned to think about each other sympathetically, as one family of humanity.  Europe, Africa, Australia, Mercury, Jupiter, comets, stars, and constellations - none is alien to the other, none is distant.

<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->We should not forget even for a moment that this whole animate world is a large family in which nature has not assigned any property to any particular individual.  Individual ownership has been created by selfish opportunists so that they might take advantage of the defects of this system in order to grow fatter in a parasitic way.  When the whole property of this universe has been inherited by all creatures, how then can there be any justification for a system in which someone receives a flow of huge excess, while others die for lack of a handful of grain?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->The aspiration to become rich by exploiting others is a sort of mental malady.  In fact, if the eternal hunger of the human soul does not find the real path leading to mental and spiritual wealth, it becomes engaged in the work of depriving other of their rights; it robs them of their material resources.  If any member of a family seizes food from a store by application of mental or physical force, he certainly becomes the cause of misery to others.  Similar is the case when a capitalist says, &ldquo;We have seized wealth by intelligence and labour.  If others have mental and physical potentialities they may also do it.  Who objects to it?&rdquo;  They do not want to realize that the volume of commodities is limited whereas requirements are common to all. In most spheres, abundance for one individual takes the bread out of the mouths of others.  It is a mental ailment not to understand this common necessity.<!-- /block --></p>

But if you apply your inner vision, i.e., intuitional sight, you see that the man was without food for four days, and so under pressure of circumstances, he had to steal.  So after this inner seeing, this inner vision, you will come to the decision that we will remodel the socio-economic structure so that never is he compelled to steal under pressure of circumstances, because of being hungry for several days.  When I started Ananda Marga, I wanted the entire humanity to stand upon the strict code of cardinal principles, human values and spirituality, and when I saw everything internally I came to the decision that there are so many loopholes in the human society. Human beings came here about one million years ago but have not yet been able to form a well-knit social order. We require a strong social order. That&#146;s why I had to create another branch of philosophy known as PROUT, through which we are to remodel the social order so that nobody is compelled to resort to immorality for lack of food or clothes or other necessities of life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="196"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=196 type=paragraph -->The first cause of sin is: shortage of physical and psychic resources.  If there is lack of physical necessities, people are not able to follow the higher pursuits of life.  A person&#146;s discrimination is easily disturbed; with a little anger even an intellectual utters crude words.  Hence, due to a shortage of physical wealth, people become restless, lose their discrimination, and become brutal.  It is because of this that communism has tended toward brutality.  Likewise, if there is a dearth of intellectual resources and the intellectual standard of the people is not high, they may confuse dos and don&#146;ts.  An example is a riot in which an innocent little boy is killed.  The one who encourages the riot becomes the people&#146;s leader.  Because the intellectual standard of the people is low, they commit blunders prompted by these leaders and become beasts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="197"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=197 type=paragraph -->In those countries which are backward or where the socio-politico-economic consciousness is less, immoral, political pigs in the form of leaders misguide the people to collect votes. I say, they are political satans, political pigs.  There, shortage of physical and intellectual wealth causes people to become beasts and commit sins and crimes.  This is common everywhere in the entire world except for a few well-off countries, and even there this is present, but less prominently.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="198"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=198 type=paragraph -->The second cause is non-utilization of over-accumulated physical and psychic resources.  It is a mental disease to accumulate money.  Those who accumulate it do not do so in order to fulfill their needs.  Human needs are few, including food, shelter and clothing.  For instance, if a person has a fruit grove which yields 500 mangoes and there are only five family members, what will be done with so many mangoes?  There is very little chance of utilization in the case of over-accumulation.  If sadvipras are not vigilant, where there is over-accumulation, human beings will tend to misutilize wealth by indulging in baser tendencies. Therefore you will note &ndash; I am making it crystal-clear to you - that the wealthy businessmen and most of the idle kings and aristocrats of ancient times were generally wicked and mean-minded.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="199"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=199 type=paragraph -->The third cause is stagnancy.  This is the greatest burden, the greatest disease of the human society.  This sort of stagnancy is suicidal, for the sign of life is dynamism.  To solve this cause of sin, an intellectual approach does not work.  Dogmatic and traditional people do not listen to reason.  They have to be struck.  And those who do the striking are sadvipras.  The striking has to be done with a hammer.  Sweet gospels will not do.  They must be hit not with a hammer but with a sledge hammer.<!-- /block --></p>

The duty of the sadvipras will be to hammer appropriately these stagnant people who are the burden of the society so that the path of human progress may be straight, pure, and well-constructed.<!-- /block --></p>

Those who are honest try to follow morality in their private lives, but at times are forced to desert morality under the unwieldy load of poverty.  In the course of time, they may have to go to court under the charge of theft.  Law has nothing to do with poverty which has goaded them to steal.  And if they are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, there is no provision in law for the maintenance of their families.  As a result, the children of such families will have no other way to live than to become pickpockets or have recourse to stealing; and their mothers, unfortunate as they are, will have to find their way leading to the underworld and to maintain their existence, embrace an ignoble and sinful life. After their release from jail, their husbands will be hated and spoken ill of by society and, out of sensitivity to such affronts, they will be forced to resort to stealing as their profession.  In this way hundreds of families are being ruined everyday.  Nobody feels their agonies or comes forward to sympathize with them.

In this plan of mutual relationship, even the slightest mistake or discord anywhere will raise a furor in the universe.  In this mighty task of creation, the brilliantly luminous sun and the insignificant ant hold the same importance of existence, all these having combined to create the world family.

If anybody, whether a judge or a common citizen, takes some sort of requital against someone else, it should be corrective, not penal.

<a name="319"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=319 type=paragraph -->At present the worth of life is ascertained with an eye to money. One who possesses wealth commands respect and passes for a noble person.  Nowadays if you have no money you cannot expect to get honour.  The poor people belonging to all other classes have to woo the moneyed people just for the sake of earning a livelihood. Human values are taboo here.  Human beings are now but a medium of earning money.  The rich have purchased all the brains with their money.  They have bidden farewell to all their human values and at the same time they are busy playing a chess game with the lives of the other members of society.  Bereft of everything, the people toil around the clock to live from hand to mouth.  Those who are at the helm of society are absorbed in strife and suspicion, or in reckoning their loss and profit.  They have no desire to think of humanity.  In order to gratify their self-interest they are ready to chew the humans&#146; bones.  There is no room for mercy, sympathy, or fellow-feeling.  All are self-centered.<!-- /block --></p>

If power is given to an incompetent person, it will be equivalent to leading society astray in cold blood.  Sadvipras will install fit persons in power, and the social order which will be evolved by virtue of their leadership will give due importance to each and everybody. In this new society based on Neohumanism, every person will find his or her life worth living.  Human beings will get back their position of honour.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="324"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=324 type=paragraph -->Wise people say that in the past there had been so many crises in the human society.  Crisis is quite natural for something moving. Where there is movement there is struggle &ndash; struggle against the inertia of the earth.  In the past there had been crises in the course of movement, crises in different branches of civilization, crises in the realm of education also.  But nowadays, the entire human society is facing the crisis of civilization as a whole and particularly crisis in the field of existence.  Now, the human society has to decide whether to live or to die.  If the crisis of civilization as a whole and of existence is encouraged, humanity has no future.  The future is dark, the future is sealed forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="325"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=325 type=paragraph -->But as you know, I am not a pessimist.  I am always an optimist. And I want all my sons and daughters to be optimists.  I also want that they should struggle against this death signal of humanity and come out successful.  I am sure that you boys and you girls must be victorious.  It is your duty to save humanity. I hope you will be able to save humanity because just like me, you are also optimistic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="326"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=326 type=paragraph -->You should know that great or small, you people are few in number.  You few are the torch bearers of human society.  You are the pioneers, you are the vanguard of the human society.  So it is your duty to save humanity.  Those who are unable to shoulder their own bags and baggages, their responsibilities are to be shouldered by you.  You should know that the life of spiritual aspirants is a mission &ndash; their entire existence is a mission. And your mission is, what?  To save humanity from these crises. I hope, you will be successful.  I not only hope, I am sure that you will be successful.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="328"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=328 type=paragraph -->Some say that after thousands of years, there will be no humanity.  Beings from other planets may come and see their fossilized existence, to see that there were creatures on this earth named human beings who were educated, who were intelligent, who used to build palaces, buildings, cities, but who have now become extinct due to their internal disunity and infighting.  Do you want history to be written like this?  Then preach the gospels of humanity everywhere &ndash; save the dying humanity.<!-- /block --></p>

The dawn of a glorious new era is on the one side, and the worn-out skeleton of the past on the other.  Humanity has to adopt either one or the other.  You are the spiritual soldiers, you are the worshippers of life divine.  Hence I call upon you to adorn this crimson dawn deluged with glorious light.  Victory is surely yours.<!-- /block --></p>

The entire human society is anxiously waiting for you, for your service.  You will have to shoulder a great responsibility for this suffering humanity.  You know that humanity is bleeding, and you will have to save it.  You should remember that if you do not help humanity, who else will come and shoulder the responsibility?  It is you, you are to do everything.  You are the torch bearers of human civilization. You are the pioneers of the human march, you are the vanguards of the new civilization.<!-- /block --></p>

Powerful human groups are exploiting the weaker ones.  Under such circumstances, it is the duty of good people to declare war on the oppressors.  It will not be of use to sit quiet for an indefinite period in the hope that only moral preaching will be fruitful.  Hence, all good people will have to be united.  There should be a pauseless preparation for war against the oppressors.<!-- /block --></p>

In the same way, the eternal glow of the boundless &#233;lan vital of Cosmic Consciousness has been illuminating the life lamp of universal humanism since time immemorial, is illuminating and will do so in future even more intensely.
