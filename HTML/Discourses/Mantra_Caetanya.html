<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Before we try to understand what a mantra is, let us be clear about shabda [sound]. Everything in this manifest universe is vibrational. Creation is also vibrational. And the first and subtlest expression of the vibrational flow is shabda. As shabda is the first vibrational expression of Brahma, Shabda Brahma is the first expression of Ka&#x301;rya Brahma [Effect Brahma, Expressed Brahma]. The fundamental difference between Ka&#x301;rya Brahma and Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma [Causal Brahma] is that all vika&#x301;sha, all expression, in Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma is purely svagata (subjective) and svarasa&#x301;tmaka (blissful). There is no paragata (objective) or pararasa&#x301;tmaka (extroversial) pleasure therein. Being purely subjective and blissful, it has no vyain&#x32D;jana&#x301;tmaka bha&#x301;va, no exceptional quality. In other words, it is purely original and cannot [contain] any compound or mixture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Prior to its practical emergence in the practical sphere, shabda was present in the realm of bha&#x301;va, or ideas. And the starting point of shabda in the world of ideation is called para&#x301;shakti. Para&#x301;shakti exists both in the unit<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and in the [Cosmos]. Although potentially para&#x301;shakti has full possibilities of expression, due to lack of a medium it does not get expressed. It germinates into expression as soon as it finds a medium. And its vibrational expression is shabda. In other words, we hear sound within and without when there is a mutual clash in the medium due to the formation of troughs and crests of various waves. This then is shabda.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma [is represented] in Tantric scriptures by all the svaravarn&#x301;a [vowel] sounds taken together. When those sounds are converted into action, that is, acquire the potential to form mixtures and compounds, they are called vyain&#x32D;jana [consonants]. The diversity of creation is expressed through consonants, not through vowels. This is the logic behind the division of the Indo-Aryan alphabet into vowels and consonants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is a mantra? It has already been stated that the starting point of shabda, para&#x301;bindu, exists both in the unit and in the [Cosmos]. In the flow of evolution, in the unit as well as in the Cosmic, shabda is born out of para&#x301;. Para&#x301; is the womb of all sounds. A mantra is a collection of a few particular shabdas - not each and every shabda. Mantra means &ldquo;that collection of sounds meditation on which leads to liberation&rdquo; &ndash; Manana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah mantrah parikiirttitah. Man plus the root verb trae plus the suffix d&#x301;a make up the word mantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->By way of illustration, suppose you are sitting somewhere and you do not have the strength to move. A gentleman happens to come that way. If you say to him, &ldquo;Come, sir, let&#146;s have a little talk,&rdquo; that will not prompt the gentleman to lift you by the hand and support your movement. If, on the other hand, you tell the gentleman, &ldquo;Come, sir, I don&#146;t have the strength to get up &ndash; please take my hand and lift me up,&rdquo; it may bring about that result. Thus we get the result we desire by means of an appropriate expression in words. In this illustration the seed of the idea was the same at the level of para&#x301;, but due to two different formations of expression, different results were obtained. A given expression carries a particular meaning for you, as it expresses a particular feeling and it possesses a particular value. In other words, when a particular feeling is expressed through a particular combination of sounds, it achieves a particular value. But even then it does not attain the status of a mantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Unless the shabda or the collection of shabdas, when meditated upon, leads to the path of liberation, it cannot be called a mantra. Every mantra is thus sonic or vibrational and is vibrating simultaneously in the Cosmic system and in the unit body. When, with the help of a mantra, a person finally establishes the parallelism of the unit ectoplasmic vibration with the Cosmic vibration, that person gets mantra siddhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And what is mantra caetanya, or the awakening of a mantra? Mantra caetanya is the condition where, with the help of a particular shabda, a person establishes parallelism between his or her external physical vibration and his or her internal ectoplasmic vibration, and then raises this to the spiritual level.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And the culmination of this process in the achievement of the final spiritual goal is called mantra siddhi. The same shabda without being made &ldquo;live&rdquo; or awakened in the above process is meaningless; it acquires force and meaning when it becomes &ldquo;live&rdquo; in the aforesaid manner. The parallelism between the internal ectoplasmic vibration and the external Cosmic vibration can only be established when one has complete control over one&#146;s own ectoplasmic vibration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->According to one&#146;s sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, a person will be vibrated immediately by one shabda, but remain immune to the vibrations of another. Thus some people get angry when you say &ldquo;Sita&#x301;-Ra&#x301;m&rdquo; to them, but are pleased when you greet them with &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dhe-Shya&#x301;m&rdquo;. Our attitude towards different shabdas becomes defined.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It will be noted that many writers repeat the use of particular words. Many, for instance, use the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; in every other sentence. All this happens because of their attachment to particular rhythmic vibrations. Similarly, when the vibrational expression is ectoplasmic, that is, when the individual gets equilibrated with the Cosmic vibration, [Cosmic] mantra caetanya takes place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As already mentioned, not only human existence but every existence in this universe is vibrational. But the vibrations of each individual, of each object, differ from those of other objects. For instance, there is a difference between the vibrational expression of iron and that of gold. Just as the vibrations of a human differ from those of iron or gold, the vibrations between one human and another also differ. A person&#146;s life is nothing but a mesh of multilateral rhythms, and the goal of human life is a singular Entity having no rhythm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The style of a person&#146;s speech represents a particular rhythm of his or her own. The way the person eats represents the rhythm of his/her own eating. Every person is thus special on account of these specialities. The rhythms of two individuals cannot be identical. An individual rhythm is the particular property of a particular person. It has been said in A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram:<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Vaecitryam&#x301; pra&#x301;krtadharmah sama&#x301;nam&#x301; na bhavis&#x301;yati [&ldquo;Diversity, not identity, is the law of nature&rdquo;]. In this universe every person in every action possesses a particular rhythm of his own. If someone wants to obstruct or strike that rhythm through disciplinary measures or expressions of anger, the person will not tolerate it. Personal liberty &ndash; individual liberty &ndash; really means the unobstructed expression of individual rhythmic vibrations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When with the help of one&#146;s para&#x301;shakti (para&#x301; in the sense of the starting point of shabda and not in the context of para&#x301; and apara&#x301;) a person coincides his or her individual rhythmic vibrations with the rhythmic vibrations in the realm of this quinquelemental universe, from that moment onwards his or her rhythms become vibrated with mantra caetanya. This is the awakening of, or putting life into, a mantra. Therefore Sada&#x301;shiva has said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Caetanyarahita&#x301;h mantra&#x301;h prokta&#x301;h varn&#x301;a&#x301;stu kevalam<br>Phalam&#x301; naeva prayachanti laks&#x301;akot&#x301;ijapaerapi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In order to make a mantra &ldquo;live&rdquo;, the individual rhythms have to be made parallel to the Cosmic rhythms. Then the starting point of expression of the unit will have to be made to coincide with the starting point of expression in the Cosmic field. &ldquo;If this has not been done,&rdquo; says the shloka, &ldquo;even hundreds of thousands, even millions, of repetitions of the mantra will not lead to mantra siddhi.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There are several essential factors to bring about mantra caetanya. The first is that the mantra should suit the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra of the individual concerned. And the second is that the individual should feel a fraternal emotion for and attachment to the external world. This sentimental contact with the external world is a must. If someone is under the impression that &ldquo;I am doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for the sake of personal liberation and I have nothing to do with the world,&rdquo; and thus denies his or her contact with external physicality, although the person&#146;s physical body is very much in this world, the person is cheating himself and indulging in selfishness. Service to humanity with a view to serve Parama Purus&#x301;a and with the same attachment which one feels towards oneself and Parama Purus&#x301;a is an essential prerequisite for progress in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. This will establish the equilibrium and parallelism of the individual rhythms with the rhythms of the external physicalities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The microcosm is in a dormant state, and the jiivabha&#x301;va, the feeling of the unit state, is in a condition of slumber. The point where the jiivabha&#x301;va, that is, the sense of the unit identity, is locked, is called kula. Hence those who achieve perfection through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; are called kaola. (Kaola, with this meaning, is also used as a surname.) Those who can move the collective ectoplasm through the medium of their ectoplasmic rhythm, can awaken new power in shabda through their own ectoplasmic strength. The awakening of this power in shabda is called purashcaran&#x301;a in Sanskrit. And those who can perform such a tough task are called Maha&#x301;kaola. They alone are worthy of the status of guru and no one else. When a Maha&#x301;kaola awakens vibrations in the universal ectoplasmic body through the medium of particular shabdas, those shabdas [are also altered and] acquire the status of siddha mantras. A spiritual aspirant can only achieve perfection through the medium of those siddha mantras. Other mantras are not capable of leading to success, and spiritual aspirants cannot awaken them. A person&#146;s individual efforts will never be sufficient for that task.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Every person has certain mental limitations. He or she can only proceed to a certain extent and then cannot do anything further. Further progress requires special power and special grace. And this power and grace of God are always available for everyone. But people must use their existing strength in order to utilize that grace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->What is the range of these shabdas, whose troughs and crests are expressed in vibrational rhythms? The medium as well as the spirit of the human&#146;s individual life are personal, but in the Cosmic body, as well as in the case of less-developed creatures, the spirit is personal or individual but the medium is impersonal or Cosmic. An existence where the medium is impersonal [or Cosmic] but the spirit is individual is called an animal existence. In other words, any progress in the life of an animal is due to the vibrational power of Parama Purus&#x301;a; the medium therefore is Cosmic or impersonal, but the spirit is individual. The progress which is attained through the personal spirit and impersonal medium is towards Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. Therefore there is no chance of a spiritual fall in the life of an animal. Animals are set firmly on a path of gradual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->As the medium is impersonal, the growth in animals is from the crude to the subtle. But when due to engagement in subtler activities the medium also acquires individual influence, when its [mental] colour and its feeling do not remain entirely impersonal, gradually thinking and intellect are born. We find this in developed animals. The transformation in a dog is due to the effect of the personal, or individual, medium on the impersonal medium; this does not occur in lower creatures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->There is a big difference between a wild Alsatian in a jungle and one who is a pet. The medium of the one is influenced by the impersonal, that of the other is under the impact of an educated person. When in a living being the influence of the personal or individual surpasses the influence of the impersonal [or Cosmic], at that point the frame of that being can no longer be called animal but is called a human being. So this is the human status.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Due to one&#146;s individual effort, para&#x301; gradually develops step by step into pashyantii, madhyama&#x301;, [dyotama&#x301;na], shrutigocara&#x301; and vaekharii.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> These steps are from the subtle to the crude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Similarly in the Cosmic order, development is from the subtle to the crude, as the medium there is Universal Mind. The vibrational principle appears in the third phase of extroversial development. This vibrational principle is fully operative in matter and in the bodies and minds of undeveloped and underdeveloped creatures. The same vibrational principle functions in the human body when it starts from the point of para&#x301; and gets full extroversial expression. When a person will awaken caetanya in a mantra, that is, when he or she will do purashcaran&#x301;a, he or she will move from negativity to positivity, from human para&#x301;bindu to human sahasra&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The starting point of the vibrational principle is the culminating or last point of the primordial principle. In other words, the last point of the primordial expression and the starting point of the vibrational faculty are one and the same. The movement after mantra caetanya is from the fundamental negativity to the fundamental positivity. In other words, this movement will be the reverse of the movement of the vibrational faculty; it will be from crude to subtle and not from subtle to crude. In the vibrational principle, the first crest and trough are far apart, and thereafter the distance becomes shorter and shorter. In spiritual practice, the first troughs and crests will be frequent, and then the intervals will gradually lengthen till a straight line is formed. Thus, in the second phase, that is, in the returning phase, the vibrational principle will be reconverted into the primordial principle and the primordial principle or primordial faculty will ultimately convert itself into the basic faculty.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  This  movement, however, is only possible after the mantra has become [awakened], not before that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Spiritual practice is essential for human beings; and for spiritual practice initiation is necessary. And those human beings who do not perform spiritual practice are under the influence of the Cosmic principle. They are guided by the Cosmic rhythmic order, but as this is an impersonal entity they will never be able to enjoy liberation or salvation. So what is the way out? In what direction must they move after mantra caetanya? They have to do an about-turn and cross the three phases described above. They have to return to their original abode. They have to merge back into the One from where their existence sprang.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;nando brahmeti byaja&#x301;nat<br>A&#x301;nanda&#x301;dhyeva khalvima&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni ja&#x301;yante<br>A&#x301;nandena ja&#x301;ta&#x301;ni jiivanti<br>A&#x301;nandam&#x301; prayantyabhisam&#x301;vishantiiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->[Know ye that a&#x301;nanda, bliss, is Brahma. It is out of a&#x301;nandam that the five fundamental factors have emerged. All created beings live within a&#x301;nandam, and finally merge with a&#x301;nandam.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->What then is to be done? The scriptures say that you do not have to exert very much. I have said before that there can be no progress either in the realm of physicality or in the realm of intellectuality. Those who are hankering for progress in these fields are indulging in a self-cheating business. Whether they admit it or not, they know that they know nothing. Ask them whether they are getting pleasure in the realm of physicality. They will admit that they are not. Ask a good businessman whether he is earning good profits. His reply will be, &ldquo;What profit? I am incurring losses.&rdquo; This will be his reply whether you belong to Income Tax Department or not! To run after progress in the realm of physicality and intellectuality is utter foolishness, a waste of time, as there is no progress in these fields. But I have already said that you may make efforts in these directions provided you can convert or metamorphose them into spirituality. But as far as spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is concerned, or as far as efforts to achieve bliss are concerned, there is no touch of pain in them, as bliss is infinite pleasure alone. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; then is what wise men have to do. And in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the first thing to be done is to use mantra caetanya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->In simple words, what we have to do is to return home from where we came. We have all come from Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; the Supreme Entity &ndash; and from the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a-kendra, the nucleus of the universe &ndash; that is, Purus&#x301;ottama. We have to return to the same place. It is like a boy who has played throughout the day away in the fields, and now that evening comes, returns home. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the process of returning home. The child has played outside for the whole day. As evening approaches, he thinks, &ldquo;Father must have returned home. Let me also return home and sit next to him.&rdquo; When one is tired of this world and worldliness, one yearns to go back to spirituality, that is, to one&#146;s home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->And what is our permanent abode &ndash; our home? It is Parama Purus&#x301;a parama&#x301;shrayah Shriiniva&#x301;sah. Here shrii refers to the Universal Creative Faculty, or Parama&#x301; Prakrti. The abode of this Universal Faculty is also your abode. Therefore going home is a simple task. It requires no scholarship, no knowledge, no intellectual faculty &ndash; no long and tedious lecturing. The scriptures tell us to remember three points in order to return home. They are shravana [hearing about the Supreme], manana [ideating on the Supreme] and nidi-dhya&#x301;sana [meditating on the Supreme with an unbroken flow of mind].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->We know that the vibrational faculty converts subtler waves into cruder waves in the phase of creation. Hari katha&#x301; [devotional talk] provides subtler vibrations. You must allow yourself to receive these subtler waves. It has already been said that sound waves are the subtlest in the chain of Cosmic expression. The importance of Hari katha&#x301; in spiritual development is great. Hearing about God is much more important than studies in spirituality, as sound is subtler than visual form. Therefore wherever there is an opportunity, listen to His name and speak it to others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->When you speak His name to others, you also hear it. This dual enjoyment in reciting His name is called kiirtana. Bhajana, on the other hand, is hearing His name by oneself.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> You must do both &ndash; both bhajana and kiirtana. This is shravana. The effect of shravana is that vibrations of sound which are moving from crude to subtle are set in motion against the flow in the vibrational faculty, where wordly sounds are moving from subtle to crude. This will set in reverse motion a flow of sounds, and this will take one up to the starting point of the vibrational faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->I have already stated that the starting point of the vibrational faculty and the culminating point of the primordial faculty are one and the same. You will therefore reach the culminating point of the primordial faculty. The vibrational phase is called bhava &ndash; also bhava sa&#x301;gara or bhava pa&#x301;ra&#x301;va&#x301;ra [ocean of creation]. The word bhava thus denotes the entire realm of the vibrational principle. This is the world of mundane involvements. The Caetanya, or Cognitive Principle of this faculty is called Bhava, and the Shakti, or Operative Principle of this faculty is called Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti. This is the worldly bondage. Only through the medium of Hari katha&#x301; can one cross this ocean of bhava, the entire range of the vibrational faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Thereafter comes manana, that is, thinking only about Parama Purus&#x301;a and about no one else. If any other person or thing comes in the mind, ascribe Brahma-hood to that person or thing. This process is manana; you learn this process through the medium of Guru Mantra.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The effect of manana will be that it will take you from the last point of the primordial principle or faculty, and gradually take you to the starting point of the primordial faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->At this point you meet the basic faculty or basic principle. The basic principle or faculty is a point in the unbalanced triangle of forces. It is situated at a particular vertex of the triangle of forces. Manana can take you up to that point. What is now left is the point of &ldquo;I&rdquo;-hood, the ego. Now we have to wipe out this &ldquo;I&rdquo;-hood.<!-- /block --></p>

The fact is that even after surrendering everything to Parama Purus&#x301;a, your arch-enemy &ndash; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; remains. Because you will say, &ldquo;I have surrendered everything to God.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; my friend, surrender that &ldquo;I&rdquo; to God.

What can I offer to You, O Lord? Oh yes, there is one thing You lack, as it has been stolen by Your devotees; it is Your mind. I therefore offer my mind to You. Please accept it.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->After the surrender of this &ldquo;I&rdquo;, Parama Purus&#x301;a is satisfied, as you have reached the central point in the triangle of forces.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn9"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn9">9</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Actually, the only task to be performed is to give away everything to Him. All that you possess &ndash; your body, your name, fame, wealth, everything &ndash; you have received from Him. So what are you to give to Him and how are you to do it? So far you were only giving God&#146;s own things back to Him. What you must give Him now is something of your own. This is the crux of the matter. Suppose someone gives you a flower as a gift and you return the same flower to that person. This is not proper. Why not give your &ldquo;I&rdquo; to Him, which anyway to you is the source of all troubles, all confusions, all complications. There is nothing dearer to you than this &ldquo;I&rdquo;. It is most difficult to give it up. Thus in the above shloka, the devotee exclaims, &ldquo;O Lord, this universe is Your abode. It is full of precious jewels. Whatever of value exists in this world belongs to You. What precious gift can I give to You? You have no desire for anything. What is the use of offering anything to one whose house is full of precious jewels? The almighty Prakrti is Your own consort; at Your will She will make innumerable jewels in a moment &ndash; aghat&#x301;ana ghat&#x301;ana pat&#x301;iiyasii Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; [&lsquo;the dexterous hand of  Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; that can even create things impossible to create&rsquo;] &ndash; this creative power is ever ready to serve You. O Lord of lords, although I have a yearning to offer You something, I do not know what that thing should be. Although I want to offer, You have no desire or want. If You lack nothing, what can I offer? If I knew of anything that You did not possess, I would offer it to You.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;O Lord of lords, we hear that Your great devotees have stolen Your mind from You. The Lord becomes the slave of his devotees. A devotee steals the heart of the Lord &ndash; almost forcibly. The deed is performed openly and not in secrecy. Therefore, O Lord, You lack one thing &ndash; You have no mind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->The devotee says, &ldquo;Despair not, O Lord, I am offering my mind to You. Please accept it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->This offer of one&#146;s mind to the Lord is nididhya&#x301;sana. The inner sense of nididhya&#x301;sana is that all the propensities of the mind are to be concentrated at a point to be offered to Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Today the human mind consists of fifty dominant propensities. Definitely when the human structure becomes more complex in the course of evolution, the number of these propensities will also increase. The number of these vrttis is not going to remain fifty forever. It will increase. Similarly, the number of glands will increase, and so also the number of sub-glands. Not only will the number of mental propensities increase; the propensities will also undergo change. The concept of beauty will also change with the change in outlook of the human mind. An owl may then appear beautiful and a peacock ugly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Shravana therefore enables one to cross the vibrational faculty. Manana enables one to cross the primordial faculty. And nididhya&#x301;sana makes it possible to merge with the Supreme Entity. This is God-realization. The essential thing therefore is to awaken the mantra, whether one also does intellectual things such as reading and writing or not. What is important is to have proper shravana, manana and nidi-dhya&#x301;sana. If one does this, one will no longer find it difficult to learn to do anything. Mantra caetanya is sure to lead to mantra siddhi, to the attainment of the supreme goal. The process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; will automatically arouse devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->When you come in close contact with the Supreme Entity, you will find that you have no wealth superior to devotion. All worldly possessions will prove of no avail. Only devotion enables you to come into close contact with Him. This is the goal of human life. This is true progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->You have been wandering through the labyrinth of a myriad of lives. You have been ever advancing toward this stage. Knowingly or unknowingly, you are being drawn unto Him. This is the summum bonum of life. As long as you have not realized Him, there is no siddhi in your life.<!-- /block --></p>
