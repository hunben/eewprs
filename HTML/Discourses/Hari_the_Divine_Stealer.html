<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->One of the names of Parama Purus&#x301;a is &ldquo;Hari.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hari&rdquo; means one who does the act of &ldquo;haran&#x301;a.&rdquo; &ldquo;Haran&#x301;a&rdquo; means &ldquo;to steal.&rdquo; How is it that Parama Purus&#x301;a steals? Stealing He does, i.e. He steal the sins of devotees. You know that every action has a reaction. If there is no change in time, space and person, there must be a reaction equal to the action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Suppose a person commits many sins; if those are to be undergone, it might take twenty to twenty-five lives. So is there no future for the sinner, and will he or she come again and again into the world to undergo his/her reactions? There more the so-called civilization is developing, the more persons are degenerating, minds are falling and the number of sinners is increasing. Then is there no future for the sinner? What is this? If the reactions of all the actions are to be reaped completely, liberation and salvation will be a far cry. There is certainly a future for sinners. Parama Purus&#x301;a will certainly do something for those who have taken refuge in Him. It is said about Parama Purus&#x301;a that He is the Lord of both hell and heaven. Those who remain in hell are also with Parama Purus&#x301;a, are also dear to Him. To give them love, Parama Purus&#x301;a will have to remain in hell with them. What does Parama Purus&#x301;a do? To save them, He will take the load of their sins on Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Real devotees do not want to give their sins to Parama Purus&#x301;a, rather, they want to offer flowers and sweets. They would like to carry the load of their sins themselves. Since they are very dear to Parama Purus&#x301;a, he takes away their sins without their permission. To take something without permission is known as stealing. So Parama Purus&#x301;a steals, and therefore He is known as &ldquo;Hari&rdquo; &ndash; you have taken refuge in Hari. There is no need to worry any more. In hell also Parama Purus&#x301;a will be with you.<!-- /block --></p>
