<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In ancient times there was a renowned scholar named Rohita. He was a great scholar, no doubt, spending the whole day absorbed in the study of the scriptures, but he abhorred mundane tasks. His father tried hard to rectify him, but unsuccessfully, as he was totally preoccupied with the acquisition of bookish knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->His father said, &ldquo;Look Rohita, a hard-working person&#146;s face often drips with the perspiration of labour. The beauty that radiates from such a face is incomparable. Even the king of the gods enjoys the company of such people who earn much reputation and prestige in society due to their dedicated actions. In fact, society advances due to the contributions of such noble people. So Rohita, move on, move on. Don&#146;t be idle. Do more and more work. The fate of those who languish lazily in bed also lies down with them. When a person sits up, their fate also sits up. When they stand, their fate also stands. When they move forward, their fate also moves forward. Therefore, Rohita, move on, move on. Don&#146;t be idle.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Kalih shaya&#x301;no bhavati.&rdquo; As long as human beings remain steeped in the darkness of staticity, they are said to be in Kali Yuga [the so-called &ldquo;Iron Age&rdquo;]. &ldquo;Sain&#x32D;jiha&#x301;nastu Dva&#x301;para.&rdquo; But when they wake up and realize that they must do something, they must move forward, they are said to have entered Dva&#x301;para Yuga [the so-called &ldquo;Copper Age&rdquo;]. &ldquo;Uttis&#x301;t&#x301;han Treta&#x301; bhavati&rdquo;. When they stand up and prepare themselves for work, they are said to have entered Treta Yuga [the so-called &ldquo;Silver Age&rdquo;]. &ldquo;Krtam&#x301; sampadyate caran&#x301;.&rdquo; When they move forward they are said to have entered Satya Yuga [the so-called &ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo;]. &ldquo;Therefore, Rohita, move on, move on.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Whatever Rohita said to his son is quite true and the message carried by his words is to be followed even today. I, too, repeat that under no circumstances should you give indulgence to laziness. Always keep yourself busy in some activity or other and always move forward.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Do not dwell upon past events: it serves no purpose whatsoever. Move on with your knowledge of modern, no, ultra-modern science, technology and thought. Advance as a vanguard leading the way for others to follow. This is the true spirit of life, and this is the path upon which your glory will be established.<!-- /block --></p>
