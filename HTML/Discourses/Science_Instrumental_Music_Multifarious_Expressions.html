<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><I>Eka + vad + ghain&#x32D;</I>. That musical instrument which produces sound in harmony (mutually related notes of the scale) is called <I>ekava&#x301;da</I>. Among the musical instruments familiar to us, the harmonium and the <I>tamboura</I> fall into this category. Among insects and animals, the cricket, owl, frog and jackal follow to some extent this same system [producing sound in harmony]. The donkey, cuckoo and Indian nightingale follow it to a limited degree. The sitar or esraj do not fall into the category of <I>ekava&#x301;da</I>. Some people think that <I>ekava&#x301;da</I> means <I>ekata&#x301;ra&#x301;</I> [a one-stringed instrument]. No, the Sanskrit word for <I>ekata&#x301;ra&#x301;</I> is <I>samava&#x301;da</I>, not <I>ekava&#x301;da</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The subject of <I>ekava&#x301;da</I> brings back a forgotten memory. At that time myself and Prasenjit used to go to the hills every evening to practise the esraj [four-stringed bowed instrument]. The esraj belonged to Prasenjit. I was trying to see if the esraj could be played as an <I>ekava&#x301;da</I> or not; and, if it could, how would it effect the <I>surasaptaka</I> [musical octave]? In what measure would it produce major and minor notes? Things sound very different under ordinary conditions and <I>ekava&#x301;da</I> conditions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Every evening, after we had been practising for a little while, we seemed to be hearing someone playing an unknown <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii</I> [musical tunes<U>]</U> on an unknown instrument coming from the distant hills. Both of us would listen for some time. We couldn&#146;t see anyone. Sometimes we would think that we were hearing the echoes of our esraj but after a few moments we would realize our mistake because how could the echoes of the esraj last so long? And moreover what we were playing was not the <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii</I> we were hearing in the echo. But there was no instrumentalist, no instrument that we could see anywhere. After spending some time in that astonishing environment, we would again come down from the hills. When we would get down to the plain at the bottom, that music would disappear over the horizon.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->On this particular day it had gotten quite late. Why Prasenjit hadn&#146;t come I didn&#146;t know. Normally he would come first and I would come later.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->I was sitting there alone when that intoxicating melody, that rapturous sound, came floating over the forest of <I>sha&#x301;l</I> [<I>Shorea robusta</I>] <I></I>and <I>pala&#x301;sh</I> [<I>Butea</I> <I>monosperma</I>] trees. I thought to myself: As long as Prasenjit is not here, nor his esraj, why don&#146;t I go on ahead a bit and look for that unknown, unfamiliar instrumentalist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->I started climbing. The moon had come out and everything was clearly visible. After the hill where I was there was a huge, uneven plateau filled with pebbles and broken stones and a catechu jungle. A few jackals sitting under a plum tree eating plums fled when they saw me coming. A little further on I saw three or four hyenas (<I>goba&#x301;gha&#x301;</I>, <I>ha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;ol</I>, <I>taraks&#x301;u</I>) sitting quietly; when they saw me they first tried to guess whether I was their friend or foe. After they saw that I wasn&#146;t moving in their direction they continued sitting where they were. A <I>ba&#x301;rshiun&#x32D;ga</I> deer appeared, running swiftly from north to south; perhaps a tiger had been chasing him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->I went ahead, on and on and on. The melody came in waves, sometimes clear and sometimes faint, sometimes close and sometimes far, very far. A little farther on I came to a small <I>piya&#x301;sha&#x301;l</I> (<I>piya&#x301;l</I> &ndash; a kind of <I>sha&#x301;l</I>) jungle; the <I>sha&#x301;l</I> flowers were then in blossom, full of intoxicating nectar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The music grew even clearer. Everything was glittering in the moonlight. I went ahead. The sound now seemed to be quite near. I came to a <I>pala&#x301;sh</I> jungle and started reciting a poem to myself:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><I>Kim&#x301;shuk bane a&#x301;ji nirjane ke tumi viin&#x301;a&#x301; ba&#x301;ja&#x301;o<br>Dekha&#x301; da&#x301;o more dekha&#x301; da&#x301;o.<br>Am&#x301;shuk-sama ujjval mane ma&#x301;dhurii char&#x301;iye ja&#x301;o.<br>Ca&#x301;ona&#x301; to tumi kichu kakhano, hayto neiko prayojan kono<br>Bha&#x301;ver atiite vijane nibhrte e kii va&#x301;n&#x301;ii shon&#x301;a&#x301;o<br>A&#x301;ma&#x301;r maner rikta nilaye, dhara&#x301; deve ki na&#x301;-bale, na&#x301;-kaye<br>Jyotsna&#x301;-sna&#x301;ta praya&#x301;ta prados&#x301;e asiimer ga&#x301;n ga&#x301;o.</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The blooming flowers of the <I>pala&#x301;sh</I> trees looked as if they were lit with fire. In the middle of the jungle, in a place where the trees were sparser, I saw a young man about my age, nineteen or twenty, seated on a mound. His body was like a motion picture, a play of light and shadow. His face was bright and he was wearing an ornament in his ear and glittering bangles around his wrists. In his hands was a stringed instrument and he was playing according to his inspiration. When I approached he stopped playing, stood up and said to me in Sanskrit: &ldquo;I&#146;ve been waiting for you &ndash; for ma-a-a-ny days now.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes, I&#146;ve often heard you play,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;What is that instrument you have?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;It&#146;s an ancient <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;</I>, <I>viin&#x301;</I> in the spoken language. Seven or seven and a half thousand years ago this was the only musical instrument in the world. When Shiva first started his musical sadhana then he had to do it with this <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;</I>. Can you tell me how long ago that was?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That was 7500 years ago,&rdquo; I replied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes, I also guess it to be the same. I&#146;ve been playing this <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;</I> for the last 7500 years. For a long time I&#146;ve had the desire to play once for you. This <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;</I> is a quite simple stringed instrument. You must have heard its harmonies.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I replied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Over time,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;this <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;</I> changed into different kinds of <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;s</I> and <I>viin&#x301;s</I>, the sitar, esraj, <I>tamboura</I>, violin and so many others. Some of them had frets and others not. Just think of it! Shiva had to make practically superhuman efforts with this primitive <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;</I>. He had to invent the scale. He had to string his instrument very carefully to get the proper sound. It was Shiva who made the <I>ra&#x301;gas</I> and <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;iis</I>. He introduced soul-stirring modulation into them. He felt the need for musical metre &ndash; without metre and tempo there could be no song. To maintain the rhythm he invented the horn and the <I>d&#x301;ambaru</I> [a small drum shaped like an hourglass]. In the post-Shiva, Vedic era this tabor and horn took the form of the <I>mrdaun&#x32D;ga</I>. That was during the end of the Yajurvedic <I></I>era and the beginning of the Atharvavedic <I></I>era. From the original <I>mrdaun&#x32D;ga</I> developed in later times the Benares <I>mrdaun&#x32D;ga</I> and the Bengal <I>mrdaun&#x32D;ga</I> or <I>khola</I> (the <I>Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas</I> also sometimes call it <I>shriikhola</I>). The <I>mrdaun&#x32D;ga</I> and <I>khola</I>, however, are not identical, so their sound is also not the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Our tabla is a metamorphosed form of this <I>mrdaun&#x32D;ga</I>. Some people believe that the tabla came from Persia but this is not the case; the tabla originated in this country. From Persia we have gotten the sitar and the <I>gazal</I>, from Turkey, <I>ha&#x301;va&#x301;-gazal</I>. Although the <I>viin&#x301;</I> originated in this country and has been here since the time of Shiva, we have gotten its descendant, the violin, from Italy. This <I>viin&#x301;</I> that I am holding fell out of use nearly six thousand years ago. I was thinking that I should play it for you, so I&#146;ve been sitting here, day after day, night after night, playing it. I haven&#146;t slept but neither my body nor my mind has become tired. I am a sound wave, the musical modulation in the minds of human beings.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I wasn&#146;t able to hear the entire melody of the piece you were playing,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If it&#146;s okay with you would you play once more?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why just once? I&#146;ll play a hundred times! The only reason I came to this <I>sha&#x301;l-pala&#x301;sh</I> forest was to play for you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->He started to play. His fingers were remarkable, the way they danced over the strings. After he stopped I asked: &ldquo;Was that the very ancient <I>sindhubhaeravii</I> that has disappeared?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You are quite correct. That was <I>sindhubhaeravii</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Now I must go.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Okay. I&#146;ll accompany you to the edge of the mountains.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->I started heading back with that extraordinary genius by my side. After a little way I stopped and asked: &ldquo;Those luminous bodies<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> who used to cultivate music were called <I>gandharva</I>. Those who used to cultivate various things in subtler spheres were called <I>vidya&#x301;dhara</I> and those who were skilled in dressing or enamoured of beauty were called <I>kinnara</I>. Which of the three are you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->He kept quiet. The luminous face of his luminous body glittered even brighter as he smiled and remained silent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->I kept on walking with him alongside me, that original <I>viin&#x301;</I> still in his hands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The world of music today is like a person without a proper guru or proper training. People want to show they can play without having paid their dues. They are selling themselves for gold without realizing that the real value of music is being lost thereby. Gold is becoming even cheaper than glass. Whenever a <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii</I> is a little difficult they only show that they can play the notes without going deep into the music. There is no way of doing this with <I>sindhubhaeravii</I>, the same with <I>mu&#x301;lta&#x301;nii</I> <I>vasanta</I> (not <I>vasantaba&#x301;ha&#x301;r</I>), so you no longer hear either one of them.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I don&#146;t hear anyone play <I>sindhubhaeravii,</I> nor <I>mu&#x301;lta&#x301;ni vasanta</I> any longer. I have heard one or two pieces going by the name of <I>sindhubhaeravii.</I> One or two songs also. But judging by the scale I could see that they were not <I>sindhubhaeravii</I>. They were different local styles of <I>darva&#x301;rii</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Right you are, quite right. That&#146;s just what I wanted to say. You must have noticed that in <I>sindhubhaeravii</I> one must pay special attention to ascending and descending in the scale. Since such profound attention makes it difficult to articulate the notes, singers nowadays don&#146;t want to take the risk.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;It would be great if you would compose a song in pure <I>sindhubhaeravii</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If I have sufficient time and capacity then I will try but I cannot give my word on it; I love music, you see, but I am not well-versed in it. Now, you didn&#146;t tell me whether you were a <I>ghandarva</I>, <I>vidya&#x301;dhara</I> or <I>kinnara</I>, but I can tell that you are one of them because you have a light-body.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->He smiled even more and said: &ldquo;I am none of these three.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Where do you live? Do you live in this <I>pala&#x301;sh</I> forest?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I don&#146;t live in the forest, I live in the mind. I&#146;ve been living in your mind for these past seven thousand years.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->We reached the end of the mountains. I looked at him and suddenly saw his body slowly begin to dissolve into the moonlight; as it did I heard the sound of music floating over the top of the <I>pala&#x301;sh</I> forest. This time it wasn&#146;t <I>sindhubhaeravii</I>; it was <I>meghamalla&#x301;ra</I>. From the northeast I noticed a wisp of cloud in the sky.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The next evening I went back to the hill and heard again the same sound wave floating to my ears. Prasenjit hadn&#146;t shown up the day before; who knows why, but again today he hadn&#146;t come. The reason for it I couldn&#146;t fathom. He was not like that. Whenever he couldn&#146;t come for some reason he would inform me the day before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Suddenly I saw Prasenjit rapidly approaching, esraj in hand. I said in a half-laughing, half-annoyed tone of voice: &ldquo;What&#146;s the matter? Yesterday you didn&#146;t come and today also you are late. This isn&#146;t like you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You really upset me yesterday,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I thought perhaps that you might drop by our house today knowing how much you upset me, so I waited for you for some time before starting off. That&#146;s why I&#146;m late today.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What did I do to upset you yesterday? Can you give me the details?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Is it a laughing matter to cause pain to another person?&rdquo; he replied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Then I&#146;ll say it in all seriousness. What did I do to upset you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;First you showed up just when I was leaving with the esraj to come here.

What objection did you have to taking a snack at my house?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->I was astonished. I kept quiet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why aren&#146;t you saying anything?&rdquo; he asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Say what you have to say,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;List your complaints.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You came into my house,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but you wouldn&#146;t sit down anywhere, neither on the cot, nor on a chair, nor even on a mat. Is that proper, I ask you, to remain standing like that when you visit someone&#146;s home.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->I kept quiet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;So you still have nothing to say? No answer at all. What&#146;s going on with you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Again, I held fast to my silence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You picked up the esraj and started playing a strange <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii</I>. I asked you its name many times but you wouldn&#146;t answer. If you had told me while you were playing perhaps I could have picked it up. But you told me much later, after I could no longer remember what I had heard.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Do you remember what name I told you,&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Certainly I remember,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You told me its name was <I>sindhubhaeravii</I>, and that it was a 7000 year old <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii</I> which has been lost nowadays. There were also some Sanskrit songs composed at one time in this <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii</I> but these songs have also been lost. You said that one must pay special attention to ascending and descending in the scale in <I>sindhubhaeravii</I> and that most singers are not prepared to take such a risk; for that reason the real <I>sindhubhaeravii</I> has disappeared. It has mixed with the moonlight and fled into the unknown.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;And what else made you get upset?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The way you left so suddenly; it seemed to me as if you too had gotten lost in the moonlight.

And then a steady rain started falling.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
