<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>7) Question</b>: Is there any difference of sex in protoplasms, as there is in the case of developed plants and animals?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  In the case of unicellular and multicellular protozoa, the entity is divided by self-dividing processes &ndash; by an inner fissiparous tendency &ndash; so the question of sex difference does not arise as in the case of animals or plants. But there are sex differences in the case of metazoic cells. The human body is the most complex multicellular metazoic structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The male structure differs from the female structure in that the number of microvita in the male structure is more than  in the female structure. The sex difference is due to the number of microvita. Suppose in the male protoplasm the number of microvita is ten billion, then in the female protozoa there are five billion. Not only the number, but also the varieties of microvita in the male and female structures differ. The male body can tolerate the application of positive or negative microvita after the formation of semen starts. In a boy above fifteen years of age, the formation of semen has started. (In hot countries this usually occurs at thirteen to fifteen years and a little later in cold countries.) As soon as semen has formed, the number of microvita is also increased in the male body. A female body or a male child in whom semen formation has not yet started, cannot tolerate the application of positive or negative microvita. But in the case of the male body, as the testes glands are functioning, the application of microvita will not do any harm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Yet females or children will also enjoy divine bliss if they satisfy Parama Purus&#x301;a. Only by His grace, by the grace of the supreme, can one attain divine bliss by satisfying Him.  In anything and everything human might, human power and human brain are extremely limited. Everyone depends on Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the past there was no mass imposition of positive microvita. For the first time the collective application of the positive microvita is being done to elevate the spiritual standard of the general mass.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><b>8) Question</b>: What causes an unpleasant odour in the body?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Due to the accumulation of dead protoplasmic cells, a bad smell arises in the body.  The reason for this is not taking a proper bath and washing away the dead cells.  In certain animals and plants, due to the secretion of smelly hormones, an unpleasant odour is emitted from the body.  Everyone should take a bath at regular intervals to clean the body and eat vegetarian food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><b>9) Question</b>: Can you say whether micropsychic movement in individual life or in collective life, in animate or inanimate objects, is of unilateral order or of multilateral order too?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  Everything in this world, whether animate or inanimate, moves. Everywhere movement is from imperfection towards perfection, but in circum-rotarian style. Not only microcosms but ectoplasms or microvita also move from imperfection towards perfection in circumferential style. Those microvita, or say the collective form of microvita, with the coverage of endoplasm, move in the same style.  Each and every microvitum moves according to propensive propulsion wrought by the Macrocosm.  Impact and tactuality both come from the Macrocosm.  As the microcosm is the unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, it cannot move in so many directions, but it appears to move in many directions.  Because movement is always from imperfection to perfection in circumferential style in the unit body, although the movement is in so many directions in the case of the unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; or microcosm, the movement is always unilateral, not unilineal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>10) Question</b>:  What is the relationship between the collective body of ectoplasm and microcosm, and the relationship between endoplasm and microcosm? Is there an inter-ectoplasmic gap that links up the unit mind with something external?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  So many microcosms, so many microvita, are there.  They have not got clear &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling.  Their existence is more of physical nature than of psychic nature.  The collective body of microvita is another name of carbon atom.  Carbon atom is another name of so many microvita with so many specialities, with so many characteristics.  The collective body of microvita is the collective &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling maintaining a relationship with the physical body.  There is no such relationship in the case of a dead physical structure.  The relationship is inert.  In animate and inanimate objects there is the intra-atomic gap; there is the intra-microvitum gap, inter-carbonic gap and so on, but these gaps are not vacua. They are filled with macropsychic conation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The collective body of microvita is carbon atom, and when carbon atoms are in cohesion with other carbonic atoms, &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is created.  As coverage of these collective bodies there is endoplasm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In animate objects there are intra-protoplasmic and inter- protoplasmic gaps.  These gaps are also not vacua; they are also filled with macropsychic conation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So far as a microcosm is concerned, it is composed of ectoplasm but the movement of ectoplasm is decided by the movement of microvita. They move in circum-rotarian style wrought by Macrocosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><b>11) Question</b>:  What is the structural formula of microvita?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Previously, people were under the impression that molecules were the minutest particles of elements.  Later it was found that atoms, not molecules, were the minutest entities.  Still later it was discovered that even an atom is not the minutest particle, for atoms are made of electrons, protons and many other imaginary and non-imaginary particles.  So, neither atoms nor molecules are the minutest particles of elements because they are composed of many other particles of the expressed world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->People are under the impression that something called a &ldquo;virus&rdquo; is the minutest living being.  But virus is a vague term; there is in fact nothing like a virus &ndash; thus the question of it being a living being does not arise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Microvitum is the minutest entity.  The collection of microvita forms a carbon atom.  As a microvitum is the minutest entity, it cannot have a structure like that of an atom or a solar system.  As a microvitum is a singular entity, it has no structure. By nature it is more energy than matter, so it travels and moves through inferences, whereas other entities cannot move through inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><b>12) Question</b>:  What is the difference between positive microvitum and negative microvitum?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Positive microvitum is pro-ectoplasmic &ndash;  it is more ectoplasmic than matter. Negative microvitum is pro-materialistic &ndash; it is more matter than mind, than ectoplasm.  Positive microvitum, being more of ectoplasmic nature, starts functioning or working first in the mental level then filters down towards physical matter.  Negative microvitum starts functioning in matter and moves towards the mind, towards ectoplasmic stuff and endoplasmic coverage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><b>13) Question</b>: What are the possible physiological effects of the application of positive or negative microvita?  How and why do they take place?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  If a large quantity of positive or negative microvita enter a person, there may be instantaneous or gradual death. If the body is not properly developed, as in the case of boys below 16 years of age, or in the case of women whose minds are very sentimental, the application of positive or negative microvita may bring about instantaneous death. To receive positive microvita, the body should not be carnivorous; it must be vegetarian.  Non-vegetarians are not fit to receive the application of positive microvita.  Positive or negative microvita can affect the protoplasmic cells of a structure directly, and even bring about a change in the genetic structure. Even the sex of a person can change due to the application of positive or negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The glands and sub-glands also are directly affected by negative or positive microvita, which in this way influence the hormone secretions as well as the nerve cells or nerve fibres.  One may gain or lose memory or gain or lose strength as a result of positive or negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><b>14) Question</b>:  What are the possible psychological effects of the application of positive or negative microvita, and how and why do they take place?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: The psychological impact of microvita occurs due to their influence on the plexii, and through the plexii all the three types of vrttis (propensities of the mind) are affected &ndash; pro-physical propensities, psychic propensities and pro-spiritual propensities. All the fifty vrttis are affected by positive or negative microvita. The positive microvita, being pro-ectoplasmic, can move both towards the subtler existence of the human spirit and also towards the cruder manifestations of human existence, but negative microvita, being pro-matter, can move only downwards.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Negative microvita can function directly at the physico-psychic plexus (at the Vishuddha Cakra) but they cannot move upwards to the occult plexus (at the Guru Cakra). Only with the application of force by a powerful personality, can they be raised to the lunar plexus (at the A&#x301;jin&#x32D;a Cakra).  This raising of negative microvita above the physico-psychic plexus is called &ldquo;rusti&rdquo; or &ldquo;risti&rdquo;.  The application of negative microvita on the human mind deranges the mind and causes many psychic ailments such as eccentricity, schizophrenia, mania, melancholia, etc. In the case of positive microvita, the reaction takes place after they cross the lunar plexus, both in female and male bodies.  Only positive microvita can touch the lunar plexus and be elevated up to the occult plexus. They start their journey in the lunar plexus, and as they move upwards they increase their speed and bring about acceleration in spiritual progress, both in the case of males and females. (Positive microvita may also be used for intellectual development and for imparting certain occult powers.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The lunar plexus is the highest point of positive microvita, but if they are raised upwards to the occult plexus, this is called &ldquo;krpa&#x301;&rdquo; (grace).  And raising positive microvita from the lunar plexus to the pinnacled point of human glory is called &ldquo;karun&#x301;a&#x301;&rdquo;. Without krpa&#x301; there cannot be karun&#x301;a&#x301;; there cannot be any galloping jump. You should always try to avoid rusti, the raising of negative microvita, and always try to receive the glamour of krpa&#x301; or karun&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph --><b>15) Question</b>:  What will happen to microvita at the boiling point, and at freezing temperatures?  Will they die?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: No, they will undergo contraction and hibernation at freezing temperature and expansion and hibernation at boiling temperature.  Negative microvita will die a natural death after their natural life span.  In order to kill negative microvita before the end of their life span, the number of positive microvita has to be increased by good thinking and sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (spiritual practice).  Only by increasing the number of positive microvita is the unnatural death of negative microvita possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->If under extreme conditions of temperature microvita died, then some of the diseases now prevalent would have ceased to exist, but this has not happened. Rather, diseases have become more complicated &ndash; malaria has become malignant malaria.  During the First World War the decaying bodies of dead soldiers attracted negative microvita from other stars and thus the influenza disease originated.  Even now influenza is fatal to human beings in cold countries.  Influenza has a natural duration of four days whether medicine is taken or not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->When negative microvita devour the positive microvita of a diseased person, then that person dies.  Medicines only reduce the pain caused by disease in different parts of the body, and so it is not proper to say that medicine cures a disease. The disease can be cured only when the numbers of positive microvita are increased, and they devour the negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->There are certain person who can cure diseases merely by touch. The science behind this is also the application of positive microvita. And the cause of the decomposition of anything over time is negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->When a person is attacked by negative microvita and certain symptoms are observed, it is called &ldquo;prognosis&rdquo;, and when the symptoms develop in the final stage of the disease, it is called &ldquo;diagnosis&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
