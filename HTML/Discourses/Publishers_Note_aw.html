<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Citation"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ndash;Equal Rights for Men and Women<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Throughout his life, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar was deeply concerned about the conditions of women in society. He supported the emancipation of women from the stranglehold of dogmas and ignorance. He recalls, in the story of Reba, an incident from his youth. After Reba gave her blunt rebuff to a matchmaking &ldquo;selection board&rdquo;, the author later meets the disappointed suitor in the marketplace. Supporting Reba&#146;s attitude, the author told the young man, &ldquo;Times are changing. People&#146;s psychology is changing. Many fixed ideas of the past are disappearing. Don&#146;t you realize these things?&rdquo; (&ldquo;Hello Reba, Goodbye Bhundibala!&rdquo;) As the founder and president of Ananda Marga he established the foundations for a society that treats men and women with equal dignity and responsibility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The women&#146;s struggle for rights has a long history. The last three decades, especially, have brought these issues to the forefront of social consciousness. All over the world women are awakening. No longer are they willing to remain silent in the face of oppression. They are finding their voices and the strength to fight. Men, too, are realizing the importance of women&#146;s long-overdue awakening if society is to progress to its next evolutionary phase.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In many parts of the world, women are still under the yoke of exploitation. They have been rendered helpless by hundreds of years of imposed ignorance, superstition and inferiority complexes. The opportunists who have taken advantage of women fail to realize that by paralysing women&#146;s minds, the whole society becomes crippled.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, for society to move forward, women must regain their self-confidence and take their rightful place in society. Men also must take an active role in this process.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The author said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->We [society] are not as developed as we should be. Why? One of the reasons is that we have kept women confined within the walls of their homes, resulting in the progress of only fifty percent of the population &ndash; the males. And as only the men are progressing, they will have to carry the load of fifty percent of the population. Thus the speed of progress is reduced. Ideally, women should also move with their own strength and with the same speed as their male counterparts. In the process of movement, if they feel pain in their legs, if they fall on their faces, they should be physically lifted up. The fact is that we must move together in unison with all. (from &ldquo;The Importance of Society&rdquo; in &ldquo;Two Wings&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Throughout his life, the author was adamant that the dignity and rightful status of women must be re-established in both collective and individual life. A true human society can only be created when all its members, male and female, young and old, black and white, have equal opportunity to express all their potentialities in the mundane, psychic and spiritual spheres. In 1956 the author first outlined the steps necessary in order for the emancipation of women to take place in the social sphere. (See &ldquo;The Emancipation of Women&rdquo;.) Simply put, there are two points: first, women must become educated; secondly, women must become economically self-reliant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Through education, women will become free from the superstitions and dogmas that have been imposed on them. They will learn how to take care of their bodies, of their minds. They will learn the hidden history of women&#146;s contribution to society. They will gain not only intellectual wealth, but the necessary self-confidence to employ that wealth for the benefit of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When women gain economic independence from men, they will also win back respect. Dowry and other social ills will die natural deaths. As women gain economic self-reliance, they will gain a voice in the household as well as in the society-at-large. Men will not be able to impose their whims on women who are no longer economically chained to them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Social, religious and educational dogmas that oppress women will go the way of slavery and sati. Women will find new opportunities for self-development, and in return be able to employ their special qualities for the benefit of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Just as men possess certain outstanding qualities, womankind, too, has certain special assets:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The number of cells in a female body is a little smaller than the number in a male body. Again, from the viewpoint of sentimentality, the number of nerve cells in a woman&#146;s body is a little greater than that in a man&#146;s. That is why in areas needing intelligence, knowledge and rationality men progress rapidly, and in areas where success depends on sentimentality, women progress very swiftly. Through the dispensation of God, men&#146;s deficiency is balanced by women&#146;s sentimentality, and women&#146;s deficiency is balanced by men&#146;s resoluteness and subtle propensive propulsion. And this is why in the sphere of education, both men and women must be afforded equal opportunities. Otherwise society will become crippled, and its all-round well-being cannot be achieved. (from &ldquo;Under the Shelter of the Guru&rdquo; in &ldquo;Sentimentality and the Psycho-Spiritual Realm&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->When Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar expounded his Neohumanist philosophy, he explained that the highest sentiment of all is the devotional sentiment:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now, what is the role of devotional sentiment, the most valuable treasure of humanity? It is to transform the sense of worldly existence into the supreme spiritual stance. (&ldquo;Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism&rdquo;, Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->And those who possess the inner asset of devotion within their hearts and follow the path of rationality in dealing with the external world, must be victorious. They alone can accomplish worthy deeds in this world. (&ldquo;Geo-Sentiment&rdquo;, Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Both men and women are children of Parama Purus&#x301;a. They are like His two hands. He has given intelligence, strength and stamina to all. Men and women must work together in coordinated cooperation to achieve a glorious human society. Inevitably, the society must move along the path of progress. Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar has called on women to take up the challenge of self-enlightenment and social emacipation. As women become free from all social bondages, they will progress towards a great ideology and usher in a brilliant future.<!-- /block --></p>
<p class="plain"><center>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</center></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Some of the author&#146;s most profound observations regarding women came during the course of discussions of other subjects. For this reason, the book is in excerpt format. The book has been organized into several parts. The first part is Women and Society. The first section, A Historical Perspective, gives the historical perspective from prehistoric matriarchy, to the transformation of society into patriarchy and the gradual decline of the status of women. Within this section are several discourses on the development of casteism in India, especially in Bengal, and its effect on the status of women.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Social Injustices Today is concerned with the social injustices that presently afflict society. Reclaiming Dignity looks towards the future, and discusses how women shall regain their dignity and their rightful place in society. Included here is the discourse &ldquo;Social Order and Superiority and Inferiority Complexes&rdquo;. Although it does not directly refer to women, the translators felt that its subject matter bears directly on the problems women face in reclaiming their dignity in society; so it has been included. A chapter has been included on the various guidelines of Ananda Marga, the socio-spiritual organization founded by the author. It demonstrates his practical outlook for the establishment of women&#146;s dignity in society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The second part is Women and Spirituality. In the section Spiritual Birthright, the author denounces the religious dogmas that have been created to keep women suppressed. The subject of goddesses is of great interest to many women, so some excerpts for Goddess Worship in India have been included. Indirectly, (that is, through quoting spiritual poetry) the author clearly recognizes that some devotees worship Supreme Consciousness through the vehicle of the Divine Mother:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The only way to attain salvation is through self-knowledge, and for this one requires pure conduct in the external world, pure thought in the mental world, and whole-hearted surrender to the Supreme Entity &ndash; the shelter of all, the one who is hidden in each and every entity &ndash; as the polestar of one&#146;s life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The Mother who is adorning this universe with so many jewels &ndash;<br>Do you want to adorn that Mother with a dress of tinsel?<br>The Mother who is feeding the world with so much food &ndash;<br>Do you want to feed that Mother with sun-dried rice and soaked gram?<br>I will remove all distinctions, all my mental anguish.<br>O Ma&#x301;! all the Vedas are true &ndash; my goddess Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is formless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Here [in the poem] the words Ma&#x301; and Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; refer to Brahma. (Namah Shiva&#x301;ya Sha&#x301;nta&#x301;ya, Discourse 16)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Or again:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->This entire creation is the child of the Divine Mother &ndash; all are equal for Her;<br>Can you please this Mother by sacrificing goats?<br>Prasa&#x301;d [the poet] says you can worship Her only with devotion;<br>How can you worship Her with external pomp and show?<br>Mother will not accept such a bribe from anyone.<br>Oh mind, you could not remove this error &ndash;<br>You never really understood Ka&#x301;lii at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->One can easily understand that here [in the poem] the Divine Mother, Ka&#x301;lii, refers to Parama Purus&#x301;a, to Parama Brahma. (Namah Shiva&#x301;ya Sha&#x301;nta&#x301;ya, Discourse 14)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The section, Women and Bio-Psychology offers the meeting point of biology, psychology and spirituality. The author has said, as mentioned above, that women have a special asset in their sentimental quality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The chapter on &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&#146;s Devotion&rdquo;, in The Feminine Aspect of Spirituality conveys much to us about spiritual devotion from the feminine perspective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In Further Reading we find a bouquet of sections. Keeping the Body Fit is about the physical aspects of women&#146;s development. Birth control, the population explosion and genetic engineering are major public issues today; so a chapter has been included in which the author gives his views on those subjects. The next section is Remarkable Women of social and spiritual history. As the references to Yoginii Pa&#x301;rvatii throughout the author&#146;s discussions of Tantra were very numerous, only a few passages have been chosen to reflect something of her contribution to spirituality and society. In Short Stories the author uses anecdotes and stories to expose the vagaries of human nature and social dogma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Of the 5018 Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita songs composed by the author, seventeen have been included in Songs of the New Dawn in which there is a definite feminine outlook. This selection is only a sampling of this category of the author&#146;s songs, not a complete collection. Limited space does not permit us to publish more at this time. In these selections the sweet language of Bengali poetry evokes the feelings and situations peculiar to the woman&#146;s experience, and transforms them into a mystic experience.<!-- /block --></p>
