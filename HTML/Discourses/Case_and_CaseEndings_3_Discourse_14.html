<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The spoken Bengali of Midnapore is quite an old form of Bengali. Midnapore&#146;s place in the cultural life of Bengal is also quite important. The people of Midnapore have never lost their vitality of life, even when passing their days enduring countless insults. Indeed, in the pre-Pathan era, the Pathan and Mughal eras, and even in the beginning of British rule, which was witness to the Chuyar Rebellion [cuya&#x301;r&#x301; vidroha], we have seen great agitation for freedom there; later, in 1942, there was an earth-shaking, stirring agitation. I can see today that many of you have come here from Midnapore. The spoken language of the western part of Midnapore, which means Jhar&#x301;gra&#x301;m subdivision, is a dialect of central Rarhi Bengali. This same dialect is prevalent in Mayurbhainj and Singhbhum. The spoken language of the southern coastal areas of Midnapore, from the mouth of the Rasulpur River to the mouth of the Suvarnarekha River, I have named Contai Bengali. The full pronunciation of the consonants is present in great measure in this dialect. Based on the evidence, it is easy to arrive at the conclusion that the poet Kalidasa was from this area.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, the northern part of our well-known land of Rarh, which we generally call north Rarh, was known in olden times as Varddhama&#x301;n Bhukti. Roughly speaking, north Rarh consisted of modern-day Birbhum, Dumka, Dhanbad, western Murshidabad, Burdwan and Hooghly. Southern Rarh, or Dan&#x301;d&#x301;a Bhukti, consisted of certain parts of Hooghly, certain parts of Burdwan, Howrah, Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia, Singhbhum, Baleshwar and certain parts of Mayurbhainj District. This Dan&#x301;d&#x301;a Bhukti was invaded several times during the reign of the Kesharii kings of Orissa (Anantakesharii, Yayatikesharii). During the Maratha invasions, when part of Orissa&#146;s revenue had to be given to the Marathas, the then nawab, Alivarddi Khan, placed certain parts of Midnapore, along with 24 Paraganas, Chittagong and Burdwan, partially in the hands of the British. Dan&#x301;d&#x301;a Bhukti was known as Hijlii during the Pathan and the beginning of the Mughal eras. When what we call ka&#x301;juba&#x301;da&#x301;m [cashew nut] was brought to this country by the Portuguese, it was first cultivated in Hijlii. Thus the actual Bengali name for cashew nut is hijlii ba&#x301;da&#x301;m. This nut was also cultivated extensively in Kerala. When the farmers of that region wanted cash value in exchange for their nuts they used to pronounce it as &ldquo;cashu&rdquo;. Consequently the name hijlii ba&#x301;da&#x301;m later became &ldquo;cashew nut&rdquo;. A certain ga&#x301;jii from a region in Turkey by the name of Soharward arrived in Hijlii to preach his religion.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> He wanted to convert Hijlii into an ideological centre for his religion, thus he gave it the name Madina&#x301;pur. When Nawab Alivarddi Khan turned over this Madina&#x301;pur to the British they christened it &ldquo;Midnapore&rdquo;. Rather than using either name, Midnapore or Madina&#x301;pur, the local people call it Mediniipur. Near the end of British rule Bengal&#146;s first minister (at that time he was not called chief minister) was Mr. H. S. Soharwardi, a descendant of the ga&#x301;jii who came from Soharward. This Midnapore is an ideological centre for various reasons.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The next subject of discussion is the ablative case [apa&#x301;da&#x301;na ka&#x301;raka]. The word apa&#x301;da&#x301;na s derived apa &ndash; a&#x301; &ndash; da&#x301; + anat&#x301;. It means &ldquo;to take something from something else&rdquo;. In Bengali the indeclinables hate [from], theke, t&#x301;heine (t&#x301;ha&#x301;ni-e), and so on, are used for this. Similarly in Hindi the indeclinable se is used, in Oriya ru, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is said that the ablative is the fifth case. The root word of the word pain&#x32D;camii [fifth] is panc. It is a Vedic word which means &ldquo;hand-work&rdquo;. Whatever may be the work done by the hand &ndash; whether patting someone on the back or making rice-cakes &ndash; it all comes within the scope of panc. In later times the word shilpana came to be used in Sanskrit for work done by hand. Thus one who did work by hand, or shilpana kriya&#x301;, is a shilpii. Nowadays the word shilpii is used all over. For example, one who sings is called kan&#x301;t&#x301;hashilpii [vocal artist]. Now we can call someone skilled in handiwork a shilpii, for example, vayanashilpii [knitter], tantushilpii [weaver], and so on. But how is it that one who is skilled in vocal work can be called shilpii? On the one hand, the word yantrashilpii [instrumentalist] can be used. The word shilpii can work for someone who plays a sitar. But the word kan&#x301;t&#x301;hashilpii is not correct. The word kan&#x301;t&#x301;hashilpii is an oxymoron like &ldquo;gold stone-dish&rdquo;. A dish can be gold or a dish can be stone but it cannot be both. Similarly, one who sings is a ga&#x301;yaka [singer], not a shilpii. Those who sing are called ga&#x301;yaka if they are male and ga&#x301;yakii if they are female. Many people call lady singers ga&#x301;yika&#x301; but this is incorrect; the proper word is ga&#x301;yakii because gae + n&#x301;aka = ga&#x301;yaka. By adding the feminine suffix uniip we get ga&#x301;yakii. I would like to add here that as with ga&#x301;yika&#x301;, the word sevika&#x301; is incorrect. Nevertheless the feminine form sevika&#x301; of the word sevaka is extremely common. Its correct form is sevaka&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now the question is: why is in&#x32D;a used to spell pain&#x32D;ca instead of na or m&#x301;? The rule for both Sanskrit and Vedic is that if the original word or original verbal root is spelled with the apada&#x301;nta na or ma then the corresponding word takes the fifth letter of that varga. For example, the original verbal root panc is pronounced with apada&#x301;nta na and since ca is added to it then it is spelt with the fifth letter of the ca varga, or in&#x32D;a. The word saun&#x32D;ga comes from the verbal root sanj in accordance with the very same rule. Here the na is not pada&#x301;nta, it is not at the end of the word. Since the ja is replaced by ga then the concerned varga&#146;s fifth letter is used, that is, un&#x32D;a instead of na. For this reason it is spelled un&#x32D;ga. Similarly the word rain&#x32D;jana comes from the verbal root ran&#x301;j. The n&#x301;a in ran&#x301;j is apada&#x301;nta, so instead of n&#x301;a or m&#x301; the fifth letter ina is used. Similarly, gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; is spelled with unga. The word gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; is derived gam + gam + d&#x301;a + feminine a&#x301;. Gam means &ldquo;towards ga&rdquo; and ga here means &ldquo;an extensive land&rdquo;. Gam + d&#x301;a + feminine a&#x301; = ga&#x301;, that is, &ldquo;a woman who so goes&rdquo;. Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; means &ldquo;that river which flows through an extensive land&rdquo; &ndash; from Gangotri towards Gangasagar. Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; is spelled with pada&#x301;nta ma, thus should it not have an anusva&#x301;r? No, it does not because even though the m (with hasanta) of the first gam is pada&#x301;nta, it is not by itself a word or a verbal root. It is the singular second case of the word ga. After the second gam is joined to the first the ma is dropped so it does not come under consideration. Hence gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; is definitely spelled with the fifth letter of the ga varga, that is, unga. However in the spelling of sampa&#x301;dak, shaun&#x32D;kar, and so on, either the fifth letter ma, or una, or the anusva&#x301;ra can be used, that is, either sampa&#x301;dak or sam&#x301;pa&#x301;dak, shaun&#x32D;kar or sham&#x301;kar. Nowadays we see a tendency to spell gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; with the anusva&#x301;ra instead of una, but this is incorrect. In some languages they go so far as to spell the word vasanta as vasam&#x301;ta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->As I was saying, the original Vedic word panc means &ldquo;work done by hand&rdquo;. Now the hand has five fingers, thus the meaning of panc became &ldquo;five&rdquo;. The Vedic panc became painj in Farsi; it also means &ldquo;five&rdquo;. That which is formed out of five a&#x301;b, or five streams of water, is pain&#x32D;ja&#x301;b. An impress of five fingers is called pain&#x32D;ja&#x301; in Farsi. Fighting with the wrist and the help of five fingers is called pain&#x32D;ja&#x301; kas&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The rule that the ablative case is the fifth case is followed closely in Sanskrit. The ablative case uses the fifth case-ending to indicate that something is taken from a specific source. For example, nara&#x301;t [from man], Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;t [from Rama], and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the fifth case has its own separate form but this is not true in Bengali or in any other Indian language. In most cases the fifth case is formed by adding ablative-indicating indeclinables, such as theke, ceye, hate, etc. after the sixth case-ending, for example, Ra&#x301;mer theke [from Ram]. In Hindi the indeclinable se is added to form the fifth case, for example, Ramse. In such an instance there is no need for the sixth case-ending. In English the preposition &ldquo;from&rdquo; is used for this purpose. In old English &ldquo;unto&rdquo; was also used. In the old English of twelve hundred years ago &ldquo;unto&rdquo; had three common uses corresponding to &ldquo;towards&rdquo;, &ldquo;to&rdquo;, and &ldquo;from&rdquo;. In modern English &ldquo;unto&rdquo; is practically not used at all, however in the Bible it is used to mean &ldquo;to&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In old Bengali, from fifteen hundred years ago to about six hundred years ago, the word hante was used, meaning hate [from]. The word hante appears in the Sris&#x301;t&#x301;irahasya, written by Saeyad Mohamad Alawal, the court poet of the king of Arakan. The language of the people of Arakan was Magii, a Burmese language. Bear in mind here that all languages in Burma are Burmese languages. For example, Arakanii or Magii, Chin, Kachin, Tenaserim, Burman and so on. However the principal language is Burman. It is also the language of the central government. Although Magii is a Burmese language, it is not Burman. All of these Burmese languages are written in more or less the same script. Of course there is a slight difference between some of the letters. The Burmese alphabet is Indo-Aryan, that is, it is formed with the Indian letters &ndash; a, a&#x301;, ka, kha, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The script of Thailand&#146;s Thai language and of the Tibetan language belong to the same family. Although the people of these lands belong to the Mongolian race, unlike the Chinese their scripts are not pictorial, but rather Indo-Aryan. The royal language or government language of Arakan was Bengali. The word hante was common in the Bengali of that time. Saeyad Alawal has written:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;ke kalla nirbalii ka&#x301;ha&#x301;ke bali a&#x301;r<br>Ha&#x301;r&#x301; hante nirmiya&#x301; karaya puni ha&#x301;r<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The modern Bengali word haite or hate comes from the word hante. The ablative-indicating indeclinable theke comes from the old Burmese word ta&#x301;ikiya&#x301;. The Burmese word ta&#x301;ikiya&#x301; became ta&#x301;ikya&#x301; in the southern Chittagong dialect and from this comes the modern Bengali tha&#x301;kiya&#x301; or theke. The mixed dialect that was formed from an admixture of Magii and southern Chittagong&#146;s Coxbazaar dialect is known colloquially as Zarvadi Bengali. The word ta&#x301;ikiya&#x301; no longer exists in modern Magii or Burmese but theke is used extensively in modern Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->All languages have an ablative case. In Bengali and most of the Indian languages the fifth case is created by first putting the original word in the sixth case and then adding the corresponding ablative-indicating indeclinable. For example, from maen [I] comes mujhse [from me]. Urdu follows the same rule. In Hindi and Urdu se functions in both the third and fifth cases. &ldquo;With&rdquo; does not fall into any specific case. Even though in Sanskrit &ldquo;with&rdquo; indicates the third case and makes it instrumental (as in saha-yoge trtiiya&#x301; [adding &ldquo;with&rdquo; makes it third case]), saha-yoge trtiiya&#x301; does not hold true in Bengali. Adding &ldquo;with&rdquo; makes it the sixth case and genitive as well &ndash; in Sanskrit, maya&#x301; saha [with me], Ra&#x301;men&#x301;a saha [with Ram], but in Bengali a&#x301;ma&#x301;r saunge, Ra&#x301;mer saunge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Nowadays in modern Bengali many people use the word sa&#x301;the interchangeably with saunge, however the word sa&#x301;the is not native Bengali; it comes from Hindi and Gorkhali. In pure Bengali and pure Maethilii the use of saunge is more proper. In our Calcutta Bengali we do not say sathe; we say saunge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Even though there is great grammatical similarity between Hindi and Urdu there are some differences as well, for example, gender. There used to be more difference between Hindi and Urdu in the feminine plural, however nowadays that has lessened somewhat. For example, in Hindi lar&#x301;kiya&#x301;n ja&#x301; rahiin thiin. Formerly in Urdu one used to write lar&#x301;kiya&#x301;n ja rahiin thiin. Of course, in the beginning people used to write it this way in Hindi as well. According to the normal rule, foreign words are feminine in Hindi. However this rule is not followed very strictly because there are many exceptions (what we call in Hindi apava&#x301;d). For example, the word kalam [pen] is foreign (Farsi). Kalam is feminine in Hindi. It is not only because it is foreign. The Sanskrit synonym for kalam is lekhanii which is also feminine. Hence kalam is feminine in Hindi, that is, we say merii kalam [my pen]. Since kalam is a foreign word it should also be feminine in Urdu but it is not. It is masculine in Urdu, that is, one says mera&#x301; kalam. If we use the word kalam in Hindi in masculine form then it does not mean a writing pen; it means &ldquo;grafted plant&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;mango graft&rdquo;, &ldquo;blackberry graft&rdquo;, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The Farsi word duka&#x301;n changes gender when the spelling changes. If it is spelled with u &ndash; duka&#x301;n &ndash; then it is feminine, for example, merii duka&#x301;n. But if we spell it with u&#x301; &ndash; du&#x301;ka&#x301;n &ndash; then it becomes masculine, that is, mera&#x301; du&#x301;ka&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Different rules also exist side by side in Hindi for some half-Sanskrit words, for example, ca&#x301;lcalan. Some people use it in masculine gender and others in feminine. The Urdu synonym for a&#x301;tma&#x301; [soul] is ru&#x301;h. Ru&#x301;h is feminine so in Hindi many people use a&#x301;tma&#x301; in feminine gender. However the word a&#x301;tma&#x301; is not feminine in Sanskrit, so in order to maintain concordance with Sanskrit some people use it in masculine gender. I support the second opinion so in my Hindi writings I have generally used the word a&#x301;tma&#x301; as masculine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In Hindi number and gender affect the verb. In English number affects the verb but gender does not, for example, &ldquo;he goes&rdquo;, but &ldquo;they go&rdquo;. In this case number affects the verb according to the general rule. But if I say &ldquo;Ram is going and Sita is going&rdquo; then one can see that gender does not affect the verb while number does.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The languages of Bihar also have an ablative case but they do not have a separate form for the fifth case-ending. As in Bengali the fifth case is constructed in these languages by adding an indeclinable, se, after the sixth case form. Incidentally, it should be mentioned that the pronunciation of se is somewhere between se and sa. For example, the Hindi for &ldquo;from me&rdquo; is mujhse. In Angika it is hamra&#x301;san. In Oriya ru is added to make the fifth case, for example, vrks&#x301;aru (in Oriya the pronunciation is vruks&#x301;aru).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, all languages have the ablative case but no Indian language apart from Sanskrit has a separate form for the fifth case-ending. There was no Vedic grammar. Early on there was no Vedic dictionary; only towards the end of the Vedic era did it come into existence. The famous composer of the Vedic dictionary, Yaska, lived long after the end of Rgvedic age. Since there was no Vedic grammar the question of what was correct and what was incorrect did not arise. Often errors were accepted because they were common usage among the Aryans. For example, during the Rgvedic age the word shiks&#x301;a was pronounced as if it had a long ii, that is, if it was written it would have been written shiiks&#x301;a. Similarly, the verbal root ji was used in a&#x301;tmanepadii, for example, jayate, jayete, jayante (that is, te, a&#x301;te, ante). However in Sanskrit the verbal root ji is parasmaepadii, in other words, jayati, jayatah, jayanti (or ti, tas, anti). Generally in Sanskrit if a prefix is added before a parasmaepadii verbal root then it becomes a&#x301;tmanedpadii, for example, vijayate. Later on Panini faced a lot of difficulties because of this, so he made a compromise between the two and gave it the name ubhayapadii [ubhaya means &ldquo;both&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Verbs are not used in a&#x301;tmanepadii form at all in Laokika Sanskrit. By accepting them as ubhayapadii he was able to maintain concordance [bojha&#x301;par&#x301;a&#x301;] with the Vedic language.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Another example is the verbal root cal [to move]. In Laokika Sanskrit this verbal root is 99.99 percent parasmaepadii but Panini accepted it as ubhayapadii. Apart from one saying of the Buddha, one will not come across any other example of the verbal root cal being used as a&#x301;tmanepadii. That saying of the Buddha is:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->At any rate, whether or not the ablative case has a separate form, it exists in all languages. In Bengali hate, theke, haite, t&#x301;heine, and so on, are used for this purpose. Some people might be a little surprised to hear the word t&#x301;heine but there is no cause for wonder because all languages have distinctive [a&#x301;la&#x301;da&#x301;] specialities of pronunciation and meaning. For example, the English word &ldquo;double&rdquo; also means &ldquo;double&rdquo; in Bengali, but in Angika it means &ldquo;very big&rdquo;. It is worth pointing out here that the word a&#x301;la&#x301;da&#x301; comes from a Farsi word, ala&#x301;hida&#x301;. Nowadays this word a&#x301;la&#x301;da&#x301; can no longer be separated [a&#x301;la&#x301;da&#x301; kara&#x301;] from the Bengali language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->I was saying before that the word kalam is feminine in Hindi and masculine in Urdu. The feminine gender is used in Hindi to refer to weapons but barcha&#x301; [spear], pharsa&#x301; [axe], bha&#x301;la&#x301; [lance], etc. are masculine in Hindi although they denote specific weapons. The word talva&#x301;r is feminine in Hindi but masculine in Urdu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The next subject of discussion is the genitive case. The genitive is the sixth [s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii] case. The word s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii begins with the letter s&#x301;a. The Yajurvedic pronunciation of s&#x301;a is kha, so the Yajurvedic pronunciation of s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii is khas&#x301;t&#x301;hii. However if it is in the beginning of a compound letter then it is not pronounced kha. In Bihar the word s&#x301;ad&#x301;ayantra is pronounced khar&#x301;yantra following the Yajurvedic pronunciation. In the same way santos&#x301;a is pronounced santokha in Panjabi and shis&#x301;ya is pronounced shikh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Anyway, the sixth case is used to relate one with another. In Bengali the indicator for the sixth case is r or er. For example, kalika&#x301;ta&#x301;r, Ra&#x301;mer. If the last letter ends with the pronunciation of a consonant then er is added, for example, varddhama&#x301;n-er &rarr; varddhama&#x301;ner. Although varddhama&#x301;n is not spelled with a hasanta it is pronounced as if it had one. Hence it is varddhama&#x301;ner, but cuncr&#x301;or.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Just as r and er are added to form the sixth case, e, te, and ete are added to form the seventh case. E is added in all cases except for those words ending in i, ii, u or u&#x301;. Ete is added after those words whose pronunciation ends with an hasanta, whether or not they are spelled that way, and te added in the remaining cases. For example, Krs&#x301;nanagar-e, Varddhama&#x301;n-ete, Kalika&#x301;ta&#x301;-te.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->This kind of rule does not exist in Sanskrit. The sixth case-ending form differs according to the word. For example, the singular sixth case form of the word nara is narasya, but the sixth case singular for muni is muneh. For such reasons it is difficult to learn the word forms in Sanskrit. In English &ldquo;of&rdquo; and apostrophe &ldquo;s&rdquo; are used to make the sixth case. The pronunciation of &ldquo;of&rdquo; in English is like &ldquo;ov&rdquo;. Many mistakenly pronounce it like &ldquo;off&rdquo; but this is incorrect. &ldquo;Off&rdquo; means &ldquo;far&rdquo; and is spelt with double &ldquo;f&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Hindi uses different indicators for the sixth case according to number and gender, namely ka&#x301;, kii, ke. Ka&#x301; is used for the masculine, kii for the feminine and ke for the masculine plural, for example, Ra&#x301;m ka&#x301; bha&#x301;i [Ram&#146;s brother], Ra&#x301;m kii bahan [Ram&#146;s sister], and so on. In Marwari ra&#x301;, ri and re are used; in Panjabi da, dii, and de; in Angika ra and ker; in Maethilii ak and ke; in Bhojpuri ke and ka; in Oriya ra and am&#x301;k; in Assamese ra; and so on. In French the definite article (the) changes according to the gender &ndash; le for the masculine, la for the feminine and les for the plural. This change in the definite article does not take place in English, nor in Hindi. Nor is there any change according to gender in the numerical article in either English or Hindi and Urdu. In other words, both masculine and feminine use ek [one]; the feminine does not use ekii. In English &ldquo;a&rdquo; or &ldquo;one&rdquo; remains unchanged but in French the numerical article also changes according to gender. The masculine form is un and the feminine is une. In this respect English is a bit more difficult than Bengali, Sanskrit even more difficult, Hindi more difficult still and French quite difficult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Many people do not accept the genitive case as a true case, but this is a matter that deserves careful consideration. As regards the genitive case, in Bengali the sixth case does not maintain a direct link with the verb, but often it maintains an indirect link due to the influence it exerts over the verb. For example, Ra&#x301;mer bha&#x301;i kha&#x301;cche [Ram&#146;s brother is eating]. Here there is no direct relationship between the verb kha&#x301;cche and Ra&#x301;m, but since the one who is eating is related to Ram therefore Ram maintains an indirect relationship with the verb, especially if Ram&#146;s brother does any true or untrue work of some magnitude. For example, Ra&#x301;mer bha&#x301;i ek laks&#x301;a&#x301;dhik t&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301; da&#x301;n kareche [Ram&#146;s brother has donated over one hundred thousand rupees]. The brother is giving &ndash; this is the root expression and it is nominative. However by saying &ldquo;Ram&#146;s brother&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;brother&rdquo; is indirectly modified, and when people hear it they will say: &ldquo;O, Ram&#146;s brother! He would be the one to make the donation. He takes after his brother.&rdquo; But if we say that Ram&#146;s brother is drinking too much wine these days, then people will say: &ldquo;Fie, fie! He&#146;s Ram&#146;s brother and he&#146;s drinking! What a disgrace!&rdquo; Thus the genitive indeed does indirectly influence the verb.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ram&#146;s brother is eating.&rdquo; Here &ldquo;brother&rdquo; is a noun and &ldquo;Ram&rdquo; qualifies this noun. Now that which qualifies a noun or a pronoun is an &ldquo;adjective&rdquo;. The verb cannot be qualified because a verb is not a qualitative entity, so in the case of the verb a modifier is used instead of a qualifier. That which modifies a verb is called an &ldquo;adverb&rdquo;. The adverb is linked to the verb, so the adverb is said to belong to the same family as the genitive. Hence if the adverb is accepted in the genitive sense then the genitive case must also be accepted. If brinjal [begun] dipped in gram flour and fried is begunii then will pat&#x301;ol dipped in gram flour and fried be pat&#x301;ol fried meat instead of pat&#x301;olii? Since the adverb modifies the verb it has to be accepted as genitive case. &ldquo;The pandit&#146;s boy drinks wine.&rdquo; Nowadays many boys all over the world drink so there is nothing about this that is much cause for surprise. But the moment we hear that the pandit&#146;s boy drinks, our surprise increases, is it not? In other words, even though the genitive case &ldquo;pandit&rdquo; is not directly connected to the verb, it cannot be denied that it influences the verb significantly. So therefore how can the need for the genitive be denied?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->I mentioned earlier that Sanskrit has a separate form for the sixth case. However the sixth case form differs for different words and it can be very far removed from the original word. For example the sixth case form for the word asmad is mama or me, for a&#x301;vayoh it is nao, and for asma&#x301;kam it is nah. In the case of Hindi pronouns ham becomes hama&#x301;ra&#x301;, hama&#x301;re, hama&#x301;rii; tum becomes tumha&#x301;ra&#x301;, tumha&#x301;re, tumha&#x301;rii; and so on, differing according to number and gender. In Bengali a&#x301;mi becomes a&#x301;ma&#x301;r and tumi becomes toma&#x301;r. In English, although &ldquo;of&rdquo; and &ldquo; &#146;s&rdquo; are used for the genitive case, there are fixed forms for the pronouns: &ldquo;my&rdquo; from &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;your&rdquo; from &ldquo;you&rdquo;, &ldquo;thy&rdquo; from &ldquo;thou&rdquo;, and so on. If the genitive pronoun follows &ldquo;of&rdquo; then altered forms are used, that is, &ldquo;my&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;mine&rdquo;, &ldquo;thy&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;thine&rdquo;, &ldquo;your&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;yours&rdquo;, &ldquo;her&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;hers&rdquo; and &ldquo;his&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;hiss&rdquo; in old English &ndash; in modern English it is written with one &ldquo;s&rdquo;. In French &ldquo;my&rdquo; is mon, ma or mes depending on number and gender. A moi, a toi, etc. are used when the voice changes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->In Bengali and other modern Indian languages this kind of usage does not exist. In Sanskrit it exists to some extent but not so much, nor is there any need for it. In Sanskrit when there is an effort to speak circuitously or indirectly then generally this is done by making use of the sixth case, for example, ma&#x301;turna vyathate manah. In Bengali the sixth case is employed for this kind of expression, however there is less of this practice of indirect speech in Bengali. An example of indirect speech is:<!-- /block --></p>

Bengali also has great expressive power, however this power has not been harnessed as it should have been.<!-- /block --></p>

One who embraces death in order to establish their religion is called shahiid.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  Nowadays the Hindi synonym for bojha&#x301;par&#x301;a&#x301; [literally, &ldquo;mutual understanding&rdquo;] &ndash; samjhaota&#x301; &ndash; is spreading orally, but one should keep in mind that the word bojha&#x301;par&#x301;a&#x301; has not yet died out. Similarly, the word ekt&#x301;a&#x301;na&#x301; [continuous] still enjoys excellent health in Bengali though the synonym la&#x301;ga&#x301;ta&#x301;r has entered the language.</p>
