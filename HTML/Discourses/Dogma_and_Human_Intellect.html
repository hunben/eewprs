<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject is &ldquo;Dogma and Human Intellect.&rdquo; What is the human intellect for? A human body has three functions: its crude physical movement and physical progress, its intellectual progress, and its spiritual progress. So far as intellect is concerned, it has two duties: to think and to remember.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What do we mean by &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;? What is thinking? The human mind is a collection of ectoplasmic stuff. And whenever we create any figure [in the mind] with the help of that ectoplasmic stuff, we say it is a thought &ndash; that we are thinking. To think means, then, to speak internally, and according to what we speak, we create a figure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Although different inferences have got different implications for the human mind, the more important, rather, the two most important, inferences are visuality and audibility. What we create in the mind, we speak mentally and at the same time we hear mentally. &ldquo;I&#146;ll go to Delhi.&rdquo; &ndash; when you think like this, you utter this sentence mentally: &ldquo;I &ndash; will &ndash; go &ndash; to &ndash; Delhi.&rdquo; And you hear mentally the sound &ldquo;I &ndash; will &ndash; go &ndash; to &ndash; Delhi.&rdquo; And at that time mentally you see the picture of Delhi, either a projection of the actual external Delhi or an imaginary figure of Delhi that you created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, what we think, sometimes we think from the extro-internal projections and sometimes from the memory. When we see an elephant [externally], at that same moment we see it mentally; and when we see it mentally, then we feel that we are actually seeing the elephant. And sometimes without seeing an elephant you can remember an elephant. That is, in your memory you can create an elephant. It is an act of re-creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now, human knowledge or knowing is divided into two portions; that is, the compartmentalized object may be of two types &ndash; one direct and the other taken from memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It is said that knowledge or the knowing faculty is infinite. Then, if the knowing faculty is infinite, is the human brain or human cranium infinite? No, certainly not. The cranium is something finite, something very little. And the human brain, although it has immense potentialities, is finite. Its qualities are very big, but not infinite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Human thought-waves and human knowledge may be directed towards two objects. One is the objective psychic stance, and the other is the objecto-subjective spiritual stance. When it is the objective psychic stance, then as a result of that objective movement on the  psychic level, what happens? The mind becomes bigger and bigger. And in order to serve the purpose of the mind, both the nerve-cells and the nerve-fibres of the human brain also become stronger and bigger. As a result of this enlargement of the nerve-cells, what will happen? In the future, the human cranium will become bigger, and limbs and other parts of the body will become lean and thin. But it is also a desired future for humanity, because when the mind will be developed, what will happen? Spiritual progress will be easier.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And the other psychic approach is objecto-subjective, or you may say, the subjecto-objective spiritual stance. In that case, you withdraw different mental faculties or propensities and make them pinnacled. And when those mental faculties are apexed, then what do you do? You offer that pinnacled human mind at the altar of the supreme spirituality. This is the spiritual approach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, if anyone says that in human life knowledge has little value or no value, that person will not be cent percent correct. In spiritual progress, if the knowledge, or the course of knowledge, or the avenue of knowledge, is subjective physicality, then in that case the progress may be delayed, but it will not be blocked forever. For intellectuals, spiritual progress is always delayed, and the reason is this &ndash; that their intellectual body goes on increasing, but for want of the apexed mentality, the goal remains far away. But when the intellectual body is highly enlarged, it is sure to become one with the Macrocosm. And when this enlarged ectoplasmic structure becomes one with the Cosmic ectoplasmic structure, certainly a person will feel his oneness with the Supreme.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->For spiritual aspirants, this type of intellectual progress may be meaningless, may be treated as superfluous; but for the all-round progress of human society, for human society as a whole, this type of intellectual progress cannot be discouraged, must not be discouraged; rather it should be encouraged.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->I want that our boys and girls who are intellectually developed, or who want intellectual development, should encourage this intellectual progress of human society, which will finally help human society in all types of progress. I hope you boys and you girls will feel, will realize, the utility of intellectual progress, and start your RU [Renaissance Universal] clubs in all towns and even in all big villages of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
