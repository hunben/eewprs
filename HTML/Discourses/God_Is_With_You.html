<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You all know that Parama Purus&#x301;a is very close to you. He is so near that nothing can be nearer. As Parama Purus&#x301;a is everywhere, He is also at the farthest point from you. If you feel that He is far from you, He becomes so distant that you cannot measure the distance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->If you [think] that Parama Purus&#x301;a is great and vast, He appears so huge and enormous that you will be bewildered. He will appear so resplendent that your eyes will close at His sight. He is the Creator of this expressed universe. But He is also in the smallest atom of this universe. If He were not also so small, so subtle, how could He enter such a small thing as an atom?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->He appears to you as per your feelings towards Him. If you are subtle, He is nearest to you; if you are crude, He is farthest from you. Do you feel that Parama Purus&#x301;a is in Ranchi or is in America? He is so near as to be in your [&ldquo;I&rdquo;] feeling, and so far as a distant country. When you think He is here, He is nearer than here. He is so near that it is difficult to measure the distance. You search Him in the caves of the Himalayas and wander here and there and He is nowhere. But when you attain awareness of Him, you know that He was along with you in your search and that He was seated in your heart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->He shares your joys and pains, as He is with you through thick and thin. He never leaves you even when all others have abandoned you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Every jiiva, every living being, is the child of Immortality. You have been born in eternity and you are moving towards immortality.  Therefore there is no need to be afraid, despondent, or sorry in any condition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Never think that your life has become useless. It is in your hands to make your life useful or to waste it. If you are aware that Parama Purus&#x301;a is always with you, in you, and that He is the greatest of the entities and there is no other entity who loves you so dearly, you will have no cause to feel that your life has become useless.<!-- /block --></p>
