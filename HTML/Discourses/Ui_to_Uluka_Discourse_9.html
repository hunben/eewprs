<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This is a native Bengali word. In north India, diimak is used, on the Bengal and north India border, diiyank or diiya&#x301;n, in English &ldquo;white-ant&rdquo; and in Sanskrit valmiikakiit&#x301;a or plus&#x301;in&#x301;a. This tiny creature belonging to the ant group increases its numbers at an extremely fast rate. They cannot see anything in sunlight. Their sense of touch also diminishes when exposed to sunlight. Thus they build little tunnels out of earth to protect themselves from sunlight and use them to move around because their sense of touch and other senses come to life in the darkness of these tunnels. Under certain conditions the different branches and sub-branches of these tunnels that they lay down right and left become visible as a mound or hillock. In spoken Bengali we call these ui-dhibi, in English &ldquo;anthill&rdquo;, in Sanskrit valmiika. An anthill was built around the entire body of a sage who remained motionless for many days during the practice of his austerities. At the time that he sat for meditation he was known by the name of Ratnakara. The people gave him the name Valmiiki because at the time that he finished his penance and rose from his seat he had the body of an anthill.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->People in many countries of the world eat ants, even civilized people in some places. They say that ants are tasty and have a sweet and sour flavour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In many parts of Bengal, a is used in place of ra, and ra is used in place of a. For this reason ui are called rui nearly everywhere in southern Bengal. That fungus variety of plant, or mushroom, which grows on anthills is called rui-cha&#x301;tu [ant-mushroom].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the word plus&#x301;in&#x301;a was more widely used than the word valmiikakiit&#x301;a. Sama plus&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; sama mashakena sama na&#x301;gena sama ebhistribhirlokaeh, that is, Parama Purus&#x301;a is unbiased. He is equal to everyone because He sees everyone in the same way. He sees an ant in the same way He sees a small mosquito. He understands an ant in the same way that He understands a mosquito. He doesn&#146;t make any undue fuss over a giant serpent (python or &ldquo;elephant of the jungle&rdquo;) because of its great size. He sees a python or &ldquo;elephant of the jungle&rdquo; in the same way that He sees an ant or a mosquito, and they also see Him in that same way. Nor does He make any special fuss over this universe, the three worlds of heaven, earth and hell, because of their vastness, and they look at Him in this same way. In other words, everyone is equal to Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; a mosquito, an ant, a python, a mammoth, even the three worlds. He remains with everyone equally through His ota yoga and prota yoga. He is impartial under all conditions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the opinion of biologists, ants first appeared on the earth approximately six million years ago. It is possible that they appeared somewhat earlier than this, but not later. In other words, after ants arrived on the earth they passed through at least one, if not more than one, ice age, and have arrived in their present form having undergone one or more long hibernations.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Ukta means &ldquo;that which has been said&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which has been mentioned before&rdquo;. Vac + kta = ukta. Generally, when the suffix kta or ktin is added to a verbal root which begins with antahstha va, the va of the root verb is changed into u. For example, vad + kta = udita [said]. Anu &ndash; vad + ghain&#x32D; = anuva&#x301;da [translation]; but anu &ndash; vad + kta = anu&#x301;dita (that which has been translated). By adding kta to vac + n&#x301;ic we get the word ucita whose etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which has been made to speak&rdquo; and whose colloquial meaning is &ldquo;that which is to be done&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is worthy of being maintained&rdquo;. Some people spell the word ucita with t &ndash; ucit. This is anucita [improper]. There is no such word as ucit.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix thal/vak to the verbal root vac we get the word uktha. Uktha means &ldquo;that which is uttered forcefully&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is sung forcefully&rdquo;. Many people know that the Sa&#x301;maveda is not actually a Veda. The song portions of the Rk, Yajuh and Arthava Vedas collectively make the Sa&#x301;maveda. The Rgvedic portion of the Sa&#x301;maveda is called uktha. The correct pronunciation of this portion is somewhat strenuous.<!-- /block --></p>

The straining which is done at the time of passing stool is also called ucca&#x301;ra deoya&#x301;. Some people mistakenly use the word socca&#x301;ra when they want to say sarava, or &ldquo;vocal&rdquo;. One meaning of the word socca&#x301;ra is &ldquo;one who has passed stool but still has not cleaned oneself&rdquo;. Its second meaning is &ldquo;one who is straining to pass stool&rdquo;. Is it desirable then to request a gentleman or lady to be socca&#x301;ra?<!-- /block --></p>

Ut&#x301; + ac = ut&#x301;a. Ut&#x301;aja shilpa means &ldquo;that industry which is done in a cottage&rdquo; &ndash; cottage industry. One should keep in mind that the word ut&#x301;a here is adopted from Sanskrit. Where the word ut&#x301;a is Sanskrit &ndash; derived then its English synonym is &ldquo;camel&rdquo;; us&#x301;t&#x301;ra &rarr; ut&#x301;t&#x301;ha &rarr; ut&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

Urn&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;wool&rdquo; or &ldquo;woollen thread&rdquo;. In northern India the word un&#x301;a is used to mean &ldquo;wool&rdquo; and the word un&#x301;ii is used to mean &ldquo;woollen&rdquo;, but it is mistakenly spelled with u&#x301; instead of u, and na instead of n&#x301;a. That creature which produces wool-like threads from its umbilical [na&#x301;bhi] region or makes its home in the web fashioned from these threads is urn&#x301;ana&#x301;bha [spider] &ndash; in Bengali ma&#x301;kar&#x301;sa&#x301;.

In olden times the area from the mouth of the Godavari River to the mouth of the Mahanadi River was called Utkala, and the area from the mouth of the Suvarnarekha River to the mouth of the Mahanadi River was called the land of Od&#x301;ra. The combined areas of Od&#x301;ra and Utkala, that is, the wide coastal area extending from the mouth of the Suvarnarekha River to the mouth of the Godavari River, was called Kaliun&#x32D;ga.<!-- /block --></p>

If someone announces something in a loud voice for the purpose of having that sound or those virtues heard by someone else then that is ut &ndash; ghos&#x301;a = udghos&#x301;a. Its English synonym is &ldquo;slogan&rdquo;. If someone says something in a loud voice, whether for another person to hear or not for another person to hear, then it is called nirghos&#x301;a.

The women of a household will sometimes worship Laks&#x301;mii year-round to bring happiness in the family; S&#x301;et&#x301;era&#x301; as well as Suvacanii is worshipped in the ritual peace ceremony; S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii and Niila are worshipped to bring welfare to one&#146;s children; and out of fear of illness Shmasha&#x301;nka&#x301;lii and Raks&#x301;eka&#x301;lii are worshipped. In Sanskrit they are all classified as upadevata&#x301;s because they are not Parama Purus&#x301;a, the object of meditation in the spiritual world. Besides these, there are many other upadevata&#x301;s such as Mangalacan&#x301;d&#x301;ii, A&#x301;sha&#x301;nbibi, Satyapiira, etc. Upadevata&#x301;s are also called folk [laokik] gods and goddesses. Some of them have dhya&#x301;na mantras and some do not; some of them also have dhya&#x301;na mantras in the local or state language and some do not have that either. In many cases the gods and goddesses of the Buddhist and Jain eras came or are coming to be worshipped as upadevata&#x301;s in the post-Buddhist and post-Jain eras. Those spiritual aspirants who follow the paths of knowledge, action and devotion, of course, do not bow their heads to upadevata&#x301;s. They practise the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the singular Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->Some people call ghosts upadevata&#x301;s out of excessive fear, that is, they accept them as minor gods and goddesses lest they be angered by being called ghosts. In Sanskrit, however, the word upadevata&#x301; is not used to mean &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; &ndash; for ghosts the word apadevata&#x301; is used. Upa means &ldquo;near&rdquo; and apa means &ldquo;just opposite&rdquo;. Apadevata&#x301; means &ldquo;one whose nature is just opposite to that of a god&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->I went there to do archaeological research on Angadesh, in the Lachmiipur jungle area by the eastern border of the Khirkhiriya (Ks&#x301;iiraks&#x301;irika&#x301;) Hills. I found there many cave paintings from the Buddhist era. I even came across some artifacts that dated back to the beginning of humankind&#146;s history in old Angadesh. In these hills humankind depicted its existence through many different varieties of drawings. From these it can be understood just how far back Angadesh&#146;s history goes. If Karna is accepted as Anga&#146;s first king, then Anga&#146;s political history is over 3500 years old, but these cave paintings are signs of the first stage of prehistoric humans&#146; ascension through the annals of history. They are approximately twelve thousand to fifteen thousand years old. No writings are found with them because at that time humankind had not yet invented script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->This Lachmiipur jungle was even bigger during Buddha&#146;s time. At that time it extended south to Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301; (Gidhaor). To the west and south of this jungle was Magadha and on the north-east border was Angadesh. After going around all day in the hills I realized that if a proper search was conducted then there would be a strong possibility of finding the highest quality slate, red mineral iron and kaolin there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, seeing that evening was fast approaching, I started heading back. As I was crossing the jungle I found that the entire region had become submerged in water. The Khargapur Lake dam had broken and water was rushing down and flooding the Khargapur River. The roads to both the cities of Bhagalpur and Monghyr had been washed away by the surging waters, hence there was no road back; I would have to spend the night somewhere there. The next morning some way could be devised to drive to Bhagalpur and Monghyr by putting bricks, wood and stones on the damaged road.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->Now, on a piece of high ground in the middle of that mass of water stood a witness to the first part of British rule &ndash; a huge indigo factory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->Incidentally, I should mention that at that time different varieties of dye used to be obtained from different sources, some metallic, some plant. Among them, the need for blue dyes was by far the greatest. There was a great demand for blue for arts and crafts, and different kinds of household and social needs. Blue dye was collected from the indigo plant. Bear in mind that nowadays blue dye is no longer prepared from the indigo plant. Since the discovery in Europe of a means of preparing blue dye through a scientific process the cultivation of the indigo plant has become obsolete.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, towards the beginning of British rule the British cultivated indigo extensively in Bengal. The indigo plant likes warm weather and lots of rain. The British cultivated their indigo in different areas using local farmers; in some areas they cultivated the indigo on their own land and they would prepare the blue dye in local factories from the indigo plants and send it overseas. These English indigo merchants used to be called niilkar saheb. There were many indigo factories in Bhagalpur, Monghyr, Burdwan and Birbhum. The indigo plant near Burdwan District&#146;s Ajapur was quite huge. It was destroyed in the Damodar flood of 1912.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Wild indigo plants can still be seen growing uncared for in this district. But indigo was cultivated more in Jessore and Nadia districts. At one time, the farmers of these two districts in Bengal revolted, disturbed by the oppression of these indigo factory owners. This rebellion has been described by Dinabandhu Mitra in his book, Niiladarpan&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->At any rate, somehow I made it to the indigo factory. Evening had descended and it was pouring rain. The road was deserted. A short distance away I spied another large house which I guessed to be where the present caretaker of the factory was staying. I approached the house and its caretaker was very glad to see me. &ldquo;This house is under my guardianship,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;but there&#146;s no good reason for you to spend the night in that dilapidated old house. You can stay here with me. Just wash up and relax; in the meantime I&#146;ll arrange for some drinking-water.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am fasting today,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I won&#146;t take anything. I&#146;ll spend the night in that house.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->I went into the indigo factory. There was a broom and a lantern from the old administration and the lime and plaster on the walls was falling off. There were owls outside in the cornices and a multitude of titmice inside in the cracks between the rafters. It felt as if I was in a silent royal palace. There was an eerie stillness all around, as if this house was not for the living, as if the dead had the sole right to be there. From the great banyan tree nearby came the sound of a bhutum owl &ndash; hoom-hoom bok-bok-bok-bok, hoom-hoom bok-bok-bok-bok.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->I opened a nearby window. A lizard jumped down and I could feel the threads of a torn spider web fall over my head.

<a name="79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->I had worked all day and was feeling quite tired. I was also half-soaked. Let me not waste any time, I thought.

<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->When I entered the room the fellow accompanying me, that is to say, the attendant that the caretaker had sent with me, lit three hurricane lanterns. One he put in the hallway room that was fixed for me to sleep in, another in the bathroom, and the third in the medium-sized room between the bathroom and the bedroom. I told the attendant: &ldquo;I know that the good gentleman sent you to take care of me, but why should you go to so much trouble on such a stormy night. Go and sleep in your own house.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&#146;ve been sent to look after you so I won&#146;t go to my own house.

<a name="82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The driver is there to watch over the car,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There&#146;s no alternative but for him to be there, but why should you go to needless trouble?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You will be completely alone in the house.

<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->His words raised doubts. The house has a history! Who doesn&#146;t have a history? If you take away history then you take away existence as well. We may know someone&#146;s history, or we may not, but everyone has a history. Some gets written; some goes unwritten. History is filled with the exaggerated exploits of kings and emperors while the history of the poor and indigent lies buried in the earth, neglected, but everyone certainly has a history. The history of victorious kings is written in glowing letters while the history of the defeated kings lies neglected and ill-treated, covered with mud. So this house also has a history&#8230; of course it does.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->In the room I found a heavy wooden cot from the old administration showing the craft-work of that time. A thick coconut-fibre cushion was laid out on top of it, over it a tos&#x301;ak [a thin cotton-mattress] and over that a beautiful bedsheet woven by a local weaver on a handloom. It reminded me that it was on these handlooms in Bengal and Angadesh that the world-renowned muslin cloth was woven that first went to the markets of Egypt and later spread to all of Europe. This handloom-woven muslin was made in Dacca, Murshidabad, and Bankura&#146;s Sonamukhi, and exported from the Port-de-Bangala (Chittagong) and the Port-de-Grandee (Saptagram or Satgaon). The sound of these handlooms resounded day and night throughout the cities of Tangail, Bajitpur, Shantipur, Baluchar, and Dhanekali. That was the golden age of Bengal&#146;s economy and Angadesh also shared Bengal&#146;s good fortune.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, I thought that after going to the bathroom and washing up properly, I would go to bed early. If I could leave early in the morning, then I could make it to Monghyr early.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->I went out of the bedroom and passed through the middle room in order to get to the bathroom. In the middle of the room I saw a beautiful rope hanging down. Perhaps they used to hang the lanterns from it. Near a window in the decaying plaster wall I saw an iguana. As soon as it saw me it jumped down and ran out. On closer inspection, I noticed that the beautiful rope was black with titmice. A pack of uccim&#x301;r&#x301;e [a cricket-like insect] had entered the room and were scurrying about, enjoying a little light after the rains. A few titmice turned circles when they saw me. Perhaps they wanted to let me know that only they had the right to be there at night in that palace of the dead. It seemed almost as if the disembodied spirits were speaking from the unseen world and saying: &ldquo;we have no objections if the titmice stay but this place is ours.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->I went into the bathroom and after washing my hands I passed again through that middle room. It seemed to me as if someone had been pacing about in the room in the meantime and had fled when they had seen me coming. I looked around carefully &ndash; no, no one was there. I was alone in the room, indeed in the entire house. Outside the crickets were letting me know through their continuous chirping that they were also alone. They also hadn&#146;t found anyone around. I continued on into the bedroom. As I did I had a feeling that someone had been standing in the northwest corner of the room and had left when he saw me. Anyhow I laid down on the cot thinking that now I would be able to rest undisturbed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->Just as I was starting to feel drowsy I heard a strange noise. I opened my eyes and saw a black cat. It was looking towards the northwest corner of the room, its eyes completely dilated, alarmed by something it had seen. When it saw me looking at it, it seemed to regain some of its lost courage and left the room with a single leap. I looked toward the same northwest corner of the room which had left the cat stupefied and I had the distinct feeling that someone had been there in the meanwhile and had absconded when he saw me looking.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->Everything was completely still and silent. From a distant banyan tree came the periodic hooting of the bhutum owl &ndash; hoom-hoom bok-bok-bok-bok, hoom-hoom bok-bok-bok-bok.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->I turned over on my other side but I wasn&#146;t able to sleep. What a bother! I had a feeling that whatever disembodied spirit was standing in that northwest corner of the room had a desire to approach me. Several times I called out in a loud voice: &ldquo;Hey, bodiless one, who are you, standing in my bedroom this way? I don&#146;t appreciate your behaviour at all. Be brave, come out face to face. Speak your mind. I don&#146;t appreciate this kind of fooling around. As long as I am in this room, it&#146;s better that you disembodied spirits cease with your games.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->After a little while I fell asleep again. I don&#146;t know how much time passed, but sometime later I thought I heard a European lady and a man talking to each other. Although the woman was speaking English she spoke it with a French accent; the man&#146;s accent was Cornish. The woman was saying: &ldquo;You know, the people have lost patience with the tyranny of the niilkar sahebs. Those same farmers who could never think of confronting the Europeans, who used to flee in fear just hearing their name, are now chasing after them with their sticks and spears when they see them. The situation is not good at all! Here also, the houses of innocent farmers are being set on fire on your instructions; your men are dragging their daughters and wives out of their houses and taking them with them. People are being beaten for no reason and chased away with bullets. It&#146;s horrible. These things are inhuman; the dignity of these women is being trampled into the dirt. As a woman I cannot put up with this. I will not put up with it. You have to put a stop to it!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The world is for the brave,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;If you can&#146;t demonstrate your power and authority in this world then you can&#146;t survive. They have to be shaken up a little. This is the ruler&#146;s philosophy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If this ruler&#146;s philosophy goes against humanity,&rdquo; the woman said, &ldquo;then I refuse to follow it. Whatever people may think, you can&#146;t sever your ties with humanity. The foundation of everyone&#146;s activities and work has to be humanity. Otherwise the demons in us will not only swallow our bodies and minds, but our entire human existence will end up crudified. That the consciousness which has evolved out of matter should return back to matter &ndash; no judicious human being would want that. So you give up your anti-humanity ruler&#146;s philosophy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If the indigo planters gave up the ruler&#146;s philosophy,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;then the farmers would disrespect them and cheat them.

<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Then this coming Monday I&#146;m going to take the ship from Calcutta back to England. I can&#146;t bear this antisocial, one-sided, hellish affair.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->After hearing all this I became suspicious. I looked in the direction where the woman&#146;s voice was coming from and could have sworn that a woman had just left. The man&#146;s voice had been coming from that dreadful northwest corner of the room. When I looked over there I could understand that the Englishman had just left hurriedly. I looked around the house carefully but found nobody there but me. I was the only guest of that deserted, silent night. From the distant banyan tree the sound of the bhutum owl continued: hoom-hoom bok-bok-bok-bok, hoom-hoom bok-bok-bok-bok.<!-- /block --></p>

What a bother I had landed in. I started scolding that unseen man in a loud and serious voice. &ldquo;If you maintain a relationship of ruler and ruled in individual or social life then it will surely lead to disaster. Whenever the kings of former days gave excessive weight to the ruler-ruled relationship, it resulted in the strong devouring the weak, and that led to revolt by the people &ndash; it happened during the time of King John; it happened at the time of Louis XIV; it happened during the Buddhist era in the time of King Devapal the Second.

He was saying: &ldquo;Please sir, don&#146;t leave me this way. I wasn&#146;t certain how to talk to you, so for a few seconds you didn&#146;t see me hanging from the rope.

<a name="118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At the beginning of the British administration indigo was a booming business. On one side there was the oppression and tyranny against the farmers, and on the other our pockets were filling up with money. This was the biggest indigo factory in Monghyr District. Millions of rupees worth of indigo were exported from here to Europe each year. I was the head manager of the factory. It is normal human psychology that when there is oppression, at first the timid people keep their mouths closed and put up with it. Even courageous people think: &lsquo;Let me see how things go for the time being. Then I will take action.&rsquo;  When the oppression increases even more, the cowardly-natured slap their heads and curse their fate, and the brave call out in loud voices and fall on their oppressors. When tyranny reaches its limit then even the faint-of-heart start roaring like lions and mercilessly take revenge on their oppressors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Maddened by delusions of power, and bereft of the knowledge of right and wrong in our greed for money, we niilkars forgot this historical and psychological truth. The result of this mistake of ours was the Niilkar Rebellion in Jessore and Nadia. The rebellion, however, never completely broke out in this Monghyr District because no such oppressive niilkars had come to this area besides myself. I set the steamroller of tyranny loose on these ordinary farmers. I earned huge amounts of money and in the process I sold my humanity in exchange for a few gold coins. I went hell-bound step by step, transforming myself from a conscious human being into no better than an inert stone. I had no remnant left of my common sense. Maddened by pride, I fired recklessly on those village farmers who came to me peacefully with their grievances and needs. I even killed seven men. After that I hadn&#146;t the slightest sense of what-to-do or what-not-to-do. There was no one around to give directions or orders or advice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;After firing on the villagers, I sent a letter to the district magistrate informing him of the affair.

Under these circumstances it is best that you observe certain limits in all matters. Do not do anything that can make the situation get out of control or law and order get out of hand. For several days now I&#146;ve known that the village farmers have been disturbed by your conduct. You have even fired on and killed several innocent farmers. I can guess that they will become even more agitated. Under these circumstances I will give you this counsel: you should start for Calcutta this very night under the cover of darkness. It is no longer safe for you to remain there. It will take you approximately five days to reach Calcutta by horse-drawn carriage.

Will I flee under the cover of darkness out of fear of a few ordinary farmers? Never! It is against my ruler&#146;s philosophy. I will have to do something to save my respect. On and on I went thinking like this until I was at a complete loss. There was no one to give any clear directions or orders.

For example, the placing of the first brick when inaugurating the construction of a house is called shila&#x301;nya&#x301;sa [laying of the foundation stone]. In olden times houses were built out of shila&#x301;, or stone, so we say shila&#x301;nya&#x301;sa rather than is&#x301;t&#x301;akanya&#x301;sa [is&#x301;t&#x301;aka means &ldquo;brick&rdquo;]. That person who has placed himself or herself completely at the service of ideology is sam + nya&#x301;sin = sannya&#x301;sin (in the first person singular, sannya&#x301;sii). One who is a true ideologue, that is, one who has placed oneself at the service of Parama Purus&#x301;a is sat + nya&#x301;sin = sannya&#x301;sin (in the first person, singular sannya&#x301;sii).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="146"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=146 type=paragraph -->Upa means &ldquo;near&rdquo;. If any material object (object of enjoyment or edible) is kept near a person then that is called upanya&#x301;sa, in Farsi pesh karna&#x301;. This upanya&#x301;sa can be done either with respect or without respect. If a wooden trough is filled with chopped hay or with bran well-mixed with flax, and that is placed near a cow&#146;s mouth, then this nya&#x301;sa is done with respect or care. If paddy or broken bits of grain is scattered or spread for the hens or pigeons then this is also upanya&#x301;sa. And if pieces of dried bread are thrown for a dog lying on the road then that is also upanya&#x301;sa. To place something near is upanya&#x301;sa. The word upanya&#x301;sa is also used in the sense of &ldquo;introduction&rdquo;, &ldquo;preface&rdquo; or &ldquo;prelude&rdquo;. In this case one thing that should be borne in mind is that the Bengali synonym for the English words &ldquo;novel&rdquo; or &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; is not upanya&#x301;sa; rather it is, or should be, katha&#x301;nya&#x301;sa. There is no relationship between the words &ldquo;novel&rdquo; or &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; and the word upanya&#x301;sa, so it is not desirable that the word be used mistakenly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="147"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=147 type=paragraph -->Previously I mentioned scattering broken bits of grain or paddy for the pigeons or hens; a person who does this should properly be called aopanya&#x301;sika.

The other colloquial meanings of the word pecaka are &ldquo;elephant&#146;s tail&rdquo;, &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;, and &ldquo;bed&rdquo;. All of these expand, so pecaka refers to all of them.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  The name of the opening instrumental section in north Indian classical music.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  Roughly speaking, this river-basin has two parts: Monghyr District&#146;s Khar&#x301;gapur (Habeli), Tarapur and Sam&#x301;gra&#x301;mpur  tha&#x301;na&#x301; [administrative area covered by one police  station], and Bhagalpur District&#146;s Belhar tha&#x301;na&#x301;. The Belharnii River forms the border between these two districts in most places. During the time of the Santhal Rebellion in 1855 there was a great battle between the British and the Santhals in this river-basin&#146;s Sam&#x301;gra&#x301;mpur. Hence the name Sam&#x301;gra&#x301;mpur [battle city]. At the beginning of the war the British were losing the battles. On  one side the Santhals entered the city of Bhagalpur and on the other side the cities of Suri and Rajnagar. The Divisional Commissioner of Bhagalpur was killed in the battle. Still today one part of the  city of Bhagalpur bears the name of the leader of the rebellious Santhals, Tilaka&#x301;ma&#x301;jhi.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  The people of Burdwan, Hoogly and Howrah have yet to forget the destructive Damodar flood of 1912. The Ta&#x301;rakeshvara  temple was on the verge of being completely submerged in that flood. Calcutta was also mostly under water. In order to save Calcutta, the British managed to divert the greater part of the Damodar&#146;s waters into the Dvarakeshvara (Rupanarayana) via the Begorhana-Mundeshvari rivers. After that the Damodar lost its force as it headed downstream in the Begorhana, that is, in the Amta, Bagnan and nearby areas, and Calcutta was thereby saved from the flood.</p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)  This shloka is the &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo;. See pp.  98-100. &ndash;Trans.</p>
