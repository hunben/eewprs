<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Etymologically, ka means &ldquo;head&rdquo;. Actually, ka does not mean exactly &ldquo;head&rdquo; &ndash; the name of that bony receptacle inside the head in which the brain resides is kabandha (cranium). Still, in common parlance kabandha refers to the head in Sanskrit. Ka + bandh (badhi) + ac = kabandha. Etymologically, the condition that is created when ka is bound and injured, or decapitated is kabandha. Colloquially, kabandha means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->1) A headless body, or torso. In spoken Bengali the imaginary headless ghost, or kabandha ghost, is called kandha-ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; ghost. In this case the word kandha-ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; has come from the word skandha-ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, that is, one whose upper portion of the skandha [shoulder] has been cut. Ordinarily the covering, as well as the ornament, of the trunk of the body, or kabandha, is called dhar&#x301;a&#x301;,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and the covering, as well as the ornament, of the head is called cu&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;. Both together become dhar&#x301;a&#x301;-cu&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->2) Kabandha is the name of a ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asa [demon] &ndash; according to the Puranas, the one that Rama killed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->3) If we take ka to mean &ldquo;water&rdquo;, then the meaning of kabandha becomes &ldquo;dam&rdquo; or &ldquo;barrage&rdquo;. Ka, or water, is certainly held back by a dam or a reservoir, but the main purpose there is to create a reservoir, while the main purpose of a barrage is to hold back the water. Thus, while kabandha can be used correctly to mean &ldquo;dam&rdquo; or &ldquo;reservoir&rdquo;, it is more correctly used to mean &ldquo;barrage&rdquo;. Thus we can call a barrage kabandha or jala-bandha [jala means ka, or &ldquo;water&rdquo;]. In ancient times when Rarh contained large forested areas there was also more rainfall. Still, then also the kings used to build huge reservoirs in years when there was little rainfall in order to save the paddy from withering. In the common language of Rarh, these extremely large reservoirs used to be called ba&#x301;ndh, and still are. For example, Bankura District&#146;s Samudraba&#x301;ndh, Bhagaladiighi, and Ra&#x301;n&#x301;iiba&#x301;ndh, Dumka&#x301;&#146;s Bar&#x301;aba&#x301;ndh, Purulia&#146;s Sa&#x301;hebba&#x301;ndh, Da&#x301;ntan&#146;s Sarashaun&#x32D;ka&#x301;, and so forth. For such types of ba&#x301;ndhs we can use the word kabandha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->4) The pure Bengali word for the cloth tie that people used to wear around their neck in ancient times as symbol of dharma is kabandha.  The muffler or scarf or comforter that is worn around the neck to protect the head, or ka, from cold or attacks of kapha can also be called kabandha in refined Bengali [and Sanskrit].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->5) The Ketu [dragon&#146;s tail] of the Puranic stories we can also call kabandha.  According to the Puranic tale, the asuras [demons] wanted to deprive the gods of the nectar of immortality that was produced from the churning of the sea by the gods and demons. One asura secretly swallowed it, and as a result he started to become immortal. What a problem, the gods realized! An asura is becoming immortal. Thereupon they cut off his head with the Vis&#x301;n&#x301;ucakra [the discus of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u]. The name of the decapitated head of that asura is Ra&#x301;hu and its torso&#146;s name is Ketu. Thus, another meaning of the word kabandha is Ketu. According to the story, at the time of the lunar or the solar eclipse Ra&#x301;hu swallows either the moon or the sun. Vidhurapi vidhiyoga&#x301;t grasyate Ra&#x301;huna&#x301;hasao [Even the moon is eclipsed by Ra&#x301;hu, this is the providential decree].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->But Ra&#x301;hu&#146;s neck is cut. Thus, shortly after Ra&#x301;hu swallows either the sun or the moon, they come back out through the cut neck. The sun or the moon gets liberated from the swallowing of Ra&#x301;hu. In ancient times, in accordance with their beliefs, people used to bathe in some holy body of water and used to call this bath the &ldquo;liberation bath&rdquo; [mukti-sna&#x301;n] Actually, Ra&#x301;hu and Ketu are successively umbra and penumbra, and for this reason, in the opinion of the astrologers, ketu would be found in the seventh sign from whatever planet in which ra&#x301;hu was found. Thus, if the moon would enter the seventh astrological sign from whatever sign the sun was in then there would be a lunar eclipse.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Ye ye ma&#x301;se ye ye ra&#x301;shi ta&#x301;r saptame tha&#x301;ke shashii<br>sedin yadi hay paorn&#x301;ama&#x301;sii avashyai ra&#x301;hu gra&#x301;se a&#x301;si<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->[The moon is found in the seventh house from the sign of whatever month; on that day, if there is a full moon, then certainly Ra&#x301;hu will come devouring.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Neither ra&#x301;hu nor ketu is an actual planet or satellite. They are, in any one set of circumstances, two kinds of umbra. Thus in the astrological scriptures they are called &ldquo;shadow-planets&rdquo;. According to the Puranic conception, Brahma&#x301; is the father and Umbra is the mother &ndash; this is how Ra&#x301;hu is known. According to a Puranic tale, the name of one of Brahma&#x301;&#146;s wives is Cha&#x301;ya&#x301; [umbra] and the name of the sun&#146;s wife is also Cha&#x301;ya&#x301;. Here the progeny&#146;s name is Shan&#x301;igraha [Saturn] (both the spellings Shani and Shan&#x301;i are correct), thus another name of Shani is Cha&#x301;ya&#x301;putra [putra means &ldquo;son&rdquo;]. Since another meaning of the word ka is the bony receptacle situated inside the head &ndash; or cranium &ndash; many people mean ra&#x301;hu when they say ka. There is no objection if someone uses ka to mean ra&#x301;hu, but it is not correct if some wishes to use kabandha to mean ra&#x301;hu; kabandha means ketu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->6) Shirt, or that kind of wearable collar, is called kabandha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->7) The retention-of-urine ailment that results when the movement of the urine is obstructed is also called kabandha. The water from soaked fenugreek, fresh date juice, palm juice, and sha&#x301;nkha&#x301;lu [a conch-shaped esculent] are medicines for this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Kamat&#x301;a<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the root verb kam is &ldquo;to want&rdquo;. Kam + at&#x301;ac = kamat&#x301;a. The etymological meaning of the word kamat&#x301;a is &ldquo;one who desires&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is desired&rdquo;. If kam is taken to mean &ldquo;water&rdquo;, then the etymological meaning of the word kamat&#x301;a becomes &ldquo;that which is involved in matters related to water&rdquo; or &ldquo;one in whose matters water is involved&rdquo;. Colloquially kamat&#x301;a means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->1) Bamboo shoot. Just as with the banana tree, where the young plant grows from near the roots, bamboo shoots spring up near the base of the tree. In ancient Bengal people would often place an earthen pot over the bamboo shoot. The young shoot would then wind itself into the pot, continuing to grow. When the shoot would fill up the pot they would cut the shoot off and take the shoot-filled pot away. They would crack open the pot and use this bamboo shoot, which was now rounded and crimped like a cabbage, as a cooking vegetable. It made for a very tasty dish. If a little breeze would come along while it was still in its pot-bound condition then the pot would tremble.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Kap + i = kapi. The etymological meaning of the word kapi is &ldquo;that which moves or jumps&rdquo; (for that reason another name for monkey is kapi), thus the round-shaped bamboo shoot inside the clay pot used to be called ba&#x301;ndha&#x301;kapi [ba&#x301;ndha&#x301; means &ldquo;bound&rdquo;] or konr&#x301;akapi [konr&#x301;a means &ldquo;shoot&rdquo;]. In subsequent times, when cabbage and cauliflower, etc. arrived in Bengal they were also given the Bengali names ba&#x301;ndha&#x301;kapi [cabbage], phulkapi [cauliflower], olkapi [arum] and so forth. In Sanskrit, then, bamboo shoot is called kamat&#x301;a; konr&#x301;akapi is also called kamat&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->2) Kamat&#x301;a also means &ldquo;[water] turtle&rdquo;. There are generally two types of turtles, the land-dwelling turtle, or tortoise, and the water-dwelling turtle. The tortoise is very long-lived. They live on grass and leaves. The [water] turtle is also long-lived. In some people&#146;s opinion, the tortoise lives up to nearly five hundred years in age, while the turtle can survive up to three hundred years.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The water turtle is highly carnivorous. The water turtle also comes onto land, however, in order to lay its eggs. It removes some sand or soft earth and lays its eggs in that depression. Afterwards it covers the eggs back up and returns to the water. With the help of the internal heat of the sand or earth the young burst their shell and come out. The moment the young are born they run right for the water. Normally most of the young turtles are eaten by birds or other carnivorous creatures before they can make it from land to water. While the tortoise also lays its eggs underneath sand or earth, it remains nearby so less of its young die. The water turtle lays a great quantity of eggs while by comparison the tortoise lays much less. People eat both kinds of turtle eggs. A perusal of old Bengali literature shows that the Bengalees of that time used to eat turtle eggs with bitter greens [a bitter vegetable green]. Not all water turtles are edible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->According to differences in size and nature turtles are known by different names in Bengali, such as kacchap, ket&#x301;ho (&ldquo;hard as wood&rdquo;), ka&#x301;ut&#x301;ha&#x301;, ba&#x301;rkol, and so on. All kinds of turtles are called kamat&#x301;a in Sanskrit and refined Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->3) Kamat&#x301;a was the name of a mythological demon depicted in the Puranas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->4) The fourth meaning of the word kamat&#x301;a is what we call in Bengali jag [jug]. The type of water vessel from which water is poured into a glass, or kakubha, is nowadays called a jag.  The actual Bengali, as well as Sanskrit, word for jug is kamat&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->5) The fifth meaning is &ldquo;water full of high waves&rdquo;. Just as water with few waves is called kamala, the same water with many waves is called kamat&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->6) The shark is called kamat&#x301;a in Sanskrit and refined Bengali. Those sharks which are large in size and live in the ocean are normally called ha&#x301;un&#x32D;gar in Bengali, and those sharks which live in coastal rivers or backwaters or estuaries, are called ka&#x301;mat&#x301;a in spoken Bengali. They are somewhat smaller in size than the ha&#x301;un&#x32D;gar. At one time there were a great number of ka&#x301;mat&#x301;as in the rivers of Midnapore, 24 Paraganas and Khulna Districts. Taking bath in those rivers was dangerous at that time. The oil of these ka&#x301;mat&#x301;a sharks has medicinal qualities. As the cod fish began disappearing, shark oil began to be used as a substitute for cod liver oil, and from that time also the ka&#x301;mat&#x301;a species started to be wiped out. Nowadays the number of ka&#x301;mat&#x301;as has greatly diminished.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Kamala<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Kam + alac = kamala. Kam means &ldquo;desired&rdquo; or &ldquo;wished for&rdquo;. Thus etymologically kamala means &ldquo;that which people like&rdquo;. The la of the suffix alac is a&#x301;di la, thus it is also at the end of the word &ndash; it is kamala, not kamalra. Colloquially, kamala means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->1) The lotus flower. The lotus flower is called kamala because its beauty and grace are quite attractive. Bees, hornets and other insects are attracted by its smell &ndash; people as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Medicine is made from lotus petals. The lotus, especially the stamen of the white lotus, is a medicine for poisonous snakebite. Lotus seeds are a very tasty food. Certain types of small worms grow in the lotus&#146;s stem or stalk (mrn&#x301;a&#x301;l or mrna&#x301;l) &ndash; especially during the rainy season. That same kind of small worm also grows in the stalk of the kalmii and ta&#x301;lma&#x301;kha&#x301;na&#x301; plants.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> These worms are favourite foods of certain long-lived fish, such as the kai, ma&#x301;gur, siun&#x32D;gi, etc. Lotus nectar has been valued as an excellent medicine for eye disease since ancient times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->2) The lotus does not grow in water that has too many waves, that is, in rivers with strong waves. Thus kamala also is used to mean &ldquo;that water which has few waves&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->3) That water vessel which people use so extensively for carrying or keeping water, that is, a bucket, is also called kamala.  The Bengali synonym for the English word &ldquo;bucket&rdquo;, ba&#x301;lti, is a very recent word; it is of foreign origin. If one says ek kamal jal a&#x301;no [bring a bucket of water] instead of ek ba&#x301;lti jal a&#x301;no it will be good Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->4) The kaman&#x301;d&#x301;alu [a water pot with religious significance in India] that people used to use in ancient times to keep water was generally made out of the shell of a ripe gourd. In some places coconut shells were also used for carrying water. Thus kamala also means &ldquo;coconut-shell&rdquo; or &ldquo;gourd-kaman&#x301;d&#x301;alu&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->5) That particular kind of deer which is found in watery or damp places, and which goes by the name of ka&#x301;kar-harin&#x301; in Bengali, is also called kamala. Like the wild boar, this ka&#x301;kar-harin&#x301; is also a favourite food of the Royal Bengal tiger. Human beings have nearly killed off the ka&#x301;kar-harin&#x301;.  Some provision needs to be made for their preservation without any delay.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->6) The colour of copper is attractive; its lustre is also attractive. And as a water vessel it comes just after gold and silver pots in quality. Thus copper is also called kamala. If one wishes, one can also call a copper pot, kamala pot.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->7) Medicine cures the diseases of living beings. It brings out the beauty of the body, or often medicine becomes very attractive to the sick person. In this sense kamala also means &ldquo;medicine&rdquo;. Bear in mind that the highest quality waters which are effective against disease (such as the Bakreswar kun&#x301;d&#x301;a or the Siita kun&#x301;d&#x301;a, etc.) are thus called tiirtha kamala in Sanskrit [tiirtha means &ldquo;place of pilgrimage&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->8) The gall-bladder is called kamala or udara-kamala.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->9) The bladder of a football is also called kamala.  In order to eliminate confusion, the football can be called kanduka-kamala (kanduka means &ldquo;ball&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->10) The words kamala or nimnakamala can be used for &ldquo;urinary bladder&rdquo; or &ldquo;kidneys&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Some people believe that the word kamalinii means &ldquo;small kamala&rdquo; or &ldquo;small lotus&rdquo;. From the grammatical point of view, the word kamalinii can be used to mean &ldquo;small lotus&rdquo;, but in customary usage kamalinii does not refer to a small lotus &ndash; it means a collection of loti, that is, when there are many loti blooming together at one spot in a particular reservoir or pond, then that bunch of loti, or that lotus grove, is called kamalinii. In the same way, if many sha&#x301;luka or kumuda (lily) flowers (in certain parts of Bengal it is also called sha&#x301;pla&#x301;) are blooming together at one spot in a reservoir or pond then we can also call that kumudinii.  Kumuda means &ldquo;sha&#x301;luk flower&rdquo;. While it is correct from the grammatical point of view to use the word kumudinii  to mean &ldquo;small kumuda&rdquo;, it is not used that way in practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The English for kamala is &ldquo;lotus&rdquo;; its plural form is &ldquo;loti&rdquo;. The English for kumuda is &ldquo;water-lily&rdquo;. The lotus maintains a relationship with the sun while the water-lily has a relationship with the moon; for this reason, moonlight is called kaomudii.  The kahla&#x301;ra flower [white water-lily] (dhyanp flower or bhent&#x301; flower) is smaller than the sha&#x301;luk.  If many of these flowers are blooming at one spot then that can also be called kahla&#x301;rin&#x301;ii.  Although kahla&#x301;rin&#x301;ii can also be used in the grammatical sense to mean &ldquo;small kahla&#x301;ra&rdquo;, it is generally used to mean a bower of kahla&#x301;ra flowers. The stalk (mrn&#x301;a&#x301;l) of the kamala has thorns while the stalks of the kumuda and the kahla&#x301;ra do not. The seeds of the kumuda and the kahla&#x301;ra flowers are food for human beings, just as kamala seeds are. Na&#x301;r&#x301;us [la&#x301;d&#x301;d&#x301;us &ndash; a popular variety of Indian sweetmeat] are prepared from them by first parching the ripe dhya&#x301;np or bhent&#x301; seeds in a pan with sand to make khai [a type of puffed grain, usually prepared from rice] and then mixing it with either sugar or molasses water; this type of na&#x301;r&#x301;u generally goes by the name of dhya&#x301;nper or bhent&#x301;er na&#x301;r&#x301;u. This na&#x301;r&#x301;u is somewhat similar to the ra&#x301;mdha&#x301;na&#x301; na&#x301;r&#x301;u of northern India. The dhya&#x301;nper or bhent&#x301;er na&#x301;r&#x301;u has little food value to speak of, but it is easily digestible. For this reason, it is fed to sick people and children. Because it has so little food value there is a common saying in Bengali:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->If we use the word kamala in feminine gender then we get two additional meanings. Kamala + t&#x301;a&#x301; = kamala&#x301;. Kamala&#x301; means:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the root verb kap/kamp (kapi) is &ldquo;to tremble&rdquo;. Kamp + ac = kampa. Kampa is a masculine word which means &ldquo;that which trembles&rdquo; or &ldquo;the state of trembling&rdquo;. But by adding rak to kamp we get the word kampra which means &ldquo;that which naturally trembles&rdquo;. Dvidha&#x301;y jar&#x301;ita pade kampravaks&#x301;e namranetrapa&#x301;te [In confusion, the feet tangled up, a trembling breast, eyes downcast]. This is very sweet to the ears but defective from the grammatical point of view. Grammatically speaking, kampavaks&#x301;e would have been better. If the breast trembles out of fear or confusion then we will not say that it is naturally trembling. We will only use kampravaks&#x301;e for someone whose breast naturally trembles.

India learned tea cultivation from the Chinese. The inhabitants of China drink both leaf tea and green tea but it seems that green tea is a bigger favourite. The Chinese people like to drink tea with butter, salt and honey. The people of ancient India used to boil the wild tea leaves in salt water, that is, they used to drink it salty, and this tea&#146;s name was kambal.

<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->3) The third meaning of karaka is a certain type of bird from cold countries that normally comes to India from the end of the month of Karttik [late Autumn] to the end of the month of Ma&#x301;gh [winter] and makes temporary nests in the areas near different reservoirs and ponds. These bird-guests usually make their nests in the tall trees near reservoirs and ponds. They are the old inhabitants of northeast China, Siberia, Russia and Tibet, but due to the oppressive cold in those lands during wintertime it becomes impossible for them to sustain themselves. It is extremely cold, and moreover there is a scarcity of food. Thus they come to India and other hot countries during the winter and stay there for a few months. During this time they lay their eggs, and after their young are somewhat grown they teach them how to fly and the process for gathering food. Then, when the hot winds begin to blow they return to their homeland. They return to exactly the place they had come from, and each year they also come back to the same place. It has been demonstrated by attaching a marker to their legs, or through other means, how unbelievably developed their intuition and ability to recognize these places is. Great crowds of them gather during the winter in Calcutta Zoo, 24 Paraganas&#146; Sandeshkhali, and Bharatpur&#146;s bird sanctuary. At one time great numbers of them used to come to Dimdiha village in Purulia District. Since they came to lay their eggs [d&#x301;im] the name of the place became Dimdiha. They can be seen in the marshlands of Bengal during wintertime. Among these birds is a bird of the Flamingo family. Karaka refers to the birds of this flamingo family.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->5) The fifth meaning of the word karaka is &ldquo;city-tax&rdquo;, what in Farsi is called cungii. In many large cities of ancient India travellers who were entering the city used to have to pay a city entrance-tax at the time of entering. This city entrance-tax still exists in certain forms in certain parts of the globe. It is called karaka.<!-- /block --></p>

If someone says &ldquo;the tailor bird is sitting in the karaka tree,&rdquo; then it will have to be understood that the tailor bird is sitting in a pomegranate tree because tailor birds don&#146;t sit in banyan trees or very large trees. From the Sanskrit da&#x301;r&#x301;imba has come da&#x301;r&#x301;im in Maethilii and d&#x301;a&#x301;lim in Bengali. The word a&#x301;na&#x301;r used in Hindustani is of foreign origin. In olden times the beda&#x301;na&#x301; [a high quality pomegranate] came into being as a result of scientific research on the pomegranate. As far as size goes, there are three different varieties of pomegranate &ndash; small, medium and large. The beda&#x301;na&#x301; is medium-sized. The rind of the pomegranate is somewhat reddish while the beda&#x301;na&#x301;&#146;s colour is catechu, or pale-yellow. The pips of the pomegranate are red while beda&#x301;na&#x301; pips are light-rose or purple-rose. The pomegranate is sour, or sweet-and-sour in taste while the beda&#x301;na&#x301; is normally sweet. Although both the pomegranate and beda&#x301;na&#x301; have food value, the beda&#x301;na&#x301; has more. The beda&#x301;na&#x301; is suitable as a diet for convalescing patients. The beda&#x301;na&#x301;&#146;s Sanskrit name is da&#x301;r&#x301;imba.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->Kr + at&#x301;ac = karat&#x301;a. The etymological meaning of the word karat&#x301;a is &ldquo;to move while engaged in work&rdquo;. Colloquially karat&#x301;a means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->1) Raven; the raven is continually going about in search of one kind of food or another. When it doesn&#146;t find any food in the vicinity, or doesn&#146;t have any other work, then rather sitting and remaining silent, it makes a ka ka sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->2) The second meaning is &ldquo;crane&rdquo;. This long-billed crane is found nearly every place in the world regardless of whether it is predominantly cold or hot. Only in those times and places where the water freezes does it not stay around because then there is a shortage of food there. If it sees the probability of water freezing in a place then it abandons that place just prior. It does so with the help of its rather advanced deductive powers. Thus, if in any particular land it is seen that the cranes are leaving, then it can be deduced that very cold weather is coming in the near future, just as it can be known that the rainy season is imminent when the swallows can be seen flying westwards at the end of the hot season.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->The rainy season begins a day or two after the rain clouds reach the Bengal coastal region from the Bay of Bengal. The swallow is native to Africa. In the spring it crosses over the Arabian Sea and the southern peninsula and enters Bengal. It stays in Bengal during the summer. Once the monsoon starts it heads westward, crosses the Arabian Sea and returns to its home country, Africa.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph -->3) People affectionately caress the cheek of young children with their hand. But no one caresses an elephant&#146;s cheek. This elephant&#146;s cheek is also called karat&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=131 type=paragraph -->4) Unclean or inferior professions are also called karat&#x301;a.

<a name="133"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=133 type=paragraph -->6) You must have seen cows that chase people or kick them if one tries to milk them. This kind of bad-natured cow is called a ma&#x301;rka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; cow in some places. This ma&#x301;rka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; cow is called karat&#x301;a. If this ma&#x301;rka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; cow is fed fodder mixed with mustard chaff before dawn then its affliction will be alleviated, that is, its temper will be calmed. Often this kind of cow kicks its own calf and chases it away, that is, she doesn&#146;t allow it to drink her milk. So that these calves don&#146;t die for a want of food during infancy, they can be fed pure roasted gram flour dissolved in water; then their life can be saved.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="134"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=134 type=paragraph -->7) The seventh meaning is &ldquo;atheist&rdquo; or &ldquo;crude-minded person&rdquo;. This is used in masculine gender.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph -->8) The eighth meaning is the &ldquo;kalke flower&rdquo;. The fruit of the kalke flower is poisonous. There is some poison in its root as well, but there is none in its nectar. Medicine is prepared from the kalke&#146;s poison. The ancient kalke flower was yellow but nowadays it is also found in pink and white varieties.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> If the red and white kalke flowers are seen from a distance they are often confused with oleander.<!-- /block --></p>

By adding the suffix amac to kard we get the word kardama. We also get the word kardama by adding ma to the word karda. The etymological meaning of kardama is &ldquo;that from which an unpleasant noise is produced&rdquo;. One colloquial meaning of kardama is &ldquo;slime&rdquo;; another meaning is the son of Brahma&#x301;, Kardama. According to the Puranic tale, Kardama&#146;s father&#146;s name was Brahma&#x301; and his mother&#146;s name was Cha&#x301;ya&#x301;.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  In Oriya &ldquo;white&rdquo; is called dhar&#x301;a&#x301;. This has come from the word dhavalra. From the word dhavalra comes the Bengali word dhalo and the Oriya word dhar&#x301;a or dhar&#x301;a&#x301;. Actually, the correct spelling of the Oriya word dhar&#x301;a is not with r&#x301;a but rather with antahstha lra. In Bengali also, ka&#x301;lo-dhalo is common [black and white]. In Bhojpuri &ldquo;white&rdquo; is dhaor&#x301;a&#x301; (dhavalra). For example, Dhaor&#x301;ii (dhavalrii) ga&#x301;y caratiiya&#x301;, that is, &ldquo;a white cow is grazing&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  For this reason people don&#146;t eat the kalmii during the rainy season. Even if people are made to understand by reason, oftentimes they don&#146;t want to understand or accept. Thus, in order to cause fear, it is said that Jagannath has fever from soja&#x301;ratha day until ult&#x301;oratha day. He is lying on a bed of kalmii leaves. And so, at that time kalmii should not be eaten; it is a sin to eat it.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  Ta&#x301;mra &rarr; ta&#x301;mba &rarr; ta&#x301;mba&#x301; &rarr; ta&#x301;nba&#x301; &rarr; ta&#x301;ma&#x301;. The ta&#x301;mba&#x301; form is prevalent in northern India. In Bengali, both ta&#x301;nba&#x301; and ta&#x301;ma&#x301; are correct although the ta&#x301;nba&#x301; form is more faithful to the original Pra&#x301;krta.  For example, both a&#x301;nb and a&#x301;m [mango] are correct, but a&#x301;nb is more faithful to the original Pra&#x301;krta.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)  The word ba&#x301;jii is of Farsi origin. In Farsi the adjectival suffixes gar, var, and da&#x301;r are used. For example, ja&#x301;dugar [magician], ja&#x301;navar (not ja&#x301;noya&#x301;r [beast]), duka&#x301;nda&#x301;r [shopkeeper]. Bear in mind, it is ja&#x301;du, not ya&#x301;du, and ja&#x301;dugar, not ya&#x301;dukar.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)  Lodhra &rarr; lodhdha &rarr; lodh. In ancient India girls used to use the pollen of the lodh flower as face powder.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn6">6</a></b>)  The author&#146;s garden contains both the pink and white varieties of this flower. Moreover, there is a variety of kalke brought from Cyprus which is halfway between the kalke and oleander.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn7">7</a></b>)  According to a Puranic story the twelve classes of Ka&#x301;yasthas came from the lineages of the twelve children of Chitragupta. The names of his twelve children were: Ca&#x301;ru, Suca&#x301;ru, Citra, Citraca&#x301;ru, Arun&#x301;a, Atiindriya, Himava&#x301;n, Matima&#x301;n, Bha&#x301;nu, Vibha&#x301;nu, Vishvabha&#x301;nu and Viiryabha&#x301;nu. Apart from these twelve classes of Chitragupta Ka&#x301;yasthas, there are six more classes of Ka&#x301;yasthas. They are: (1) The sun lineage king, Ashvapati&#146;s descendants &ndash; Pattanprabhu Ka&#x301;yastha; (2) The moon lineage king, Ka&#x301;mapati&#146;s descendants &ndash; Damanaprabhu Ka&#x301;yastha; (3) The devotee king, Dhruva&#146;s descendants &ndash; Druvaprabhu Ka&#x301;yastha; (4) Upaka&#x301;yastha (Bengal&#146;s Kuma&#x301;r or Kunya&#x301;r Ka&#x301;yastha, Kerala&#146;s Na&#x301;ya&#x301;r and Tamil nadu&#146;s Pilla&#x301;i groups); (5) Purka&#x301;yastha (Purka&#x301;it); and (6) Bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;rii Ka&#x301;yastha. Although the Bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;rii Ka&#x301;yasthas are Ka&#x301;yastha by caste, they have taken on the Brahman&#146;s profession. Due to their social relationship with the Buddhist Chakravarttiis during the Buddhist era, the other Ka&#x301;yasthas don&#146;t especially like them. Today caste differences and caste divisions are fading out. What I have just related is a Puranic story of the old days.</p>
