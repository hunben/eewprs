By sandalwood tree we refer primarily to the white sandalwood (another name of white sandalwood is <I>shriikhan&#x301;d&#x301;a</I>), since red sandalwood does not belong to the sandalwood family at all according to the science of botany. It is a forest tree belonging to a completely different species; its leaves also are completely different. There are only a few species of white sandalwood. Of these, the Sri Lankan and Indonesian species are the dominant species. The sandalwood that grows in India, especially in Karnataka and adjacent areas, is mostly the Sri Lankan species. It differs from the Indonesian species in that it is relatively more fragrant. Generally it is a little shorter than that of the Indonesian species. During its infancy the roots of this sandalwood are weak, so it cannot draw fluids from the deeper recesses of the earth&#146;s water table. That is why it should be planted near another tree that can easily draw up this deep-lying water towards the roots of the sandalwood and help it to take in water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><p>Generally the swallow wort [<I>Calotropis gigantia</I>], tamarind and cactus are planted as auxiliary plants. This species of sandalwood prefers a somewhat dry climate but it does not like intense heat. It dies in its infancy in Bengal as well as in areas of heavy rainfall, and it also does not survive in the extremely hot areas of North India either; it dries up in the intense heat. Apart from South India, the area most suitable for it is the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h region of Bengal, that is, the areas of Purulia, Birbhum and Bankura, where it can grow easily. The tree begins emitting its scent when it reaches about twenty years of age. It takes longer for trees belonging to the Indonesian species to begin producing scent. I have seen a tree belonging to the Indonesian species that was not producing any scent even after twenty-eight years of age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><p>The red sandalwood is a forest tree with mildly fragrant red timber; it generally prefers somewhat hilly areas with medium rainfall. Red sandalwood can grow very easily in Assam, Bengal and Orissa. Red sandalwood trees grow fast and are larger than white sandalwood. In most cases where there is a red sandalwood tree near a white sandalwood tree, it is found that the white sandalwood tree dies under the dominance of the red sandalwood tree. The red sandalwood tree has indomitable vitality. However, red sandalwood has hardly any utility value compared to white sandalwood. Followers of orthodox religion generally use red sandalwood for worship of the goddess Kali and for sun worship. At one time the use of red sandalwood was widely prevalent among the <I>Sha&#x301;kadviipii</I> Brahmans. Today it is no longer so. Black sandalwood is a sub-species of white sandalwood. This sandalwood is generally used for oil preparation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph --><p>Since well water is stagnant, people in ancient times would not use this water for different kinds of religious rites. They would use Ganges water, or if that was not available then the water of some other river.

Those reservoirs that have small waves due to being smaller in size, and in which fish eggs do not burst open, are called <I>pus&#x301;karin&#x301;ii</I> (<I>pukura &ndash;</I> in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali <I>pokura&#x301;</I>)<I></I>, <I>tar&#x301;a&#x301;ga, diirghika&#x301; (diighi), gar&#x301;e</I> or <I>d&#x301;oba&#x301;</I> [varieties of ponds]<I></I>.

These long<I>-</I>lived <I></I>fish can survive for quite some time after being taken out of the water.

Their eggs sometimes open due to the impact of the waves but often they do not. (3)The third group is called <I>kuco</I> or <I>bhuso</I> fish [tiny fish], for example, <I>ten&#x32D;to pun&#x32D;t&#x301;i, chot&#x301;o khayra&#x301;, tecoka&#x301;</I>, prawn, shrimp, etc. Their eggs open in small bodies of water, even in the puddles of autumn paddy fields.<!-- /block --></p>

To indicate one they showed one finger; to indicate five they showed one hand; to indicate ten they showed two hands; to indicate fifteen they showed two hands and one foot; and to indicate twenty they showed the entire human body with its twenty fingers and toes.

<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph --><p>Although there is no separate letter <I>r&#x301;a</I> in Sanskrit, if the letter <I>d&#x301;a</I> occurs in the middle or at the end of a word it is pronounced <I>r&#x301;a</I>. So we write <I>kud&#x301;upa</I> but pronounce it <I>kur&#x301;upa</I>. You know that the letter <I>d&#x301;ha</I> is not always pronounced in the same way. It is pronounced <I>d&#x301;ha</I> at the beginning of a word but <I>r&#x301;ha</I> in the middle or end, for example, <I>d&#x301;hakka&#x301;</I> [drum] but <I>A&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;[d&#x301;]r&#x301;ha </I>[third month of Bengali calendar]; similarly <I>d&#x301;anka&#x301;</I> [trumpet] but <I>a&#x301;</I> [<I>d&#x301;</I>]<I>r&#x301;hambara</I> [pomp and grandeur]. However, in those cases where the letters are pronounced without the terminal vowel, the rule is that if they are joined to an <I>antahstha</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> letter [<I>ya, ra, la, va</I>], <I></I>then their original pronunciation is retained. For example, in the spelling <I>kud&#x301;ya</I> the letter <I>d&#x301;a</I> does not occur at the beginning of the word. So for this reason it should have been <I>kur&#x301;ya</I>, but it is not because here the <I>antahstha</I> letter <I>ya</I> has been joined to <I>d&#x301;a</I>. So even though the letter <I>d&#x301;a</I> occurs in the middle or at the end, it is not pronounced <I>r&#x301;a</I>, but rather <I>d&#x301;a</I>. Similarly, in the spelling of the word <I>a&#x301;ryya</I> the letter <I>ya</I> is not at the beginning. For that reason its pronunciation should have been like <I>antahstha</I>, i.e., <I>a&#x301;ryya</I>. Since in this case the <I>antahstha</I> letter <I>ra</I> has been conjoined to the letter <I>ya</I>, the pronunciation should be <I>a&#x301;rya</I> [<I>a&#x301;rja</I>] and not <I>a&#x301;ryya</I>. For this reason the pronunciations <I>ka&#x301;ryya&#x301;laya, ka&#x301;ryyakrama, a&#x301;ryya, paryyaya</I> are not <I></I>correct; they should be <I>ka&#x301;rya&#x301;laya</I>, <I>ka&#x301;ryakrama, a&#x301;rya, parya&#x301;ya</I>, etc.<!-- /block --></p>

This part of Howrah District is very fertile. It has been densely populated since ancient times. When Howrah fell within the jurisdiction of Burdwan it was the pride of Bengal. Afterwards, when it came within Hooghly District, it was regarded as one of the prosperous areas of Hooghly District. Later on, when Hooghly District was divided and Howrah District was formed, this area remained within Howrah District. Partially without industry, partially industrialized, it was the jewel of the region, shedding its lustre on the whole of Bengal through its scholarship, industriousness and erudition. There was a time when the vast Sarasvatii River used to flow through this area. The Sarasvatii River came out of the main branch of the Bhagiirathii River at Triven&#x301;i in Hooghly District&#146;s Mogra Thana. It came out from the right side of the Bhagiirathii. The Yamuna River came from the exact opposite direction, that is, from the left side of the Bhagiirathii through the Chakda and Haringhata Thanas of what was then Nadia District, the adjoining region. This confluence of the rivers Ganges, Yamuna and Sarasvatii Rivers is renowned as the <I>Triven&#x301;itiirtha</I> [holy confluence of three rivers] or the <I>Mukta</I> [liberated] <I>Triven&#x301;ii</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

There it used to flow past the meadows of Kendua&#x301; on its right side. What we call nowadays the Kendua&#x301; meadows was a vast lake in prehistoric times. The lake gradually filled up and turned into the Kendua&#x301; marshlands or Kendua&#x301; meadows. Up until a hundred years ago the rice and paddy crops never failed in the Kendua&#x301; marshlands. Rice and rice paddy used to be exported from the port of Amta by ship to foreign lands along the Damodara River. Those days are gone. Nowadays the Damodara is almost dried up.

Brahmans and Kayasthas brought the glow of scholarship, and the skilful peasants of the Ma&#x301;his&#x301;ya and Sadgope communities produced golden harvests. The heroism of the Kaivarta fishing community became famous far and wide. They were respected in the society as &ldquo;Bara&rdquo; [a surname], the best, and were primarily responsible for the formation of the navy of independent Bengal. This area was also home at that time to a shipbuilding factory where indigenous methods were used. That industry perished during British rule. The expert carpenters and Kaivarta fishermen of this place built those ships. The merchants of this area also set out to sea after loading their goods on those ships.<!-- /block --></p>

There are three chief reasons for this. The first reason is the changing of course and subsequent drying-up of the Sarasvatii. The second reason is the decline of rural industries. The third reason is the loss of economic balance and equilibrium owing to defects in education and the social system. In general, in order to build a strong economy in a certain area thirty to forty percent of the population of that area &ndash; neither more nor less &ndash; should be dependent directly on agriculture. If it is less then agriculture is neglected; conversely, if it is more, then there will be a heavy strain on agriculture. That is exactly what has happened in this Ma&#x301;ju-Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; region. What to speak of Ma&#x301;ju-Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, the same thing has happened throughout Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, throughout Bengal, throughout India, and even in China and the whole of the Southeast Asia. To combat this problem a new social and economic evaluation is necessary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph --><p>Just as agriculture should be built up on an advanced scientific foundation, industry should also be organized in perfect adjustment with agriculture. The percentage of the population depending directly on agriculture should not exceed forty percent. Where rural industries have been destroyed, a major part of the population once engaged in that sector is now moving towards agriculture. Just as the percentage of people depending directly on agriculture should be thirty to forty percent for balanced economic development, about twenty percent of the people should depend on agro-industries, twenty percent on agrico-industries, ten percent on general trade and commerce, and ten percent on intellectual or white collar jobs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph --><p>Because village industries have been ruined, those who depended on those industries have turned to agriculture. The percentage of merchants has not increased much; rather the opportunities for further growth have decreased. However the number of people looking for white-collar jobs has increased, resulting in soaring unemployment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph --><p>The sons of farmers, after receiving a little education, are no longer willing to labour in the fields. They want to become Babus [title of a Hindu gentleman]; they consider farm work to be menial labour. As a consequence there is a dearth of educated youths in agriculture on the one hand, and on the other an increasing number of people from other vocations turning towards agriculture. In the rural areas the percentage of the population depending primarily on agriculture has gone up to seventy or eighty percent. What an unbearable situation! So just as social and economic life in other parts of Bengal has been turned upside down, Ma&#x301;ju-Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; is no exception. This Ma&#x301;ju-Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; region was Howrah District&#146;s greatest potential for economic development but that hope has been shattered. Today the city of Howrah is neglected, so it is not capable of supplying vital energy to rural Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph --><p>Non-agricultural industry (such as steel plants, brass industry, metal industry, oil refineries, salt industry and non-plant based pharmaceuticals) refers to those industries that are neither direct agrico-industries (such as the production of pick-axes, spades and tractors) nor industries that are directly dependent on agriculture, that is, agro-industries (such as jute mills, cloth factories, flour mills, paper mills and plant-based medicines). The percentage of people engaged in non-agricultural industry should be formed by reducing the percentage of people depending directly on agriculture, reducing the percentage of people depending on agrico-industries and reducing the percentage of people engaged in agro-industries. The percentage of people engaged in non-agricultural industries should be kept within twenty to thirty of the total population. If the percentage is less than twenty percent, the country is said to be industrially undeveloped and the per capita income of the people cannot be very high. The standard of living also cannot be very high because the purchasing capacity of the people remains very limited. Due to the reduced capacity for purchasing consumer goods, the import index remains lower than the export index or the area has to remain a satellite of a developed country. As a consequence, the balance of power in the world is jeopardized and the possibility of war is always around the corner.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph --><p>If the percentage of people engaged in non-agricultural industry is kept between twenty and thirty percent of the population, then it creates a state of balance, a balanced socio-economic system. If the percentage goes beyond thirty percent it becomes an industrially developed area. The more the percentage rises beyond thirty percent, the more the area goes from industrially developed to industrially over-developed. In order to procure agricultural produce the industrially over-developed countries try to convert agriculturally predominant regions into their satellites. They feel the need to keep these industrially undeveloped countries under their control in order to serve as a market for their finished goods. If they do not obtain markets for their industrially produced consumer goods, they will have to suffer from economic recessions and growing unemployment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph --><p>In this regard, there is no difference between communist and non-communist countries. All of them are equally aggressive in their approach. They are desperately searching for the wish-fulfilling cow, which they want to keep tied to their door, feeding it the minimum amount of fodder. Is it any wonder there are so many wars and conflicts in the world, so much war psychosis and sabre-rattling! Efforts must be made so that each and every country of the world can enjoy a balanced state in both agriculture and industry; otherwise the socio-economic balance of the world is bound to be destroyed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph --><p>The negative consequences of over-industrialization result in the deterioration of the personal, social and political health; due to the gradual psychic degeneration of both individuals and the collective, a kind of psychic epidemic may become rampant any moment which can endanger or jeopardize every expression of life. It may not happen today, but it will surely happen in the near future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph --><p>Where the industrial system (whether it is agro-industry, agrico-industry or non-agricultural industry) depends on outside labourers, the situation becomes precarious. The speed of psychic degeneration accelerates. Such a region will suffer from a chronic scarcity of food. The possibility of expanding the markets for their consumer goods will be gradually become curtailed. As an example, we can look at Howrah, Hooghly, 24-Parganas and Burdwan. Since the labourers there are outsiders, the local people will never see good days. However developed or over-developed these areas might become, they will have to endure the ill effects of over-industrialization without being able to enjoy any of the benefits of industrialization. This sort of scenario can be seen daily in Howrah District. Moreover there are still many such areas in India where ninety percent of the population consists of farmers. There is no industry whatsoever in those areas. They are completely surplus labour areas. A balanced socio-economic structure will have neither surplus labour nor deficit labour. It cannot be permitted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph --><p>The agricultural system should be built up similar to the industrial system; that is, the prices of agricultural produce should be determined by considering basic factors like agricultural income, expenses and necessities. In other words, the farmers of Burdwan and Birbhum should not be forced to sell their rice at throwaway prices. Similarly, the farmers of Hooghly district should not be compelled to sell their potatoes at cheap prices, and the farmers of Nadia District should not be forced to sell their jute at low prices in order to pay off their debts.<!-- /block --></p>

Our sahib, this <I>ana&#x301;ha&#x301;rii</I> magistrate, is a skinflint, downright niggardly. But when it comes to himself he is quite generous. Recently he ordered an expensive imported shirt with a French silk collar from Paris, the capital of France. He even attended the office wearing this shirt once or twice but over the shirt he wore an ordinary, cheap coat. You may remember that there was a cyclone some days back which hit the southwest coast of Bengal. On the radio they said that there was a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal, or some such thing. There was a heavy rainstorm in the city that day. Everyone was completely drenched on their way to court. What could the magistrates do? They took off their coats and shirts and sat in the courtroom in their undershirts. The ordinary employees took off their shirts and brightened the room by sitting in their chairs bare-chested, like the roly-poly god Gan&#x301;esha. I sat there with my torn undershirt on. The cool breeze was coming in through a hole in the undershirt; actually it wasn&#146;t an unpleasant feeling. Our sahib, however, was unwilling to take off his coat. I could see that underneath the coat he was wearing the same expensive French silk shirt with its dazzling collar. The sahib&#146;s coat was completely drenched.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;The sahib was reluctant to take off his coat.

But the sahib was still reluctant to take off his coat. &#x301;Sir, please take off your coat,&#146; I told him, &#x301;your body will be wet and you will fall ill.&#146; Good or bad, the sahib said nothing.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

The sahib had bought a torn shirt from some second-hand shop and worn it inside his coat to show off in front of us. He had told us that his paternal aunt&#146;s son&#146;s paternal uncle&#146;s daughter&#146;s niece&#146;s husband&#146;s paternal aunt&#146;s son had paid a French tailor five thousand rupees to make the shirt and then had sent it here by air.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
