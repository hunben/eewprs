<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Whose directions are to be obeyed? One should always follow and observe dharma. It embraces all; no one is distant from it. Therefore dharma will not teach differences, it will not teach distinctions of high and low, it will not teach untouchability. It will, instead, teach fraternity. Why? Because the voice of dharma comes from God Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Dharma is to you what water is to fish. What sustains you is dharma. If you leave dharma you die. If dharma goes, everything goes. There is a story about a king who wanted a good market in his capital, but businessmen and merchants were reluctant to come because the city was somewhat unpopular. So the king thought out a plan: he offered to buy all those articles or commodities which could not be sold in the market by evening. This offer attracted the businessmen and merchants, and soon a big market was established. One day a businessman went to the king and showed him an idol of the goddess of misfortune which he could not sell in the market. Nobody wanted to buy it, for it would mean ruin to him and to his family. The king, bound by his offer, bought the idol and placed it in his palace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->That same night he saw a woman weeping. When he asked her why, she told him that she was the goddess of good fortune and that she could not live in a place where the goddess of misfortune was also living. The king said that he was helpless and could not remove the idol: he was bound by dharma. So the goddess of good fortune left the palace. Then the king saw a gentleman, who told the king that he was the god of good fortune and could not live in the palace after the goddess of good fortune had left it. The king expressed his inability to help him, so the god of good fortune also left the palace. After him several large and small gods living in the palace left it for the same reason, but the king told them all that he was bound by dharma. Then the king saw another person. When he inquired, the person said that he was dharma and he could not live in the palace after all the gods had left it. The king said that it was for dharma that he had kept the idol in the palace, it was for dharma that he had given shelter to the goddess of misfortune. Under these circumstances, dharma could not leave the palace. Dharma could not deny the king&#146;s statement, so he agreed to continue to live in the palace. Soon after this, all those gods who had left, quietly entered the palace from the back door. Even the god and goddess of good fortune returned, hiding their faces.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Everything in the world has been created by God. Human dexterity lies only in creating physical mixtures or chemical compounds; human beings cannot create anything original. From white ants to elephants &ndash; all have been created by Him. Thus everything in the universe is His incarnation. There is no one small or big, no one is hateful All are the sons and daughters of God.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In the transitional period of civilization, honesty in individual life is a prime necessity. We shall have to remain ever-vigilant that the darkness of petty self-interest does not shroud this supreme human treasure. With the extinction of honesty, civilization too will not survive; the long sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the human race will go in vain, and all intellectual achievements will become meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>

Crushing the pebbles of hindrances and obstacles with a stroke of your feet, disdaining the frowns of winds, tornadoes, meteors and roaring thunders, and rendering all superstitions to ashes without any second thought&#8230; march on and on. God is with you. Victory is yours.<!-- /block --></p>
