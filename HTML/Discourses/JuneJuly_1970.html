But 800 crores [8,000,000,000] of years ago there was only a gaseous form. Wherever there is the time factor, space factor, or person factor, everything changes.

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The Vedic language was a spoken language from 10,000 to 3000 BCE. When the Aryans came to India there were so many languages spoken by the Austrics, Mongolians<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and Dravidians. After several centuries, both racial and lingual blending had taken place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The Vedas were the only books composed &ndash; not written, as the Aryans [had no script] &ndash; in the Vedic language. This language underwent change and metamorphosis according to local changes and [the influence of] local languages, and developed into Pra&#x301;krta of one type in the Punjab, of another in Bengal, another in South India, etc. &ndash; all in all seven Pra&#x301;krtas in seven portions [of the Indian subcontinent] spoken by the general public. When the Aryans came to India they learned how to write, and thus wrote books in a modified Pra&#x301;krta having close proximity to the Vedic language &ndash; it was known as Sanskrit. [Here Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; traces the development of a few words.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Language changes due to environmental change and also due to change in race. Certain sounds cannot be pronounced by some races. [Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; gives some examples.] Soil also has an effect. No pronunciation is good or bad; all are natural for a particular [time], for a particular land. Sanskrit has four recognized pronunciations.<!-- /block --></p>

Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; notes that a flower is &ldquo;sweet-scenting&rdquo;, because it has its own fragrance, but a handkerchief is &ldquo;sweet-scented&rdquo;. Finally Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; observes:] &ldquo;English is a very rich and very expressive language, perhaps the most expressive language of the modern world.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->We should take proper care of this garden of civilization &ndash; we must take proper care of each and every flower.

The seed of omniscience lies in the pineal. The mind has fifty propensities or [modes] of mental expression. These may be expressed internally [mentally] and externally [physically]. And this expression may be in ten directions &ndash; through the five sensory and five motor organs. Thus the total expressions of the mind are 50 x 2 x 10 = 1000. The sahasra&#x301;ra cakra controls these thousand expressions, and hence it has been called the thousand-petalled lotus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra [pituitary gland] is the controlling point of the conscious mind, and indirectly of the subconscious mind.

<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Each hormone has its own taste. The divine nectar of the pineal gland is very tasty and it cannot be imagined by taking any drug. It is very intoxicating &ndash; then and there sama&#x301;dhi. It cannot be approximated by any drug&#8230; and it won&#146;t weaken the liver! (Shiva is pictured as being in trance &ndash; because of the divine nectar He would at times be in trance all twenty-four hours &ndash; drinking the internal wine!)<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Naturally a spiritual aspirant should not take drugs. It is against the very idea of spirituality as it weakens one&#146;s control over mind and body. Ananda Margis should also try to avoid a non-vegetarian diet &ndash; though this is not an order, it is advice.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->What are the causes of salvation? A&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [self-knowledge] is the only requisite for the attainment of moks&#x301;a. (The knowledge that &ldquo;I am Brahma&rdquo; is also known as pan&#x301;d&#x301;a, and one having this pan&#x301;d&#x301;a is a pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Of the living creatures, only the human &ndash; one having a human body, human glands, etc. &ndash; can attain moks&#x301;a.

But a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is obtained from within and is always perfect. It is not dependent on any organs, not even on the nerve-fibres. Everything is within. You hear with internal ears and see with internal eyes. For materialistic research you depend on the thought-waves of the conscious and subconscious. But for self-realization you do not even depend on the mind! It is something within, your personal property. Nothing else can be your personal property, for you will have to quit everything except the Supreme.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->The entire human society is of a cosmopolitan nature &ndash; nothing can be treated as being indigenous to this group or that. The world is fast moving toward cosmopolitanism, and none will be able to maintain their national characters. The big towns have already become cosmopolitan. Just as the mixture of the English, the Spanish, the French and so on gave rise to the culture of America, similarly a cosmopolitan blending is taking place. Cultural blending is going on throughout the world. No group of people or nation will be able to maintain its speciality &ndash; the political entities are trying hard to maintain these specialities, but they will not be able to. During a time of flood, ponds, streams, lakes, oceans all become one; similarly, culture will become one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->29 June 1970 morning, Ranchi<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Human philosophy is to help human development in all respects; it must not be just a philosophy of logicians. Logicians&#146; philosophy only teaches you how to kill time in gossiping. Thus in ancient India two philosophers once spent three days arguing about whether sound was created before or after a palmyra [fruit] strikes the ground &ndash; and at the end of the three days, both were killed by the [fruits] falling from the palmyra tree above them! This is the fate of logicians &ndash; their philosophy has no practical value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Similarly, some have come forth with the philosophy that the world is illusion. The philosopher Shankaracharya said that the world doesn&#146;t exist. Once when he was attacked by an ox and was fleeing away, he was questioned by a follower, &ldquo;But is not the ox an illusion? And if so, why are you fleeing away?&rdquo; To which the philosopher replied, &ldquo;But my fleeing away &ndash; that is also an illusion!&rdquo; These philosophies are hypocrites&#146; philosophies &ndash; utopian ideals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->According to Ananda Marga, this world is not an absolute reality, rather it is a relative reality that exists through change, as a passing show. But we cannot say it is an illusion. The universe lives through change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->29 June 1970 evening, Ranchi<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit there are two terms for the play of Parama Purus&#x301;a: (1) kriid&#x301;a&#x301; &ndash; where the play can be grasped by human psychic faculties; and (2) liila&#x301; &ndash; where no rational explanation can be given by the intellect, where the causal factor is beyond the reach of the intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Whatever we see and can be grasped is in the scope of kriid&#x301;a&#x301;. In the case of kriid&#x301;a&#x301;, also, the causal factor comes within liila&#x301; &ndash; we may know the cause, but the cause of the cause we do not know. That subtlest causal factor of mind is certainly the effect of something &ndash; but it is beyond human intellect. Where you do not exist, how can you find the cause of something?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->14 July 1970 morning, Ranchi<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a can do everything except two things: (1) He cannot create another God; (2) He cannot hate others &ndash; He does not have the right or capacity to. Because He cannot hate Himself; and there is no second person, no second object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Those people who support caste, creed, etc. &ndash; they hate Parama Purus&#x301;a. By hating the microcosm, they hate the Macrocosm that the microcosm is an expression of. Suppose Mr. X hates others, while Mr. Y does not hate others &ndash; is Mr. Y praiseworthy? No. Not to hate others is doing something natural, it is not to be praised. To hate, however, is unnatural and is to be condemned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Satan cannot remain in the universe, because if the existence of Satan is recognized, then he becomes a second God. Satan is only temporary, for he does not have the attributes of the Absolute; rather he is nothing but human intellect propelled by depraving tendencies. If these tendencies are diverted properly, they no longer exist &ndash; it is within your power to kill that Satan.<!-- /block --></p>
