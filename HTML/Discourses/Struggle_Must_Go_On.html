<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Struggle must go on in every sphere of life &ndash; social, economic, mental and spiritual. Wherever there is economic exploitation of the poor, a struggle will have to be waged against the exploiter. And wherever there is exploitation of humanity in general, struggle against the exploiter is a must.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Where there is linguistic exploitation, the struggle should be directed against the oppressive language. If you are exploited in the mental sphere, if anybody tries to demean you, you will have to struggle against the person. If in the mental sphere anybody designs to deprive you of your moral rights, against that person also you will have to struggle. And if in the spiritual sphere you want to reach your Supreme Father, but some special force in the world obstructs your spiritual progress, creates obstacles on the path of your spiritual progress and upliftment, in that case also you will have to struggle against that force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In fact, life is a big struggle &ndash; rather the sum total of infinite struggles. A number of battles constitutes a war. Hence the saying of Bhagava&#x301;n Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a that once on the battlefield, you should never worry under any circumstances; you should only bear in mind that your aim is noble; and when the aim is noble, glorious and good, victory is inevitable. Simply throw those forces that create obstacles for you, like thorns on your path, into the dustbin. A task that may appear extremely difficult for a single individual, may be light work for eight or ten persons. And the same task will appear extremely easy when there are thousands of people together. So my advice to you is: &ldquo;Do all your works unitedly.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Sama&#x301;nii va a&#x301;ku&#x301;tih, sama&#x301;na&#x301; hrdaya&#x301;nivah [&ldquo;Let our aspirations be united, let our hearts be inseparable&rdquo;]. Do all your works unitedly. No work is hard for you, no work is difficult. Move forward easily and smilingly, solving all the problems of the world. Your victory is assured. It is within your grasp. When anyone does some virtuous work, Parama Purus&#x301;a is with that person. Under such circumstances, one need not even pray, &ldquo;O Lord, give me more strength,&rdquo; because since Parama Purus&#x301;a is with you, He will surely give you more strength. In fact He is always giving you more strength. So my advice is: &ldquo;Move ahead&rdquo; &ndash; Yuddhasva vigatajvarah<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> [&ldquo;Struggle must go on&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
