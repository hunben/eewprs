<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Psycho-economic exploitation is the latest form of dangerous and all-devouring capitalist exploitation. It is a special type of exploitation which first weakens and paralyses people psychologically in various ways, and then exploits them economically. Some of the methods of psycho-economic exploitation include, first, the suppression of the indigenous language and culture of the local people; secondly, the extensive propagation of pseudo-culture, exemplified by pornographic literature which debases people&#146;s minds and undermines the vitality of the youth; thirdly, the imposition of numerous restrictions on women, forcing them to be economically dependent on men; forthly, an unpsychological educational system with frequent political interference by vested interests; fifthly, the negation of dharma in the name of secularism; sixthly, the Balkanization of society into numerous castes and groups; seventhly, the damaging of society by the use of unnatural and harmful methods of birth control; and eighthly, placing the control over different mass media such as newspapers, radios and television, in the hands of the capitalists. Intellectual exploitation and psycho-economic exploitation are great dangers to the entire humanity today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->To counteract this threat, a powerful popular sentiment should be immediately generated for the liberation of intellect. For this, the first requisite factor is that the intellectuals in society must keep their intellects pure and unblemished. They will have to adjust to the level of the common people, casting aside their inertness and prejudicial notions. They should assist the masses in their development and extend their support to all anti-exploitation movements. This approach will ensure that exploitation is rooted out, the social structure is stabilized and the intellectual horizon of the human mind is expanded. If humanity follows such a path, human society will move forward to a brilliant future with rapid steps.<!-- /block --></p>
