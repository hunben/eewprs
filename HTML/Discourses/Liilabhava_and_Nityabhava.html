<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Entity is one without a second.  At that stage that Entity does not create anything. The flow of creation starts when Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma [Non-Qualified, or Non-Attributional, Supreme Entity] becomes Sagun&#x301;a [Attributional Supreme Entity]; and Prakrti [Operative Principle], which starts the creative flow, does not get the opportunity of unfolding Her creative faculty by Herself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a is the material cause on the basis of which Prakrti is creating the numerous entities. So when Brahma or His Prakrti is continuing the creation along the processes of sain&#x32D;cara and pratisain&#x32D;cara,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> that is the liila&#x301;bha&#x301;va of Parama Purus&#x301;a. One Purus&#x301;a becomes many. The quinquelemental universe with its innumerable entities with their varied shapes and sizes, forms and colours, has come into existence due to His liila&#x301;bha&#x301;va. (The word liila&#x301; means that the purpose of the game is not known, whereas the game whose purpose is known is kriida&#x301;. The term liila&#x301; is used in the case of the divine game only.) In nityabha&#x301;va, this varied expression is conspicuously absent. There Purus&#x301;a remains in His original stance, original rank, even though He is the source of this entire creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The sa&#x301;dhaka who looks at this expressed universe from the absolute point of view will see that all the five fundamental factors, the sky and the earth, the sun and the moon, have all vanished into nothingness; everything has merged into the Non-Attributional Entity. Ekoham&#x301; Sad vipra&#x301;h bahudha&#x301; vadanti &ndash; &ldquo;He is one, [intellectuals] describe Him variously.&rdquo;  When the same sa&#x301;dhaka (being associated with Purus&#x301;ottama [Nucleus Consciousness]) looks at this universe, he sees the universe with men and things and the various movements and actions. He will see different pictures at different angles, although he will look at the same thing from the same place. In the first case, he will see that Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, Purus&#x301;ottama, Bhagava&#x301;n and the universe are all non-existent, there being only one Supreme Entity &ndash; infinite, without any beginning or end, all-pervading &ndash; only Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. He is in His original rank &ndash; nityabha&#x301;va.  In the second case, he sees the universe with people and other living and non-living beings.  He sees the universe, with all the varied and kaleidoscopic creation. Which of the two is better is difficult to say because without both of these aspects, it is not possible to realize the madhura bha&#x301;va [sweet stance] of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
