<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Intellectuals and scholars say that one may attain salvation by dint of one&#146;s knowledge and intellect. Those who are <I>karma yogiis,</I> that is, those who follow the path of actional cult, say that by dint of action one will attain salvation. (Salvation means emancipation of permanent nature.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now you know all are children of the Supreme Father. All the children of the same father cannot have the same intellectual standard &ndash; it is an impossibility. But that does not mean that those who are intellectually backward will not get His bliss or Grace. So this idea is a defective one &ndash; that one is to attain Him by dint of one&#146;s intellectual knowledge or intellectual stamina. It is a defective idea. A father cannot neglect his son who is intellectually backward.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Not only this. Till recently there was a defective idea in all the corners and amongst all the groups of people on the earth, that males are blessed beings and not females. In your family life, you know, you feel, that the parents cannot have any sense of disparity in their mind regarding their sons and daughters. Both are equally important, both are equally loving. I said my sons and my daughters are just like two hands of mine. They are just like wings of a bird. A bird having one wing cannot fly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now the days of those defective ideas are gone. All are equally blessed human beings, and those ideas cherished by those intellectuals, that by dint of one&#146;s intellect, one will get Him, are not only defective but foolish ideas. Similarly, the idea that by dint of actional cult one is to attain Him &ndash; this is also a defective idea because in the realm of actionality all have not got equal status. A weak boy, or say a weak girl, physically weak or mentally weak or even weak in spiritual vitality, has also got the birth-right to attain salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->First, what is the meaning of salvation? Salvation means becoming one with Him, and each and every child of the Cosmic Father has equal right to sit on His lap. There cannot be any differentiation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now what is the guiding factor? Neither intellectuality nor the actional faculty is the guiding factor. Then what is the guiding factor? The guiding factor is that all your ideals, all your propensities, all your thought waves, are to be goaded unto Him. That is, the cult of devotion is the only cult. There cannot be any second cult in the realm of spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Moks&#x301;aka&#x301;ran&#x301;asamagrya&#x301;m&#x301; bhaktireva gariiyasii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The intellectual giant of India, about 1300 years ago, in the post-Buddhistic era, was Shankaracharya. He says &ndash; he was a giant intellectual &ndash; he said amongst all the approaches, amongst all the cults, the best one is the cult of devotion. So that aspirant is the blessed one who has developed this cult of devotion. You may or may not be an intellectual, you may or may not be established in the actional faculty. But if you can develop love for Him, devotion for Him, you are sure to be successful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now how to develop this cult of devotion? The idea is that the All, the entire Universe, is His object, and He is the Supreme Subject. He sees everything and you do not see Him. Now how can He be objectivated when He is the Supreme Subjectivity? The idea, the spirit or the secret to develop devotional cult is to think, while doing anything, while doing any mundane duty or doing any spiritual practice &ndash; you should always remember that He is Subject, He is seeing what you are doing. He is hearing what you are thinking. You cannot do anything secretly. He is always with you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->This idea has got one advantage and one disadvantage. The disadvantage is that you cannot even think secretly. All your thoughts are tape-recorded by Him. You cannot think secretly. And the advantage is that you are never alone; He is always with you. You are never helpless, you are never shelterless, you are never weak, you are the strongest personality of the universe, because the Supreme Entity is always with you.<!-- /block --></p>
