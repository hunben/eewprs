<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Have you heard the story about the two women who had a conversation from opposite banks of a pond in Burdwan district? One was the elder sister of the Bose brothers and the other was the elder sister of the Mittir brothers. Both women were slightly deaf.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Mrs. Mittir said, &ldquo;Hello, Mrs. Bose, how are you? Quite well, I trust?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;So you&#146;ve heard the news too,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Bose. &ldquo;It&#146;s a scandalous story, isn&#146;t it? It&#146;s hardly surprising the news reached you so quickly. I was making puffed rice when the wretched thief came and stole the papaya. Since then I&#146;ve been crying my eyes out.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Very good! Very good!&rdquo; said Mrs. Mittir. &ldquo;That&#146;s wonderful news. Did you hear the sad news that the second brother of the Chatterjee family passed away last night?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Excellent! Excellent!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Bose. &ldquo;I&#146;m glad to hear that. I was planning to offer the papaya to Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, but the damned thief has ruined everything. What a wretch!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Were you asking whom Mr. Chatterjee left behind?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Mittir. &ldquo;Well, he left behind a daughter. His son-in-law rushed from Chandannagar to his house as soon as he heard the news.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;It&#146;s quite natural for you to feel sad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bose. &ldquo;Had I lost my pearl necklace I could have tolerated the grief, but the loss of the papaya is too much to bear.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Do you want to know what the son-in-law does?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Mittir. &ldquo;He&#146;s quite a good chap&#8230; very well educated. He used to teach at Khandaghose school. Now he&#146;s a professor at Uttarpara college.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;It&#146;s normal to feel so heartbroken,&rdquo; consoled Mrs. Bose. &ldquo;Anyone who heard this story in any part of the world would feel the same. It was such a huge, juicy papaya, and so sweet. It was tastier than Jessore palm and as sweet as a lump of molasses.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
