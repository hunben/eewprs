<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There are some people who deliver hollow lectures on economics or philosophy and make others believe that these ideas or theories will be able to bring about the economic emancipation of the people and unite them. They view everybody else in terms of their utility without creating in them any incentive or inspiration for or interest in work, and without recognizing the special value of an individual&#146;s efficiency. By delivering superficial talks and propagating empty slogans, they in fact surreptitiously create artificial divisions among human beings. Whenever there is even a slight blow to these divisive sentiments, they protect themselves by claiming that because they are engaged in political affairs which cannot be called social crimes, punishment is not possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Many people blindly follow the dogma of so-called religions. A religion is a collection of &ldquo;isms&rdquo;, and an &ldquo;ism&rdquo; is a collection of dogma. (In common language &ldquo;religion&rdquo; is equilavant to the Sanskrit word dharma, but in philosophical language &ldquo;religion&rdquo; and dharma are not the same thing.) A religion which deals in abstract ideas related to unit consciousness, Supreme Consciousness and the manifest world is not the only type of religion. There are some &ldquo;isms&rdquo;, based upon various types of dogma, which sound and function as religions in the socio-economic sphere. And just as religions often impart defective teachings to human beings and incite them to communal conflict, likewise these particular &ldquo;isms&rdquo; cause human beings to degenerate to the level of animality in the name of class struggle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The people belonging to the same religion are divided into various groups and sub-groups. For example, Jainism has Shveta&#x301;mbar, Digambar and Thera&#x301;panthii sects. Among the Buddhists there are Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii, Hiinaya&#x301;nii, La&#x301;ma&#x301;va&#x301;dii, Sthavirva&#x301;da, Sammitiiya, etc., sects. Likewise, in socio-economic religion you must have seen how a particular political or economic party fragments into many branches due to minor differences of opinion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This has happened, is happening and will continue to happen. It should be clearly understood. Just as the present world suffers from intense oppression due to religion, so does it face disintegration due to the intimidating threats of socio-economic religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Peace-loving, civilized human beings will have to find a way to protect themselves from these problems. They will have to act. Following the path of morality, human beings will have to move towards liberation with perseverance and rationality. There is no other way.<!-- /block --></p>
