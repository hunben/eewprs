<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Most people suffer from either a superiority complex or an inferiority complex. A balanced state of mind is one of the most essential qualities that one should possess. It is that state in which a person does not suffer from any complex, that is, neither from superiority complex nor from inferiority complex, neither from fear complex nor from hate complex. People should be free from each and every kind of complex, they should not suffer from any of these. People have many vices and virtues. One of the virtues is to be free from any kind of complex. What is vice?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Nidra&#x301; tandra&#x301; bhayam&#x301; krodha a&#x301;lasyam&#x301; diirghasu&#x301;trata&#x301;,<br>Ete ha&#x301;tavya&#x301;h, sadados&#x301;a&#x301;h bhu&#x301;timicchata&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In this manifested world there are six kinds of main vices &ndash; nidra&#x301;, tandra&#x301;, bhaya, krodha, a&#x301;lasya, and diirghasu&#x301;trata&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Nidra&#x301; means sleep. No one should be a slave to this habit. Tandra&#x301; means you are hearing but your mind is somewhere else. I will tell you one story on tandra&#x301; from the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. (The Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a is a pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, it is not a narration of facts, but an educative story. When something has got some educative value it is called a pura&#x301;n&#x301;a.) Rama and Laksmana went in exile. Laksmana took the responsibility of security but he felt sleepy. This became very embarrassing for him and he picked up his bow and arrows ready to attack the goddess of sleep. On seeing this the goddess of sleep told Laksmana that it was not fitting for such a brave and gallant man as him to attack a woman with his arrow. Laksmana replied that he was on security duty. They then made a pact that the goddess of sleep would not sit on his eyelids for fourteen years, that is, till the period of exile was over. On returning to Ayodhya, after the lapse of fourteen years, Rama&#146;s coronation ceremony was held and on that occasion Laksmana was fanning Ramchandra. As the period of fourteen years was over, Laksmana felt sleepy. He was about to pick up his bow and arrows but the goddess of sleep protested saying that she had come after fourteen years in accordance with their pact and so Laksmana had no right to use his bow and arrows. Laksmana entreated that he was very busy waving a fan for Ramchandra and should therefore be spared from sleep on that occasion. The goddess asked where she should go as she had already arrived with her full force. Laksmana suggested that she should go and sit on the eye lids of any sinners who might be attending a spiritual function. So be careful, all of you, and do not sleep when you come to attend a spiritual function.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Bhayam [fear]. Fear complex is another human shortcoming. The other remaining vices are krodha [anger]; a&#x301;lasya [lethargy] and diirghasutrata (procrastination, that is to postpone today&#146;s work for tomorrow and then for the day after).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Maintaining a balanced mind is one of the greatest virtues. There are no complexes in a balanced mind. One neither feels inferior nor superior to others; one never fears anybody nor ever gets perturbed. One maintains a mental balance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Inferiority and superiority complexes &ndash; not fear complex which is altogether different &ndash; arise due to a defective social order. Some people have to live like slaves in the society and thus suffer from a strong inferiority complex &ndash; their heads remain forever bowed &ndash; while others inherit vast wealth as well as family pride from their ancestors and keep their heads held so high that at times it appears as if it will fall backwards. These complexes are due to a defective social order. The complex is in the crude physical world and in the socio-economic strata, not in the stratum of spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There cannot be any complex in the spiritual level or existential sphere. In spirituality there is no complex because every person has contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a on a purely personal level. There is no third existence between them. There are only two &ndash; the spiritualist and the Parama Pita&#x301; [Cosmic Father]. Spiritualists move towards the Cosmic Father and sit on His lap. To do this is every one&#146;s birthright. Nobody can be debarred from doing so on the pretext of inferior caste, colour, education or poverty. Since this is every one&#146;s birthright there cannot be any complex in the arena of spirituality. The defective social order injects an inferiority complex in the mind which often persists even when people enter the spiritual field. They feel that as the Cosmic Father is so great, how can they, being of low caste or poor or uneducated, go to Him? This is called mahimnabodha in the sha&#x301;stras [scriptures]. But one should not forget that the relation of father and child exists. Even if the father is a great scholar, the uneducated child will go to him and ask for whatever he requires because he or she has affection for the father. Just now I said that in the field of spirituality there cannot be any complex, but there are complexes due to social defects. It is our spiritual duty to rectify the social order. If we fail, there may not be good spiritualists. Even those who have the potentiality to become good spiritualists may not progress. They may be like a flower that dies before it blossoms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->I cannot allow this to happen. For this reason the theory of Prout has been given so that every person can progress speedily in the field of spirituality without any complex.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In the existential sphere, too, there should not be any complex because every one is the child of the Cosmic Father. If there is any superiority complex, it should be the common one that one is the child of the Cosmic Father who is so great, so potent. One may only have this superiority complex. Whatever people possess is given by the Cosmic Father and therefore no individual has the right to have a superiority complex. So in the existential sphere there is no reason for any complex to remain. In other words it can be said that there will be a common complex that all are the children of the Cosmic Father, no one being inferior and no one being superior.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is neither nearer nor further away from anybody because it is His duty to look after His children. Since it is His duty to look after them, He will take proper care of them. He will take proper care of each and every human being and see everything. He has to do so even if He does not like it, because this is His duty. Suppose a son falls into bad company when he reaches the age of twenty and forms the habit of smoking cigarettes. He may not want his father to know about his smoking habit but the Cosmic Father sees everything. He may not say anything because the son may blush! He has to be with everyone to keep Himself informed of everything they do so that He can take proper care. Therefore He is associated with each individual unit and this is called ota yoga. Collectively He is associated with all and this is called prota yoga. Parama Purus&#x301;a sees those who are in an existential form, that is, physical body. He also sees those who have left the physical form and have not got a new physical body but are in the existential world. He is with all of them. Parama Purus&#x301;a is with everyone therefore no one can be inferior or superior. As such, in the existential sphere there cannot be any sort of complex, and our social order should be such that there remains no room for any complex. We have to make such a social order and we have to make it immediately without any loss of time.<!-- /block --></p>
