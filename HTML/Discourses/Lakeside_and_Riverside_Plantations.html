<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->A few hundred years ago, many of the desert regions that we see in different parts of the world today were full of trees and wildlife. Due to tree felling by local people and commercial interests, and the depletion of the subterranean water, the deserts have spread.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Many problems occur with the disappearance of trees.  First, the carbon dioxide content in the air rises as there are fewer plants to absorb the carbon dioxide which is constantly being expired into the atmosphere. This results in changes in the atmosphere and the environment, causing climatic warming. If there is a rise of only a few feet in the level of the oceans, many major cities in the world, including Calcutta, could be flooded. In addition,  as the catchment areas are destroyed, rivers reduce their flow of water or dry up. Also, the area around the rivers is transformed into a desert, as in the case of the Nile and the Ganges. Finally, the organic processes in the soil are halted. The micro-organisms die, and so do the worms, while the organic matter breaks down and ceases to retain water. Hence, the soil making process is stopped.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Central Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was full of lush flora, wildlife and large rivers three thousand years ago. Even thirty years ago there were many trees and dense forests in the region. Now there are hardly any trees, few wild animals, and the rivers have almost dried up. For eight months of the year, the region is dry. The soil is hard and barren, contains few worms or micro-organisms and little organic material, which acts like a sponge to retain the rainwater. The annual rains wash away much of the topsoil that still exists, hence the remaining soil has become coarse and sandy. As a result, the whole region is subjected to flash floods and severe soil erosion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->To transform this depleted and undernourished environment, a massive, scientific afforestation programme has to be launched. Such a programme should have a two-phased approach:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->1) In the first phase, fast growing trees which grow to their full height in six months to two years and provide valuable green cover should be planted.  Ten types of trees can be used: 1. cassuarina 2. sisir (Albezzia lebbeck) 3. sisoo (Dalbergia) 4. bakphul (Sesbania grandiflora) 5. large screwpine (Pandanus andamanensium) 6. drumstick (Moringa oleifera) 7. red sandalwood (Santalum album) 8. agave (sisal, Agave americana) 9. Diospyros discolor, and 10. cha&#x301;mal (Eterocarpus chaplasa, Roxb.), a wild variety of jackfruit found in north east India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->2) In the second phase, slow growing trees like teak, which also provides green cover and can be harvested after 30 years or so, should be planted. The fast growing trees can be cut after three years, providing an additional source of income for local people. If this approach is followed, the ecological balance in the area will be restored very quickly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In addition to this approach, some selected plants need to be grown in desert regions to check the process of desertification. For example, in dry, sandy areas we can grow jojoba which produces seeds that yield oil which can be substituted for diesel oil. Different cactii, Acacia catechu or Acacia arabica can also be grown. Afforestation is the only solution to desertification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Artificial Ponds and Lakes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->For afforestation programmes to be successful, surface water must be conserved. This can best be accomplished by increasing the water capacity of existing storage systems and building new systems. The cheapest and easiest method of creating new water storage systems is to construct small-scale ponds and lakes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Where should artificial ponds and lakes be located? In the rainy season observe where the surface water flows &ndash; its currents and directions &ndash; and where the rivulets created from the rain water converge together.  The point of convergence is the ideal location for a lake. The bigger the catchment area, the bigger the number of rivulets, so the bigger the pond or lake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->How should an artificial lake be constructed? If there is no modern machinery, a rectangular area should be selected in the middle of the proposed site and line after line of earth dug out. The soil should be deposited around the periphery to form the slopes and ridges of the banks. The lake should be only five feet deep to avoid accidents and drowning. A boundary wall topped with angled irons which are connected with wire should be constructed to keep animals out. Along the wall, wire plants may be grown, and inside the wall palm trees can be planted. On the flat areas, surface plants may be cultivated. The lake can be any shape. Underground culverts or channels may also be constructed so that water from the surrounding countryside can flow through the culverts into the lake. There should also be name plates beside each lake which specify the opening hours, the depth of the lake and any other prescribed details. People should only be permitted to swim and fish in some specified lakes, while boating should be allowed on larger lakes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->To prevent water seeping out immediately after the lake has been constructed, earth from the beds of other lakes can be spread across the lake floor. Alternatively, the earth on the bottom of the lake can be mixed with calcium, although this may harm the  aquatic plants and fish. If sealing the lake is not urgent, nature will perform this task. After the lake has contained water for some time, a fine layer of clay will naturally form on the bed of the lake, sealing the bottom and preventing the water from seeping away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In central Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h most of the rain water is lost as there is very little organic material in the soil to retain it. To conserve the water, many small ponds and lakes should be conctructed.  If this is done, the surface water can be stored and used for drinking and irrigation. Within a short time the environment will be totally transformed and the ecological balance will be restored.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->There are five categories of small-scale lakes: <ol> <li>A category lakes, which contain over 31,000 gallons of water, <li>B category lakes, which contain 25,000 to 31,000 gallons of water, <li>C category lakes, which contain 20,000 to 25,000 gallons of water, <li>D category lakes, which contain 10,000 to 20,000 gallons of water, <li>E category lakes, which contain under 10,000 gallons of water. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Lakeside Plantations<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Five types of plants should be used around lakes: slope plants, boundary plants, wire plants, aquatic plants and surface plants. These types can be summarised as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->1) Slope plants &ndash; includes  pineapple, asparagus, aloe vera, brinjal and chilli. All of these plants conserve water and check soil erosion, and can also provide an income for local people. Slope plants should always be planted in symmetrical horizontal lines and never in vertical lines, as this allows the water to flow away and encourages soil erosion. Along with pineapple, asparagus and aloe vera, brinjal and chilli should be planted as per the seasonal order. For example, in the summer season, green leafy summer vegetables, small bitter gourd and summer round brinjal of the makada variety can be planted. In the rainy season, caladium, chilli and rainy season brinjal which is not exactly round can be planted. In the winter season winter red chilli should be planted. This variety of chilli can be dried, packed in bags and sold when the market price is high. It is utilized as a cooking spice. Large, white autumn brinjal can also be planted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Should the slopes beside lakes be terraced? Terraces prevent the run off of surface water and soil erosion. As a general rule, all sloping land should be terraced as far as possible. While it may not always be possible to terrace small slopes, large hills and sloping agricultural land should always be terraced. The mounds and furrows on sloping land must be dug perpendicular, not parallel, to the slope. Where a gentle slope ends and a steep slope commences, both slopes should be terraced, but the terracing on the steep slope should be constructed high up the slope so that soil erosion and the rapid flow of water is checked. Roads which go through sloping terrain should be constructed so that the water runs off in a regulated way without damaging the land.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Where the boundary line of a slope touches a river, just above the extreme lowest portion of the slope, a row of banyan and palmyra trees should be planted alternately. Where the slope starts, custard apples, guavas etc. should be planted. Between two custard apples and guavas, agave should be planted in the same row, not in separate rows. This system will help to check the soil erosion around the base of a steep slope and also protect the banks of the river.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->One row of either East Indies or West Indies pineapple can also be planted on the boundary line of any slope between sha&#x301;l and Indian olive, between shaid and cinnamon, or between sha&#x301;l and himalayana devadaru.  Also, one row of pineapple can be planted on the boundary line of a slope where it touches a field. The pineapples may or may not bear fruit if there is scanty rainfall, but they will definately check soil erosion. The West Indies variety requires less rainfall than the East Indies variety.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->2) Boundary plants &ndash; includes  palm trees and the creepers of flowers, vegetables and fruits. Palm trees should be planted around lakes according to their water capacity. For example, coconut trees should be planted around A category lakes, palmyra around B category lakes, betel nut palms  around C category lakes, date palms around D category lakes, and tall banana trees around E category lakes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Creepers should also be grown along with the trees. Coconut trees should be combined with black pepper creepers; palmyra with jasmine creepers; betel nut with lavender; and date with the following medicinal creepers: 1. malehmal &ndash; diirgha lata, 2. harjora, 3. ananta mula, 4. ishanmula, 5. shveta makal, 6. gulain&#x32D;ca lata, 7. jayanti lata, 8. shveta kuce, 9. rakta kuce, 10. rakta kambel, 11. choi, and 12. black pepper. Only one type of creeper should be planted by each lake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->3) Wire plants &ndash; a brick  wall should be built around each lake and topped by angle irons and wire. The fence will keep out large animals and prevent people from having accidents. Along the wire the following plants should be grown &ndash; creeping vegetables such as beans, bottle gourd, squash and pumpkin; flowers such as aparajita, morning glory and moonflowers; and fruits such as melon, passion fruit, grape, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->4) Aquatic plants &ndash; are of two types: thorny and non-thorny. The thorny aquatic plants include the lotus, makhana and Victoria regina. The lotus produces vegetables and provides organic matter to the water. Makhana seeds are very nutritious and can be sold at a good price. Victoria regina can be grown in beauty spots. All these plants are known for their beauty. Non-thorny aquatic plants include the water lily and the water chestnut. The water lily has edible seeds as well as floral nectar, and the water chestnut provides edible roots which can be used as a vegetable or a fruit which is good for the stomach. Aquatic plants can generate income for local people. Thorny and non-thorny aquatic plants should not be grown together.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->5) Surface plants &ndash; should be  grown on the flat  land surrounding the lake. Anything can be here according to the local preference and the condition of the soil. Banyan (Ficus benghalenses), bo tree (Ficus religiosa), Acacia catechu, Acacia arabica as well as thorny and dry climate trees can be grown in rocky areas. Lotus, makhana, water lily, water chestnuts, pineapple and bitter date palm grow very well in or beside ponds and lakes. If these plants are cultivated properly, they will be very productive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->All lakes should be treated as beauty spots. Pineapple, asparagus and aloe vera should be planted on the slopes, along with different types of brinjal and chilli. Different varieties of slope and aquatic plants should also be planted in and around the lakes so that each lake has its own particular charm and beauty according to its size and location.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Pisciculture should also be developed in ponds and lakes. The fish help to keep the water clean and the level constant because their breathing creates water and carbon dioxide. The fish inhale oxygen along with water vapour from the atmosphere as well as dissolved oxygen from the water. They synthesize water which is exhaled into the lake. This helps to keep the water in the lake at a constant level. If many fish live in a lake, hundreds and even thousands of gallons of water will be added to the size of the lake in the course of time. Each lake should also have an attached bird sanctuary, because the fish provide food for the birds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The recommended depth of small-scale artificial lakes is five feet. If the lake is located in a hot dry climate with high levels of evaporation, the depth should be increased to ten feet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Fish without gills, like prawns, chingry and tortoises can survive with thorny aquatic plants, but some other fish cannot, so thorny and non-thorny aquatic plants should be grown seperately. Fish that are good for pisiculture include small fish, crabs and prawns, like charamach, koira, guri and rai mach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Riverside Plantations<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Riverside plantations are important for preventing floods, conserving water, regulating the flow of water in rivers, and keeping soil moist and fertile. Some examples of plants which are useful riverside trees include banyan, date palm, neem or margosa, tamarind, simul, imli and fruit trees. If horticulture is developed along the banks of rivers, the rivers will never dry up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Most trees with tap root systems do not alleviate riverside erosion, but eucalyptus is an exception. Trees with tap roots  draw water from deep under the ground. Many tap root trees growing in an area can lower the water table and deprive other plants of water, and this can be an additional factor in the creation of desert conditions. For example, eucalyptus trees have contributed to the sparse, arid conditions in Australia. Eucalyptus trees are suitable for planting in marshy areas to help dry them out and are useful for preventing grass fires, but they are not recommended as part of a reforestation programme. As eucalyptus helps check riverside erosion, it can also be a useful riverside tree, but it should always be planted in association with other trees. An example of a riverside plantation is neem, tamarind, simul and eucalyptus. Between each of these trees, palmyra and date palm should be planted alternately. A second example is imli, neem and simul in either of two configurations &ndash; imli, neem, imli, etc. or imli, simul, imli, etc. Imli is a good riverside plant because it retains water and checks soil erosion. It has an extremely fibrous root system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Fibrous roots gather water near the surface and benefit neighbouring plants and trees. Many banyan trees have been planted along the seven rivers in A&#x301;nanda Nagar for this reason. Previously, only one river ran throughout the year at A&#x301;nanda Nagar, but now all seven rivers flow almost all year round, right up to mid-March. The dry season starts in October and extends to June. Riverside plantations have shown tremendous positive effects within only one year at A&#x301;nanda Nagar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The rivers in A&#x301;nanda Nagar are: 1) Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a (southern); 2) Uttara (northern); 3) Kunti (mother of the Pandava brothers), previously called Kopia, meaning angry, because of flash floods; 4) Alka&#x301;nanda, meaning the river coming from heaven, and previously called Alkusi (which often gave lots of trouble due to flash floods and the subsequent damage this caused); 5) Guaki, which is loop-shaped, and is actually the confluence of the Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a and Uttara; 6) Para&#x301;gati; and 7) Manda&#x301;kinii. India used to be called the land of the seven rivers, and now A&#x301;nanda Nagar is the land of the seven rivers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Trees which should be planted along the rivers at A&#x301;nanda Nagar are the indigenous neem, bakayan neem or gudra neem, eucalyptus, tamarind and simul. Tea gardens can also be planted along the river banks. Patal may be grown on the banks of the streams in Purulia district.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Land and water hyacinths originated in Brazil. Mr. Lee, the Divisional Commissioner of Dhaka, and his wife visited Brazil. Mrs. Lee liked the water hyacinths and brought them to the Divisional Commissioners house in Dhaka. From there they spread into the Durhi Ganga. Within ten years they spread to Bengal, and within fifty years to Uttar Pradesh. Now they have spread throughout the whole of India. In Bengali they are called &ldquo;kachuri patra&rdquo; and in Hindi &ldquo;jalakumbhi&rdquo;. Water hyacinths are good for producing bio-gas. Lily ponds should be located far from rivers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->So, lakeside and riverside plantations stop soil erosion, nourish the top soil and assist in providing a steady supply of water throughout the year. This method of plantation should be adopted everywhere.<!-- /block --></p>
