<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->As I mentioned before, phallus worship was the first step to the oldest form of religious thinking. The people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, who had heartily embraced Shaeva Dharma, started worshipping Shiva without crafting Shiva idols. They did, however, build Shiva temples. Though afterwards Jainism spread everywhere in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, Shiva remained unaffected. His influence did not decrease at all. It was Digambara Jainism that Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was under the influence of. All the idols of the Tiirthaun&#x32D;karas that have been found so far in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are naked. Under the influence of Digambar Jainism, Shiva became naked as well. But what is found in Shiva&#146;s dhya&#x301;na mantra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[One should constantly meditate on Maheshvara, who is like a silver mountain, whose ornament is the lovely moon &ndash;<br>Whose limbs are brightened with the splendour of jewels, with axe in hand, holding animals, bestowing boons, ever-blissful &ndash;<br>Seated in lotus posture, wearing a tiger-skin, worshipped by all the gods &ndash;<br>The seed, the cause of this vast world, who removes the boundless fears of the entire universe &ndash; the One with five faces and three eyes.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In other words, Shiva was clad in tiger-skin. But the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h said about Shiva: A&#x301;didev digambar bhola&#x301;na&#x301;th ka&#x301;shiishvar [&ldquo;O original god, unclothed, ever-merciful, the Lord of Ka&#x301;shii (Varanasi)&rdquo;]. So in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h Shiva was depicted as Nya&#x301;m&#x301;t&#x301;eshvara [Naked God]. A poet of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h has composed a song in this respect:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->It was all as a result of the nudistic Jain influence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->It has been said before that the idols of the Tiirthaun&#x32D;karas found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were all naked. Mahavir himself was nirgrantha [without clothes], or digambara. But the populace never did accept nudism. So the Jain gods imagined by them are all clothed and adorned with ornaments. In short, in the depths of their minds the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were all followers of Shaeva Dharma. It was like an enamelled ornament; the gold underneath was Shaeva Dharma and the enamel was Digambara Jaena Dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It was under the influence mainly of Jainism and secondarily of Buddhism that the festivals of Car&#x301;aka and Shiva Ga&#x301;jan made their appearances in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Where the Buddhist influence is greater, Car&#x301;aka and Ga&#x301;jan are observed on Vaesha&#x301;khii Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301; [the full-moon day in the Bengali month of Vaesha&#x301;kh, i.e., Buddha&#146;s birthday]. Where the influence of Shaeva Dharma is greater, they are observed on Caetra Sam&#x301;kra&#x301;nti [last day of the last month of the Bengali year]. Where the influence of Jainism is greater, they are celebrated on the Jain festival day. The word Bola&#x301;n is widespread in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. It is a special festival. Bola&#x301;n has come from the [verb] bala&#x301; [&ldquo;speak&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The devotees used to say aloud: Shiva balo [&ldquo;Say &lsquo;Shiva&rsquo;&rdquo;]. This balo turned into bola&#x301;n in the same way as Car&#x301;aka came from cakra and Ga&#x301;jan came from garjan [Car&#x301;aka and Ga&#x301;jan were two other festivals related to Shiva.] The devotees of Shiva shook the air all around them, crying, Shiva he [&ldquo;Hey Shiva!&rdquo;]. This Bola&#x301;n ritual is observed especially in those areas where Burdwan, Birbhum and Murshidabad Districts all meet. At one time all these areas &ndash; not only these areas, but the entire Ajay and Hingula river basins &ndash; were regarded as deep-dyed Shiva areas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The enamel that covered the religious life of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h disappeared under the influence of Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma, while the innate Shaeva Dharma continued to remain like the subterranean flow of the Phalgu River. No village of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is without a Shiva temple. A village without a Shiva temple is regarded as unholy. The people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h accept Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma and act in accordance with Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma, yet intrinsically they are all Shaivites.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The Sha&#x301;kta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  influence on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is negligible. A hundred years ago, also, Durga&#x301; Puja&#x301; did not have much influence on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Durga&#x301; Puja&#x301; is a sensationalistic festival. It has little meaning for the common people. They simply don new clothes and hop the Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; pandels.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The common people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h do not follow the marriage and other systems dictated by the Brahmans. They are observed according to the simple Shaeva system. Besides, the sa&#x301;un&#x32D;a&#x301; [the un&#x32D; here is pronounced &ldquo;ng&rdquo;], the wedding of a man who has somehow (through death or divorce) lost his wife, or a woman who has somehow lost her husband, is solemnized everywhere in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h without the participation of Brahmans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It is Shiva who is the original god. He is called Bur&#x301;a&#x301; Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  by the villagers. All the deities of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are somehow or other related to Shiva. For example, Manasa&#x301; is said to be Shiva&#146;s daughter. Likewise, one goddess may be Shiva&#146;s shakti (wife), others His daughters or His sisters. The priests of those deities of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h which have been denied the status of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika gods all belong to one or another original Bengalee community.<!-- /block --></p>

This vyu&#x301;d&#x301;ha Shiva in later times, and in modern Bengali, became bur&#x301;o Shiva.
