<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Of all the doctrines centred around Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is considered to be the most important. Let us see how far it is possible to analyse Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a from the viewpoint of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da or Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The life of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was intensely practical, whereas Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is an impractical, visionary philosophy that floats in the air. Many take delight in moving in this world of fantasy, the world of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, and losing all contact with the world of reality. Although the role played by Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a extended throughout the three spheres of existence, His sweetness was felt most in the spiritual sphere. Yet even so, when I analysed Him in the light of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da suffered an ignoble defeat. How then will it be possible to judge Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi in such a light? Though it is an extremely difficult thing, still I must make the attempt, but the question is, how? One idea comes to mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The Vivekacud&#x301;a&#x301;man&#x301;i and the Mohamudgaraka<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->People generally consider the two books Vivekacud&#x301;a&#x301;man&#x301;i and Mohamudgaraka to be something related to practical life, or to the materialization of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da in the quinquelemental realm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, as we have already observed, was an intensely practical man. He worked hard not only to promote the spiritual elevation and psychic welfare of human beings, but also to satisfy their needs for food, clothing, education, medical care and accommodation. He tried to bring all rational people, kings as well as commoners, together under one banner for the establishment of dharmara&#x301;jya, the rule of morality, so that all could live in peace and prosperity. How can we judge the life and personality of such an intensely practical man in the light of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da? It is like trying to measure milk with a tape measure. Of course there are things that can be measured with a tape measure, but how can we measure liquids in that way? And how can we measure Parama Purus&#x301;a with the tape measure of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da? Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi represents the universal existence of Parama Purus&#x301;a; He is the Sarvabhaoma Satta&#x301; [Supreme All-Pervasive Entity].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You know that the word bhu&#x301;mi [the root of sarvabhaoma] is synonymous with vasu. Vasu or bhu&#x301;mi means a land which people can inhabit without any difficulty. And where people live their mundane existence is this quinquelemental world. And who is the Entity who makes suitable arrangements for human beings and other jiivas in this quinquelemental world? It is Parama Purus&#x301;a who does, so He is surely the Bhaomika of the physical world. [And sarva means &ldquo;all&rdquo;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->You all know that in ancient and medieval Bengal, the landlords used the surname Bhaomika.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In modern Bengali it is Bhuniya. They are both derived from the word bhu&#x301;mi. Parama Purus&#x301;a is called the Bhaomika of the quinquelemental world because it is He who holds the key to the solution of all mundane problems.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There is another world, the psychic world, the psychic bhu&#x301;mi, which lies beyond this mundane world. It is a world of innumerable feelings, emotions, sentiments, etc. From where do people draw their inspiration for these things? From Parama Purus&#x301;a, certainly. So Parama Purus&#x301;a is not only the Bhaomika of the physical world, He is the Bhaomika, the Lord, of the psychic world as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Beyond the physical and psychic spheres lies the spiritual sphere. A person, whatever may be his or her degree of spiritual elevation, possesses an a&#x301;tmika satta&#x301; [unit consciousness] which shines out like a diamond in a heap of coal. But where does the effulgence of that a&#x301;tmika satta&#x301; come from? Certainly from Parama Purus&#x301;a, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. So He is Lord, or Bhaomika, of the spiritual realm as well. His existence is tribhaomika.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->If Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is the tape measure, how will it measure that Parama Purus&#x301;a who is the Lord of the three realms?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Still, we have to try to measure Him in the light of the so-called practical interpretations of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da. They say:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Pita&#x301; kasya ma&#x301;ta&#x301; kasya kasya bhra&#x301;ta&#x301; sahodara&#x301;;<br>Ka&#x301;yapra&#x301;n&#x301;e na sambandha vrtha&#x301; ka&#x301; parivedana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[Father, mother, brother and sister are non-existent, so where is the relationship between the ka&#x301;ya (body) and the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a (vital energy)?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Who is one&#146;s father, who is one&#146;s mother, who is one&#146;s brother, and who is one&#146;s sister in this world? No one exists.&rdquo; Look, human beings come into this world and attend to so many duties. Among so many fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, you will come across some who spend their whole lives maintaining their younger brothers and sisters. There are others who spend their lives caring for their ailing parents. Many people look upon human beings as God Himself and throw themselves into the service of humanity abandoning their families and personal comforts. Defying all obstacles &ndash; the dense forests, the towering mountains, the stormy oceans &ndash; they travel throughout the world promoting the welfare of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->It is the sense of duty that causes one person to renounce everything; and it is the sense of duty that inspires another person to readily accept the burden of caring for his or her family. It is the sense of duty that makes a person great. Of all bonds, the bond of duty is the strongest, and the bond of moha [blind attachment or infatuation] is the worst. Humanity will have to break the bonds of moha and increase the bonds of duty willingly and consciously. This is the law. So if we say that human beings, our friends and relations, have no existence, are all Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and as such unreal, then whom shall we serve? If you tell a teacher that all his or her students are unreal, then why should he or she devote six hours a day to teaching them? Even to take care of one&#146;s family goes against the doctrine of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da &ndash; as does the life of renunciation, cutting off all relations with the worldly family in order to serve the world &ndash; because the family does not exist, nor does the world. If one sincerely accepts Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, then the only thing to do is to adopt the Pi-pu-phi-shu policy,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> that is, remain inert and do nothing at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Then the question arises whether or not adherents of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da should eat. I suggest that they should not eat, because the rice, dal, rasagolla&#x301; and ra&#x301;jabhoga that they will eat are also Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. I will go one step further and say that they should not live either, for in order to live one must breathe in and breathe out, and air is also Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, so they should stop that breathing in and out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->It is said, ka&#x301;ya pra&#x301;n&#x301;e na sambandha vrtha&#x301; ka&#x301; parivedana&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Ka&#x301;ya means &ldquo;that which is collected from different sources&rdquo;. Our human body is composed of water, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, iron, a little gold, minute quantities of silver, and a considerable amount of calcium. As our body is a collection of various elements coming from various sources, it is known as ka&#x301;ya in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->When the world itself is non-existent, then how can there be any carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc? They must also be non-existent. The fundamental tenet of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is that your body has no existence and thus you have no connection with the rest of the world, for human beings are connected to the rest of the world through their bodies. How  can there be any practical application of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da without the existence of the physical body? There cannot be. Moreover, as I have already said, the Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dins should give up food, since they have no body. Thus it follows that the practical application of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is impossible; it is a mere fantasy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Our next point of discussion is pra&#x301;n&#x301;a. In Sanskrit, when pra&#x301;n&#x301;a is used in plural form, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h, it means &ldquo;vital energies&rdquo; or &ldquo;life&rdquo;, and when used in the singular form, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a simply means &ldquo;energy&rdquo;. The Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dins do not explain this point clearly, nor is it necessary, because vital energy is the transmuted form of different physical energies. They assert that the physical body has no relationship with the various forms of physical energy. A sensible person may raise a point here. When the physical body itself is non-existent, then the question of it having any connection with the external world does not arise. Then is it not redundant to use the term pra&#x301;n&#x301;a? &ndash; for pra&#x301;n&#x301;a does not exist either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Obviously, in the absence of energy, its acoustic root ra does not exist either. In ancient times, a section of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dins would never utter the sound ra because there was no such thing as energy; they would say it was all Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. For instance, they would pronounce &ldquo;Ra&#x301;macandra&rdquo; as &ldquo;A&#x301;macandra&rdquo;. However, the days of such crazy notions are long gone. The human beings of today have made enormous intellectual progress. They will no longer accept any illogical or irrational proposition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->According to the previous shloka, the human body and its vital energy have no relationship. If that were so, how could that gentleman who advances such peculiar ideas operate his vocal cords? The vocal cords operate with the help of vital energy. A healthy person can speak clearly; a sick person will mumble some words in a feeble voice due to the shortage of vital energy. What does common sense suggest? It suggests that people have both life and a physical body. Nothing is permanent in this phenomenal world, neither the body nor the vital energy, but at this moment they do exist. &ldquo;Do not be concerned about anything in the world. Do not bother unnecessarily as to how human beings will progress or how collective development can be brought about. All these do not actually exist,&rdquo; is the practical application of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301; tava ka&#x301;nta&#x301; kaste putrah sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ro&#146;yamatiivavicitrah [&ldquo;Who is your wife? Who is your son? The world is very strange.&rdquo;]. Kasya tvam&#x301; va&#x301; kutah a&#x301;ya&#x301;tah [&ldquo;To whom do you belong? Where do you come from?&rdquo;]. You should think only this, that nothing really exists. You should think only about where one has come from and to whom one belongs. But when nothing really exists, questions about one&#146;s origins do not arise. Even the questions do not exist. When no one really exists, then you also do not exist, so where will any questions come from? The entire philosophical discussion becomes meaningless. This is a kind of nihilism that limits the scope of human expression. It is something that people must carefully avoid. They should remember Shiva&#146;s statement in this regard, Lokavya&#x301;mohaka&#x301;rakah, which means that such people create disease in the human mind by their high-sounding words. One must keep aloof from such things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Look again at how they contradict themselves,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Naliniidalagatajalamatitaralam&#x301; tadvat jiivanamatishayacapalam;<br>Ks&#x301;an&#x301;amiha sajjanasaun&#x32D;gatireka&#x301; bhavati bhava&#x301;rn&#x301;avataran&#x301;e<br>naoka&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->It is said, &ldquo;Human life is fleeting, just like the momentary pause of a drop of water on a lotus leaf before it slips to the ground. Thus, the most important thing in human life is satsaun&#x32D;ga [keeping good company], even for a short time, because satsaun&#x32D;ga is the boat which will ferry human beings across the ocean of bhava [the unrequited sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which cause rebirth].&rdquo; I must ask, when no one exists then how can good people exist? How can the ocean of bhava exist, much less the boat? Only if the physical world, the ocean and the boat exist can satsaun&#x32D;ga be compared to a boat. If one denies the existence of any of them, how can one make analogies with them? Thus, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da has bound itself up in a net of self-contradiction. It has become the cause of its own demise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Now, what about Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi? What did His worldly existence signify? He was an embodiment of tremendous karma shakti [energy for action]. He was determined to destroy whatever was harmful and undesirable for humanity by application of His indomitable strength and commanding force, and at the same time facilitate the growth of all that was good and helpful. Those of noble intentions who are weak and lack the ability to provide for themselves should be supported and cared for by the society as a whole. This was the theme of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->There are many people who remain weighed down by numerous cares and anxieties as well as the lack of the basic necessities of life. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi took birth at a critical juncture in the history of human society, towards the end of the Vedic age, when exploitation had reached its zenith, with opportunists finding ample scope to prey on human society. At such a moment in history could He afford to teach people that all was Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;? That their fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters did not really exist? Rather, He expected people to sympathize with the poor and the miserable and help to alleviate their suffering.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi never preached the vaera&#x301;gya<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> message of the Mohamudgara. This nihilistic philosophy has made the people of India and Southeast Asia averse to reality and has been the cause of untold misery in their lives. The life of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was the antithesis of this nihilism. He advised people, &ldquo;Move collectively; look after the welfare of all; develop yourselves in the physical, psychic, and spiritual planes while maintaining proper adjustment among them; follow the dictum Varttama&#x301;nes&#x301;u vartteta [&lsquo;Live in the present&rsquo;], meaning that while you go on solving all your mundane problems collectively, you should direct your minds towards subtler spheres.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->There is a close relationship between the body and vital energy. The body you possess in this relative world requires food, water, etc., in order to maintain its existence, and vital energy in order to function properly. To increase your vital energy you need a suitable quantity of food. If you cannot provide food through your own efforts, then society should do it for you. For this, dharmara&#x301;jya [the rule of morality] must be established, and that is why Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi devoted His entire time and energy to establish it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;an&#x301;amiha sajjanasaun&#x32D;gatireka&#x301; [&ldquo;Even the momentary company of good people is the medium to uplift you&rdquo;]. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi does not support this sort of philosophy. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s message is, &ldquo;Do all your mundane duties with utmost sincerity, but keep your mind constantly engaged in the thought of Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; Why &ldquo;momentary&rdquo; only, why just for a moment? To make significant progress you must remain in the company of Parama Purus&#x301;a not just for a fleeting moment, but constantly, round the clock. But if you look upon this world as mithya&#x301;, then your existence will also be unreal, and then to whom will you turn for company with your heavy load of unreality? What is the benefit of keeping  company with good people only for a moment, if your very existence is negated?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi taught people that this body exists, and the vital energy also exists. People should always try to develop the body, mind and vital energy that they have been endowed with, and should always bear in mind that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is always with them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Your hands may be weak but His hands are strong. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi has gone on playing His flute to draw your mind towards the internal world, and He who held the flute also caught up the sword to promote the greater welfare of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>

O human beings, move ahead with smiling faces. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is always with you. One who is devoted to Iishvara [the Cosmic Controller], one who meditates on Parama Purus&#x301;a with madhura bha&#x301;va, need not go on a pilgrimage, for he or she remains constantly with Parama Purus&#x301;a.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  The word ka&#x301;ya [body] is derived from the  Sanskrit root verb ci and the suffix ghaun (finally  passing from the ca varga [group of letters] to the ka  varga). Ka&#x301;ya is grammatically correct; ka&#x301;ya&#x301;  is incorrect. Of course, it can be ka&#x301;ya&#x301;h in Sanskrit  when used in the plural, but ka&#x301;ya&#x301; in Bengali is altogether  incorrect. But the poet Hemachandra Bandopadhyaya in one of this poems  rhymed ka&#x301;ya&#x301; with cha&#x301;ya&#x301;. Since then, ka&#x301;ya&#x301; has been used in Bengali literature. In Sanskrit,  ka&#x301;ya is used in the singular and ka&#x301;ya&#x301;h in  the plural.</p>
