<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I will talk a little today about the Farsi words currently in use in Bengali. The distortion or alteration of vowel sounds is very important in any language. The first thing to say about Farsi is that there is some confusion regarding u and o in Farsi and languages related to Farsi. Kut&#x301;hi and kot&#x301;hi, duka&#x301;n and doka&#x301;n &ndash; the interchangeability of u and o is accepted as an unwritten rule in many languages. In Hindustani one says duka&#x301;n but in  Bhojpuri, Maethilii, Magahii and Angika one says doka&#x301;n. In Bengali one also says doka&#x301;n. In Farsi there is a difference between words of masculine and feminine gender but this does not affect the verbs as it does in Urdu and Hindi. Most of the languages descended from Pra&#x301;krta, with the exception of Ma&#x301;gadhii, have two genders, masculine and feminine, much the same as in French. In the languages descended from Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta (Bundelii, Ba&#x301;ghelii, Avadhii, Vraja, Hariya&#x301;navii) the difference in gender can be seen in the genitive case, just as in French. However the difference is that the French verb has three different forms &ndash; masculine, feminine and plural while in Hindustani there are four forms &ndash; masculine singular, masculine plural, feminine singular and feminine plural. For example: Lar&#x301;ka&#x301; ja&#x301; raha&#x301; hae; lar&#x301;ke ja&#x301; rahe haen; lar&#x301;kii ja&#x301; rahii hae; and lar&#x301;kiya&#x301;n ja&#x301; rahii haen. In Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta ka is added to the end of a word to indicate masculine gender and kii to indicate feminine gender, while in the masculine plural or to show respect ke is placed before the word. In Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, as in Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Maethilii,  Bhojpuri, Angika, Magahii, Chattrishgar&#x301;ii, Na&#x301;gpurii, etc., there is no difference between masculine, feminine and neuter genders in the genitive case. For example: Ra&#x301;mer bha&#x301;i [Ram&#146;s brother], Ra&#x301;mer bon [Ram&#146;s sister], Siita&#x301;r bha&#x301;i [Siita&#146;s brother], Siita&#x301;r bon [Siita&#146;s sister].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In Farsi both u and o can be used with the same meaning, but in the Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta descendants u is used. Take, for example, duka&#x301;n &ndash; here doka&#x301;n cannot be used. And in the languages that come from Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, the o pronunciation is seen, that is, the pronunciation will be doka&#x301;n, not duka&#x301;n. In Hindustani the word duka&#x301;n is used in both masculine and feminine genders, but if the word is used in feminine gender then it is spelled duka&#x301;n (with u) and if it is used in masculine gender it is spelled du&#x301;ka&#x301;n (with u&#x301;). In other words, merii duka&#x301;n [my shop] but mera&#x301; du&#x301;ka&#x301;n. In Hindustani the possessive case changes in this way according to gender. Hindi and Urdu follow Farsi but in Farsi there is no change in gender in the possessive case. Gender is connected with the verb in Hindi and Urdu but not in Farsi, so Farsi is quite easy to learn.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->People certainly do not understand everything they see or hear. One person understands while another person does not. One who has sufficient thinking capacity can understand and one who understands is samajhda&#x301;r. The word samajh is of Farsi origin. The Sanskrit-derived word for it is bojha which comes from the Sanskrit bodha. In Pra&#x301;krta the light Sanskrit dha becomes ha and the hard dha becomes jha. For example, dadhi becomes dahi [yoghurt] while sandhya&#x301; becomes sanjha &rarr; sa&#x301;njh [evening] and bandhya&#x301; &rarr; banjha&#x301; &rarr; ba&#x301;njha&#x301; [barren]. Here the dha becomes jha because it is a hard dha. Similarly bodha becomes bojha. The word bojha is used for the English &ldquo;to understand&rdquo; in the languages derived from Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. For example, a&#x301;mi bujhlum, tumi bujhle, hamma&#x301; bujhae nyay pa&#x301;raichiye. But in the languages derived from Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta, the Farsi word samajh is used instead of the Sanskrit-derived word bojha&#x301;. In these languages the word bojha&#x301; means &ldquo;to be extinguished&rdquo;, for the example, &ldquo;the light went out&rdquo;. In Hindi one says vattii bujh gayii. I have just said that in the Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta-derived languages the word bojha&#x301; means &ldquo;to understand&rdquo;, thus these languages do not use the root verb bojh to mean &ldquo;to be extinguished&rdquo;. In these languages &ldquo;the light went out&rdquo; would be translated by vattii but gelai or vattii but gaila.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The word samajhda&#x301;r as used in Bengali clearly comes from Farsi. If it had been half-Bengali, half-Farsi then it would have been bujhda&#x301;r. I have heard the word bujhda&#x301;r used in the villages of Hooghly District.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->I was talking about the use of Farsi words in Bengali. There are a great number of Farsi words in Bengali. It should be noted here that these Farsi words have either entered into Bengali in altered form, been altered after entering the language, or else there has been an attempt to Sanskritize them while in other cases they have retained their proper form. For example, the Farsi word ada&#x301;lat has become a&#x301;da&#x301;lat in Bengali; the Farsi mukadma&#x301; has become mokaddama&#x301;; pasiind has become pachanda; hadd has become haddo; khuda&#x301; became khoda&#x301; (of course in this case I have already discussed the mutual interchange between u and o); kacharii became ka&#x301;cha&#x301;ri; bandowasta became bandovasta; kaka&#x301; became ka&#x301;ka&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> There are some nouns in Bengali which use the Farsi suffixes da&#x301;r, gar, and ka&#x301;r. For example, one who understands is samajhda&#x301;r; one who is in debt is dena&#x301;da&#x301;r; the owner of a shop is doka&#x301;nda&#x301;r. Similarly, pa&#x301;ona&#x301;da&#x301;r [creditor], jamida&#x301;r [landlord], dilda&#x301;r [open-hearted], and so on. Many people improperly say delda&#x301;r instead of dilda&#x301;r. Of course the Farsi word dil is used in Bengali but many people distort the pronunciation and say del although the actual pronunciation of the word is somewhere between dil and del &ndash; do del ba&#x301;nda&#x301; kalma&#x301; cor / na&#x301; pa&#x301;y vehast na&#x301; pa&#x301;y gor. The correct Bengali pronunciation of what we call jamida&#x301;r in Bengali is either jaminda&#x301;r or jamiinda&#x301;r. The above mentioned words are all Farsi &ndash; they are neither Bengali, nor Sanskrit, nor even Indian, but what does that actually matter? These words belong to the language of human beings. We are using them and will continue to do so. A language is enriched by plucking words from other languages and incorporating them, thereby increasing its expressive power. No manner of touchability or untouchability can be allowed in this respect, otherwise a language will run into difficulties. One cannot simply remain inside one&#146;s house collecting brinjals from the courtyard garden with a rake and deny the existence of the great vanaspati tree while refusing to set foot outside. If we do not enrich our own mother tongues or other languages by incorporating words from outside then our condition will become like that of a person who shuts their doors and windows in the middle of the day and then cries out for fear of the dark. Open your doors and windows. Let the outside light and air in and make yourself healthy. Who can deny the fact that the noble attitude of gathering words from other languages has contributed to the enrichment of Bengali? Thus none of these words have been dropped from Bengali, right from ja&#x301;dugar to dilda&#x301;r, hukamda&#x301;r and mansavda&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One who has ja&#x301;n, or life,&rdquo; is ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r. &ldquo;One who has ja&#x301;n&rdquo; is also called ja&#x301;nvar if the Farsi suffix var is added to the root word ja&#x301;n. However when doing so one should keep in mind the difference in usage between the suffixes da&#x301;r and var. All living creatures who have ja&#x301;n are ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r, but those who, despite having ja&#x301;n, do not have a great deal of intellect are ja&#x301;nvar (ja&#x301;nowa&#x301;r &ndash; animal), derived by adding the suffix var to the root word ja&#x301;n. As human beings we do not fall in this category, that is, human beings are not ja&#x301;nvar despite being ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Another Farsi word used in Bengali is hukka&#x301;varda&#x301;r. When the Europeans arrived in this country they used to wear beautiful dhotis and Panjabis and smoke tobacco. They were the ones who brought tobacco here.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In the beginning they used to use a coconut hookah (d&#x301;a&#x301;ba&#x301;-hunko) for smoking.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  The Mughal emperors, as part of aristocracy, introduced the hubble-bubble which was fashioned out of metal and had a long reed attached. Later this hubble-bubble became a symbol of the aristocracy. At that time they used to use gold and silver hubble-bubbles. It was most likely the Empress Nurjahan who introduced the hubble-bubble. Smoking tobacco in a hookah, however, presupposes a certain inconvenience. One cannot carry a hookah around in one&#146;s pocket as one does with cigarettes, so an employee used to walk behind them carrying the hookah. Such a person was called a hukka&#x301;varda&#x301;r which is a Farsi word. When a European would feel the need for a smoke they would call out: E hukka&#x301;varda&#x301;r, t&#x301;um keya&#x301; kart&#x301;a hae, t&#x301;um hukka&#x301; le ao [Heh, hukka&#x301;varda&#x301;r, what are you doing, bring the hookah.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word hukmda&#x301;r is &ldquo;one who is prepared to obey a hukum [order]&rdquo;. The English for hukmda&#x301;r is &ldquo;orderly&rdquo; which has become a&#x301;rda&#x301;lii in Bengali. The word hukumda&#x301;r in Bengali comes from the word hukmda&#x301;r. &ldquo;One who obeys the commands of God&rdquo; is called hukm-i-ra&#x301;m or hukmiira&#x301;m. You will still find a few Hukmiira&#x301;m Singhs in northwest India. We can pose the question here whether or not the word hukmda&#x301;r is actually Farsi, even though it appears to be at first glance. There are many Urdu and Farsi scholars who are not quite sure where the word comes from. Actually the word is English. It arrived in India by way of Europe initially, then Turkey and finally Persia. In this process it underwent changes. Actually it comes from the English &ldquo;Who come there?&rdquo; When an on-duty military person would see unknown persons approaching they would ask &ldquo;Who come there?&rdquo; In answer, the approaching person, if everything was above-board, would raise their hands and call out &ldquo;friend&rdquo; (dost in Hindustani). Anyhow the word hukmda&#x301;r comes from this &ldquo;Who come there?&rdquo; Here da&#x301;r is not an example of a suffix. We do not remember this fact but not remembering does not mean forgetting.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Bhule tha&#x301;ka&#x301; se to nay bhola&#x301;<br>Vismrtir marme vasi<br>Rakte mor diyecho je dola&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->[Not remembering does not mean forgetting<br>sitting in the heart of oblivion<br>you have stirred my blood]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->We all want to keep our loved ones close to us always but ultimately it is not possible to do so. According to the law of nature everything passes away. We have to let everyone go away. We cannot say &ldquo;I won&#146;t let you go&rdquo; and keep them confined. One day they are close to us and the next day they are gone. The day that they left our side we broke into tears but today we are no longer crying. But does that mean we have forgotten? We have not forgotten even if we do not remember. Similarly, even though we do not remember the origin of those Farsi words which nowadays have become an inseparable part of the Bengali language, they have not disappeared into the bottomless pit of oblivion, nor can they ever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The Farsi word saoda&#x301;gar [merchant], that is, &ldquo;one who understands trade&rdquo;, has the suffix gar added. Ja&#x301;dugar means &ldquo;one who knows or understands ja&#x301;du [magic]&rdquo;. It is worth mentioning that some people spell the word ja&#x301;dukar instead of ja&#x301;dugar. They see this as being formed by adding kr + al to the root word ja&#x301;du, but this is incorrect. Ja&#x301;du is a Farsi word. By adding the Farsi suffix gar we get ja&#x301;dugar which means &ldquo;one who knows or understands magic&rdquo;, so the spelling ja&#x301;dukar is incorrect from top to bottom. The Sanskrit synonym is va&#x301;jikara. Kara is a Sanskrit suffix. Farsi does not have a suffix kar. The word ka&#x301;r which is found in Farsi is not a suffix. Ka&#x301;r means &ldquo;work&rdquo; [ka&#x301;j] in Farsi (The word ka&#x301;m [work] which is currently used in Hindi comes from the Sanskrit karma; it is also used in rural Bengali). The word ka&#x301;j is also used in Maethilii &ndash; ehan ka&#x301;j ham na&#x301; sakab. Some people spell ka&#x301;j with ya instead of ja. This is downright wrong. Antahstha ya is only used at the beginning of a word. In the middle or at the end of a word its pronunciation becomes &ldquo;ia&rdquo;, thus if someone spells ka&#x301;j with ya instead of ja then it is read as ka&#x301;y instead of ka&#x301;j. Incidentally I should point out that many people spell iurop [Europe] as yurop. This is also wrong. If ya occurs at the beginning of a word then it is pronounced like ja [antahstha ya], thus if iurop is spelled yurop its pronunciation becomes &ldquo;Jurope&rdquo; &ndash; quite difficult, indeed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So, I was discussing the Farsi word ka&#x301;r which means &ldquo;work&rdquo;. &ldquo;One who knows or understands work&rdquo; is ka&#x301;r-i-gar = ka&#x301;rigar [workman]. &ldquo;The place where work is performed&rdquo; is ka&#x301;rkha&#x301;na&#x301; [factory]. The meaning of the word kha&#x301;na&#x301; is &ldquo;a place dedicated to a specific purpose&rdquo;. Likewise there are many Farsi words in Bengali which include ka&#x301;r such as ka&#x301;rcupi [deception], ka&#x301;rva&#x301;r [business], ka&#x301;rsa&#x301;ji [fraud], beka&#x301;r [unemployed], etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The Farsi word kha&#x301;na&#x301; is also used extensively in Bengali. In addition to ka&#x301;rkha&#x301;na&#x301;, there is ba&#x301;burcikha&#x301;na&#x301; [Islamic kitchen], gosalkha&#x301;na&#x301; [bathroom], pa&#x301;ykha&#x301;na&#x301; [latrine], jimkha&#x301;na, iyatimkha&#x301;na&#x301; [orphanage], musa&#x301;phir kha&#x301;na&#x301; [traveller&#146;s inn], d&#x301;a&#x301;kta&#x301;rkha&#x301;na&#x301; [doctor&#146;s dispensary], ma&#x301;lkha&#x301;na&#x301; [storehouse], laun&#x32D;garkha&#x301;na&#x301; [almshouse], da&#x301;va&#x301;kha&#x301;na&#x301; [pharmacy] in Hindustani, and so on. There is no need to study Farsi in order to learn the words that have been given here as examples because these words have become a part of Bengali as well as many other Indian languages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Earlier I mentioned that both u and o are used in Farsi. It is worth mentioning in this context that there is a mutual interchange between u and o in the Sylhet dialect of Bengali as well as a partial interchange in one or two others of the twelve Bengali dialects.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->I have heard a sailor from Sylhet working on a ship called rom and also rum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There is a word in Bengali, ujir [prime minister], which comes from Farsi. It is pronounced vazir (here the va is antahstha va.) A similar Farsi word is vakil which we have made into ukil [lawyer] in Bengali. Vaka&#x301;lat is almost always called oka&#x301;lati [legal profession]. No one will even bat an eye if someone says vaka&#x301;latna&#x301;ma&#x301;, so accustomed have we become to the word. There is a common word in Bengali, ojan, which does not actually begin with o but with antahstha va, exactly like vazir. This Farsi word entered Bengali in distorted form so that nowadays if someone pronounces it correctly most people will either laugh or think that this poor fellow has not learned the proper pronunciation. It is almost as if there were a conspiracy to mistake God for a ghost. In my childhood I used to say a&#x301;m [mango] instead of a&#x301;nb. When I grew up I learned that a&#x301;nb is comparatively more correct than a&#x301;m. I also used to make jokes with my friends in Burdwan about the way people from Calcutta said a&#x301;nb &ndash; you all say ba instead of ma, you call your Ma&#x301;ma&#x301; [maternal uncle] Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; [father], don&#146;t you? Now, of course, after learning what is correct, I try to say a&#x301;nb although a&#x301;m comes out due to habit. If anyone makes a joke about saying a&#x301;nb I tell them: You say ba instead of ma, you call your Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; Ma&#x301;ma&#x301;, don&#146;t you?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->There are also some Farsi words in Bengali formed with da&#x301;r. For example, jella&#x301;da&#x301;r, ima&#x301;nda&#x301;r [having faith], caokiida&#x301;r, dapha&#x301;da&#x301;r [cavalry officer], pa&#x301;ha&#x301;ra&#x301;da&#x301;r [sentinel], and so on. There is a heaven and hell difference between the Bengali pronunciation of jamida&#x301;r and the Farsi pronunciation. If the consonant na occurs at the end of a word in Farsi then na is dropped and the preceding letter is nasalized, especially if na occurs in the first word of a compound word. Thus jamin can become jamiin. For this reason one can also say jamiinda&#x301;r for jaminda&#x301;r in Farsi. However in Bengali the word is mistakenly pronounced jamida&#x301;r. Hindusta&#x301;n, gulista&#x301;n, pa&#x301;kista&#x301;n, and so on, follow the same pattern. Sta&#x301;n is rendered in English as &ldquo;stan&rdquo;. Bear in mind that the concerning Sanskrit word for sta&#x301;n is stha&#x301;nam. The Farsi word sta&#x301;n comes from the Vedic word stha&#x301;nam, however this Vedic word has remained unaltered in Sanskrit. Stha&#x301;nam becomes t&#x301;ha&#x301;nam in Pra&#x301;krta, t&#x301;ha&#x301;nvii in Demi-Pra&#x301;krta and t&#x301;ha&#x301;ini in old Bengali. The word t&#x301;ha&#x301;ni in modern Bengali is used quite readily in colloquial speech and in some poetry. T&#x301;hinya&#x301; in Angika comes from this t&#x301;ha&#x301;ni and t&#x301;hiya&#x301; as well as thinya&#x301; were used in Rarhi Bengali in olden times. For example, sva&#x301;miistha&#x301;na &rarr; sa&#x301;ni t&#x301;hiina&#x301; &rarr; sa&#x301;nithiya&#x301;. In the Bengali of twelve hundred years ago one finds this verse:<!-- /block --></p>

The pat&#x301;t&#x301;ana&#x301;yaka was the head of a certain number of na&#x301;yakas. The Bengali word pa&#x301;t&#x301;a comes from the word pat&#x301;t&#x301;a. The word pa&#x301;t&#x301;ara&#x301;n&#x301;ii [queen-consort] from fairy tales comes from pat&#x301;t&#x301;ara&#x301;n&#x301;ii.

<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Earlier it was mentioned that efforts have been made to turn some of those Farsi words currently used in Bengali into Sanskrit while others have become altered. For example, &ldquo;one who has hunsh, or consciousness&rdquo; is called honshiya&#x301;r in Farsi; it has become hunshiya&#x301;r in Bengali. Likewise, mihannat has undergone alteration and become mehanat in Bengali. All Farsi words which end in at are feminine in gender. This rule is also followed in Hindi and Urdu. For example, mehanat karnii hae. Even though the words ga&#x301;t, ma&#x301;t, bha&#x301;t and so on, end in a&#x301;t, they are masculine. For example, Siita ne bha&#x301;t kha&#x301;ya&#x301;. Bha&#x301;t is masculine, thus it becomes Siita ne bha&#x301;t kha&#x301;ya&#x301;. On the other hand: Ra&#x301;m ne rot&#x301;ii kha&#x301;yii. Rot&#x301;ii is feminine, thus Ra&#x301;m ne rot&#x301;ii kha&#x301;yii. The word bha&#x301;t [cooked rice] comes from the Pra&#x301;krta word bhatta. It is not a Sanskrit word. The Sanskrit for bha&#x301;t is odanam. The word rot&#x301;ii [bread], however, comes from the Sanskrit word rot&#x301;ika&#x301;. The Hindi word capa&#x301;tii [a flat, unleavened bread] comes from the Sanskrit word carpat&#x301;ika&#x301;. There is no Sanskrit-derived word in either Hindi or Bengali for the Sanskrit soma&#x301;lika&#x301;. The Hindi synonym for soma&#x301;lika&#x301; is puri [fried, unleavened bread]; if it is fried in strained ghee then it is called luci in Bengali. Even though the word luci comes from Farsi and remains in use in three languages, Panjabi, Kashmiri and Urdu, luci has become a native Bengali word. Thus luci, nuci; leci, neci, can be used equally &ndash; none of them can be labelled incorrect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->There are many fruit names in Bengali which are of Farsi origin. For example, am&#x301;gur [grape] (a&#x301;ungur in Bengali and dra&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301; in Sanskrit), beda&#x301;na&#x301; [pomegranate], kismis [raisin], pesta&#x301; [pistachio] and khova&#x301;nii [apricot] are all Farsi words. A&#x301;na&#x301;ras [pineapple] is an Iberian word. The Portuguese brought this fruit to India from the western Indian archipelago. The fruit&#146;s real pronunciation is a&#x301;na&#x301;nas but since it is a juicy [rasa&#x301;l] fruit it has been given the name a&#x301;na&#x301;ras in Bengali. There are two varieties of pineapple in Bengal, the variety brought from the western Indian archipelago and the variety brought from the eastern Indian archipelago. The eastern Indian archipelago pineapple, which we normally call the Singapore pineapple, is large in size and thornless, while the western Indian archipelago pineapple, which we normally call the Ba&#x301;ruipurii pineapple, is smaller in size, golden-coloured and has thorns. None of the pineapples which grow in Tripura and Assam are native to this country; they have been brought from the eastern Indian archipelago. The mango (a&#x301;m or a&#x301;nb) has been previously discussed. Generally the word a&#x301;m is used more frequently in Bengali although the word a&#x301;nb is more correct.<!-- /block --></p>

Guava is not native to this country. While it is true that guava is called perukam or biijapu&#x301;rakam in modern Laokika Sanskrit, both of these words are quite recent. The Bengali word piya&#x301;ra&#x301; or peya&#x301;ra&#x301; and the Marathii word peru (ripe guava is called pikle peru in Marathii) come from the Iberian word piya&#x301;ro. In the Sylhet and Mymensing areas it is called saphlii a&#x301;m or soprii a&#x301;m. It should be kept in mind that there are many words in Bengali which are formed by adding the word soprii meaning &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;. For example, the bananas imported from Martaban Province in Burma are called martama&#x301;n kala&#x301; in Calcutta, anupam kala&#x301; in north Bengal and soparii kala&#x301; in east Bengal. Guava is called a&#x301;njir in Rarh. The word a&#x301;njir is common in the markets of Siurii, Dumka, Deoghar, Dhanbad, Asansol, Bankura, Purulia and Tata. Guava is called t&#x301;a&#x301;mras in the western outlying areas of Rarh &ndash; Jhalda, Muri, Silli, and so on. In Angika it is called sa&#x301;phlii a&#x301;m and in Maethilii lat-a&#x301;m. In Patna, Magadha, Muzaffarpur and Bhojpur it is called a&#x301;mdhur and in chaste Hindi it is amru&#x301;d.<!-- /block --></p>

After a military encampment was established there during the British time they used to hold the customary drill and target practice so there was the constant sound dama&#x301;dam, dama&#x301;dam [boom boom].

The Portuguese word for &ldquo;window&rdquo; is janela. The Farsi word for &ldquo;door&rdquo; is darwa&#x301;ja&#x301;. In Sanskrit &ldquo;window&rdquo; is gava&#x301;ks&#x301;a or va&#x301;ta&#x301;yana. Keep in mind that the correct Sanskrit word is gavaks&#x301;a (go + aks&#x301;a) but it has been written gava&#x301;ks&#x301;a since ancient times, thus gava&#x301;ks&#x301;a becomes correct (correct as an exception or through use by the Rs&#x301;is). Nowadays if someone writes gavaks&#x301;a it is thought to be incorrect. The native Hindustani word for &ldquo;window&rdquo; is jharoka&#x301; or khir&#x301;ki. In Bengali, however, khir&#x301;ki means &ldquo;back-door&rdquo;. In Rarhi Bengali the word jharoka&#x301; is used. There is a folksong in Hooghly District which goes like this:<!-- /block --></p>

Ja&#x301;da&#x301; means &ldquo;son&rdquo; or &ldquo;boy&rdquo;. Sha&#x301;h ja&#x301;da&#x301; means &ldquo;king&#146;s son&rdquo;; sha&#x301;h ja&#x301;dii means &ldquo;king&#146;s daughter&rdquo;. A&#x301;damsuma&#x301;rii is an old Bengali word for counting people; it is also a Farsi word. Along with the Indian word ta&#x301;lika&#x301;, the Farsi word tapshiil is also commonly used in Bengali to mean &ldquo;list&rdquo; or &ldquo;schedule&rdquo;. In fact for &ldquo;scheduled caste&rdquo; we more often use the word taphshiilii ja&#x301;ti or taphshiilbhukta ja&#x301;ti instead of ta&#x301;lika&#x301;bhukta ja&#x301;ti. The Bengali word a&#x301;kkel [wisdom] comes from the Farsi word akkl. I am quite sure that no one would like to drop this a&#x301;kkel from the Bengali language and thus end up be-a&#x301;kkl [without a&#x301;kkl &ndash; foolish]. The popular Bengali word ba&#x301;ha&#x301;r [beauty] is also Farsi. We call the calediam ba&#x301;ha&#x301;rii kacu. The croton plant we call pa&#x301;ta&#x301;ba&#x301;ha&#x301;ri.

Bengali has also collected words from various languages. It would not be right to be fussy about this; otherwise it will do harm. There is no sense in shutting one&#146;s doors and windows in the middle of the day and then crying out that one cannot bear the darkness. The doors and windows will have to be flung open to let the outside light in. Words will have to be gathered from various languages in order to make the Bengali language more expressive.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  However the common Bengali word ca&#x301;ca&#x301; is not actually Farsi; it is a Hindustani word. The correct pronunciation is caca&#x301;. Neither ca&#x301;ca&#x301; or ka&#x301;ka&#x301; is native Bengali; the native Bengali word is khur&#x301;a&#x301; which has gradually gone out of use. It is a Sanskrit-derived word.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  Tombaco in Iberian, &ldquo;tobacco&rdquo; in English, from which we get the Bengali word ta&#x301;ma&#x301;k [tobacco]. In rural Bengal ta&#x301;muk or ta&#x301;m&#x301;ku are also common.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)   The word d&#x301;a&#x301;ba&#x301;-hunko comes from the word d&#x301;a&#x301;ba [green coconut] in Bengali because it was made from a coconut shell.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)  Some people, ignorant of the actual story, mistakenly think that Ka&#x301;rttika is the sena&#x301;pati [commander-in-chief] of the devas [gods] &ndash; devasena&#x301;pati. This is incorrect. He is the pati [husband] of Devasena&#x301;.</p>

In the remaining parts of north India it is called Holi. The day after Holi is called Hola in Panjabi.</p>
