<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The eagle [iigal] is the largest of the birds who are able to fly. The emu, ostrich, etc. are bigger than the eagle but they are unable to fly. Of course, not all eagles are equally large. There are thirty-two different varieties of eagle. Some of them are equal to or greater in length than human beings while others are like the vultures of this country.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The garuda bird as described in the Puranas and the va&#x301;ta&#x301;vii bird described in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata are types of eagles. However the homa&#x301; bird from the stories is not an eagle but rather a giant owl [bhutum pein&#x32D;ca&#x301;]<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ndash; in some parts of Bihar it is called durgum. In the village areas of Burdwan some of the old people still call the giant black owl the homa&#x301; bird. Their numbers are fast diminishing due to the scarcity of large trees and pervasive poaching by hunters greedy for the large amount of meat they can get from them. Some provisions should be made to ensure their survival.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The large migratory bird that one finds in the fields of northern India during the winter harvest at the beginning of the cold season is also called the garuda bird in the village areas of Bihar. However this bird is neither a garuda nor an eagle, but rather a very large variety of flamingo. They come to the winter harvest fields and eat the newly-sprouted pulse seeds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Bengal one normally finds five varieties of owls: bhutum owl &ndash; large in size and black in colour &ndash; the author of the Hutumpein&#x32D;ca&#x301;r Naksa&#x301; was most likely referring to the bhutum owl; (2) laks&#x301;mii owl &ndash; medium in size and white in colour; (3) black owl &ndash; medium-sized and black; (4) kut&#x301;ure owl &ndash; small-sized and catechu coloured; (5) shmasha&#x301;n owl (found mostly in burial grounds) &ndash; small and black.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The original home of the eagle was the mountains of the Alps in central Europe. Originally, different varieties of eagles lived in different portions of these mountains. Later, they spread to other areas due to natural causes, pressure from human beings and in search of food. Eagles cannot build nests like other birds due to their large size. Generally they place rocks and branches and twigs in mountain caves in order to protect themselves from the adversities of nature. This kind of eagle&#146;s nest is called an &ldquo;aerie&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The condor is the biggest member of the eagle family. In ancient times they used to live in the southeast region of the Alps. Today there are very few left. They can see objects clearly five miles away; thus any entity with very sharp or penetrating vision is said to have &ldquo;condor-eye&rdquo; or &ldquo;condor-vision&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The monkey-eating eagle that is found in south and southeast Asia is quite large and very strong. They are also becoming very rare nowadays. A hundred years ago this monkey-eating eagle could also be seen from time to time in the Philippines but no longer.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Although it differs somewhat in size and shape, the Indian vulture also belong to the eagle family. It&#146;s Sanskrit name is grdhra or shakunta bird. The meaning of the verbal root shak is &ldquo;to be able to&rdquo; or &ldquo;to be firm&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The vulture has an uncommonly powerful beak, thus it is called shakunta. In Sanskrit literature, Shakuntala&#x301; is the name of the girl who was abandoned by her mother when she was a baby and raised by a vulture out of its sense of deep affection (hence the name Shakuntala&#x301;, in the sense of one who is raised by a shakunta bird).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->At one time a good number of golden eagles used to be found in western Europe. Today they are on the verge of extinction. Approximately a hundred years ago the last of the British variety of golden eagle died. Today the British golden eagle no longer flies in the earth&#146;s skies. Like the dodo bird, they have disappeared forever. The British golden eagle is one of the victims of humankind&#146;s death-sacrifices. Similarly, the Indian leopard can only be seen nowadays in pictures; it can no longer be seen in the Indian jungles. The Indian leopard, along with the leopard-cat, used to be found in good numbers in the Duars of northern Bengal, but today the Indian leopard is no longer to be found and the leopard-cat is also rarely seen anymore.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Yes, talking about the eagle brought up the subject of the Indian vulture. At one time there were many sub-species of the Indian vulture. Nowadays, basically three varieties can be found: the big black vulture, the white vulture and the red-throated vulture.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Among them, the white vulture has virtually disappeared and few people ever have an opportunity to see a red-throated vulture. In ancient India the white vulture was considered to be a symbol of misfortune. Thus in the Vedic era, if a white vulture sat on anyone&#146;s house they would perform the shakunta yajin&#x32D;a [vulture sacrifice] to chase away misfortune. King Shya&#x301;mala Varmman&#x301;a brought Brahmans versed in the Vedas from north India to Bengal in order to perform the shakunta yajin&#x32D;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Although birds of the eagle group are meat-eaters and ferocious by nature, they are not very clever. Often it is seen that vultures meet their death in fights with crows because of their lack of intelligence. Most likely, the popular tale of old Jaradgava [a senile vulture] was based on the vulture&#146;s lack of intellect.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root ii is &ldquo;to move rapidly&rdquo;, &ldquo;to arrive suddenly&rdquo;, or &ldquo;to depart abruptly&rdquo;, etc. Someone who falls victim to an unexpected natural disaster, such as tempest, flood, earthquake, falling meteor, or volcanic eruption, we call iita (ii + kta). Similarly, an unexpected calamity or natural disaster is called iiti (ii + ktin). In ancient literature iiti was also used for any sudden or unexpected battle or epidemic or plague of locusts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Occasionally you will find a sudden swelling in the small rivers and rivulets of Rarh. It remains for a short time, causes some damage, and then disappears just as quickly. This suddenly appearing, suddenly disappearing flood is called har&#x301;ka&#x301; in Rarhi Bengali. This har&#x301;ka&#x301; is also a type of iiti.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix iip to any masculine word ending in a, the word becomes feminine.

<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->This word comes from the verbal root a&#x301;p (a&#x301;pnoti) which means &ldquo;to get&rdquo;. The meaning of the word iipsa&#x301; is &ldquo;the desire to get&rdquo;. The meaning of iipsu is &ldquo;desirous of getting&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which has a propensity for getting&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

Iishii means &ldquo;supremacy&rdquo; or &ldquo;comparative supremacy&rdquo;. Iishita&#x301; means &ldquo;supremacy when judged comparatively&rdquo;. For example, &ldquo;Among these four cooks, so-and-so has iishita&#x301; in comparison with the rest.&rdquo; The word iishita&#x301; is pleasing to the ear and feminine in gender. Girls can be given the name iishita&#x301;. Similarly, by adding the suffix tvac we get the word iishitva which carries the same meaning but is neuter in gender.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Iishika&#x301;/Iis&#x301;ika&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word iishika&#x301;/iis&#x301;ika&#x301; is &ldquo;the pupil of an elephant&#146;s eye&rdquo;. That is, iishika&#x301;/iis&#x301;ika&#x301; means the eyes, particularly the pupils of the eyes, of those animals which are very large in size, but whose eyes are comparatively small. Because the eyes of elephants and rhinoceri are small in comparison with the size of their bodies, they were iishika&#x301; in old Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->This word means &ldquo;tusk&rdquo;. The two long teeth that extend out from both sides of the mouth of the male elephant are not used for mastication; nowadays they are purely for show. Previously. however, elephants used to use these tusks for digging up the ground. The tusks of the elephant&#146;s ancestor, the mammoth, were even bigger &ndash; both longer and thicker. They used to attack and kill other animals with their tusks.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In comparison with younger elephants, the tusks of older elephants are relatively yellowish. Needless to say, elephants also have ordinary teeth inside their mouths for chewing food just like other creatures. Those female elephants that have visible tusks we call va&#x301;ran&#x301;ii (not va&#x301;narii).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->In olden times the ivory craft of Bankura and Murshidabad in Bengal was of a very high standard. This craft depended on the patronage of royalty and the wealthy. Nowadays it has nearly disappeared.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The teeth of the hippopotamus are even stronger and whiter than those of the elephant, but there are fewer hippopotami. Today the hippopotamus is no longer found in India. It disappeared from India approximately a thousand years ago. Human beings were most probably responsible for this evil deed, acting out of greed for their extremely firm, white teeth, much as they have nearly brought an end to the rhinoceros by killing them out of greed for their horns. It is in the last one hundred years or so that the rhinoceros has disappeared from the Sundarbans. The two hundred or two hundred fifty rhinoceri still surviving somehow in eastern India should be in protected reserves, otherwise humans, greedy for their hides, flesh and horns, will bring their final day even closer. Hippopotami teeth should also be considered ivory for the same reason that elephant tusks are. In prehistoric times, both hippopotami and giraffes were found in Rarh, but they disappeared about ten thousand years ago thanks to the capriciousness of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Speaking of tusks, an old incident comes to mind from the days just after independence when the influence of the British could still be felt everywhere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->I had gone to Ranchi for a few days in relation to an idea I had that the civilization of the Koyel River-valley found in the west of Ranchi District was a branch of the Rarhi civilization of central Gondwanaland. To the east of Ranchi was the Suvarnarekha River-valley, which in terms of language, culture and heritage belonged to Rarh. Each day I would go to one or two different spots in the Suvarnarekha River-valley in search of archaeological artifacts of ancient Rarh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->One day, while searching in a spot near Muri in the Silli area, I came across a fossilized fragment of a mammoth jaw with part of the tusk still attached. I knew I had found something important. There was no doubt that it would add lustre to the cultural heritage of Rarh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->All day long I travelled like a whirlwind from village to village in Ranchi District&#146;s Silli area and the Jhalda and Jaipur areas of what was at that time Manbhum District, just adjacent to it. This region is also worthy of being recognized by archaeologists as the cradle of Rarhi civilization. Here the Suvarnarekha River-valley, Kamsavati River-valley and Damodar River-valley (Alkushi, Kupai, Uttara&#x301; or Chot&#x301;ki Guyai and Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; or Bar&#x301;ki Guyai) are all close to each other and I was able to discover many things there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->I was quite pleased with the prospect of presenting the land of Rarh in a new way to people. And I was especially pleased, looking at the straightforward faces of these dark-complexioned, Austrico-Scythian-Negroid people of Rarh, to think that, though they are neglected today, at one time they were perched at the summit of civilization. They were the forefathers of human civilization and the trumpets of Bengali civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->It was 8:00, I noticed, when I made ready to return to Ranchi after having spent the entire day moving from place to place. If I started then, I thought, it would be nearly 10:00 before I made it back to the house in Ranchi, which would be quite late for my bath and spiritual practices, so I decided to complete them in the Jhalda dak-bungalow. Afterwards I would return to the house in Ranchi no matter how late it might be.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->After arriving at the Jhalda dak-bungalow I finished my bath and spiritual practices, took a light snack and then told my travelling companions: &ldquo;So much walking has left me a little tired. I want to lie down for a bit. When you have the car packed and are ready to leave, then you let me know and I&#146;ll come to the car.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->I took some rest. After a while the room began to seem as if it was under an enchantment. Something was definitely out of place. Suddenly, the door near the foot of the bed cracked open and a gentlemanly-looking young man in his early twenties stepped in. He greeted me with a very sweet and courteous smile and said: &ldquo;Oh, I&#146;ve waited a long time for a chance to see you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Why did you want to see me?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ve been here for a few days with the Silli royal family; we are very close. I am greatly interested in the archaeology of Rarh. In fact, I am from Rarh. My home is in the Bundu area of Ranchi District.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Go ahead and tell me what you wanted to say.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am extremely interested in the archaeology of Rarh,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I have never had an opportunity to meet anyone who was as interested in the matter as I am. I heard that you were in the area going around to different villages, and that you had managed to gather many facts. I also heard that you discovered in the house of a certain Sim&#x301;mun&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; in the village of Mardu, an intact statue of the state goddess of Bengal, Da&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301;yan&#x301;ii, from the beginning of the Shur dynasty. I went out to try to find you but you were moving so fast from village to village that it was impossible to catch up with you. I got tired and sat down under a mango tree near the Silli royal palace. Then it popped into my head that you were staying in the Jhalda dak-bungalow, so I rushed here and managed to find you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;During the rule of the Shur dynasty,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;our Bengal extended from the Suvarnarekha River-valley to the Naaf River-valley. Although nowadays there are twelve dialects of Bengali spoken over this huge area, in those days there were even more because there wasn&#146;t any good transportation between the different areas. It was due to the impassability of traffic that so many dialects arose. Roughly speaking, the Bengali language of that time was a related form of Oriental Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii. We can also call it old Bengali. We can find this Oriental Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii-related form of Bengali in the Carya&#x301;pada and the Carya&#x301;caryavinishcaya of the Buddhist era. From this we can easily conclude that the Bengali language is at least 1500 years old &ndash; not a bit less. There are older languages among the world&#146;s modern living languages, but very few.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;In that era the influence of Shiva on the Bengali people was immense. Da&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301;yan&#x301;ii, the daughter of King Daks&#x301;a and the wife of Shiva, was the state goddess of Bengal. Statues of this Da&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301;yan&#x301;ii have been found in a good number of the villages of our Suvarnarekha River-valley. Most of them have been carved from stone and some bear inscriptions in the Dalma script. You went to the village of Mardu in the Silli area of Ranchi District &ndash; that village is very close to Jhalda; the Suvarnarekha River runs through it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;During the Buddhist and Puranic eras, indeed, even during the Pathan era as well, the Da&#x301;kra&#x301;s<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> used to gather gold particles from the sand of this river which they would then melt down to remove the base metals and extract the pure gold. During that time many of the archaeological artifacts made in this Suvarnarekha valley were fashioned of pure gold, but they fell into the hands of thieves so they are no longer found today. During the time of Varddhamana Maha&#x301;viira there was a great influence of Jainism in this region especially in our Suvarnarekha and Kamsavati river-valleys and to a lesser extent in the Dhalkishore<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> , Damodar, Ajay and Mayurakshi river-valleys.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You certainly must have discovered a large-sized Jain Shiva in the broken Shiva temple in Mardu village. This type of Shiva-liun&#x32D;ga has been recovered in excavations elsewhere in Rarh and more will be in the future. Some of them can also be seen above ground, in some of the temple ruins. At the end of the names of these Jain Shivas the word iishvara was used, not na&#x301;tha. For example, Khadgeshvara, not Khadgana&#x301;tha. In Bengal the word iishvara was used at the end of Shiva&#146;s name from the end of the Buddhist era until the appearance of Shankaracharya. These Jain Shiva-liun&#x32D;gas were quite large in size and the gaorii pat&#x301;t&#x301;as were very large as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The old Jain Shiva-liun&#x32D;gas had the same radius from top to bottom. Later, during the time of Shankaracharya, those people of Rarh who accepted Shankara&#146;s Shaeva doctrine gave them the name jyotirliun&#x32D;ga. But alongside the Jain religion, va&#x301;n&#x301;aliun&#x32D;gas were also prevalent in Bengal, chiefly in Buddhist Bengal. This va&#x301;n&#x301;aliun&#x32D;ga has no relation to the Jain Shiva, thus, in olden times, the jyotirliun&#x32D;ga and va&#x301;n&#x301;aliun&#x32D;ga were worshipped with different mantras. Khadgeshvara of Birbhum, Jhar&#x301;eshvara of Midnapore, and Ta&#x301;rakeshvara of Hoogly are all from the Jain era, but while some of their temples are quite old, many are less so and some are quite contemporary.<!-- /block --></p>

Rasagolla, rasamalai and coconut ladu are three types of sweets. When we taste them we can easily understand the difference between them, but when expressing it in language we cannot explain just what the sweetness of each is like. The capacity of language fails. This is the case with all worldly feelings, in other words, in comparison with feeling, our expressive capacity is significantly smaller. If we stick ourselves with a pin we say &ldquo;ooh&rdquo;; if we are stung by a wasp we also say &ldquo;ooh&rdquo;; and if we are stung by a scorpion we still say &ldquo;ooh&rdquo;.

For example, one who is very noble we call the embodied symbol of nobility. One who possesses great erudition we call the embodiment of erudition. Regarding Iishvara, it is said that He is the embodied image of love &ndash; the embodiment of divine love. No matter how much a person remains engaged in unjust actions, he always hopes that Parama Purus&#x301;a will forgive him, that He will wipe the dust off him and take him on His lap. Although he forgets Parama Purus&#x301;a at the time of committing injustice, after he has committed it, when he remembers Parama Purus&#x301;a, he thinks to himself: &ldquo;O Lord, you know the condition I was in when I committed this injustice. Please forgive me.&rdquo; Or else he says: &ldquo;O Lord, why did you give me such a nature that I could commit this type of injustice? Save me.&rdquo; That is, under all circumstances the living beings are dependent on Parama Purus&#x301;a, whether they know it or not. Parama Purus&#x301;a is such an entity. No matter how much a person may be frightened of Parama Purus&#x301;a, he is much more filled with hope by Him.

One day, an unknown man arrived unexpectedly in the city. Sometimes he worked as an astrologer, sometimes he sold fruit and sometimes he sold woollen clothes. The state intelligence people had doubts about him but after conducting their secret investigations they could find nothing to accuse him of. Through their efforts arrangements were made for a dance performance in the capital. That unknown man also attended and was seated a short distance from the king, the royal princes and the king&#146;s officers [ra&#x301;japurus&#x301;a].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn13"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn13">13</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> During the dance, when the dancers would approach the king and his retinue with a gold pot that they would extend in a certain mudra&#x301;, they would give the dancers some coins. It was observed that when the dancers approached that unknown man he began to lift his hand to give something and then pulled it back. The king&#146;s intelligence people or gahapurus&#x301;as then understood that this aquiline-nosed man was the son of some royal family. And because he belonged to the Mediterranean<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn14"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn14">14</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  branch of the Caucasian race, they had no doubts that he was from Kashmir, that is, he was a member of the Kashmiri royal family and he had come there for the purposes of spying. The intelligence people then arrested that iiks&#x301;an&#x301;aka.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  I have seen this bird also in Kachar District.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  The Philippines&#146; Sanskrit name is Maha&#x301;rlika&#x301;  or Maha&#x301;rliina&#x301; which means, etymologically, &ldquo;small in size  but great in qualities&rdquo;. After the Spanish took possession of  the country they gave it the name &ldquo;Philippines&rdquo; after their  King Philip.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  The word shaktu is used in the sense of &ldquo;that which makes the body strong&rdquo;. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;corn-meal&rdquo; or &ldquo;gram-meal&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)   The plains at the edge of the Himalayas are called  terai in northern India and duya&#x301;r in Bengali. Thus  the name of the city of Alipur located in that region is Alipurduar, and the one that is not located in the duya&#x301;r, but rather adjacent to Calcutta, is just called Alipur. Until the Mughal era its name was Alinagar.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)  In old Sanskrit they used to be called grdhra and in north India, gidha.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn6">6</a></b>)  In English we use the word &ldquo;tusk&rdquo; for the Bengali  word gajadanta and the adjective &ldquo;ivory&rdquo; is used for  the material which is made from these tusks. In other words, when  I show someone an elephant&#146;s tooth [gajadanta] I call it a  &ldquo;tusk&rdquo;, and when I show a bangle made from the tooth of an  elephant I call it an &ldquo;ivory bangle&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn7">7</a></b>)  A local indigenous tribe. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn8">8</a></b>)   The name of the first part of the river is Dhalkishore.  After it joins the Gandheshvari River in Bankura, the name of the combined flow is Dvarakeshvar. When this Dvarakeshvar River reaches  the far border of Hoogly District it joins the Shilavati (Shilai)  River coming from the west and thereafter flows towards the southwest  under the name of the Rupanarayan River, dividing Midnapore and Howrah;  thereafter it joins with the Bhagirathi. At its end, Howrah District&#146;s  Shyampur area is on the left bank and Midnapore District&#146;s Tamluk  is on the right bank.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn9">9</a></b>)  The far western fringe of Rarh, where the Suvarnarekha, Kansavati and Damodar River-valleys come together, we can call the  cradle of both Rarhi and human civilization. As regards the spoken  language, the branch of Rarhi Bengali that is prevalent in the area  lying on the right bank (south) of the Suvarnarekha River is called  Pa&#x301;inc-Pargan&#x301;iya&#x301; Bengali. The  spoken language found on the left bank of the Suvarnarekha  River and the right bank (south) of the Kansavati River is the Patkumi  branch of Rarhi Bengali. And the language spoken on the left bank  of the Kansavati and the right bank of the Damodar is the Golawa&#x301;rii branch of Rarhi Bengali. Gola is a famous place of this area from which the name Golawa&#x301;rii has come. The spoken language of the area lying on the left  bank of the Damodar, that is, north and west of the Pareshanath Hills  is called Daks&#x301;in&#x301;ii Khotta Bengali. The closer one gets to  the Pareshanath Hills the more the influence of Rarhi Bengali increases  in this Daks&#x301;in&#x301;ii Khotta Bengali and the nearer one gets to  the Tilaiya Reservoir, the more the influence of southern Magahii  or Gaya&#x301;li Magahii increases. The Pa&#x301;inc-Pargan&#x301;iya&#x301;  branch of Rarhi Bengali is spoken in Ranchi District&#146;s Bundu, Arki,  Tamar &ndash; 1, Tamar &ndash; 2, Sonahatu, the southern part of the Silli  area, and the southern part of the Angara area. The Patkumi branch  of Rarhi Bengali is prevalent in Purulia District&#146;s Jhalda and Tulin  areas, the northern part of Ranchi District&#146;s Silli and Angara areas,  and in certain parts of Hazaribag District&#146;s (now Giridi District) Kasmar and Petarwar areas. The Golawa&#x301;rii branch of Rarhi Bengali is spoken in Purulia District&#146;s Jaipur area, Dhanbad District&#146;s Chas,  Chandankeyari, Bokaro Steel City and Jeridi, and in certain portions  of Hazaribag District&#146;s (now Giridi District) Kasmar, Petarwar, Gola  and Ramgarh areas. The spoken language of Hazaribag District&#146;s (now  Giridi District) Gomoh, Nuyadi, Bermo, Dumri, Chandrapura and Bokaro (Thermal) areas is also a variety of this Golawa&#x301;rii Bengali.</p>
