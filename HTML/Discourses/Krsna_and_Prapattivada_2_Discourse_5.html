<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Prapatti-orientated psychology generally resembles the psychology behind the science of phonetics. Just as in the science of phonetics there are three types of pronunciation &ndash; short, long, and drawled (or prolonged) &ndash; so in prapatti there are three distinct kinds of psychological expression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->We started our discussion about Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and prapatti. To make the topic clear, we must analyse a few more things. When people utter something and when that utterance keeps adjustment with the collective acoustic flow in the ethereal void, that sound is called pluta [prolonged sound]. In the Sanskrit language there is the system of pluta sound, but this is absent in Bengali and the rest of the world&#146;s languages. If I use a short pronunciation I will say agni-miilre; if a long pronunciation, I will say agni-mii-i-lre; if a prolonged pronunciation, I will say agni-mii-i-i-lre.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In Bengali there is hardly any prolonged pronunciation. For that reason, Rabindranath Tagore spelled the word ra&#x301;n&#x301;ii as ra&#x301;ni, and n&#x301; as n. Anyway, when one&#146;s psychology conforms to the one vast flow, one eternal flow, of bliss, flowing from beginninglessness to endlessness, wherein every entity is inundated, saturated and drenched with bliss &ndash; when I am identifying my psychology with that flow &ndash; this psychology resembles the psychology of the prolonged phonetic sound, and is called prapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This idea may be explained in another way. An all-pervasive idea is originating from the universal Nucleus and flowing towards Infinity. We should bear in mind that this universe of ours is very vast but not infinite, because it has been created by three principles &ndash; the sentient, mutative and static principles. The sentient principle cannot be measured, neither in idea nor in practice. The mutative can be measured in imagination but not in practice. The static can be measured in both ways; however, the sphere of the static principle is so vast that it is difficult to measure it, even in practice. For example, the Himalayas, though very, very vast, can theoretically be measured, but practically speaking, it is impossible to measure them. For such cases, we use the Sanskrit term visha&#x301;la, which means &ldquo;vast but within the scope of measurement&rdquo;; and the Entity that is too big to be measured is called vira&#x301;t&#x301;a. This universe is very vast, visha&#x301;la, but not infinite, vira&#x301;t&#x301;a. Though very big, it has limitations. While people are small, the universe is very large.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->These forces, these waves of different lengths emanated from that singular, universal hub, that universal nave, are constantly advancing towards infinity. That is, those waves are not confined to this world. This should be borne in mind. Whenever something remains within the scope of this universe, within the circumference of this universe, we call it vishvagata, and when it goes beyond the scope of this universe, we call it vishva&#x301;tiita. When human beings proceed along these waves &ndash; along these pencils of waves and pencils of rays &ndash; their movement, although vishvagata in the initial stage, becomes vishvatiita in the end. Those who are clever will identify their limited individual identity with the Cosmic emanations and they will thereby finally become Cosmic. As long as they remain vishvagata, they continue to enjoy the waves of bliss, the blissful expressions, and when they attain the vishva&#x301;tiita state, they remain forever in the ocean of bliss. Then the sa&#x301;dhaka becomes detached from everything else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now whatever Parama Purus&#x301;a does, He does for the good of humanity. Not a single blade of grass can move without His desire. This very endeavour to obtain bliss by identifying one&#146;s microcosmic waves with the Cosmic emanations is called prapatti. I have already said that this prapatti resembles, to a great extent, the prolonged sound in the science of phonetics. Those of you who have achieved some spiritual elevation will hear a prolonged sound &ndash; one that is neither short nor long, but a prolonged sound that continues smoothly without changing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Next comes the long sound of the science of phonetics, that is, a medium sound. The sa&#x301;dhaka feels that he or she is able to hear that sound by dint of his or her own efforts. If drawn out to a great length, it may become a pluta sound, and if shortened, it will be a sound which generally conforms to aprapatti. But where there is only individual effort regardless of one&#146;s capacity, to the exclusion of prapatti, aprapatti and thoughts of Parama Purus&#x301;a or the universal acoustic emanation, it is similar to short pronunciation &ndash; it resembles viprapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->It has been said earlier that Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a attracted people with His magic flute. Innumerable sound waves emanated from His flute, and His devotees rushed towards Him in the flow of those sound waves. Clearly, this is prapattiva&#x301;da. Although there is an element of knowledge and action, devotion is the predominant factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was different. It is a fact that Parama Purus&#x301;a does everything; nevertheless, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not permit any spirit of inaction. He said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Karman&#x301;yeva&#x301;dhika&#x301;raste ma&#x301; phales&#x301;u kada&#x301;cana;<br>Ma&#x301; karmaphalaheturbhu&#x301;ma&#x301; te saun&#x32D;go&#146;stvakarman&#x301;i.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->[You have the right to action but not to the fruits of the action. You must not do actions that will bind you, but you must not be averse to action, either.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You have the right to action but not the right to the fruits of action.&rdquo; You have your hands and feet, you have the capacity to work and hence work you must. Rights may be applied only in the case of work. One may or may not want to work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301; phales&#x301;u kada&#x301;cana [&ldquo;but not to the fruits of the action&rdquo;]. Regarding karma, it is said that for each and every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, provided the three fundamental relative factors, namely, the temporal factor, the spatial factor and the personal factor, remain unchanged, remain unassailed; otherwise, there will be a change in the reaction. The reaction in that case will not be equal and opposite in nature. Suppose, for example, you borrow one hundred rupees from a particular person. If you pay back the amount then and there, you will not be required to pay back any additional money. If you pay back the loan after a long time, however, say a few years, you will have to pay back the capital with interest. Thus the amount of one hundred rupees returns in a changed form due to the change in the temporal factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In prapattiva&#x301;da, if the devotees respond in the same manner as the musical flute calls them, there will not be any change. But with karma, it is different. Here Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a says, &ldquo;You are certainly entitled to action, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions.&rdquo; The result of action changes with the changes in time, place and person. Therefore, you have control over the original action but not over the reaction. Hence it is said, Ma&#x301; phalesu kada&#x301;cana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Here you should remember one thing. There are some opportunistic people in this world who distort the meaning of this shloka from the Giita&#x301; and thus manage to perpetuate the machinery of exploitation. This is very amusing. I bring it into the domain of philosophy because it is highly illustrative. Those exploiters glibly make their views known: &ldquo;These poor people, these toiling people, these intellectuals, they have no doubt the right to work, but they have no right to the results of their actions. The results, the fruits, should accrue to us, the owners, the proprietors. &lsquo;Increase our wages, give us more remuneration, pay us a bonus&#8230;&rsquo; &ndash; they have no right to say all these things.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->However, let us get back to the main topic. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, Ma&#x301; karmaphalaheturbhu&#x301;ma&#x301; te saun&#x32D;go&#146;stvakarman&#x301;i [&ldquo;You must not do actions that will bind you, but you must not be averse to action, either&rdquo;]. Do your duty, your karma. Now, is this karma in conformity with prapatti or is it antagonistic to prapatti? The teachings of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a are clearly consistent with prapatti. His existence, His actions, the music of His flute, the way in which He attracts people and gives them shelter &ndash; all these are in perfect harmony with prapatti, because an individual feels free after surrendering everything to the Macrocosmic Entity. Here Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, &ldquo;Do your karma, for you have an inalienable right to your karma.&rdquo; Karma is defined as Karma Brahmeti karma bahu kurviita &ndash; &ldquo;You are human. Simply look upon karma as a veritable expression of Brahma [Supreme Entity] and do as much karma as you can.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Is this in agreement with prapatti or at variance with prapatti? It seems to be opposed to prapatti but in actuality it is not. If we go deeper into the subject, we see that this quinquelemental body, this body of flesh and bones, this mind made of ectoplasmic stuff, this reflecting plate that acts as the witnessing entity (known as a&#x301;tman or purus&#x301;a in philosophy) &ndash; all these have their origin in Parama Purus&#x301;a. It is the Cosmic desire that is the source of the creation of the human body, mind and soul. If we utilize this body, mind and jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; [soul, self, unit consciousness], we are only following the path of prapatti. That is, we are utilizing the things given to us by Parama Purus&#x301;a. All these things, the body, mind and self, are His gifts. Had He willed otherwise, they would not have existed. Without Cosmic desire, nothing can exist, nothing can move, not even a blade of grass. So in accordance with the spirit of prapatti, that the body is a machine, we can say that He has been kind enough to provide the body and mind, to be utilized for work only. Hence I follow the spirit of prapatti in using them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In the beginning, karma seemed to be against prapatti, but karma is not antithetical to prapatti. It is definitely in conformity with prapatti. So a boy or a girl who does work is surely following the path of prapatti. Even if there is any room for indolence while enjoying the flute of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, there is not the least room for inaction in the clarion call of the karma yoga of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
