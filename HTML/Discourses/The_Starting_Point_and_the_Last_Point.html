<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Whenever something is done, the doer should follow certain rules and regulations, and the authority that creates those rules and regulations is known as the &ldquo;controller&rdquo;. Here in this Universe of ours, so many actions are done, there are so many manifestations and expressions, so many waves are emanated from so many sources; so there must a strong controller.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->But that strong controller must not be a machine, nor should he be of mechanical order. He must be a loving entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now there are so many controllers in different fields and different spheres of our life. There are so many different expressions, so there are different controllers also. But above all controllers there is the Supreme Controller.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit, &ldquo;controller&rdquo; is <i>iishvara,</i> and the Supreme Controller is called &ldquo;Maheshvara.&rdquo; Now the rules and regulations of lower controllers may or may not be of perfect order, but the rules and regulations of the Supreme Controller must be of perfect order. Otherwise the equilibrium or equipoise of this Universe will be lost.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So our first duty as disciplined human beings is to do as per the desire of the Supreme Controller, of that Maheshvara. Just doing according to the desire of that Controller is a must for all spiritual aspirants. But while obeying Him, while doing as per His desire, one should always remember that Supreme Entity is not the boss; that Supreme Entity is the loving Father. The relationship is not official, the relationship is purely personal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You know if there is an impersonal entity controlling everything, having no link with you, in that case the psychology of discipline will not be created, because in that case an order is followed or obeyed or adhered to due to a fear complex &ndash; but in the field of spirituality there must not be any complex, neither fear complex nor shy complex nor any other complex. So the scriptures saying that if you do not obey Him you will go to Hell, like this, these scriptures are the worst enemy of human society. Because these scriptures create a complex, a fear complex, in the human mind, and that fear complex creates disparity in this human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->This human society is one. It is a singular entity. It cannot be divided; it must not be divided; and we won&#146;t allow any entity to create any fissiparous tendency in this human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Whatever a man is to do in his spiritual life he is to do &ndash; why? Because he is in love with the Supreme Entity. Love is the first word, love is the starting point, and love is the last point. And scriptures have no moral right to create a fear complex in the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
