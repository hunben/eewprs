Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; told him to utter some name. The man easily spoke the name aloud. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; then said:] Now I am withdrawing the capacity for speech from his vocal cord. Now again say that name. [The man opened and closed his mouth, struggling to speak, but could not utter a sound. All was silent. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; said:] In the same way, the powers of seeing, hearing, walking, etc., can be withdrawn easily and without one&#146;s knowledge by Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; He can easily withdraw the powers that He has given to human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There is vitality, vital energy, associated with the physical body. Where does this vital energy come from? Humans can speak: where does this power of speaking come from? Humans can see and hear: where does this power come from? He, the Supreme Consciousness, is the mind of your mind, the life of your life, the vocal power of your vocal cord. The sa&#x301;dhaka [the spiritual aspirant] who understands this attains salvation, enjoys the divine nectar. You see and hear, not because of your eyes, but because of His grace. He can do anything and everything. You may have so many desires, but they will not work unless they are supported by His desire.<!-- /block --></p>
