<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Now we come to the fourth of our various interpretations of &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> We come to another type of interpretation &ndash; the Ra&#x301;ja Yaogik interpretation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This human body is controlled by nerve fibres, which in turn are controlled by nerve cells. The human body generally moves as it is directed to by the mind. But when the body functions under the impact of certain inborn instincts, it does not require direction by the mind. Such actions are absolutely physical or mundane. Then there are some functions which, though physical, are also related to the mind, such as hunger, thirst, sleep and drowsiness. The latter functions are regulated by the ten va&#x301;yus [vital-energy flows] &ndash; pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, apa&#x301;n&#x301;a, sama&#x301;na, uda&#x301;na, vya&#x301;na (the five [internal] va&#x301;yus), and na&#x301;ga, ku&#x301;rma, krkara, devadatta and dhanain&#x32D;jaya (the five [external] va&#x301;yus). Through these external va&#x301;yus all kinds of natural functions are performed. The mind does not play any particular role in these cases.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->All other functions, however, are controlled by the mind. The mind will send instructions to the body according to how it (the mind) is controlled or regulated by physico-psycho-spiritual practices; and in order to control the mind the ten va&#x301;yus have to be brought under control. The systematic and scientific process to regulate the va&#x301;yus in order to control the mind is called pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma. Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;n yamayatyes&#x301;ah pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;mah  &ndash;  &ldquo;The process of controlling the va&#x301;yus is known as pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma.&rdquo; (The word pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma is derived as: [pra&#x301;n&#x301; + a&#x301; &ndash; yam + ghain&#x32D;].)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is a unique causal relationship between the functioning of the va&#x301;yus and the functioning of the mind. If someone keeps running at a certain pace by drawing rapidly on accumulated vital energy, the person&#146;s respiration becomes faster, and if the respiration becomes fast, one loses the capacity for deep thinking or deep contemplation. That is, one loses the capacity to think, or to assimilate or internalize any idea through the organs, in a calm and systematic way. [[If the mind is restless, the body will also be restless, and if the body is restless, the mind will also be restless.]] That is why during spiritual practice, the body should be kept motionless. One must practise seated in a certain posture, because if the body becomes calm and motionless the mind also tends to become calm and concentrated. If someone is constantly thinking that he or she will have to sit down at a certain time, stand up at a certain time, catch hold of one&#146;s nose or ears at a certain time, the mind will automatically tend to become restless. Such is the intimate relation between the body and the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Indriya&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;m manona&#x301;thah manona&#x301;thastu ma&#x301;rutah &ndash; &ldquo;The indriyas<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ndash; both sensory indriyas and motor indriyas &ndash; are controlled by [the mind and the mind is controlled by] the va&#x301;yus.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This sort of functioning of the mind is discharged in and through the body with the help of the nerve cells and nerve fibres. Its principle controlling centre is situated in the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra &ndash; the pineal gland &ndash; but its substations are located in various parts of the body.  The substations are located in sites of the body from which particular kinds of thought-waves control the adjacent areas of the body in their own respective ways. These substations are called cakra or padma or kamala &ndash; plexus in Latin &ndash; thus we have the various cakras &ndash; mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na, man&#x301;ipura, ana&#x301;hata, vishuddha, a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;, etc. The mind, instead of exerting its control directly from the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, exerts its control through the other cakras, the other plexi. Hence in order to advance spiritually, one has first to establish control over these lower cakras, then finally over the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra. If one, conversely, tries to control the sahasra&#x301;ra first while the other cakras remain uncontrolled, spiritual practice on the sahasra&#x301;ra may be hampered. Not only that; even if the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra can be brought under control, the final result will not be good if the subsidiary cakras are not brought under control. It is not enough that the driver of a car be efficient, the car as well must be free from any defect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The various cakras are controlled by particular biija mantras, particular acoustic roots, and also emanate sound vibrations; and every sound vibration coming from each such plexus &ndash; each such network of na&#x301;d&#x301;iis [psychic-energy channels] &ndash; is in scripture given the name of a particular devata&#x301; [deity], a particular vibrational existence. When you think in a particular way, your mind is vibrated in the corresponding way, and your nerve cells and nerve fibres are vibrated in the corresponding way. When someone gets angry, the mind also becomes heated and red, and there is a corresponding reaction in the nerves. The body becomes reddish and starts trembling. Now these devata&#x301;s or vibrational existences &ndash; each the repository of a particular kind of thinking and each representing one point in a given cakra &ndash; are controlled by the nuclei of their respective plexi, and all those nuclei are controlled by the human mind, which is the collective expression of fifty main propensities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Those fifty main propensities function both internally and externally. One may donate something to someone both internally and externally. Likewise, one can steal both mentally and physically. Hence every propensity is functioning in two ways, and fifty times two equals one hundred. Furthermore, each propensity functions in ten directions [north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, up and down]. One hundred times ten equals one thousand. Hence there are one thousand functioning propensities. These one thousand vrttis are controlled by the mind from the pineal gland, which is why [its corresponding cakra] is called sahasra&#x301;ra [sahasra means &ldquo;thousand&rdquo;]. So the nucleus of the sahasra&#x301;ra controls the sahasra&#x301;ra itself, every subsidiary plexus below the pineal gland, and the vrtti-controlling points of all those cakras. (Each of these points is a vibrational existence, a devata&#x301;.) All the devata&#x301;s of a given plexus are controlled by the controlling point of that plexus, and the supreme controlling point is the controlling point of the pineal gland. This supreme controlling point is called Paramashiva in yoga philosophy &ndash; Paramashivah Purus&#x301;ottamah vishvasya kendram [&ldquo;Supreme Consciousness at the nucleus of the universe is known as Paramashiva or Purus&#x301;ottama&rdquo;]. The same entity which is called Paramashiva or Purus&#x301;ottama in Ra&#x301;ja Yoga is known as &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra. This is one aspect [of the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a concept in philosophy]. This is a very important point which should be well understood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->When a spiritual aspirant can concentrate all his or her psycho-physical existence or individual &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling on Paramashiva or Purus&#x301;ottama in the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, the jiiva becomes Shiva. A jiiva is manifested out of Paramashiva as a jiiva in a human body &ndash; or rather, simultaneously in the Cosmic Body and in a human body. Each and every microcosmic structure is like a universe. Hence the yoga scriptures say, Traelokye ya&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni ta&#x301;ni dehatah &ndash; &ldquo;Whatever exists in the universe exists in your small structure as well.&rdquo; Just as the universe, starting from Paramashiva, Purus&#x301;ottama, flows on and on along the path of sain&#x32D;cara and attains the form of the crudest matter (if it undergoes further crudification it will explode), and thereafter starts moving on the path of subtlety, similarly in the human frame the last vertebra is the crudest manifestation. The last vertebra in the human body is termed kula in Sanskrit. So kula literally means &ldquo;that which bears the load of the entire body&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->[[The jiivabha&#x301;va [unit identity] sleeps [coiled around] that kula; spiritually it is asleep. &ldquo;Asleep&rdquo; means that it lies as if sleeping [around] that last bone with its own tail, that is, its own existence, clamped in its mouth. It sleeps like a snake. That sleeping devabha&#x301;va [divinity], sleeping jiivabha&#x301;va, that lies [around] the last point of the kula bone is called the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii.]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When human beings do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, an ideative entity, rises upward through the spine. It pierces through cakras one after the other, and simultaneously the thoughts or propensities controlled by their respective cakras are brought under control. As soon as the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii pierces the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na and man&#x301;ipura cakras, it brings under control all the propensities up to and including those of the man&#x301;ipura cakra. The man&#x301;ipura is the controlling cakra of ten propensities &ndash; shyness, sadistic tendency, envy, staticity, melancholia, peevishness, yearning for acquisition, infatuation, hatred, fear. When after rising and rising the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii reaches the sahasra&#x301;ra, it becomes one with Paramashiva. This is the state of liberation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->You know very well that in medieval India, Tantra branched  out  into  numerous  schools:  Saora  Tantra,  Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, Shaeva Tantra, Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, etc.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So according to yoga scripture, the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii resides in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra and Paramashiva in the sahasra&#x301;ra. And according to Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is called &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo; and Paramashiva is called &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. This is the essence of the concept of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Unfortunately, the actual underlying spirit of the Vaishnavite Cult is forgotten or ignored by many.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Quite often at the end of a [Vaishnavite] kiirtana you will hear that Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a have become united. The participants express this with a sentence that includes the words, Haribol, Haribol. The fact is that the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; has elevated the jiivabha&#x301;va [microcosmic bearing], and, it having become one with Paramashiva at the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, the microcosm has gone beyond the periphery of all bondages, and has attained the bliss of emancipation. This is the inner secret.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Here the seven cakras, from mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra to sahasra&#x301;ra, which the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii has to pierce, are the fetters or ropes which a spiritual aspirant has to snap. Pa&#x301;shabaddho bhavejjiivah, pa&#x301;shamukto bhavecchiva &ndash; &ldquo;Those who are in bondage are called jiivas, and those who have been freed are Shiva.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->This is the last of our interpretations of the term &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. In the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, Paramashiva is the controlling point. Paramashiva is the same as &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
