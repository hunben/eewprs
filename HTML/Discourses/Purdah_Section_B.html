<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Garbhaka. Garbha + kan = garbhaka. If the word is used in the masculine gender it is a flower circlet that is tucked into a woman&#146;s hair. In the olden days, a woman&#146;s evening dress included a garbhaka in her hair. Perhaps you know that in ancient India, there was no custom of using veils among the women. During the last part of the Pathan rule and in the early days of the Mughal period [16th-19th c.], the veil was forcibly imposed on the women of some aristocratic families in Burdwan, so that others could not see the ladies&#146; faces. Burdwan was the capital of Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Over a period of time, the use of the veil spread to other areas. Muslim rule was not firmly established in south India, so the veil was not introduced there. You will notice that even today the women of south India use garbhakas in the evenings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I remember some years ago at Anandanagar<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  I said that my daughters coming to Anandanagar need not cover their heads because it is the home of their father. Girls do not use veils at their parents&#146; house. I remember that it was the first time for the married women of north India to give up their veils. Many years have passed since then. The custom of using veils has disappeared from many urban areas of north India and is fast disappearing from the rural areas as well. That particular incident at Anandanagar set a healthy trend in this regard. This was a step forward in the direction of women&#146;s emancipation [in north India]. An auspicious beginning indeed!<!-- /block --></p>
