<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Physical Propulsion, Psychic Propensities and Spiritual Attainment.&rdquo; Wherever there is any physical structure, be it animate or inanimate, there is certain propulsion, or you may say propensive propulsion. In the case of inanimate objects the propulsion is of physical nature. In magnets there are certain characteristics. In water there are certain characteristics. These are all their physical propulsions or propensive propulsions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the case of animated structures, in animals or in human bodies, the propulsion is based on psychic specialities. That is, the propulsion is psycho-physical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Everything moves in this universe; everywhere there is expressed dynamicity. Nothing is static in this universe of ours. Not only in the realm of physicality, but in the psychic stratum also there is, we find, this movement. In the psychic stratum, rather in the psychic arena, the movement takes place through different propensities and with the help of certain inferences. So the mental structure of each animate body moves sometimes with proper acceleration, sometimes with retardation. Where there is retardation, a day will come when the mental structure will get crudified and become one with crude or material objects. Those who have not got any subtle ideology or goal are sure to become one with the crude world, one with the physical world, one with the world of atoms and electrons. What a dangerous situation! They will lose their identities and become one with the dust of the earth. So it is the duty of each and every sane human being to see that there remains movement in his or her mind, in his or her mental world, and that mental world, that mental movement should be charged with proper acceleration, because when there is no acceleration, retardation is sure to take place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now in the realm of physicality, in the stratum of physicality, there is some urge and there is some movement, rather actional movement. This urge is psycho-physical. What is this urge?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Phalisyatiiti vishva&#x301;sah siddherprathama laks&#x301;an&#x301;am<br>Dvitiiyam&#x301; shraddhaya&#x301; yuktam&#x301; trtiiyam&#x301; gurupu&#x301;janam?<br>Caturtho samata&#x301;bha&#x301;vo pain&#x32D;camendriyanigrahah<br>Sas&#x301;t&#x301;ain&#x32D;ca pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ro saptamam&#x301; naeva vidyate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In this phase of physicality, the first item of the psycho-physical urge is the firm determination that &ldquo;I must be successful in my mission.&rdquo; This firm determination is the first requisite factor. The second item is that one should have respect for one&#146;s goal. &ldquo;Shrat + dha&#x301; = shraddha&#x301;.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shrat&rdquo; means satyam, the Supreme Veracity, and &ldquo;dha&#x301;&rdquo; means movement towards that. So &ldquo;shraddha&#x301;&rdquo; means movement towards the Supreme Veracity. Sometimes people wrongly understand the word &ldquo;shraddha&#x301;&rdquo;. Shrat satyam&#x301; Tasmin dhiiyate ya&#x301;sa&#x301; shraddha&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Trtiiyam gurupu&#x301;janam: one should do as per the gospels of the preceptor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Caturtho samata&#x301;bha&#x301;vo: one must have balanced mind, that is, one must establish Prama&#x301; within and without i.e., in the physical, psychic and spiritual spheres. If Prama&#x301; is lost, it must be restored immediately.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Pain&#x32D;camendriya nigrahah: one must have self-restraint, one must not be goaded by crude propensities. How can a person who has no control over himself or herself, exercise control over others? It is not possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And &ldquo;S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hain&#x32D;ca pramit&#x301;a&#x301;ha&#x301;ro&rdquo;: one must have a balanced diet. &ldquo;Whatever I get, that I will eat&rdquo; &ndash; this must not be the policy of a sane being. This human body is a composite of protoplasmic cells, and these protoplasmic cells are made of the food we take in. If the food and drink is defective, then the protoplasmic cells will also become defective, and the human mind, which is the collective mind of so many protoplasmic minds, will also become defective. That is why ta&#x301;masik or static food has a negative influence on the human mind. These are the requisite factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->And in the psychic sphere, when the mind proceeds internally towards its Supreme Fulfilment, there will also be three separate stages for accelerated progress: Pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;tena pariprashnena sevaya&#x301;. Pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;ta means surrendering oneself before one&#146;s goal. The attitude of self-surrender is represented by sa&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;aun&#x32D;ga-pran&#x301;a&#x301;ma, which means to lie flat in a straight line like a rod. The idea is, however crooked I may be to others, to my ideology I am as simple and straight as a rod. That is why I lie prostrate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When one surrenders before one&#146;s ideology, one will automatically attain self-knowledge. One need not move here and there in pursuit of self-knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Idam&#x301; tiirtham idam&#x301; tiirtham&#x301; bhramanti ta&#x301;masa&#x301;h jana&#x301;h.<br>A&#x301;tma&#x301;tiirtham&#x301; na ja&#x301;nanti katham&#x301; moks&#x301;a vara&#x301;nane.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Here is a place of pilgrimage: if one takes a holy dip in this holy place of pilgrimage one will acquire one sort of merit. Over there is another place of pilgrimage: if one pours water on the deity over there one acquires another sort of merit. One does not acquire any spiritual progress in this way. This is not the path of true spirituality. One will have to move internally. So only a person who surrenders himself before his ideology can attain self-knowledge. This is the only way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Pariprashna means to get the detailed answers to all the questions which will facilitate one&#146;s individual progress as well as the collective progress of the cosmos, and also to apply that acquired knowledge in accelerating both individual and collective progress, Pariprashna does not mean to become a ship of knowledge: it means to know the answers to those queries which will accelerate and make the path of progress smooth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->And the third one is sevaya&#x301;. Seva&#x301; means rendering selfless service to the universe, not to a particular group of people but to anybody and everybody, to all living creatures &ndash; animals, plants or human beings. Service is unilateral, not mutual. Where it is mutual, it is not service &ndash; it is commercial transaction. You are giving salt to somebody and he pays you in return. This is not service. People should carry on commercial transactions to earn their bread and render service in order to attain their spiritual progress. Only those are successful people who follow this principle in life. This is the dharma of humanity. This is the practical dharma. When people deviate from this practical dharma, their progress is stopped, and the prama&#x301;trikon&#x301;a in the physical stratum is also destroyed. And in the absence of prama&#x301; trikon&#x301;a in the physical stratum, material prosperity will become an impossibility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now you are to move towards the spiritual world from the psychic stratum. When one proceeds in the psychic arena, having attained prama&#x301; sam&#x301;vrddhi in the individual and collective spheres, one should try to attain prama&#x301; rddhi also, and for this one requires two things. There must be some spirituo-psychic urge, and there must be some psycho-spiritual action, actional progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->What is that spirituo-psychic urge or spirituo-psychic propulsion? It is: I love my Lord, I love Him. My love knows no barriers, and in the field of activity I will be ready to do anything and everything for Him. I will recognize no obstacles, I will not care for anyone&#146;s blame or censure. The chariot of my victory will move undaunted, smashing all hindrance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->And on the psycho-spiritual path, one will proceed towards the object of ideation, the Supreme Entity, the Source of all benevolence. This movement towards the Supreme Entity is not only intended for one&#146;s individual emancipation, but for the emancipation of the entire universe. In the field of actional progress, one will attain prama&#x301; in the psychic sphere. Prama&#x301;-rddhi will be established both in the individual life and in the universe. And in the immediate next stage, that is, in the psychospiritual stage one will attain a purely spiritual stance, That is, one will attain prama&#x301; siddhi. It means that the aspirant has attained the goal. This one attains not out of one&#146;s self-interest, but for the promotion of the interests of all. One will be able to bring about welfare to one and all in a better way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In the last stage of this movement, that is, in the spiritual sphere, one comes in contact with the kaos&#x301;ikii shakti, the primordial force of creation. And through the lokatrikon&#x301;a which was established through prama&#x301; siddhi, which has prama&#x301; sam&#x301;vrddhi as one side, prama&#x301; rddhi as another side and prama&#x301; siddhi as the third side &ndash; one approaches the vertex of the gun&#x301;atrikon&#x301;a. This is the particular vertex of the unbalanced triangle, from which the kaos&#x301;ikii shakti came out moving in a straight linear order, not in a systaltic way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Now in this final stage of spiritual practice, the kaos&#x301;ikii shakti will move in a straight line in the opposite direction, along the upward movement of kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, and finally one will become one with the gun&#x301;atrikon&#x301;a. This is the state of perfect consummation of human existence; this is the glory of supreme spiritual attainment. You are the spiritual aspirants, it is your duty to establish a balanced triangle through prama&#x301; sam&#x301;vrddhi in the physical sphere, prama&#x301; rddhi in the psychic sphere, and prama&#x301; siddhi in the spiritual sphere. By this, your coming to this earth will be successful.<!-- /block --></p>
