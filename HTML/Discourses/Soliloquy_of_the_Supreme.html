<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is the soliloquy of the Supreme? His soliloquy is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Mayyeva sakalam&#x301; ja&#x301;tam&#x301; mayi sarvam&#x301; pratis&#x301;t&#x301;hitam,<br>Mayi sarvam layam&#x301; ya&#x301;ti tadbrahma&#x301;dvyamasmyaham.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Everything cometh from Me, remaineth in Me and goeth back in Me. &ldquo;Mayyeva sakalam ja&#x301;tam&rdquo;. Everything cometh from Me. That is, He desired that something should be created in His mind, that there should be a thought-projection, internal thought projection in His mind, that He should create the universe. And the universe came into being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->He wanted it. Why did He want it? Philosophers fail to find out the reason.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Why did He think like this that He would create the universe? Who can know the motive, the intention of the Supreme as to why He did create? But He created. It is not known to the philosophers, why such an idea to create come into His mind. But as I told you a few days back, where the philosophers fail, the bhaktas, the devotees succeed. Here the philosophers fail to give the satisfactory reply to others. Not only that, they fail to get a satisfactory reply for themselves. But the devotees can, because they have got deep love, internal love, unknown love, secret love for the Supreme within the core of their hearts. They say, &ldquo;We know what the reason is: He, our Lord was alone in this universe. If you are forced to remain alone in a house, you will become almost mad, what to speak of being alone in the entire universe.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Sa va&#x301; eka tada&#x301; drs&#x301;t&#x301;a na pashyat drshyamekara&#x301;t&#x301;,<br>Me ne santamiva&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; suptashaktirasuptadrk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Our Lord was alone. He had got the potentiality to see, to hear, to smell, to speak, to do anything and everything. But because there was no second entity whom to speak to? Whom to love? Whom to tell? Whom to punish, saying, &ldquo;My boy, why have you done wrong? Don&#146;t you deserve punishment? You should be punished.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->At that time He could not punish anybody because nobody was there. As there is nothing beyond Him, nothing without, so He could not get any second object to love or to punish. I did not say &ldquo;hate&rdquo; because He does not know how to hate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->He cannot do two things. He does not know how to hate and He does not know how to create a second &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a&rdquo;. He remains a singular entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So He has to create it within His mind, within His internal projection of thought. That is why the soliloquy is &ldquo;Mayyeva sakalam&#x301; ja&#x301;tam&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Mayi sarvam&#x301; pratis&#x301;t&#x301;hitam&rdquo;. After creation, He will have to look after the creation. Who else is to do this or take this responsibility? Because there was no second guardian factor to look after the creation; so His creation had to be looked after by Him. The responsibility of looking after the creation had to be shouldered by Him and by Him only.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Mayi sarvam&#x301; layam&#x301; ya&#x301;ti&rdquo;. Everything you know is moving. The universe is a passing show, is a moving reality, a fast changing panorama. Since the thought-waves are moving, the universe is also moving, everything is moving. In Sam&#x301;skrta, the world is called &ldquo;sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra&rdquo; (sam&#x301; &ndash; sr +ghain&#x32D;) which means moving by nature. The world is also called &ldquo;jagat&rdquo; (gam + kvip), which means moving. So, everything is moving, because thought-waves are moving. These thought-waves move in a systaltic order, in a pulsative way. After movement, where are those created beings to go? Finally, they are to merge, they are to come back to the starting-point, become the culminating point. That is why the soliloquy says &ldquo;Mayi sarvam&#x301; layam&#x301; ya&#x301;ti&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Everything cometh back to Me, there is no alternative. &ldquo;Na&#x301;nya pantha&#x301; vidyateyana&#x301;ya&rdquo;. It is the only route, the circular path known as Brahma Cakra, the Cosmological Order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tadbrahma&#x301;dvyamasmyaham&rdquo;. This is my own, these are my own. I am engaged in this duty of creating, then nourishing, retaining or maintaining and finally taking back everything within Me. This is my duty, and because of this duty, I am known as Brahma. I am the Singular Entity; there can not be two Brahmas. There can not be two Parama Purus&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I have these two imperfections. First, I can not create second Parama Purus&#x301;a. Whoever loves Me becomes one with Me. The person can not maintain his separate identity. That is why I always remain a Singular Entity. And the second thing is that as everything is created by Me, so everything is My child, everything is My progeny. That is why I can not hate anything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->I keep busy in the task of generating, maintaining and destroying and have no time to take rest.<!-- /block --></p>
