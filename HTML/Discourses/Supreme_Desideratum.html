<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->All the manifestations of the world are vibrational. The fundamental reality is vibrational. It is so not only for the realm of those quinquelementalities, but also for the ectoplasmic and supra-ectoplasmic strata. These vibrational manifestations come in contact with the living being through different cells and organs. Amongst the sensory organs, the most important experience living beings acquire is ocular experience. Ocular experience is received through the optical nerves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the realm of vision, colour is a very important factor. White represents the sentient principle, red represents the mutative principle, and black represents the static principle. There are seven controlling colours, and the process of permutation and combination to convey the large number of colours is not infinite. Had it been infinite in character, this expressed universe would also necessarily have been infinite. But actually this expressed universe is big, but not infinite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->That singular entity, with the help of different expressions of Prakrti, or different &ndash; what should I say &ndash; tactics of Prakrti, can emanate innumerable vibrations. That is why it is said that although He Himself is colourless, His creation is in innumerable colours. It is a colourful universe, with so many colours attracting living beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->White is no colour. The combination of all the colours is white. Black is no colour. Want of colour is black.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->With the help of different manifestations of the Operative Principle, the noumenal cause remains a singular entity, but the phenomenal expressions are many. The noumenal world is singular in character; the phenomenal world is multifarious in character.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->But why does He create this universe of so many colours, where there is a mess of so much colour? Why? What for? What is the intention? Why does He create like this?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Varn&#x301;a&#x301;naneka&#x301;ni nihita&#x301;rtha.&rdquo; Why? The inner spirit, the intention, is known only to Him and to nobody else, and whoever comes in close contact with Him, whoever is in deep love with Him, can understand the inner spirit. A jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii cannot know it, only devotees can know it, because devotees can come in close contact with Him and know the secret from Him secretly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If one moves towards the emanative point, the point from which all vibrations emanate, one will discover that the starting-point is the Supreme Entity and that one is moving forward as per pulsation of vibrations emanating from that Entity. One finds that the culminating point, of these vibrations is also that Supreme Desideratum, that Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is, the starting point is that Supreme Entity, and the culminating point of these vibrations is also that Supreme Entity. And to the Purus&#x301;a who is the starting-point and who is the Desideratum, to Him I say that He should attach our intellect with the spirit of welfare, with the spirit of shubha. This should be the only prayer for each and every living being.<!-- /block --></p>
