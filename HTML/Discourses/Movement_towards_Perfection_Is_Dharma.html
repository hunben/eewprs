<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In this world nothing is non-causal. Everything has a cause. The fact that you have been born as a human being has also a cause and a purpose. You may not know it, but the Supreme Being knows it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Life is movement from imperfection to perfection. When inanimate objects become animate there is progress. There is further progress when animate beings become multicellular, metazoic organisms, more and more complicated structures. The imperfection of a crab is not seen in a serpent. The human being is the highest being, the most perfect in structure. The human is thus a perfected animal. But this is only the beginning of progress for the human. The human still has to achieve further physical, intellectual and spiritual perfections.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Movement towards perfection, that is, God, is dharma; while movement towards imperfection is adharma.  The former is life, the latter is death. A human being&#146;s movement towards animalism is, therefore, death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->No movement is free from friction. Even when you walk, the force of gravity obstructs you. Movement towards perfection is obstructed by all the forces of imperfection. The sinful, the crude, the narrow, obstruct all movement for the expansion of a human being&#146;s mind. But, perfection being a God-ward movement, one should not be afraid. Move on; obstacles will go down the drain to which they belong; you will progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The human being&#146;s mission in life is movement towards perfection &ndash; towards God.  This is one&#146;s dharma, or duty. In this struggle, the forces of evil are bound to be defeated. That has been the case all along, and that will repeat itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You will have no right to rest until you have fulfilled your mission of being perfect, divine.  Establish yourself in perfection. Resting is a sin, as it puts a stop to the movement. Do not rest till you have reached the goal.<!-- /block --></p>
