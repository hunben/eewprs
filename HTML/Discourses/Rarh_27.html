<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Just as the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h engaged themselves in philosophical exercises on the one hand, on the other hand, in a lighter mood, they were ever vivacious, with laughter, amusements, dance, song, wit and humour. The people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are sociable and prefer to remain in company and in a pleasant mood. Though burdened with poverty, they invite people for meals. They serve what they themselves eat &ndash; rice, black gram (bir&#x301;i in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali), and curry of bar&#x301;i-posta [dumplings made of pulse, flavoured with poppy seeds] and pumpkin (&ldquo;pumpkin&rdquo; is d&#x301;im&#x301;la&#x301; in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali). They feel no inhibitions in their behaviour and actions due to their poverty. They do not feel shy to speak the correct thing in a clear way. Here is an example of the straightforwardness of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->A judge asked a very simple, illiterate Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii farmer, &ldquo;Well, you say that the land is yours; can you tell me how many embankments<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  there are on the land?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The illiterate farmer could not answer that question. He sat looking up in the air. The judge said, &ldquo;What in the world are you looking at?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The farmer said, &ldquo;Well, my lord, you have been sitting in judgement in this room for a long time. Now, without looking up, can you say how many beams and girders there are in the ceiling?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The judge said, &ldquo;Who tutored you to say this?&rdquo; The farmer said, &ldquo;No one, I spoke for myself. In my other statements I was tutored by the lawyer as to what to say. Now I spoke just the right thing, and you should give just the right judgement.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Such is the simplicity of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. So in the rural life of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, there is no end of festivals and there is no shortage of ingredients of merry-making. Inexpensive and common adornments are ingrained in the life of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h; but they have never been allowed to stand in the way of the simple lifestyle of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. From time immemorial, the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, like other Dravidian and Mongol populations, used to chew betel leaf and exchange it with others, and make wide use of non-Aryan things such as betel-leaf, betel-nut, banana, pieces of sugar cane, etc., during festivals, wedding ceremonies and other social functions. These things are absolutely non-Aryan. Equivalent words for these things are not to be found in the Aryan Sanskrit language; they are found in non-Aryan Sanskrit only. For example, &ldquo;betel-nut&rdquo; has no equivalent word in Aryan Sanskrit; in non-Aryan Sanskrit it is called guva&#x301;k or puun&#x32D;giphalam. From guva&#x301;k the Bengali word guya&#x301; has been derived &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[Hey Raun&#x32D;ga, let&#146;s go to the village market;<br>Let&#146;s buy and eat betel-nut and betel-leaf.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><b>&ldquo;Betel-leaf&rdquo;</b>: there is no equivalent word in Aryan Sanskrit. It is na&#x301;gvallarii or parn&#x301;a in popular Sanskrit. From this word parn&#x301;a the Bengali word pa&#x301;n&#x301; has come. In Sanskrit the word parn&#x301;a has two other meanings: &ldquo;mature leaf&rdquo; and &ldquo;yellow leaf&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>&ldquo;Banana&rdquo;</b>: there is no equivalent word in Aryan Sanskrit. It is kadalii or rambha&#x301; in non-Aryan Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><b>&ldquo;Sugar cane&rdquo;</b>: there is no equivalent word in Aryan Sanskrit. It is iks&#x301;u or kusherika&#x301; in non-Aryan Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The custom among the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of taking betel-leaf and betel-nut can be traced back to prehistoric days. The male-folk of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h used to carry with them a betel-leaf container and nut-cutter whenever they went out of doors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It is known to all, and is still true today, that the women-folk of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h still enjoy freedom to a great extent. This freedom has brought a sort of comfort in the life of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. In market-places and in paddy-fields, women and men work side by side. In ancient times, when hunting was a very widely-practised feature of life in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the men used to do the hunting and the women came back home with the killed birds and animals on their heads. The simple cosmetics which these women living in a free and clean manner used to resort to, after working in the paddy-fields, and coming back home with bundles of sticks on their heads, were to take a bath, applying a paste of raw turmeric over the body, and then to apply collyrium on their eyes, cakitaharin&#x301;iipreks&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301; [&ldquo;like the long and startled eyes of a deer&rdquo;]. The wide use of this collyrium would give the dark-complexioned women of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h a graceful appearance. Therefore at one time they would keep a container of collyrium inserted in their coiffures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In other words, at that time the men of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h always had a nut-cutter with them, and the women always had a container of collyrium. Even today during a wedding ceremony in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, in continuation of that old custom, the groom holds a nut-cutter and the bride has on her head a container of collyrium.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->It goes without saying here that the custom of wearing veils appeared in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h at the beginning of the Mughal Age.<!-- /block --></p>
