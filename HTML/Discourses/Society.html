<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->(1) Before taking food, ascertain if anybody present there has not eaten. If anyone has not eaten, do not take food unless the person willingly gives permission.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->(2) Whatever food you have, distribute it equally among all the Margis present, and then eat. But if somebody expresses unwillingness to eat, that is a different matter. You need not then feel restrained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->(3) Love all, trust in all, but do not give responsibility to those not established in Yama-Niyama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->(4) Science is not the enemy of humanity. Avidya&#x301; (ignorance) is the enemy of humanity. Keep strict vigilance that the knowledge of science is confined only to those persons who are established in Yama-Niyama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->(5) Hypocrites are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->(a) Those who give indulgence to falsehood;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->(b) Those who are ungrateful to their benefactors;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->(c) Those who do not keep their word;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->(d) Those who betray;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->(e) Those who slander behind one&#146;s back.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->(6) You may come to a temporary truce with a hypocrite, but do not forgive till his/her nature is reformed. Immediate forgiveness is a special weakness of mind. It results in worse harm to society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those who cherish class distinctions, communalism, provincialism and casteism while indulging in propaganda about universalism are also hypocrites.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->(7) Help the weak and the helpless in all possible ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->(8) You should always strive to maintain the honour of women, without considering whether a woman belongs to a particular caste or religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->(9) Never attack the religious beliefs of anyone. Make the person understand gradually with logic. If you attack a person&#146;s religious beliefs, it means you have attacked Ananda Marga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->(10) Distinctions based on profession, wealth and birth are man-made. You must not give indulgence to these things in any way. Only vested interests are behind class distinctions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->(11) To ensure the subsistence of a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas (spiritual teachers), all kinds of sacrifice should be accepted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->(12) One who does not come forward to help when seeing a person in distress is unworthy to be called a human being &ndash; he or she is a slur on Ananda Marga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->(13) The unity of Ananda Margis should not be allowed to be jeopardized for any reason. Unity should be maintained even at the risk of your life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->(14) If an Ananda Margi engages in harming another Ananda Margi he or she remains under the condemnation of A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rtijii till his/her conduct is reformed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->(15) Agriculture, arts, commerce and other developmental work should, as far as possible, be carried out on a cooperative basis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->(16) Fine arts lead human beings to the trans-sensory realm; hence sa&#x301;dhakas should not discourage fine arts; rather they should support them, directly or indirectly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->(17) Artists are great benefactors of society, hence take active steps for their protection. For example, before enacting a drama or its translation, enough money for a day&#146;s maintenance must be given to the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->(18) If a drama or other art performance is staged and a charge is made for tickets, after deducting the incidental expenditure, the remaining money should be distributed among the artists, half on the basis of labour and half on the basis of merit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->(19) The faults of others should be excused as far as possible. If you find that the conduct of an individual is antisocial, you should try to reform his or her nature by resorting to whatever severe measures may be necessary. Remember, he or she is not your enemy, but his/her conduct is the enemy of your society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->(20) Four kinds of debt are irredeemable &ndash; debt to father, debt to mother, debt to a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya, and debt to guru (divine debt).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->(a) The only way to do service to one&#146;s father after his death is to help every male member of the universe to progress on the path of highest development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->(b) The only way to do service to one&#146;s mother after her death is to help every female member of the universe to progress on the path of highest development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->(c) The best service to the a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya is to work for the comfort and benefit of one&#146;s a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya and his/her family.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->(d) The best service to Ma&#x301;rga Guru is to work according to His wishes. But however much service one renders, one will not redeem the four debts until Moks&#x301;a (salvation) is attained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->(21) Seva&#x301; (service) is of four kinds &ndash; shu&#x301;drocita, vaeshyocita, ks&#x301;atriyocita and viprocita. This is known as nr yajin&#x32D;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Serving the sick, performing the funeral rites of a dead body, helping the suffering and doing all possible developmental work, through physical labour, is known as shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Economic service to living beings and the giving of food and water is vaeshyocita seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->To rescue a person in distress, or to compel a person moving on the wrong path to come to the right path, by one&#146;s strength, physical capability and courage, is ks&#x301;atriyocita seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->To help human society in its mental and spiritual development by application of para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na (intuitional knowledge) is viprocita seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Remember that the value of each service is the same. Whatever kind of service is most necessary at a given time should be rendered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The scriptures express that vipras are like the head of vira&#x301;t&#x301;purus&#x301;a (Supreme Consciousness), ks&#x301;atriyas are like the arms, vaeshyas are like the trunk and shu&#x301;dras are like the two legs. Think, therefore, are not all four purposive? The head controls the legs, and the legs support the head.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The result of viprocita seva&#x301; is lasting and that of the rest is short-lived. But even so, under special conditions, ks&#x301;atriyocita, vaeshyocita or shu&#x301;drocita service may be the only recourse &ndash; there viprocita seva&#x301; may perhaps be completely meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->(As the base of the jiiva [being] is Brahma, so the base of society is the shu&#x301;dra; hence for one who cannot be a good shu&#x301;dra, to try to become ks&#x301;atriya, vaeshya or vipra is meaningless.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->An Ananda Margi will have to be vipra, ks&#x301;atriya, vaeshya and shu&#x301;dra all at once.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->(22) Businessmen:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->(a) Do not create pressure of circumstances to force anyone to buy your goods.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->(b) Do not sell adulterated goods.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->(c) [[Even]] if you feel it difficult to run your business as a result of not selling adulterated goods, completely stop purchase and sale [[of such goods]], and do not forgive adulterators till they are reformed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->(d) Remember, for you the greatest opportunity lies in vaeshyocita seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->(e) Specially ensure that the stores of the disaster relief section of the Marga remain full.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->(23) Employees of different institutions:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->(a) Consider yourselves as servants of the common people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->(b) Do not, on any account, accept or offer a bribe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->(c) If someone, through pressure of circumstances compels you to offer or accept a bribe, do not forgive that person till he/she is reformed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->(d) If, in consideration of the power of your post, anyone offers you a present, that should count as a bribe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->(24) Householders:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->(a) If someone offers you something out of regard for you (and not in consideration of the power of your post), you should accept and use it cheerfully, however inexpensive it might be.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->(b) You should cooperate fully with all welfare activities, governmental or non-governmental.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->(c) Do not offer a bribe to anyone. If someone through pressure of circumstances forces you to offer a bribe, do not forgive that person till he/she is reformed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->(d) Unless the doctor objects, his fair dues must be paid.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->(25) Doctors:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->(a) The convenience of the patient must be given more consideration than your own.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->(b) If the patient dies, do not take any fee for that visit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->(c) If all the children of the dead person are minors, then unpaid fees should be forsaken.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->(d) Do not use adulterated medicine. [[Even]] if you feel it difficult to carry on your practice without using such medicine, purchase and sale of that medicine should be stopped, and as long as the nature of the adulterators of that medicine is not reformed, do not forgive them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->(26) Political workers:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->(a) Do not be misled by anybody&#146;s tall talk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->(b) Do not have any dealings with a party whose policies are opposed to those of the Marga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->(c) Continue efforts to change the activities of a party whose policies are in agreement with the Marga but whose activities are opposed to it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->(d) Those not established in Yama-Niyama should not get the opportunity to assume leadership.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->(e) For the selfish and hypocrites, politics is the best instrument to achieve their selfish ends; hence when dealing in politics proceed very cautiously and with sharp eyes all around.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->(27) Electorate:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->(a) Do not be misled by anyone&#146;s tall talk. Judge merit by seeing the performance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->(b) Remember, whatever position one is in offers sufficient opportunity to work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->(c) One whose character is not in accordance with Yama-Niyama should not get opportunity for becoming a representative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->(d) Only people established in Yama-Niyama [[are worthy of]] your support; in case of more than one such person, vote for the best worker.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->Rather than support an [[unworthy]] person, it is better not to exercise one&#146;s franchise because to invest an [[unworthy]] person with power means to push society towards destruction knowingly and deliberately.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->(28) The steps of sha&#x301;sti (corrective punishment):<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->(a) First attempt to bring the guilty person around through sweet words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->(b) Secondly, adopt a stiff attitude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->(c) Thirdly, tell him or her about the possible punishment for the offence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->(d) Fourthly, take steps for punishment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->(29) Degrees of crime:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->(a) Activities harmful to the Marga, [[hypocrisy]], theft and the persecution of women are the greatest crimes. Such criminals should be categorized as maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takiis (great sinners) and severe measures should be taken against them from the beginning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->(b) Weapons should not be used against those criminals who are not maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takiis and are weaponless. If a criminal is alone, more than one person must not attack him with weapons; and if he asks for forgiveness, whether you forgive him or not, do not hit him. Do not attack from behind. Do not take severe measures against old people and children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->(30) Dharma (spirituality) is for all walks of individual and collective life. Those who think that dharma is a personal system of worship or that dharma is completely a personal affair are wrong, and their mistake: hurts collective progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->(31) Service and tolerance:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->(a) Cooperate with all in the field of social service.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->(b) Propagate Ananda Marga ideology without casting aspersions on others out of intolerance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->(c) Try your best to arrange alternative means of livelihood for religious professionals, irrespective of their connection with Ananda Marga, if they face financial difficulties as a result of extensive propagation of Ananda Marga ideology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->(32) No one in Ananda Marga is anyone&#146;s servant. Use terms like &ldquo;agricultural assistant&rdquo; or &ldquo;family assistant&rdquo; according to the nature of their work. Look after your assistants as your own children and pay attention towards their all-round development. Fix the time for their Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na and help them to acquire social status. Never be an impediment their progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->(33) Set an example of manliness by marrying a shelterless woman. Do not under any circumstances allow her to lead a disrespectable life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->(34) The meaning of the Sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&#x301; mantra should be realized in life. Always remain united. Solve all problems, big or small, with unity. Consider misfortune of one as the misfortune of all, an injury to one as an injury to all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->(35) You may participate in all kinds of innocent ceremonies. As, in principle, you do not support the philosophy of those who, in the name of worship of God, indulge in idolatry, do not participate in their ceremonies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->36) If dowry is demanded on behalf of either the bride or the bridegroom at a wedding, you can help out manually as required, and if you feel like it, you can give a present, but you must not take food there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph --><b>37) Priityanna</b>: If a person wants to feed you out of genuine intimacy, you should take that food happily, even if it is just grains and vegetables. But if someone invites you only to make a show to people, never accept his/her food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph --><b>A&#x301;padanna</b>: When life is jeopardized because of the lack of food and water, you need not consider whether the food is prohibited on any grounds or comes from an unworthy person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph --><b>Shra&#x301;ddha&#x301;nna</b>: Shra&#x301;ddha&#x301;nna (food offered at a memorial service) is neither priityanna nor a&#x301;padanna, hence it is not to be taken.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->38) The habit of making wagers is extremely undesirable. You must avoid lotteries and gambling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->39) Prerequisites for sha&#x301;sti:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->a) Before punishing a person you should consider whether you love him/her or not. You do not have the moral right to punish one whom you do not love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->b) Punishment should be meted out to reform and not to cause suffering.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->c) The quantum of punishment must not exceed the quantum of love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->d) If some innocent person is pained by any of your actions, then without considering whether he/she is your superior or inferior, you should sincerely seek his/her forgiveness; this will only enhance your prestige.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph -->40) You should try to get advice from everyone, but accept only the best. One whose advice you were unable to accept should not feel internally that he/she is trifling or insignificant to you, to society, or to the organization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph -->41) Do not judge anyone to be good or bad hastily, nor express your opinion. Even a small mistake in your decision or in your expression may result in collective harm to society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->42) Remember, with every person you have a relationship of love and not of fear; those who love you will certainly give you recognition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="104"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=104 type=paragraph -->43) Do not hurt an honest person even slightly.<!-- /block --></p>
