<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In all three worlds &ndash; human world, animal world and plant world &ndash; there are some common characteristics which determine their respective identities. In spite of that, living beings and plants are not exactly the same. Living beings have certain special duties and distinct characteristics which distinguish them from plants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Had living beings not possessed these special characteristics, we would not have called them &ldquo;living beings&rdquo; but would have called them &ldquo;plants&rdquo; The characteristics that are common to animals and plants are also inherent in human beings, but human beings also have certain additional characteristics, without which they would be no different from birds, animals, plants and creepers, etc. It is the bounden duty of each and every human being to awaken and develop their unique characteristics, for upon this depends the excellence of the human race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Human beings lacking these characteristics are not worthy of the appellation &ldquo;human&rdquo; &ndash; they should be called something else. No human being wants to become degraded. To prosper in life, to move along the path of development step by step, is the natural desire of all. It is the duty of those accorded a status of excellence to move together with the rest of society. For some to advance far ahead while others lag behind is not at all desirable. If anything like this were to happen, it would not be at all glorious for those who have advanced.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->History has been written and is read &ndash; it was written in the past; it will be written in the future. But I suggest that in the writing of history there should be a radical change. The history written so far is a history of kings and monarchs. It should be thoroughly overhauled and completely rewritten &ndash; rewritten in the interest of humanity and the universal well-being of the human race. If the chronicles of history merely describe who succeeded to the throne and when, who plundered the neighbouring countries or kingdom, and who became a minister, they will be of no importance whatsoever, nor, indeed, of any interest to the common masses. If human beings are to profit from the study of the annals of history, they must reflect the weal and the woe, the hopes and aspirations of the masses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The annals of human history should show which communities brought about which amount of progress and prosperity in which area of social life and in which part of the world &ndash; only such significant events are worthy of being recorded. History should also maintain special records of the trials and tribula tions which confronted human beings, how those trials and tribulations were overcome, how human beings tackled the numerous obstacles to effect greater social development, and so on. Only such history would I call the complete history or complete cultural history of the human race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The history of the human race should be written according to the inherent special characteristics of human beings. Only then will we know how successful the human beings of the past were in developing their latent noble qualities, and how much they have progressed today. A handful of people out of millions may reach the pinnacle of progress and provide inspiration for thousands of others, but this will not benefit the entire human race. We will have to be particularly persevering to ensure that the special characteristics, that is the innate Dharma, of all people are fully developed. Some people may be dissatisfied with such a writing of history, but from this type of historical analysis people will gain inspiration and derive great strength to move ahead.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Some people say that both sannyasins (renunciates) and householders are required for the smooth running of society. Now the question is, is their Dharma different? Will there be a separate history for each of them? My emphatic answer is, &ldquo;NO&rdquo;, because the quadri-dimensional manava dharma (human dharma) is one and the same. It includes: vistara (expansion), rasa (flow), seva&#x301; (service) and moks&#x301;a (spiritual emancipation). Is the observance of manava (bhagavad) dharma equally obligatory for both the sannyasins and the householders?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The only difference between them is as follows: householders have to care for two families whereas the renunciates have to care for only one. The householders&#146; two families are their own small family consisting of father, mother, brothers, sisters, husband or wife, sons, daughters, etc. and the larger human family, that is, the entire universe. The householders will have to maintain a balance between both these families.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The householders will have to look after the larger family as well, but for that they may take the assistance of the sannyasins. Sannyasins do not have a small family of their own &ndash; their family is the entire universe. In order to maintain that family they, in turn, may take the help of the householders. Therefore it is clear that manava dharma is the same for both the householders and the renunciates.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->When we write the history of genuine human progress, the glorious role of both the householders and the renunciates will be written in letters of gold. Only by writing such a history will human beings one day prove not only to this world but to the entire universe, that Parama Purus&#x301;a was justified in creating human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
