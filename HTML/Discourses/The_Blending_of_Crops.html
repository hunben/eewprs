<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Our system of integrated farming is designed to utilize every inch of land. Not only should the surface land be fully utilized, but the space under the surface, and even the space above the surface, should be used to the maximum. The surface, the sub- surface and the space above the surface is to be used 100%.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There are three main systems of cropping which will ensure the maximum utilization of land &ndash; mixed cropping, supplementary cropping and crop rotation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In mixed cropping two or more crops are grown in a field at the same time. For example, potato, spices, brinjal, pumpkin and cauliflower are suitable for mixed cropping. Mixed cropping reduces soil erosion and the wastage of agricultural land, and makes better use of water. It also helps retain the fertility of the soil. For instance, legumes add nitrogen to the soil whereas maize consumes nitrogen, so these crops should be planted together. Well selected plant combinations maintain the fertility and structure of the soil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In supplementary cropping there is one main crop and a minor crop to support it. This system is different from mixed cropping where all crops are major.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In crop rotation the soil is under cultivation for most of the year. In the Purulia district of West Bengal, many farmers grow only one crop of paddy a year. Through crop rotation four crops can be harvested in a year. In the rainy season no mixed crop can be grown with paddy, only small fish. Autumn paddy can be combined with big onions, summer paddy with radish, and spring paddy with small onions grown from seeds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Cultivation should be done on the cooperative basis. Only cooperatives can support the expanding economic requirements of agriculture, like creating ponds, purchasing machinery, uniting local people to pressurise the government for irrigation facilities, etc. Through the cooperative system four crops of rice in a year can easily be grown from any plot of land.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Mango can be grown as a roadside tree. Between two mangoes one palm should be planted &ndash; one mango, one palm, one mango, etc. Agave (sisal) can then be grown as a fill up plant between them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Oranges<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Orange trees must be planted 15-20 feet apart. Between two orange trees there should be one coffee tree. Then between the orange and coffee trees there should be two tea plants approximately three feet apart from each other. Between these there should be ginger as a fill up. Each ginger plant should be two feet apart from each other. All the rows should be parallel in a grid formation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->There are no soil or rainfall considerations for oranges, but calcium must be present in the soil in sufficient quantity because it makes the fruit sweet. There are no soil considerations for tea either, but there should be a lot of rainfall which does not accumulate around the plant. Coffee can grow with less rainfall than tea, and it can grow in poor soil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Suggested orange varieties include: <ol> <li>Nagpuri orange (small size) <li>Kalimpong variety (big fruit with space between the skin and the fruit, watery taste) <li>Assam variety (small size, sweet) <li>Silal variety (small size, very sweet) <li>South Indian variety (a little bigger than Nagpuri) <li>Other varieties, including Valencia, Italian, Maltese, etc. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Wheat<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Wheat, poppy (ordinary poppy or opium poppy) and mustard can be grown as blended crops. Peas, lentils, khesa&#x301;ri, etc. may be planted with wheat as well as poppy. If any of these plants occupy 10% of a wheat field, the yield of the wheat will be increased so that the production of wheat will be the same as when wheat occupied the whole field. Also, if wheat, peas and khesa&#x301;ri are planted together, the production of wheat will be as much as when wheat was grown alone. Yellow mustard, red mustard and the ra&#x301;i variety of mustard may all be sown as mixed crops with wheat. The larger variety of lentil may be cultivated along with wheat as a winter crop after the land has been tilled.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Radish<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->When growing rainy season radish, mis&#x301;t&#x301;i danta sha&#x301;k (a sweet green leafy vegetable) should be planted in between the radish plants. The seedlings of the radish should be planted with a&#x301;us paddy. For this the soil should be wet, but not waterlogged.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->CROP ROTATION<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The two main principles of crop rotation are: 1) maximum crops should be planted in the minimum period of time, and 2) maximum crops should be planted in the minimum space. These two principles are to be implemented without affecting the fertility of the soil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->An example of the first principle is reaping four crops of rice in a year where there was only one, two or three before. For instance:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->1) In Vaesha&#x301;kha transplanted a&#x301;us or summer paddy can be planted and in Shra&#x301;van&#x301;a it can be harvested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->2) In Shra&#x301;van&#x301;a transplanted a&#x301;man or rainy season paddy can be planted and in Ka&#x301;rttika it can be harvested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->3) In Ka&#x301;rttika early boro or autumn paddy can be planted and in Ma&#x301;gha it can be harvested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->4) In Ma&#x301;gha late boro or spring paddy can be planted and in Vaesha&#x301;kha it can be harvested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->In central Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h there are only four months of rain. For the rest of the year there is little or no rain, yet it is still possible to get four crops a year. For example, with a&#x301;us paddy, radish should be planted between the rows of rice. With a&#x301;man paddy, small fish but no crops should be cultivated. The fish maintain the water level in the field and can be caught by carnivorous humans or animals, or left in the field to fertilize the soil after the water has dried up. With early boro paddy, big onion and safflower as a boundary plant should be cultivated. With late boro paddy, onion seeds which produce onion bulbs should be planted as a subsidiary crop.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->A special system is used to grow rice in two and a half or three months instead of four. Early in the year transplanted a&#x301;us seedlings should be grown. A&#x301;us takes four months before it is ready for harvesting, so for the first four weeks the a&#x301;us seedlings should be kept in a nursery, and for the remaining two and a half to three months they should be grown in the field. The period for a&#x301;us is Vaesha&#x301;kha, Jyes&#x301;tha&#x301; As&#x301;a&#x301;dha and Shra&#x301;vana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->In between the a&#x301;us seedlings radish can be grown. A good variety of oil which is a substitute for mustard oil can be produced  from the seeds of radish. The radish should be of the summer variety. The leaves of radish are very good for the liver.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->After a&#x301;us, a&#x301;man variety of paddy can be grown according to the same system used for a&#x301;us &ndash; that is, one month in the nursery and two and a half to three months in the field. The a&#x301;man paddy should be in the nursery while the a&#x301;us crop is in the fields. The period for a&#x301;man is Shra&#x301;van&#x301;a&#x301;, Bha&#x301;dra, A&#x301;shvina and Ka&#x301;rttika. There cannot be any blended crop with a&#x301;man, but instead pisciculture can be practised. During a&#x301;man cultivation some fertilizer may be necessary, but whatever fertilizer is used should be non-poisonous, otherwise it will kill the fish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h the soil is of a sticky nature so it does not allow water to seep underground. This type of soil is very good for a&#x301;man cultivation. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h has the best soil for a&#x301;man cultivation in the entire world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->After a&#x301;man we have to cultivate the early variety of boro according to the same system. With boro, onion and garlic can be grown as blended crops between the seedlings. Around the boundary of the field, one line of safflower seeds can be grown.  Oil which has medicinal value can be produced from the seeds of onion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->After early boro, late boro paddy should be cultivated following the same system. As a blended crop in between the seedings, transplanted onion can be grown. Onion is static so A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rgiis should not take it. However, onion leaves are mutative in the daytime, not at night, so householders can eat them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->So according to this crop rotation system, fields will be occupied for two and a half to three months each by four crops a year, totalling ten or eleven months. For the remaining period, the fields should be prepared for the next rotation. This is an example of how to get maximum crops in minimum period of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->This type of paddy rotation system is best for sticky or clay soil. If the soil is half sandy half sticky alluvial soil, barely two paddy crops &ndash; a&#x301;us and amam &ndash; can be grown. Wheat and mustard can be cultivated the rest of the year. Planting 20% mustard with wheat will increase the production of wheat by 150%. Peas or lentils can also be grown with the wheat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Two potato crops &ndash; one of 60 days or early potato and the second of 90 days or late potato &ndash; can be grown in a season. 60 day potato is produced for immediate consumption. It cannot be stored because it is not fully matured, but the 90 day crop can be stored. Both varieties can be dried, powdered and then stored.  60 day potato grows in the months of A&#x301;shvina and Ka&#x301;rttika, while 90 day potato or mature potato grows in the months of Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a, Paus&#x301;a and Ma&#x301;gha. With 90 day potato different types of spices can be grown, such as coriander, cumin and chandani. Cauliflower and pumpkin can also be grown. If potato is grown in the mounds of a ploughed field, brinjal can be grown in the furrows from cuttings, as it needs more water. The winter variety of chilli can also be grown.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->The second principle of crop rotation is growing maximum crops in the minimum space. An example of this is as follows. Grow potato in mounds in rows with a cauliflower between each potato as a surface crop. The potatoes are root crops, so no competing root crop, such as peanut, should be grown at the same time. On the slopes of the mounds small spices like cumin can be planted. After one month when the potatoes have partly grown, canals for irrigation should be dug between the rows of potatoes. In the canals brinjal, cucumber and chilli can be planted. Cauliflower matures before potato. When it matures it can be cut, but the roots should be left in the soil so as not to disturb the potato crop.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Another example is wheat. 20% mustard can be planted with 80% wheat. Mustard grows leaves which can be used as a vegetable and seeds which can be pressed to produce oil. If mustard oil cake is put in water until it starts giving off a bad smell, and is then mixed with more water and spread on the fields, it makes a good fertilizer. Bees can also utilize the flowers to make excellent honey. In addition, on the border of the field two rows of garlic should be grown so that their spacing is in the configuration of equilateral triangles. In the middle of each triangle, one  safflower seed should be sown to make another row of safflower flowers. So, four crops can be grown: wheat, mustard, garlic and safflower. Other crops also can be grown as blended crops.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->For very infertile soil, barley rotation can be grown with a supplementary crop. For example, 20% of the area reserved for the barley crop can be planted with red mustard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->If one is going to cultivate sugar cane, banana or radish, the seeds, cuttings or roots should be brought from at least twelve miles away. However, they may come from the opposite bank of a river which is less than twelve miles away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->The brinjal plant should have thorns, as the thorny brinjal produces tasty brinjal. White brinjal should not be cultivated because it is static and makes the soil infertile.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->When cultivating lentils, high quality manure should be used, and the best manure for this purpose is the oil cake of castor. Lentils crops should not be discontinued simply because they need good fertilizer, because they can be used to produce refined vegetable oil and lubricants. Linseed can also be used to manufacture refined vegetable oil and lubricants, as well as scented hair oil, linen cloth, etc. Linseed can be cultivated after lentils.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->When there is a scant supply of water, a &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> of the ra&#x301;i variety of mustard can be grown. The mustard seeds should be spread out over the whole field while it is still wet after the rainy season, then the crop will grow through the dry season.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->It is not economical to cultivate sugar cane in Bengal because it occupies the land for a whole year. Sugar beet should be grown instead, because three crops can be grown in a year. However, sugar beet cannot supply molasses, which is a very famous food in rural Bengal. Also, seeds cannot be produced from sugar beet due to the hot climate, so they have to be imported from outside the region. Research should be done to develop varieties of sugar beet which produce seeds in warm climates.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Some examples of crop rotation include the following:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->2) A&#x301;shvina &ndash; half the field should be planted with red mustard and linseed, and the other half with yellow mustard and winter sesame. The soil should be properly tilled before the crops are sown. These crops take four months to mature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->3) Ma&#x301;gha, Pha&#x301;lguna, Caetra &ndash; peanut and late sarguja&#x301; (an oil seed).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->3) A&#x301;shvina, Ka&#x301;rttika, Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a, Paos&#x301;a &ndash; half the area should be planted in winter sesame with red mustard, and the other half with linseed and yellow mustard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->4) Ma&#x301;gha, Pha&#x301;lguna &ndash; sunflower should be planted for 65-80 days, the growing period of the crop, along with green gram.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->Potato and Radish<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->Potato and radish crop rotation should be done according to the following system:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->1) A&#x301;shvina to Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a &ndash; Early potato or 60 day potato.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->The best system for preparing the field for potato is to plough the field sixteen times &ndash; twelve times by tractor and four times by power tiller. Fertilizers like NPK (nitrogen, potassium and phosphate) may be used, either 20:20:20 or 28:28:0 (and then add potash) about 500 kg per acre. Early potatoes are planted in rows twenty inches apart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->Between the potatoes there should be any variety of early radish. Radish does not have such wide roots. The main root comes down in such a way that it does not affect the potatoes. Along with these some small spices such as kalo zira, mongrela, fenugreek, five spices, cumin, small ajwain, celery, etc. may be planted. Ajwain is &ldquo;jamani&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta, &ldquo;jamain&rdquo; in Urdu and &ldquo;Trachyosparmum amni&rdquo; in Latin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->In the irrigation canal between rows of potatoes, winter pumpkin, winter brinjal (Varanasi varieties), anise, coriander, cumin, and/or capsicum should be grown. The canal is not dug until the potatoes are one foot tall. First put water on the soil, then manure and then dig the canal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->Another crop rotation of early turnip and sugar beet can be planted with early potatoes. Varieties of cauliflower may also be planted, but they must spend the first month in a nursery, then two months in the field. They should be planted on the mound or hill along with the potatoes. The plants must be watered at least every 8-10 days in the initial stage of their growth. When they get bigger they do not need so much water. One month later, when the potato plants are one foot tall, an irrigation canal should be dug between the rows. The dirt from the canal should be placed on the mound around the plants growing there.  This will preserve the soil and help the plants as well. In the irrigation canal, plant winter brinjal, early lettuce, tomato, palang sha&#x301;k (a green leafy vegetable), big onions, small onions and varieties of cabbage. There are only two varieties of lettuce, early and late. The lettuce should be harvested along with the potato.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->The cauliflower is harvested after two months in the field.  During this time the potato should be left one month more to spread its roots. Lettuce requires three months and should be harvested with potato. After cauliflower, the early cabbage should be ready in one month.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->Then again the soil is tilled eight times &ndash; six by tractor and two by tiller, and the same ratio of NPK should be used, but in a lesser amount.<!-- /block --></p>

Dry and big winter chilli should also be grown in the canal. Big seedlings should be grown so that the plants flower within fifteen days after planting. For one week after planting, the seedlings should be covered with shade to avoid direct sunlight, but in the night they should not be covered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="167"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=167 type=paragraph -->Sugar Crops<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="168"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=168 type=paragraph -->Sugar crops include the following:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="169"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=169 type=paragraph -->1)Sugar cane &ndash; Sugar cane is of Indian origin and comes within the grass group. It is a medium-sized grass. The percentage of sugar produced differs from one variety to another. Traditionally, sugar cane is planted just before winter, but this system is a bit defective. The best season for planting is the early spring in the month of Pha&#x301;lguna. The cuttings must be brought from at least twenty kilometres away, otherwise they will be prone to pests and disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="170"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=170 type=paragraph -->If sugar cane is grown, it should be planted along with late boro paddy. In the month of Jyaes&#x301;t&#x301;ha, after harvesting boro paddy, the plants should be bundled up with the leaves of the sugar cane. The place between two sugar cane plants may be utilized either for green gram, which grows in sixty days, peanuts, or maize of the taller variety. In the month of As&#x301;a&#x301;dha, after removing the grass, the vacancy between two sugar cane plants may be utilized for growing turmeric. Turmeric requires half sunlight and half shade. It will grow well in sugar cane fields. In the month of Ka&#x301;rttika, after harvesting the turmeric, if a place remains between two sugar canes, it may be utilized for producing sweet potato or sweet juice potato.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="171"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=171 type=paragraph -->2) Sugar beet &ndash; Sugar beet is an all-season crop, but in India it is grown only in the winter season between A&#x301;shvina and Pha&#x301;lguna. It may be grown along with potato between two potato plants on the upper portion of the valley, that is, on the mound. The lower portion of the mound may be utilized for growing winter spices. Sugar beet may be produced both with early potato (A&#x301;shvina to Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a) or late potato (Paus&#x301;a to Pha&#x301;lguna).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="172"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=172 type=paragraph -->3) Sweet potatoes &ndash; The space between sweet potatoes can be used to cultivate soybeans, cabbage and winter brinjal. The early variety of sweet potato can be grown from A&#x301;shvina to Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a, and the late variety from Paus&#x301;a to Pha&#x301;lguna. Green chilli may also be grown, but green chilli is three year crop. In the first year there is a good crop, in the second year there is a medium crop, and in the third year there is a very low crop. For example, if in the first year the production is taken as 100%, in the second year it will be reduced to 40% and in the third year to only 10% to 15%. So it is best that after the second year the old plants are replaced. Cauliflower should not be planted along with the creeping crops. It requires direct sunlight and the creepers will cover it. Cabbage, because it needs less direct sunlight, can be grown along with the creeping tuber vegetables.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="173"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=173 type=paragraph -->After harvesting late sweet potato, select varieties of arum, along with summer creepers like pumpkin, gourd, bitter gourd, water gourd, cucumber, musk melon, watermelon, spinach, etc. should be planted. From As&#x301;a&#x301;r&#x301;ha to Bha&#x301;dra, the land may be utilized for a&#x301;us paddy, maize, jute, rainy season brinjal or spinach, rainy season chilli, rainy season beans and rainy season creeping vegetables like pumpkin, gourd, etc. A platform must be used in case of such vegetables. In the winter or summer, a platform may or may not be used.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="180"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=180 type=paragraph -->The crop rotation for jute should be as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="181"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=181 type=paragraph -->1) Vaesha&#x301;kha &ndash; The jute seeds are sown in a seed bed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="182"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=182 type=paragraph -->2) A&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;r&#x301;ha &ndash; The seedlings of jute and the seedlings of a&#x301;us paddy are transplanted. They will both be harvested in Shra&#x301;van&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="183"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=183 type=paragraph -->3) After this autumn maize can be planted (a two-month crop) along with soybean or radish. Maize and soybean are both harvested in the end of A&#x301;shvina. Radish would be left in the field a little longer before harvesting.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="184"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=184 type=paragraph -->4) Winter crops are planted later, and include wheat, winter vegetables and linseed. Linseed is harvested at the end of winter, in Pha&#x301;lguna. After growing linseed, dhain&#x32D;ca must be sown for two months and then plowed into the soil as green manure because linseed takes so much out of the soil. In Vaesha&#x301;kha, jute and a&#x301;us paddy can start again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="185"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=185 type=paragraph -->BOUNDARY PLANTS<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="186"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=186 type=paragraph -->To ensure the maximum utilization of every inch of land, there is also a system of planting in the boundary areas of all schools, farms, orchards, homes, etc., as well as beside all roads. For example, trees with spreading branches, like most fruit trees and even some timber trees, should be planted all around the perimeter of such places at fixed distances. Palm trees, which grow straight up, should be planted in between the fruit trees, as they do not block the sun light from the fruit trees. Between the fruit trees and the palm trees, filler plants should be planted. Three examples of small filler plants are edible anthurium, a root crop; permanent cotton, a shrub; and arrowroot, a root crop. If the soil is deep and good, plant anthurium. If the soil is stony and poor, plant permanent cotton. If the soil is of medium quality, then plant arrowroot. In between all these there is still space for associate plants to the filler plants. With anthurium plant Chinese mini-grape; with permanent cotton plant ghee kavla, a vegetable; and with arrowroot plant wild mini bitter gourd. The boundary wall should also be topped with wire, then it is also quite possible to plant wire plants, in series, as in the lakeside plantations. Where trees are planted around the boundary of agricultural land, care should be taken so that they do not shade the crops from the sun.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="187"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=187 type=paragraph -->Some examples of boundary plants grown in A&#x301;nanda Nagar include: <ol> <li>Red oak with a fill-gap of cotton (ga&#x301;ch ka&#x301;pa&#x301;s). 2) Night jasmine and Paraguay coconut with a fill-gap of large cardamon (bar&#x301;a ela&#x301;chi). <li>Silver oak with a fill-gap of cotton. <li>Shiriish. <li>Green oak, cotton. <li>Bakphul (Sesbania grandiflora) and African oil palm. <li>Redwood, shveta karabi, na&#x301;gdona&#x301;, and intermittently, red sandalwood (rakta chandan) with a fill-gap of Agave americana. <li>American ash with a fill-gap of Agave americana. <li>Kael pine with a fill gap of Agave americana. <li>Arjuna. <li>Sita asoke (Sarika indica) planted with intermittent sa&#x301;bu da&#x301;na&#x301;. <li>Two mulberry plants with one oil palm in between, the oil palm should not be an African variety. <li>African palm with a fill-gap of pineapple. <li>Beda&#x301;na&#x301;. <li>Phalsa. <li>Paraguay coconut. <li>Indian rosewood with intermittent ta&#x301;l, alternating with Indian rosewood and Indian olive, and pineapple as a fill-gap.  <li>Occidental olive (jalpa&#x301;i, Olea europaea, L.) and chalpa, the fill-gap will be Agave americana. <li>Green oak with a fill-gap of cotton. <li>Sisoo (Dalbergia sisoo) and teak (segun), planted between banyan and night jasmine. <li>Cloves and Indian cassia bark (tejpata) with scholar&#146;s leaves between them. <li>Red sandal and kababcini with sotti between. <li>Japanese cherry tree. <li>Kain&#x32D;can. <li>Sondal tree (Indian laburnum, Cassia fistula). <li>Indian rosewood, pineapple, palmyra, pineapple, Indian rosewood etc. (I+P+Pa+P+I&#8230;) <li>Himalayan devdaru, pineapple, date palm, pineapple, Himalayan devdaru, etc. <li>Ta&#x301;l and Nimnapatra devdaru with a fill-gap of Chinese chaste tree. <li>Nutmeg, ta&#x301;l ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;l, kauphal, ta&#x301;l ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;l, with a fill- gap of asparagus. <li>Banyan alternately with palmyra, the gaps filled with asparagus and aloe. <li>Indian rosewood, piya&#x301; sha&#x301;l (Pterocarpus marsupium), garjan (Dipterocarpus alatus), shishu (Dalbergia sisoo) and mangostein, with a fill-gap of date palm, asparagus and aloe. <li>Sesame (til) and ginger (adarak) alternately on the boundary of late boro paddy. <li>Boundary plants for oil seeds include night jasmine and Paraguay coconut alternating, with bar&#x301;a ellachi as a fill-up plant. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="188"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=188 type=paragraph -->There is no fixed rule for fill-up plants on boundaries in compounds. Sisal makes a good boundary, roadside and riverside plant, and it is the usual fill-gap on roadsides and many boundaries. It also helps to prevent erosion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="189"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=189 type=paragraph -->So a well integrated system of the blending of crops has many benefits. There is the maximum utilization of land because the space below the surface, on the surface and above the surface is fully used. Properly selected crop combinations also increase productivity, and regions which produce only one or two paddy crops in a year can harvest four paddy crops as well as other associated crops in a year. Through scientific crop rotation which does not adversely affect the productivity of the soil, maximum crops can be planted in the minimum period of time, and maximum crops can be planted in the minimum space. The space around buildings and fields can be used to grow boundary plants, and any convenient space can also be used to grow fill-up and fill-gap plants. Poor farmers will be benefited if they adopt such a system, and so will society.<!-- /block --></p>
