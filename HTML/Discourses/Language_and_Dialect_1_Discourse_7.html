<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Many people have the conception that the language of a tribe is a dialect. In Hindi it is called boli. Many persons call or used to call dialects bha&#x301;kha&#x301; (not as Yajurvedic pronunciation) out of contempt. Kabir has said: Sam&#x301;skrta ku&#x301;podaka bha&#x301;kha&#x301; bahata&#x301; niir &ndash; in other words, the Sanskrit language is like stagnant well water and the people&#146;s language is like the flowing water of a river, that is, full of vitality. This people&#146;s language proceeds forward and moves on while the so-called refined languages, bound by the fetters of rules and regulations, dos and don&#146;ts, modestly and tremblingly move ahead at a snail&#146;s pace. A few hundred years ago the Yajurvedic style of pronunciation was still in vogue in the Aryan languages of north India. S&#x301;a used to be pronounced like kha. Even today the word ks&#x301;ama is pronounced khama&#x301; in Panjabi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The point is, wherein lies the essential difference between a language and a dialect? Every dialect comes within the periphery of one language or another. Actually a language is the conglomerate of a certain number of dialects. The substance of the matter is that under no circumstances do we have the right to turn up our nose at a dialect, considering it to be unrefined or deprived of a glorious lineage. Even if its lineage has no glory or has disappeared, from the existential point of view it is worthy enough. Often we can become acquainted with the nature of the movement of more than one language through the study of a particular dialect. Take, for example, the &ldquo;Kacchii&rdquo; language. Gujarati comes from Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta and Sindhii comes from Pahlavii Pra&#x301;krta. This Kacchii language or dialect is a sweet blending of the Gujarati and Sindhii languages. We can easily understand or become familiar with the natural differences between Gujarati and Sindhii through the study of Kacchii. Similarly, when we travel from Kishanganj to Purnia we come across an area whose language is called Shiripuriya&#x301; (Shriipuriya&#x301;). It has arisen as a mixture of Bengali and Angika. In the area lying between Bokaro and Hazaribagh we find Khot&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; Bengali which is a mixture of Bengali and Magahii. If one goes from Haludpukur towards Ba&#x301;ripada&#x301; the linguistic river basin that one comes across on both banks is known as Kera&#x301; Bengali. In this Kera&#x301; Bengali we find a peculiar union between northern Oriya and Rarhi Bengali. In Bengali we say a&#x301;mi jete pa&#x301;rba na&#x301; [I will not be able to go]; in Kera&#x301; Bengali one says mui ja&#x301;itye pa&#x301;rim na&#x301;i. If you travel still further east it becomes a&#x301;mi jete pa&#x301;rbuni. This spoken language continues up to Uluberia. This is called a &ldquo;dialect&rdquo;. In Oriya, if the first person singular is pa&#x301;ribi then the plural form is pa&#x301;ribu, however in Kera&#x301; Bengali there is no difference between the singular and the plural.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Most languages have more than one dialect. Bengali has twelve different dialects:<!-- /block --></p>

This dialect has a very beautiful pronunciation and a unique intonation or manner of speaking.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->6) Barendrii Bengali: Rajshahi District with the exception of Nawabganj subdivision, the western portion of Pabna District, the southern portion of Dinajpur District, the northern part of Kusthia District, and the southern part of Bagur&#x301;a District.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->7) Rangpuri Bengali: Rangpur District, Dinajpur District, West Dinajpur District, Coochbihar District, Jalpaiguri District, the plains of Darjeeling District, a few parts of Purnia District, certain portions of Bagur&#x301;a District, Assam&#146;s Goalpara, and Nepal&#146;s Jhanpa District.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->8) Sylhet Bengali: Sylhet, Kachar, Karimganj, Kumilla District and the plains of the Khasia-Jayantia Hills.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->9) Dacca or Vikrampurii Bengali: Dacca District, Faridpur District and Pabna District&#146;s eastern areas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->10) Jessore Bengali: Jessore District, Khulna District and Faridpur&#146;s Gopalganj subdivision.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->11) Barisal or Candradviipii Bengali: Barisal District, Khulna District&#146;s Bagerhat subdivision, Faridpur District&#146;s Madaripur subdivision and Patuakhali District.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->12) Chittagong Bengali: All of Chittagong District except for the southern areas and some parts of Noakhali District.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->As I said before, most languages have dialects. It must be borne in mind that not all the languages of particular tribes or communities are dialects; some of them are separate languages also. It is perfectly acceptable to entitle the language of five hundred people as a full-fledged language. By the same token the language of a million or more people may be considered a dialect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now the question arises &ndash; what is the fundamental difference between a language and a dialect? Roughly speaking there are eight conditions that must be fulfilled in order to be considered a language, much like an eight-legged cot. These eight are: 1) own vocabulary, 2) pronouns, 3) verb-endings, 4) case-endings, 5) oral or written literature, 6) style of intonation, 7) psycho-acoustic and inferential acoustic notes, and 8) syntax.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><b>Vocabulary</b>: The meaning of vocabulary [shabda sambha&#x301;ra] is &ldquo;a collection of words&rdquo;. Every language has to have its own vocabulary. Now, how do words come into existence? In the beginning, unrefined verbs were fashioned from qualitative sounds. Nouns, adjectives and the different verbal expressions &ndash; prefixes and suffixes &ndash; were created from verbs after the refinement of those first verb forms. Pronouns and indeclinables were not created from verbs. They were produced from psycho-acoustic notes. In English, indeclinables are commonly called prepositions and conjunctions. Apart from this, the word &ldquo;do&rdquo; in English is often used in place of a specific verb. For example: &ldquo;As I see, so I do&rdquo;. Instead of using the verb &ldquo;see&rdquo; a second time, &ldquo;do&rdquo; performs its function. The old English grammarians used to consider this &ldquo;do&rdquo; to be a &ldquo;pro-verb&rdquo; but nowadays it is no longer considered as such. Anyhow, both pronouns and indeclinables come from acoustic notes. A&#x301;mi [I], tumi [you (familiar)] and a&#x301;pani [you (respectful)] come from a&#x301;hme, tuhme and appana. There is a Buddhist lyric written about twelve hundred years ago in which we find these lines:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;hme n&#x301;a ja&#x301;nahun acinta joi<br>Ja&#x301;ma maran&#x301;a bhava kaisana hoi<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->[When there is no existence of bhava the idea of birth and death is confusing. We do not understand that entity which is beyond the concept of duality.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Vocabulary is created from psycho-acoustic notes and inferential acoustic notes. For example, the vibration created when a person&#146;s eyes come in contact with something white is similar to words such as dhapdhap [white, bright]. From this comes the expression dhavdhave sa&#x301;da&#x301; [bright white]. Ka&#x301;n kat&#x301;kat&#x301; karche [The ear is throbbing &ndash; literally &ldquo;doing kat&#x301;kat&#x301;&rdquo;]. Now is the ear here actually doing kat&#x301; kat&#x301; kat&#x301; kat&#x301;? No, rather the vibration in the nerves is similar to the sound kat&#x301; kat&#x301;; from this evolved the word kat&#x301;kat&#x301;. Thus we see that in the beginning there is a sound denoting a certain quality and from that the word is created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The size or measurement of a vocabulary does not remain static. As a result of mutual interchange and mixing between people, words from the vocabulary of one region enter the vocabulary of another. Many Arabic, Farsi, Turkish, English, Portuguese and French words have entered Bengali in this way. It is futile to try to keep these words out, nor is there anything to be gained by it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the English word &ldquo;head&rdquo; is ma&#x301;tha&#x301;. One whose head is confused or has had their head turned is often called be-hed. The be of behed is a Farsi prefix and hed is an English word. Similar is the case with the word jimkha&#x301;na&#x301;. The word jim comes from the English word &ldquo;game&rdquo; and the Farsi suffix kha&#x301;na&#x301; has been added to it. In this way the word gemkha&#x301;na&#x301; became jemkha&#x301;na&#x301; and in subsequent times it was transformed into jimkha&#x301;na&#x301;. In Arabic the pronunciation of ga and ja can be substituted for each other. For example, gawa&#x301;hir &rarr; jawa&#x301;hir.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->A word that is very well known to us is a&#x301;ta&#x301; [custard-apple]. Many people believe that a&#x301;ta&#x301; may be a Bengali word but actually it is not. The Portuguese first planted the a&#x301;ta&#x301; tree when they came to Bandel about four hundred and fifty years ago. A&#x301;ta&#x301; is a Portuguese word.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The Bengali word aca&#x301;ra [pickle] comes from the Portuguese word aca&#x301;r. In Sanskrit there is a word a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra that means &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo;. The Portuguese brought their fruit aca&#x301;r to this country and it became a&#x301;ca&#x301;r in Bengali &ndash; for example, mango aca&#x301;ra, tamarind a&#x301;ca&#x301;r, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->In this way a vocabulary grows through the give and take of words between languages. Having one&#146;s own vocabulary is one special characteristic of a language. In a dialect the vocabulary is very small and in some very poor dialects it practically does not exist at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Now a language&#146;s vocabulary provides a mirror that reflects just how far any particular community has progressed in this world in terms of human culture and human civilization. There are some communities whose language contains only about eight hundred and fifty words while the language of highly developed apes contains around seven hundred and fifty words. Hence there is very little difference between the vocabulary of the least advanced human communities and the most highly advanced ape communities. Even bird languages have their own vocabulary. If birds are eating rice and by chance a person happens by then one bird will start calling out ka, ka which means &ldquo;flee, flee&rdquo; and they all fly away. Birds and animals have vocabulary but not verbs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Bengali has approximately 125,000 words. From the standpoint of vocabulary this is a matter of pride, however, Sanskrit, Latin, English, French and German have much larger vocabularies. Hence there is a need to further enrich the Bengali vocabulary. For that new words will have to be created. In one Prabhat Samgiita song the word pra&#x301;vrt&#x301; has been used to mean &ldquo;heavy rains&rdquo;. The word pra&#x301;vrt&#x301; is originally a Vedic word that is no longer in use. Not only does the language become sweeter by using this word but the vocabulary is also increased. This vocabulary is one of the prerequisites for being considered a language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Another thing to be considered in the case of vocabulary is the use of nominal verbs. Although these nominal verbs are verb forms they are created by making a word causative (according to the Sanskrit rule, nominal verbal roots follow the a&#x301;tmanepadii conjugation). For example, se gaya&#x301;y ner&#x301;a&#x301;te giyechila [He went to Gaya for a shave]. Here ner&#x301;a&#x301; hate is understood, thus ner&#x301;a&#x301;te is a nominal verb. The village people of Burdwan say se kabla&#x301;cche na&#x301;, that is, se kabul karche na&#x301; [he doesn&#146;t admit]. Here kabla&#x301;cche is a nominal verb. An example from Sanskrit is sah ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yate (a&#x301;tmanepadii), that is, &ldquo;he is repeating &lsquo;Ra&#x301;m, Ra&#x301;m&rsquo;.&rdquo; Here ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yate is a nominal verb. Niraste pa&#x301;dape deshe eran&#x301;d&#x301;o&#146;pi druma&#x301;yate. It means: Even the castor oil plant becomes a great tree where there are no other big plants. The meaning of druma&#x301;yate is druma druma iti karoti. Here druma&#x301;yate is a nominal verb.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The use of nominal verbs is not very common in Bengali, however one Bengali writer who did use nominal verbs extensively was Michael Madhusudan Dutta. Pravesh karila&#x301; &rarr; praveshila&#x301;; a&#x301;rambha karila&#x301; &rarr; a&#x301;rambhila&#x301;. Michael used these and other verbals quite often in his poetic compositions. Nominal verbs are also used in Hindi. For example, the Hindi equivalent of the Bengali a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke khub dhikka&#x301;r diyechila [He scolded me roundly] is mujhe dhikra&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, the use of nominal verbs enriches a language&#146;s vocabulary. In India there are many languages which are called dialects but which, when considered from the point of view of vocabulary, certainly deserve more respect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><b>Pronouns</b>: All languages have their own pronouns. Pronouns, such as the Bengali pronouns a&#x301;mi, tumi and a&#x301;pani, are created from psycho-acoustic notes. English has the pronouns &ldquo;thou&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rdquo;, and so forth, while in Bengali the pronouns o, uni, ini are used when the person is present and se, tini, jini when the person is not present. Formerly &ldquo;thou&rdquo; was used in English when the person was present and &ldquo;you&rdquo; when the person was not present. In Rarhi Bengali se and tini are not currently used. In Rarhi Bengali one says: u ki ballek, u kutha&#x301;ke ja&#x301;bek, and so on. No language can be considered a separate language if it does not have its own pronouns. The language-ness of the language would cease to exist. Hence pronouns are very important from the standpoint of linguistic recognition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->All the languages which were recognized by the Indian constitution have their own pronouns and many of the languages which were not accepted also have their own pronouns, for example, Angika, Maethilii, Magahii,  Bhojpuri, Chattishgarii, etc. Although these languages are not recognized in India by the constitution, they deserve recognition and should be recognized. From the standpoint of linguistics they should be accepted as languages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Bengali is an independent language. It has had its own pronouns for the past twelve hundred years. There is an early Buddhist lyric:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Appan&#x301;e raci raci bhavanirva&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;<br>Micha&#x301; loye vandha&#x301;boye apan&#x301;a&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->[Usually people under the influence of avidya&#x301; (ignorance) confuse bhava and nirva&#x301;n&#x301;a but in reality the idea of dualism is misleading.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Appane raci raci means &ldquo;composing one&#146;s self&rdquo;. The Sanskrit third person singular bhava&#x301;n became appan in old Bengali &ndash; in modern Bengali a&#x301;pana &rarr; a&#x301;pni. The Sanskrit second person singular tvam became tuhme and the Sanskrit first person singular aham became a&#x301;hme from which comes the modern Bengali a&#x301;mi &ndash; aham &rarr; ahammi &rarr; a&#x301;hmi &rarr; a&#x301;hme &rarr; a&#x301;mi. Aham, bhava&#x301;n and tvam have all developed from psycho-acoustic notes. There is a thirteen hundred year old Bengali verse:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Mai means a&#x301;mi (singular); the plural form is a&#x301;hme (a&#x301;mra&#x301;). The old Bengali ha&#x301;nu comes from the Sanskrit aham. For example, aham ma&#x301;nus&#x301;am&#x301; kha&#x301;dis&#x301;ya&#x301;mi &rarr; ahammi ma&#x301;nus&#x301;am&#x301; kha&#x301;is&#x301;ya&#x301;mi &rarr; hammi ma&#x301;nus&#x301;am&#x301; kha&#x301;ia&#x301;mi &rarr; ha&#x301;nu ma&#x301;nu kha&#x301;nu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->The stories that are written nowadays about demons are written in modern Bengali but the demons are made to speak old Bengali. At any rate, Bengali has been using its own pronouns for the past twelve or thirteen hundred years.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->At one time Bengali, Assamese, Maethilii, Oriya and so on were one language. They became separate languages about eight hundred and fifty years ago. Similarly, Telegu and Kannad were once the same language and so were Tamil and Malayalam. Subsequently Kannad pronunciation became similar to that of Tamil while Telegu did not undergo any change, thus the two languages separated. They are still written in the same script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Tamil has very few Sanskrit words but Malayalam has incorporated many Sanskrit words and this is the reason it separated from Tamil. In Malayalam words of Sanskrit origin and words of Tamil origin are used side by side. The old Tamil word for &ldquo;coconut&rdquo; is teun&#x32D;ga&#x301;s from which we get the modern Tamil word teun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. There are three words for coconut in Sanskrit &ndash; na&#x301;rikela, na&#x301;likera and kera. In the spoken language of Calcutta we say narkol, for example, na&#x301;rkol tel [coconut oil], na&#x301;rkol na&#x301;r&#x301;u [a coconut sweet], na&#x301;rkol da&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; [a high land where coconuts grow in abundance]. How does it sound if someone says na&#x301;rkel? As if the gentleman perhaps comes from some small subdivision. If we add the verbal root la and the suffix d&#x301;a in Sanskrit to the word kera it forms the word kerala.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The meaning of the word kerala is &ldquo;the land where coconuts grow in abundance&rdquo;. In Malayalam the words teuna&#x301; and na&#x301;likera are used side by side.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->The native Bengali word gatara signifies &ldquo;physical strength&rdquo;. Educated urban dwellers say sha&#x301;riirik sa&#x301;marthya [physical strength] and the common people of the villages say gatara. Many people think that the word gatara comes from the Sanskrit word ga&#x301;tra [body] but this is incorrect. Ga&#x301;tra in Sanskrit &rarr; ga&#x301;tta in Pra&#x301;krta &rarr; ga&#x301;a in old Bengali &rarr; ga&#x301; in modern Bengali. According to the rules of linguistic transformation, the word ga&#x301; in Bengali comes from the Sanskrit word ga&#x301;tra, not the word gatara. Gatara is a native Bengali word.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph --><b>Verb-endings</b>: Verb-endings are one of the eight prerequisites for being a language. In Sanskrit lat&#146;, lot&#146;, laun, vidhiliun, lrt&#x301;, etc. are examples of different verb-endings. However, Sanskrit does not have a present continuous tense while most of the Indian languages do. The Hindi equivalent for &ldquo;is doing&rdquo; is kar raha&#x301; hae and the equivalent of &ldquo;does&rdquo; is karta&#x301; hae. However in Sanskrit karoti or kurute are used to signify both &ldquo;is doing&rdquo; and &ldquo;does&rdquo;. Some pandits are partial to using kurvannasti to indicate the continuous tense of the verb. In the material world what is uninterrupted or continuous is called &ldquo;contiguous&rdquo; and in the world of ideas the word &ldquo;continuity&rdquo; is used. For example, &ldquo;Calcutta has territorial contiguity with Diamond Harbour&rdquo;. &ldquo;Continuity&rdquo; indicates an abstract idea. For example, after one person gives a speech, another person is giving a speech. Here the word kurvannasti can be used to indicate &ldquo;is giving&rdquo;. For &ldquo;is swimming across&rdquo; we can use either tarati or tarannasti, however in this case the fundamental mental idea is not properly expressed. Thus in Bengali separate verb forms &ndash; kare, karche, kare caleche, etc. &ndash; are used. Hence in this respect Bengali is more expressive than Sanskrit. Bengali has its own speciality when it comes to linguistic continuity or material contiguity. In all the Indian languages that have developed from Pra&#x301;krta we find greater or lesser use of a kind of sonorous word form to indicate the indicative, continuous tense. This is worth noting. For example, kariteche, karta&#x301; hae, karaita achi, kareiche, karuchi, kardii hae, and so on. The fundamental unity of these languages is expressed through these verb-endings. They also demonstrate that these languages come from the same source. From the verb-endings one can determine which language has developed from which Pra&#x301;krta. This can be shown through examples of verb-endings. For example:<!-- /block --></p>

This rule of transformation is similar to the rules of transformation which govern the scale in classical music. There is little scope for deviation. For this reason it is possible for erudite people to predict at this time what form a language will take after the next ten thousand years. The Kheyal style was evolved in the Mughal court to give some temporary relief from the rigidity of the scale usage in classical music. Although there is an opportunity for vocal play in Kheyal, in the end one has to return to the set scale usage. In Bengali it is said that the measure of the tied cow is the grass [ba&#x301;ndha&#x301; garur ma&#x301;pa&#x301; gha&#x301;s] &ndash; it is the same in the case of the transformations that languages undergo.<!-- /block --></p>

In Pra&#x301;krta the a&#x301;tmanedpadii verb-endings e, vahe and mahe disappeared and became the parasmaepadii case-endings mi, vas, and mas.

A few Sanskrit parasmaepadii verbal roots change into a&#x301;tmanepadii if they are preceded by a prefix, for example, jayati, jayatah, jayanti.

For example, &ldquo;he reads a book&rdquo; is karan&#x301;a&#x301;rtha and &ldquo;he reads in class five&rdquo; (here the verb is used to indicate that he is a student) is svabha&#x301;va&#x301;rtha. &ndash;Trans.</p>
