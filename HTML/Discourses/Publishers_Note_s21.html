<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha (&ldquo;Collected Discourses&rdquo;) series assembles all the Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (DMC) discourses given by Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti. Dharma Maha&#x301;cakras, large spiritual congregations addressed by Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti, were held in cities and towns all over the world. They were an important feature of Ananda Marga throughout most of A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rtijii&#146;s long life as its preceptor. The first DMC was held on 1 January 1955, and within less than two years, that DMC discourse and ten more appeared in book form as Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha Part 1.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As far as possible throughout the publication of the Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha series, the chronological order of the discourses, both within each part and among the various parts, has been maintained. Only in a few instances have pressures, such as those occasioned by the Emergency, caused departures from this system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The present volume, Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha Part 21, contains nine discourses. The discourses were given by the author on diverse occasions over a period of fourteen years, but they have not been published before in authorized book form. Most of them were originally published in Ananda Marga magazines and newspapers. For one of the discourses, &ldquo;Niiti and Dharma&rdquo;, two existing translations were found, the earlier of the two in both Cosmic Society and Education and Culture and the later of the two in Bodhi Kalpa. In preparing this edition, both translations were extensively used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate here &ndash; in addition to the original language of each speech, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if at all, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In all cases where a tape was in existence for a discourse given in English, we have re-edited the published discourse with reference to that tape.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the editors have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Eds.&rdquo;  Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
