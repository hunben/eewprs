<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Yesterday I talked about the Puranic gods and goddesses. In this connection let me tell you one thing more. Various types of Puranic methods, such as <I>nya&#x301;sa<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I>, <I>pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma</I>, etc., have now become accepted in the Puranic mode of worship, but in fact these methods are of Tantric origin and not related to the Puranas. When doing <I>pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma</I> one will have to concentrate one&#146;s mind on a certain point. This is a Tantric method; when the mind is concentrated on a point it gets confined to a particular space. This method, confining the mind to a certain space, is called <I>Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hira Vidya&#x301;</I> in <I>yoga sha&#x301;stra</I>. That is, this was invented by the first Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava brother, Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hira.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->However, I will have to say something more about the Puranic system of worship. There are many Puranic worship practices which people are inclined to believe to be very old; many believe that they are as ancient as the Vedas. But that is not the fact of the matter. None of the Puranic systems of worship, or Puranic rituals, is older than 1200 or 1300 years. All those systems of worship are post-Buddhistic, or developed somewhat prior to the period of Buddhist Tantra [which came one thousand years after Buddha himself], or developed, at the earliest, contemporaneously with Buddha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Numerous Buddhist gods and goddesses later became accepted as Puranic gods and goddesses; for example, the Buddhist goddess Shiitala&#x301; became converted into a Puranic goddess because of the fear of smallpox and some of the Buddhist Tantric gods and goddesses also became converted into Puranic gods and goddesses. For instance, the Buddhist Tantric deity Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is now accepted as a Puranic deity; these days many Hindus accept Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; Devii. You will find many persons with names such as Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;da&#x301;s, Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;pada, etc. Similarly, the Hindu Tantric goddess Ka&#x301;lii has been accepted in Buddhist Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->For these reasons I was saying that no Puranic ritual or mode of worship is older than 1200 or 1300 years. In the wake left by the collapse of Buddhism [in India], the Puranic religion or neo-Hindu religion emerged, and the Buddhist Tantric gods and goddesses became accommodated in the new religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->A new religious movement called the Na&#x301;tha Cult emerged during the period of transition from the Buddhist Era to the Puranic Era. Many gods and goddesses of the Na&#x301;tha Cult can also be detected [in the Puranic religion], for instance Bur&#x301;o Shiva. In fact, most of the Puranic gods and goddesses receiving great reverence in our country are not older than five hundred or six hundred years. If any of them are 1200-1300 years old, that is indeed the maximum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Some people believe that the worship of Durga&#x301; is something very old, but that is not true at all. This worship became popular during the Muslim period; that is, it is of quite recent origin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The system of Durga&#x301; worship was in existence at the time when Krttivasa first composed the Bengali <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. Since Durga&#x301; worship was a contemporary matter, Krttivasa mentioned the goddess Durga&#x301; in his <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. For instance, he mentioned that Ramacandra worshipped the goddess Durga&#x301; with 108 lotus flowers. But in the original Sanskrit <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a,</I> Valmiiki&#146;s <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a,</I> these stories are absent. The worship of Durga&#x301; was popular during the time of Krttivasa, and therefore he inserted the story into his <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. But even in the <I>Ra&#x301;mcaritma&#x301;nasa</I> composed by Tulasii Das, the story is conspicuously absent. Thus we can conclude that it was only created in the imagination of Krttivas. So the idea that the system of Durga&#x301; worship is quite old is entirely unfounded.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The system of worshipping the goddess Durga&#x301; was first introduced in Bengal by Kamsanarayana Ray, the king of Tahirpur of Rajsahi District [now in Bangladesh], during the Pathan period. King Kamsanarayana had a lot of wealth. He told the pandits, &ldquo;I have so much wealth, I would like to hold the Ra&#x301;jasuya Sacrifice.&rdquo; The pandits said, &ldquo;O king, in <I>Kali Yuga</I> there is no system for holding the Ra&#x301;jasuya Sacrifice [a sacrifice done only by the most powerful kings]. But since you have so much money, you can celebrate the worship of the goddess Durga&#x301; in accordance with the instructions in the <I>Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The story goes that Kamsanarayana Ray spent as much as 700,000 rupees for the worship of the goddess Durga&#x301;. 700,000 of the rupees of those days mean almost 70 million rupees today. It was a huge expense, and this sparked a competition among the other kings and landlords. The following year King Jagadvaballabh of Ektakia (his name was Jagat Narayana according to other sources) spent 850,000 rupees on the worship of the goddess. In this unhealthy process of competition, the worship of the goddess Durga&#x301; became an affair restricted only to the wealthy landlord households. Actually the display of wealth became the primary motive. There were gargantuan feasts, and a lot of pageantry. &ldquo;I will feed multitudes of people, I will hold huge pageants.&rdquo; The competition went on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->All kinds of landlord, big, small and medium, began to worship the goddess. This all happened during the period of Pathan rule [just before the Mughal Dynasty]. These are purely Puranic systems of worship, and the books considered authorities for this subject are only the Puranas. None of these books has anything to do with Tantra or Veda, except that they prescribe chanting some <I>rks</I> [couplets] from the <I>Deviisukta</I> [verse] of the <I>Rgveda</I>. Actually, the worship of the goddess Durga&#x301; has no direct relation to the <I>Rgveda,</I> except that incidentally the word &ldquo;Haemavatii Uma&#x301;&rdquo; from the Deviisukta is quoted. [&ldquo;Uma&#x301;&rdquo; is conceived of as another name for Durga&#x301;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->So you see that the landlords began to worship the goddess with a lot of fanfare. The middle-class people did not have enough resources to organize such expensive religious worship. But perhaps you know that there is a certain place called Hukkipara in Hooghly District. Twelve persons from middle-class families in that Hukkipara village once decided to organize the <I>pu&#x301;ja&#x301;</I> [worship] of the goddess Durga&#x301; collectively, because separately they did not have the resources to organize such worship. In Urdu a friend is called <I>iya&#x301;r</I>. Since twelve friends [in Bengali &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; is <I>ba&#x301;ro</I>] combinedly organized the <I>pu&#x301;ja&#x301;,</I> it was called &ldquo;Ba&#x301;roiya&#x301;rii Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;&rdquo;. At that point in time this form of worship spread from the landlords down to the masses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Caste distinctions continued to be observed in Ba&#x301;roiya&#x301;rii Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;, but toward the end of the British rule, people began to argue, &ldquo;Since you are collecting subscriptions from all kinds of people, how can we believe in casteism? Let all people participate in this worship.&rdquo; At that time this worship received a new name, &ldquo;Sa&#x301;rvajaniin Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;&rdquo;. This Sa&#x301;rvajaniin Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; is also <I>ba&#x301;roiya&#x301;rii</I>, but caste distinctions are disregarded.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In Tantra there is some reference to Durga&#x301;, but to <I>as&#x301;t&#x301;abhu&#x301;ja&#x301;</I> [an eight-armed one &ndash; ten-armed was more common]. In western India and northern India, similar <I>as&#x301;t&#x301;abhu&#x301;ja&#x301;</I> stone and metal images are sometimes unearthed during excavation work. So the quarrel is whether the deity has eight or ten hands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->One of the characteristics of Tantra is this, that the different gods and goddesses originate from one idea or other. Those ideas were conceived in order to arouse and develop the finer sensibilities of the human mind. Thus a person conceived of a certain idea, and to make concrete that abstract idea, an image was invented. But such an idea, whether good or bad, is not an integral idea, it is a non-integral idea. If human beings try to give expression to one such idea out of many, that means that other ideas are excluded. In any case, this is how there arose the various gods and goddesses in Tantra, through a process of giving external form to abstract ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the term <I>devata&#x301;</I> is feminine. In this respect there is no fundamental difference between Buddhist and Hindu Tantra, although there is a difference in terminology. For instance, there are Buddhist Tantric goddesses called Ma&#x301;riici, Ha&#x301;ritii, Vajrabara&#x301;hii, Ba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii, Vajrayoginii, Vajrata&#x301;ra&#x301; and Bha&#x301;nata&#x301;ra&#x301;. And then there are Ka&#x301;lii and the <I>Dashama&#x301;ha&#x301;vidya&#x301;</I> [ten goddesses known as the Ten Maha&#x301;vidya&#x301;s], all Hindu Tantric goddesses. These various gods and goddesses represent one idea or other. For instance, <I>Anucchunya&#x301; Prakrti</I>, the state of <I>Prakrti</I> at the stage prior to creation: that idea is represented by Ka&#x301;lii. But this is just a non-integral idea, not an integral one.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->With a particular idea in one&#146;s mind, one experiences a particular state of existence in life, and accordingly one or another <I>Maha&#x301;vidya&#x301;</I> has been thought up. For instance, Dhu&#x301;ma&#x301;vatii is described as <I>vivarn&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [colourless], <I>vidhava&#x301;</I> [widowed], with sunken eyes and wizened face, wearing dirty, dishevelled clothing (<I>malina&#x301;mbaradhara&#x301;</I>). Crows hover over her head (<I>ka&#x301;kadhvaja&#x301;</I>); in her hand she is holding a broken winnow (<I>shu&#x301;rpakara&#x301;</I> &ndash; from the Sanskrit <I>shu&#x301;rpa</I>, the words <I>suppa</I> in Pra&#x301;krta and <I>sup</I> in Bengali have come<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->). The entire description gives an idea of an impoverished deity, shorn of all glory and opulence.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  When people are shorn of everything, the idea of Dhu&#x301;ma&#x301;vatii symbolizes that idea. Tantra holds out one or another idea of that type.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->It is not proper to create images, ostensibly for religious worship, such as that. As ideas are very pleasing to the human mind, if we draw or paint a picture on any surface, it will give us aesthetic pleasure, but what is the benefit in worshipping such things? If you worship one idea, maybe you will have some control over that idea, but you will not have influence over other ideas. After all, one particular image is not <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, it is just one of His partial expressions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Take for instance the case of Ka&#x301;lii. She is described as <I>meghavarn&#x301;a&#x301;,</I> black. Why the black colour? Because it was conceived that there was no creation at that time. At the time when this world had not been created, there was no colour, and want of colour is black; so the idea of want of colour is represented by Ka&#x301;lii. It is not possible to think of any other colour, because there was no other colour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Then again Ka&#x301;lii is conceived of as <I>vigatavasana&#x301;,</I> having no clothes. Why no clothes? Because, is it possible to cover an all-pervading entity with clothes? Can we conceive of clothing the Infinite Entity? What does logic say about this? Therefore <I>vigatavasana&#x301;</I>. If the Infinite Entity is covered with clothes, can it be called infinite? Therefore <I>vigatavasana&#x301;</I>, but also <I>digva&#x301;sa&#x301;</I>:<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> here metaphorically all the directions (<I>dik</I>) are Her clothes (<I>va&#x301;sa&#x301;</I>). She is further described as <I>shavashiva&#x301;ru&#x301;d&#x301;ha&#x301;</I>. When Consciousness has not been metamorphosed into the different successive stages of manifestation, Shiva [Consciousness] is just like a dead body, because at that stage Shiva cannot do anything, there is no expression of consciousness. Only <I>Parama&#x301; Prakrti</I> is the creative entity. She carries on Her eternal dance of creation. She is also conceived as three-eyed (<I>trinayana&#x301;</I>), because she is witnessing all the phenomena of the past, present and future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->In fact there is no such thing as Ka&#x301;lii, it is just an idea. Two of the deity&#146;s hands hold a human head and a sword (<I>khad&#x301;ga</I>). The other two are in <I>vara&#x301;bhaya mudra&#x301;</I>.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> She is wearing a garland around her neck, a garland dotted with forty-nine severed heads, each face representing one particular acoustic root, and one hand, as mentioned, is also holding a head.

<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In the poem Ka&#x301;lii is described as <I>Narashirakhad&#x301;ga-vara&#x301;bhayashobhana&#x301;</I> . Here <I>khad&#x301;ga</I> [sword] is a symbol of the fight against evil and sin, and <I>abhaya</I> means &ldquo;fearlessness&rdquo;. When we confront the illusions of creation and destruction, the Supreme Entity tells us, &ldquo;Don&#146;t be nervous, don&#146;t be afraid, there will again be creation.&rdquo; And what is <I>vara</I>? &ldquo;I will again create.&rdquo; And in her hand there is a container of nectar. So this is an excellent idea, but an idea is just an idea, it should not be worshipped. If people do so, they will be metamorphosed into that idea only; they can never attain the Supreme Goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->All such Tantric ideations are very beautiful images of the different aspects of the Supreme Entity, and human beings start moulding clay statues depicting those ideas.

The total expression of all these ideations is what is called the human psychic expression. If a follower of Tantra or Purana remains preoccupied with a particular idea, the total development of the mind will remain an impossibility. That&#146;s why all these ideas of [this school of] Tantra should be rejected. The great mystic Ramprasad said,<!-- /block --></p>

All sorts of distinction will be obliterated, all the afflictions of my mind will be totally removed; the scriptures are right when they declare that Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is formless.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->So if people concentrate their minds on a particular idea, their progress will remain a far cry away from total progress. So  <I>sa&#x301;dhakas</I> must try to realize <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, and not any non-integral entity. There is no other way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->It is not that the concepts of different gods and goddesses are based on Tantric ideas alone. For instance, when people suffer terribly from various incurable diseases, they conveniently invent one deity Raks&#x301;a&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii (that Ka&#x301;lii which protects one from disease). When society faces some problem, people worship Shmasha&#x301;na Ka&#x301;lii or Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii, and so on. Here also you see that the people are creating deities depending on their own psychic ideation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->When the deity stands with the right foot forward, she is called &ldquo;Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii&rdquo;; whereas the Ka&#x301;lii deity with her left foot forward is called &ldquo;Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii&rdquo;. This much is the difference between the two deities. Then again there are other deities, such as Durga&#x301;, Navadurga&#x301;, etc. The system of worship of Navadurga&#x301; &ndash; she is worshipped through nine varieties of plant &ndash; is centered around Tantra, but the worship of Durga&#x301; in general does not originate in Tantra. The worship of Durga&#x301; originated in the Puranic tradition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The nine kinds of plant having special qualities of their own are themselves treated as deities. They are repositories of power, but of partial nature. They are not as vast as the Supreme Entity. As they are conceived to be as powerful as the goddesses, they are worshipped. These nine plants are <I>kadalii</I> [plantain], <I>kacu </I>[arum], <I>haridra&#x301;</I> [turmeric], <I>jayantii</I> [sesbania], <I>ashoka</I> [sarica], <I>bilva</I> [bel-fruit], <I>da&#x301;d&#x301;imba</I> [pomegranate], <I>ma&#x301;n</I> [alocasia], and <I>dha&#x301;nya</I> [rice]. Before the actual worship of the goddess Durga&#x301;, these nine plants are bathed in pure water. A plantain tree is considered as <I>kala&#x301;bau</I>, but it is not a <I>kala</I> [plantain] tree as the <I>bau</I> [wife] of somebody. And some think that <I>kala&#x301;bau</I> means &ldquo;wife of Gan&#x301;esha&rdquo;; but no, nothing like that exists.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn10"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn10">10</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> A plantain tree is taken as a symbol of Brahma&#x301;n&#x301;ii Shakti. So the presiding deity in plantain is called Brahma&#x301;n&#x301;ii. The presiding deity of arum (<I>kacu</I>) is Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;. Likewise the presiding deity in turmeric is called Durga&#x301;. The presiding deity in <I>jayantii</I> is called Ka&#x301;rttikii; in <I>ashoka</I> is called Shokarohita&#x301;; in <I>da&#x301;d&#x301;imba</I>, Raktadantika&#x301;; in bel-fruit, Shiva&#x301;; in <I>ma&#x301;n</I>, Ca&#x301;mun&#x301;d&#x301;ii; and in rice, Maha&#x301;laks&#x301;mii. The nine plants are worshipped as symbols of nine Tantric deities. For instance, the plantain tree, as mentioned represents <I>Brahma&#x301;n&#x301;ii Shakti</I>, the mythological mother of Gan&#x301;esha (and not the wife of Gan&#x301;esha, as commonly misunderstood by the masses). So you see, these are just small ideas and limited powers. No benefit will come from adopting these ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Suppose a person meditates on turmeric; one will become turmeric. If one meditates on Gan&#x301;esha, one will become Gan&#x301;esha. Gan&#x301;esha is <I>dalapati</I>; <I>dalapati</I> means <I>gan&#x301;apati</I> [mass leader]. A kind of leader worship is still to be observed in many countries! So if you meditate on Gan&#x301;esha, it means you want to become like Ganesha, you want to become a &ldquo;leader&rdquo; &ndash; but in fact you will develope a long trunk and a fat belly. People become like their objects of meditation.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn11"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn11">11</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->I do not know whether Gan&#x301;esha has any spiritual knowledge or scientific understanding, wisdom, spiritual quality or not. I know that he has some occult power, so if one meditates on him, one may or may not get some of his powers; but the problem is that if one meditates on Gan&#x301;esha, one will have to meditate on his mount also &ndash; his mount being a mouse. Think what the consequences could be!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Each of the gods and goddesses has a particular mount, or vehicle. Had they been modern gods and goddesses, their vehicle would have been a jeep. But the ancient gods and goddesses had birds and animals as vehicles. Now if you meditate on these birds and animals, <I>ya&#x301;drshii bha&#x301;vana&#x301; yasya siddhirbhavati ta&#x301;drshii</I> [As you think, so you become]. How dangerous it is! It is more dangerous for women. They generally like to remain well-dressed and well-decorated. But if they worship Laks&#x301;mii and if they become like an owl which is the mount of Laks&#x301;mii (because in meditating on Laks&#x301;mii you are meditating on owl also), then would it be good?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Suppose someone meditates on turmeric; they may imbibe the qualities of turmeric. Now turmeric does have one quality, it is an antidote to poison; and if you eat turmeric, it kills hookworms; but remember, there are innumerable varieties of medicinal plants, with so many qualities, in our universe. So you see, you are still not adopting the qualities of all those medicinal herbs. And suppose you do adopt all the qualities of all the herbs, there are still so many animals roaming around, and various animals have various qualities which might be great assets to human beings. You may have seen certain lizards that sit silently on the walls in a state of ambush for cockroaches. You will see that the lizard does not move even slightly for ten to fifteen minutes. Is not this patience and stillness a wonderful quality? Very few human beings have that quality. They cannot sit silently that long, they become restless. You do not have that quality, you cannot sit silently that long. Ants move in long columns, sheep also move in long columns; an ox stands in the middle of the road without the least motion. The vehicles and carriages have to pass by the standing ox.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->How does the lizard or the ox do that? The secret is explained in yogic scriptures. These scriptures say that in our throats is the <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I> [energy channel related to vocal cord]. If one&#146;s mind is fixed on the <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I>, one&#146;s body becomes motionless. So the ox can remain standing on the road without the slightest movement. A lizard can do similarly. Oxen, crocodiles and many other animals and birds have this same faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->A chameleon (<I>vahuru&#x301;pii</I>), by concentrating its mind on the <I>u&#x301;rdhva ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I> above the <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I>, can change the complexion of its body every moment. A chameleon (similar to a lizard) can take on the colour of the leaves of the tree on which it is perched.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Now, if one meditates on a particular animal or bird, one will imbibe the qualities of that animal. Similarly, each of the [Puranic] gods and goddesses has a particular quality of its own. Yes, one may acquire some quality, but one will never attain <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Hence the only object of meditation of human beings should be <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. One can never attain the Macrocosmic vastness if one meditates on a limited idea, a finite entity. The Tantric gods and goddesses, whether we are speaking of Hindu Tantra or of Buddhist Tantra, have equally limited powers. Moreover, as each of the gods and goddesses has its own vehicle, and it is unscientific to meditate on that vehicle [because of the possibility that one will acquire the qualities of the vehicle along with those of the deity.], the Tantric gods and goddesses are not to be accepted as objects of meditation. And Tantra has also emphatically said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->It is also stated in Tantra that if a person wants only to attain limited progress, one may practise on certain limited ideas. But those who are genuine seekers of Brahma will never agree to worship any finite idea. Those who want the Supreme Entity will have to ideate on <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> alone. People may attain limited achievement in terms of occult power through the grace of the gods and goddesses &ndash; whether belonging to Tantra or Purana &ndash; but they will remain far away from the attainment of the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
