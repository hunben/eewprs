<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Just as a scintillation like that of an emerald occurs when glass comes in contact with gold, similarly even a fool becomes a wise man if in contact with a good soul. The verbal root of <I>kain&#x32D;c/kac (kaci)</I> means &ldquo;to shine&rdquo;, &ldquo;to tie up&rdquo;<I></I>. Both the words <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> and <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;ca</I> are derived by adding the suffix <I>ghain&#x32D;</I> to the verbal root <I>kac</I>. Both the words etymologically mean &ldquo;something that shines&rdquo; or &ldquo;something that ties up&rdquo;. Although etymologically both the words <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> and <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;ca</I> are correct, the word <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;ca</I> in Sanskrit <I></I>has a very limited use. The word that is actually in use, so to speak, is <I>ka&#x301;ca</I>. But the <I>tadbhava</I> derivative [word derived from Sanskrit in changed form] of <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;ca</I> is <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;c</I>. The word is quite prevalent in Bengali and many other Indian languages. So if we write <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> that will be a <I>tatsama</I> word [Sanskrit loanword] and if we write <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;c</I> that will be a derivative word. But both have the same meaning. In its common usage, the word <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> would mean: <ol> <li>Any shining alkaline entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><li>The ashes of a burnt alkaline object.<!-- /block --></p>

It should be borne in mind that in Urdu, <I>siisa&#x301;</I> also means <I>ka&#x301;ca</I>, as a glass object is described as <I>siise kii ciij</I> [object made of glass]<I></I>. But in Bengali <I>siisa&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;lead&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> is <I>sphat&#x301;ika</I> [&ldquo;thick glass&rdquo;], or what is called &ldquo;crystal&rdquo; in English. What is &ldquo;clear as glass&rdquo; is called &ldquo;crystal-clear&rdquo;. Here we should bear in mind that India has been familiar with <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> for a long time, from the pre-<I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> age, in fact.<!-- /block --></p>

The courtyard of that crystal palace appeared to be filled with water. In order to avoid wetting his loincloth Duryodhana lifted it up above his knees. Many people present there could not help laughing on seeing Duryodhana&#146;s discomfiture. Duryodhana reacted sharply to the derisive laughter of the people; he felt anguished and insulted and vowed to himself to take revenge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><p>India has been making crystal for a long time. In Sanskrit literature there are many references to crystal, but it was not invented in India. It is said that some Phoenician merchants were travelling to a far-off land in connection with their business. On the way they once prepared their food by building a fire on the sand with alkaline wood. After cooking they noticed that the mixture of alkali and sand had produced a shining material near the site of the fire. This is how crystal was invented.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><p>The English word &ldquo;glass&rdquo; is derived from the Sanskrit word <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;ca</I>. Since ancient times, crystal has been used in India for medicine bottles, wine glasses and chandeliers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> is <I>man&#x301;ika&#x301;c</I>, or quartz. As a mineral metal it has been available in many parts of India since ancient times as evidenced by the fact that quartz has been used for decoration and ornaments since that time period. In Bengal, quartz is available in Bankura and Purulia in some quantity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> is &ldquo;to bind&rdquo; or &ldquo;to tie up&rdquo;. In ancient times the women referred to the braiding of hair as <I>ven&#x301;ii-ka&#x301;c</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><li>If a flower or ribbon or any other attractive object swings at the end of a women&#146;s braid as a decoration, that is also called <I>ka&#x301;ca</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><li><I>Ga&#x301;la&#x301;</I>, or &ldquo;lac&rdquo;, is called <I>la&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301;</I> in chaste Bengali. The word <I>ga&#x301;la&#x301;</I> is derived from the Sanskrit word <I>galanam</I> which etymologically means &ldquo;that which can be easily melted&rdquo;. The word <I>la&#x301;ha&#x301;</I> has come from the Sanskrit word <I>la&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301;</I>. In ancient Bengal, particularly in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region, lac was produced in huge quantity. Production continues even now, and there is full potential for it to continue in future. The merchants of Bengal who used to export lac therefore acquired &ldquo;La&#x301;ha&#x301;&rdquo; <I></I>as their title, or surname. Although there is vast scope to increase the volume of production of lac in Bengal, particularly in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region, it is not effectively realized. The reason is that its production depends upon global demand. Like mica, global demand for lac is very limited. There is no specific large industry that uses lac or mica [as its raw material]. Both the industry and its products suffer whenever there is lack of global demand, and the same situation is prevalent even today. In any case, as in English we use the word &ldquo;tusk&rdquo; for the tooth of an elephant but use the word &ldquo;ivory&rdquo; while referring to an object made from the elephant tusk, similarly in Sanskrit, while &ldquo;lac&rdquo; is called <I>la&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301;</I>, a lac product is called <I>jatu.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I> Most of you are aware of the incident of the burning of <I>jatugrha</I> [house made of lac] in the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> during the period when the Pandavas were living incognito. Similarly, if something is fixed or sealed with lac, then the lac used in the seal is called <I>ka&#x301;ca</I>. Remember that &ldquo;seal&rdquo; is not a Bengali word; it is an English loanword; the word <I>mohar</I> is also not Bengali, it is Persian; the word <I>cha&#x301;p</I> [<I>mohar</I> and <I>chap</I> both mean &ldquo;seal&rdquo;] is also not Bengali; it is Portuguese. The Sanskrit word corresponding to <I>siilmohar</I> is <I>mudra&#x301;un&#x32D;kan</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

But both forms have the same meaning. <I>Ka&#x301;cana</I> etymologically means &ldquo;ribbon or rope used for tying&rdquo; or &ldquo;to make something valuable&rdquo;. In its extended form, <I>ka&#x301;cana</I> means the following: <ol> <li>Any kind of ribbon, tag or lace (<I>ka&#x301;cana&#x301;m&#x301;shu</I>, that is<I></I>, &ldquo;a silken ribbon&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>

The <I>pat&#x301;ol</I> broth <I></I>[wax-gourd curry preparation] which is used as a diet for sick persons in some parts of Bengal is called <I>pat&#x301;ol-ka&#x301;in&#x32D;canii</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

At one time, a vast expanse of <I>na&#x301;gakeshara</I> forest stretched along both banks of the Ajay River. The name <I>na&#x301;geshvara</I> was very common in those days in Bengal and Magadh. Satyendranath Dutta has immortalized <I>na&#x301;gakeshara</I> in a poem. This <I>na&#x301;gakeshara</I> is also known as <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;cana</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

In Sanskrit, however, a <I>mosa&#x301;heb</I> is called a <I>vidus&#x301;aka</I>. In a limited sense of <I>mosa&#x301;heb</I>, the word <I>bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I> was also prevalent in Sanskrit. It is from this word that the Bengali word <I>bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;</I> has come (Gopal Bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;, for example). But <I>bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;</I> also means a clown. When we say, <I>a&#x301;r bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;mi&#146; karte habe na&#x301;</I>, [&ldquo;enough of buffoonery there!&rdquo;], the word <I>bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;</I> is not derived from <I>bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I> but <I></I>from <I>bhan&#x301;d&#x301;a</I>, meaning &ldquo;pretentious or deceptive&rdquo;. Thus in the present case, the word <I>bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;mi</I> has been used in the sense of <I>bhan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;mi</I> or pretension.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph --><li>For every kind of task, there is a most suitable or appropriate time [for its implementation].

If the time is lost in negligence and then if it does not rain for a few days, the water level will fall. At that low water level, the seedlings (<I>ca&#x301;ra&#x301;</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->) will survive but new seedlings cannot be sown. However, if the new seedlings are sown in time, then the saplings will not be affected even in heavy rainfall, because the saplings will grow along with the rising water level. The saplings will not be affected until the tops of the saplings are submerged. But if the seedlings are not sown at the proper time, they cannot be sown in high water, because it is not possible to sow the seedlings with their tops under water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph --><p>Again, look at the harvesting. The paddies once reaped cannot be left unused in the field or in a [roofless] granary for an extended period. It is essential to immediately thresh and flail the reaped paddies and store in a [roofed] granary, <I></I>because if the reaped paddy corns come in contact with too much rain water, they will begin to germinate. As a result, let alone <I>cin&#x32D;r&#x301;e-mur&#x301;i</I>, that is, paddy made into flattened rice, puffed rice or sunned rice, <I></I>it will not be good even for boiled rice.

<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph --><p>So it is seen that there is an appropriate time for everything.

But what would be the use of wasting that time in playing tipcat<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and concentrating on studies only after the examination? That is why one should do everything at the proper time. This proper time for a particular kind of job is also called <I>ka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph --><li>If a person tries to get his work done, spending whatever time he may have available [to organize that work] in coarse behaviour to another person, he may perhaps get the work done, but it is more likely that he will not get it done. If, however, he tries to get the work done by spending even a fraction of the same time in sweet words and good behaviour, time will be saved and there will be a greater chance of success. So sweet words or good behaviour, which are certainly marks of higher culture, are also steps to success. The word <I>ka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I> is also used for such people who use sweet words in their social life. The word <I>ka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I> is also used as a noun for that particular work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph --><li>There is a proper time and season for doing any task.

The soil for sowing wheat seeds is loamy soil, and the right season is <I>hemanta</I> [the season between autumn and winter] and the first seven days of Paus&#x301; <I></I>[from mid-December to mid-January] in winter.

So you realize that for every task there is a special season and a definite time. A boy who plays in the morning without studying cannot do well in the examination. A boy who studies in the afternoon, which is actually the time for playing, cannot have good health. So even during the day there are different hours for different kinds of activities. This particular season, or particular <I>prahara</I> [a measure of time equal to three hours], or particular time earmarked for a particular job, is also called <I>ka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
