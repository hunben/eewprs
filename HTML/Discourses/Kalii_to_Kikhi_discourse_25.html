<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Last Sunday I told you a few words about <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I>. You must have understood that although the two words, <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> and <I>ka&#x301;lii</I>, are closely related, they are not exactly identical <I>(hubahu)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I>. The word <I>ka&#x301;lii</I> is formed <I></I>by adding the suffix <I>un&#x32D;giic</I> to the stem <I>ka&#x301;la;</I> we get the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> by using the suffixes <I>i</I> and <I>in</I>. In most cases both the spellings, <I>ka&#x301;li</I> and <I>ka&#x301;lii</I> are correct. But the spelling with <I>ii</I> is not acceptable if the word forms the first part of a compound word. The rule applies to the adding of <I>i</I> or <I>ii</I> when a word ends with the phoneme <I>la</I>: <I>a&#x301;balii-a&#x301;bali, ta&#x301;lii-ta&#x301;li, kara&#x301;lii-kara&#x301;li, kalii-kali, tama&#x301;lii-tama&#x301;li, stha&#x301;lii-stha&#x301;li, sha&#x301;lmalii-sha&#x301;lmali, na&#x301;lii- na&#x301;li-n&#x301;a&#x301;lii-n&#x301;a&#x301;li</I>, etc<I></I>. So while <I>Ka&#x301;liida&#x301;sa</I> is incorrect, <I>Can&#x301;d&#x301;iida&#x301;sa</I> is correct. The rule is applicable only to the end <I>lra</I>. <I>Can&#x301;d&#x301;iida&#x301;sa, Deviida&#x301;sa</I> do not have the end <I>lra</I>. You must have heard that the verbal root <I>kala</I> means to sound, to measure, to count, etc. That is the etymological meaning of <I>ka&#x301;la</I>. The feminine of the word is <I>ka&#x301;lii</I>. Although feminine, the meaning is the same. In common usage, by <I>ka&#x301;lii/ka&#x301;li</I> we understand the following: <ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><li><I></I> <I>Ka&#x301;lashakti:</I> Although both <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> and <I>ka&#x301;lii</I> mean <I>ka&#x301;lashakti</I>, they do not have the same connotation. <I>Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> refers to the vibrational force by which <I>ka&#x301;la</I> is measured. But <I>ka&#x301;li</I> means the entity that measures <I>ka&#x301;la</I>. It was in this sense that the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> was used in Buddhist Tantra, and the ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;nii <I></I>and <I></I>Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii <I></I>schools used to worship <I>Ka&#x301;li</I> in the <I>Bhaeravii Cakra</I>. Later this <I>ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na</I> got lost in the wave of <I>vajraya&#x301;na</I> [another Buddhist Tantra]. <I></I>Even the last vestige of <I>ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na</I> disappeared under the pressure of <I>vajraya&#x301;na</I> from the soil of Bengal some 1,100 years ago.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> is the negative form of <I>Can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301;shakti</I>. According to Puranic legend when Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii was asked to disclose her identity, even before she could answer, an ink-black entity emanated from her body and said, &ldquo;I am not Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii&rdquo;. Then Can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301; asked her, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;I am Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; <I>&#133;</I> I <I></I>am <I>Kaoveri.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I> I am your negative self.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><p>So, <I>Ka&#x301;li</I> means a special state of Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li><I></I>Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; (<I>vajrata&#x301;ra&#x301;, ugrata&#x301;ra&#x301;, niilata&#x301;ra&#x301;, tathaevaca/ta&#x301;ra&#x301;-ta&#x301;rin&#x301;ii-bhra&#x301;mariita&#x301;ra&#x301; iti sa&#x301; ucyate)</I>, originally a Buddhist goddess, was later incorporated into the Puranic religion, but the case of Ka&#x301;li <I></I>is not exactly the same. <I></I>Ka&#x301;li <I></I>is certainly a Buddhist Naera&#x301;tmadevii [nihilistic goddess]. But <I>Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> Tantra originated during the period when the ancient Shaeva <I></I>school was predominant, as was the case during the rise of Jainism. For this reason, the Jains recognized Jaina-Shiva (Jyotirliun&#x32D;ga) <I></I>and <I></I>accepted <I></I>Pa&#x301;rvatii as <I>a&#x301;dya&#x301;shakti</I> or <I>ambika&#x301;shakti</I> or the collective form of sixty-four <I>yoginiis</I>; similarly, in Buddhism also Shiva has been accepted as Maha&#x301; Buddha. In the same way, Shiva&#146;s <I></I>earthly wife Ka&#x301;lii <I></I>was considered an acoustic form of Naera&#x301;tmadevii. As a result, Ka&#x301;lii not only acquired status in Buddhist religion, in Puranic Tantra also she was somewhat more firmly established than Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;. Darjjelim&#x301;, the traditional Buddhist name of Darjeeling, became Durjaya Liun&#x32D;ga <I></I>in the Puranic language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><p>For all the different meanings in which the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> is used above, both <I>i</I> and <I>ii</I> are acceptable. But in the case where it is the first part of a compound word, <I>ii</I> is a must.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><li>One meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> is soot, that is, <I>bhus&#x301;o</I> [obtained from the smoke of wood, coal, oil, etc]. In this case the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> must be spelt with <I>i</I>, without exception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><li>You must know that there is always soot <I></I>(<I>jhul)</I> in the kitchens of housewives who pay scant attention to cleanliness. This soot is only a kind of <I>bhus&#x301;o</I>. Three things together make this <I>jhul</I>: water particles in the atmosphere, dust particles in the air and <I>bhus&#x301;o</I>. The <I>bhus&#x301;o</I> that hangs or keeps on hanging is called <I>jhul</I> [literally &ldquo;something that is hanging&rdquo;]. This kind of soot is also called <I>ka&#x301;li</I>. In this case also, the spelling will be <I>ka&#x301;li</I> [and not <I>ka&#x301;lii</I>].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><li><I></I> <I>Ka&#x301;jala</I> <I>(kajjvala</I>): The word <I>kajjvala</I> is formed by adding the suffix <I>jvala</I> to <I>kat</I>, which etymologically means &ldquo;something that shines in an ugly manner&rdquo;. So one has to use <I>va</I> [with <I>jj</I>]. <I>T</I> of <I>kat</I> is converted into <I>ja</I>; so there must be two <I>ja</I>. And <I>kad + jal = kajjal</I> means swollen or expanded water, that is, cloud. In its spelling there will be two <I>j-s</I> but no <I>va</I>. So now you understand the difference between <I>kajjvala</I> and <I>kajjala</I>. However, this <I>kajjvala</I> or <I>ka&#x301;jala</I> is soot mixed with oil. This <I>ka&#x301;jala</I> is <I></I>also called <I>ka&#x301;li</I>. It can be spelt only with <I>li</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><li>Well, can you tell me whether the people of India used to wear shoes in ancient times? Yes, it is true, human beings did not know how to wear shoes in pre-historic times when civilization was in its infancy, but they started using shoes when civilization had passed the first few stages. The <I>Vipras</I> [intellectuals] and the <I>Vaishyas</I> [business class] used wooden clogs with wooden balls attached. The <I>Shu&#x301;dras</I> were not allowed to use shoes. The <I>Ks&#x301;atriyas</I> wore leather sandals. In those days there was no arrangement for tanning. They used to rub the leather with the resin of <I>ga&#x301;b</I> [<I>kendu</I>, mangosteen variety] and dry it in the sun. Then it was seasoned in lukewarm water for a lengthy period. When this process was repeated several times, the leather no longer remained a raw hide, and the stench was also removed to some extent. It is with this leather that <I>na&#x301;gra&#x301;s</I> [a kind of loose shoe or slipper] used by <I>Ks&#x301;atriyas</I> were made. Formerly the Kayasthas of Bengal used to wear <I></I>this <I>na&#x301;gra&#x301;</I> at the time of marriage, perhaps in continuation of ancient tradition. However, the practice is no longer in vogue.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><p>The use of shoes brought in its wake the use of blackening [to polish.] the shoes. In spelling <I>ka&#x301;li</I> [black] used for polishing the shoes, both i <I></I>and <I>ii</I> are acceptable. True, it is generally spelt with <I>i</I>, but it will not be wrong if you use <I>ii</I>. However, if the word is <I>kalii</I>, then the first part of a compound word must be written as <I>ka&#x301;li</I> with <I>i</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> is <I>masii</I>. The word <I>masii</I> is derived from the verbal root <I>mas</I>. The word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> is derived from the verbal root <I>ka&#x301;la</I>. As writing ink, that is, as <I>masii</I>, the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> is widely used. Here also, although both <I>i</I> and <I>ii</I> are correct, the practice of writing it with <I>i</I> is more prevalent. But it will not be wrong to use <I>ii</I>. Perhaps in order to distinguish the goddess Ka&#x301;lii from all other uses of the word, they used <I>i</I>, although in most cases it would not have been wrong to use <I>ii</I>. In Sanskrit there is also limited use of the word <I>kajjvala</I> in the sense of writing ink &ndash; <I>Asitagirisamam&#x301; sya&#x301;t kajjvalam&#x301; sindhupa&#x301;tre &#133;</I> . [If the Himalayas is considered an ink tablet and the ocean is the inkpot &#133;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> is defective conduct or menial jobs. In this case also, both <I>i</I> and <I>ii</I> will go with <I>la</I>. But in Sanskrit, the custom of using <I>i</I> is very old &ndash; <I>Eta pralobhaner madhye thekeo ta&#x301;r caritre ka&#x301;li la&#x301;geni</I> [&ldquo;Even in the midst of so many temptations, his character remained untarnished&rdquo;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><li>Of the seven flames of fire, one flame is called <I>ka&#x301;lii</I>. The real nature and the real form of a flame are determined by the speed of the wind and the percentage of unburnt carbon particles in the flame. Varied opinions notwithstanding, the seven flames of fire recognized during the Buddhist period of the scientist Nagarjuna are: i) <I>ka&#x301;lii</I>, ii) <I>kara&#x301;lii</I>, iii) <I>leliha&#x301;na</I>, iv) <I>lolojihva&#x301;</I>, <I>v</I>) <I>sarvalakta&#x301;</I>, vi) <I>kharpara&#x301;</I>, and vii) <I>masiikrs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><li>One meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> is night.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><li>You know that the people of India have been familiar with coal for a long time. The Sanskrit word for coal is <I>aun&#x32D;ga&#x301;ra</I>, <I></I>which in colloquial Bengali is <I>a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;ra</I> o<I>r a&#x301;un&#x32D;gra&#x301;</I>. Charcoal was called <I>ka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;ra</I>, and the firewood (burning wood or dry wood) was called <I>aun&#x32D;ga&#x301;ra-ka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I>. In the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region there are many villages with similar names, like A&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;radihi, A&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;raha&#x301;t&#x301;i, A&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;rasole, because the inhabitants of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region have been familiar with coal since ancient times. The people in those days did not know an effective method for digging up coal from a coal mine where deposits lay far below the earth&#146;s surface. They used to dig up the earth, scoop out the coal and use it for burning, cooking and metallic crafts. At one time there were a number of open pits in Burdwan, Manbhum (Purulia and Dhanbad) and Hazaribag regions. In an open pit, the layers of coal sometimes rise and move towards the uppermost layer of the earth. So it was from open pits that coal used to be collected since very ancient times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><p>The Bengali word <I>kayla&#x301;</I> has come from the word <I>koilo</I> (note the phonetic affinity of the Bengali <I>kayla&#x301;</I> or <I>koilo</I> with the English word &ldquo;coal&rdquo;) of <I>Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta</I> as well as ancient Gujarati languages. The introduction of the scientific method of lifting coal in Raniganj of Burdwan district ushered a new era in the coal industry. The contribution of &ldquo;Kar-Thakur Company<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->&rdquo; in this respect can never be forgotten.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><p>Although there was no scientific method to determine the quality [of coal], and although there was little acquaintance with the byproducts of coal tar and pitch, still people had some familiarity with coal tar and pitch. It means they had not yet invented saccharine or other coal-tar derivatives. No one inspired them in that direction. However, there was a sound infrastructure. They had a general idea regarding the location of available coal mines. They knew that there was a huge deposit of coal in the Damodar River bed. So they named the river <I>Da&#x301;modara</I> (<I>da&#x301;ma + udara</I>). <I>Da&#x301;ma</I> means &ldquo;fire&rdquo;. [and <I>udara</I> means &ldquo;stomach&rdquo;]. The river that has fire in its stomach is [literally] <I>damodara</I>. The Damodar basin had potentially the largest coal deposits. Today most of it is gone. Perhaps after some time there will be no coal in the upper layers of the coal mines. In order to collect coal, one will have to go deep down. Perhaps the venture may not be cost-effective then. Once a substitute for coal as fuel is invented, the mines will be abandoned. Instead we will have a huge lake stretching from Bhurkunda to Mejia. From the western side, the Damodar will flow into that lake, and then, leaving the lake, the river will run towards Durgapur. As the used mines are not properly filled with sand, the mines will collapse and these kinds of lakes will be created. The catastrophe that has befallen Jharia will befall the entire vast expanse of the Damodar basin.<!-- /block --></p>

You can freely use the word <I>ka&#x301;lya&#x301;</I> in Bengali. Milk-yielding cows are generally divided into three categories &ndash; <I>ka&#x301;lya&#x301;</I>, <I>dhenu</I> and <I>sandhinii</I>. One does not milk a cow in India for some time after it has given birth to a calf. A cow in that stage is called <I>sandhinii</I>.

<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->I told you a little while ago that the verbal root <I>ka&#x301;sh</I> means to shine, to scintillate, and the verbal root <I>ka&#x301;s</I> means to make a nasty noise (to make different coughing sounds like <I>khak-khak, khak-khak, khuk-khuk, khuk-khuk, khok-khok, khok-khok</I>). By adding the suffix <I>than</I> (according to another opinion, <I>kthan)</I> we get the word <I>ka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I>, whose etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which shines or scintillates&rdquo;. <I>Ka&#x301;sh + kth + na</I> should <I></I>become <I>ka&#x301;shtha</I>. But <I>sha</I> is a palatal consonant, while <I>tha</I> is dental; hence the two cannot be combined. <I>Sha</I> can be combined with the palatal <I>cha</I>. Now if for the sake of a combination [cluster] we write <I>sa</I> in place of <I>sha</I>, then the word will become <I>ka&#x301;stha</I>, which means an asthmatic patient. So you cannot use <I>sa</I>. It is safer to use the word <I>ka&#x301;s&#x301;a</I>. But <I>s&#x301;a</I> is retroflex and therefore cannot be combined with the dental <I>tha</I>. In this case, therefore, <I>s&#x301;a</I> has been clustered with the second retroflex letter, <I>t&#x301;ha</I>. The spelling has thus become <I>ka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->In common usage the word <I>ka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I> means &ldquo;wood&rdquo;. <I>Ka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha &gt; ka&#x301;t&#x301;t&#x301;ha &gt; ka&#x301;t&#x301;h/ka&#x301;t&#x301;</I>. According to the science of phonetics the spelling can be both <I>ka&#x301;t&#x301;h</I> and <I>ka&#x301;t&#x301;</I>. But since the usual practice in Bengali is to spell the word as <I>ka&#x301;th</I>, we should allow it remain as such. In feminine, however, the word <I>ka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;</I> has several meanings in common usage: <ol> <li>We divide this earth of ours into the eastern hemisphere and western hemisphere on the basis of the temporal dimension of the sunrise and the sunset. Again owing to the angular changes [of the earth] during different seasons, sunlight does not fall equally on the northern and southern parts of the earth. Sometimes the sun is hotter in the Tropic of Cancer, and sometimes in the Tropic of Capricorn. So the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth are divided according to the predominance of heat or cold. In this manner we have four parts of the earth: i) the northern part of the eastern hemisphere, ii) the southern part of the eastern hemisphere, iii) the northern part of the western hemisphere, and iv) the southern part of the western hemisphere. Each of these four parts of the earth is called a <I>ka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph --><li>a. The verbal root <I>ka&#x301;sh</I> means something that shines or glitters or is luminous. So by adding the suffix <I>u</I> to the verbal root <I>vas</I>, we get the word <I>vasu</I>. The soul resides in the eight elements, using them as its base: five <I>prapain&#x32D;ca</I> or <I>pain&#x32D;cabhuta</I> [five fundamental factors], <I>cittatatattva</I> [ectoplasm], <I>aham&#x301;tattva</I> [the doer &#x301;I&#146;], <I></I>and <I>mahattattva</I> [the pure &#x301;I&#146;]. So these eight elements are called <I>as&#x301;t&#x301;avasu. Ka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;</I> also means <I>as&#x301;t&#x301;avasu</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

For example, in ancient times people believed that on the first day of the moon they see only one <I>kala&#x301;</I> [1/16 of the whole moon]. On the second day they see two <I>kala&#x301;s</I> [2/16] of the moon.

The sixteenth <I>kala&#x301;</I> [the sixteenth lunar digit] <I></I>cannot be seen. The reason is because the slightly tilted position of the moon causes the sixteenth part to be covered by darkness. In ancient times people used to refer to that sixteenth <I>kala&#x301;</I> as <I>ama&#x301;kala&#x301;</I> [the black lunar digit] or <I>Indu</I>.

Similarly, when something of general standard begins to decline, the lower it sinks, the more it elicits human hatred. The lowest point is hated by most the people.

<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Ku + d&#x301;ikhin = kikhi</I>. The verbal root <I>ku</I> is used in many senses. One meaning is grinning and grimacing. So, the etymological meaning of the word <I>kikhi</I> is &ldquo;one who grimaces&rdquo;. One speciality about the suffixes <I>d&#x301;ikhin</I> and <I>kvan</I> is that the last phoneme of the verbal root can alternately be <I>i</I>. For example, if you add the suffix <I>kvan/kvas</I> to the verbal root <I>kan</I>, the resulting word will of course be <I>kan&#x301;va</I>, but it can also be <I>kin&#x301;va</I>. Similarly, if you add the suffix <I>d&#x301;ikhin</I>, it can be both <I>kukhi</I> and <I>kikhi</I>. But the <I>kukhi</I> form is not prevalent. In common usage, the word <I>kikhi</I> means: <ol> <li>&ldquo;Monkey&rdquo;. On the slightest occasion, either due to fear or excitement, a monkey grimaces with clenched fist. So it is called <I>kikhi</I>. This habit of the monkey is prehistoric. Although the ancestors of human beings and monkeys are the same, they were separated at least one million years ago. So a human being also, when frightened or excited, clenches the fist and grimaces. A small child keeps its fist clenched most of the time, and the habit of grimacing also remains predominant in childhood.<!-- /block --></p>

He was familiar with many private and public matters of his boss. I learnt from Ujbuk Singh that about fifteen days previously his boss had become an additional minister (deputy minister). On seeing me, he gave a broad, beaming smile and said, &ldquo;Sarkar sahib, since my boss has become the deputy minister, everyday he tells me about his desire to see you. Only this morning he told me, &#x301;I must see Sarkar sahib today by any means. You go to his house and immediately make a &rdquo;pontmont&ldquo; (&rdquo;appointment&ldquo;) with him.&#146; But I could never imagine that I would run into you like this.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Then many insects must die at the tip of the plough or a power-tiller or tractor when you use these to till the soil. Is that not an act of violence? The sickle with which you reap the corn, is it not a weapon?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph --><p>Akalmand retorted, &ldquo;I no longer tread a path of sin like that. I no longer cultivate. That is a great sin&#133; great sin&#133;great sin. I have given up farming altogether.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;What are you doing then?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;I have begun to build a cow herd, maintain cows and do dairy farming&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;Then how do you give fodder to the cows? How do you cut the bunch of straw to pieces?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;I don&#146;t cut the hay; I don&#146;t cut the straw to pieces. I tear it by hand and put the pieces in the eating vessel.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph --><p>Now I realized that Akalmand is indeed a very serious practitioner of non-violence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;I have noticed that many gods and goddesses have weapons in their hands. Do you think they believe in violence?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph --><p>Akalmand responded, &ldquo;Look, in this respect I have a few words to say. First, you should never compare divinities with humans. What is prohibited to humans is allowed to divinities. And what is forbidden for divinities is allowed to humans. So when divinities have weapons in their hands, we must presume that those are not weapons; those are sacred objects like copper vessel and basil leaves. And in case they really have weapons, even that does not matter.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;And what is your second argument?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph --><p>Akalmand replied, &ldquo;What you see in the hands of divinities and take for weapons are not actually weapons. That is your misunderstanding &ndash; a learning error. That is the reason why I say that the educational system must be overhauled&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Many gods and goddesses have bows and arrows in their hands. How would you account for that?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;Didn&#146;t I tell you a little while ago that an arrow means <I>shar</I>, a pen made of reed?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Many gods and goddesses carry lotus in their hands. There are bees, wasps, bumblebees, etc. in the lotus, and these insects sting. Is it non-violence?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph --><p>He replied, &ldquo;You should remove the insects by violently shaking the lotus before you put it in the hand of a god or a goddess. Then it will be alright.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Many deities have conch shells in their hands. A conch is a marine creature. The fishermen catch them in their nets. Then they boil it in hot water and remove the flesh and other parts. Then they clean the shell and sell it in the market. Is it not violence?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;Yes, what you have said is partly true but not wholly true.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=114 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=115 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;There are also many dead conches in the sea. If the fishermen collect only those, then there will be no violence.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;But will the fishermen agree?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;We will make an amendment of the Constitution to prohibit the collection of live conches.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Then are you going to prohibit fishing [live fish] as well?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Even otherwise, the Constitution is amended a dozen times every year. What does it matter if it is amended a few more times?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;But what about the clubs and mallets that some gods and goddesses have in their hands? Would you call that non-violent also?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph --><p>Akalmand retorted, &ldquo;Look, again it raises the question of lack of education and bad education.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Do you mean to say that owing to our lack of education, what we take for clubs in the hands of gods and goddesses are not really clubs?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;Exactly. You took the words right out of my mouth.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;How&#146;s that?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph --><p>He declared, &ldquo;People who believe in violence have armed gods and goddesses with clubs for their own ideological satisfaction. Actually it is not a club at all; it is a gourd &ndash; a club-gourd, in fact. Haven&#146;t you read <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I>? There lots of praise has been showered on the club-gourd. The gods with club-gourds in their hands want to say, &lsquo;O humans! Without wasting any more time, start eating preparations of club-gourd. It will do you immense good!&rsquo;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;Then what we take for a club in the hands of the divinities is actually a club-gourd?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;Yes, of course yes; a hundred times yes.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph --><p>I proffered, &ldquo;Well, we have practically finished the discussion. But, still there is one point that is yet to be sorted out. What about the <I>cakra</I> [the wheel-shaped missile], the boomerang that we see in the hands of some divinities?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=129 type=paragraph --><p>He averred, &ldquo;Here also the issue is lack of education and bad education. This is the reason why in the cabinet we are discussing seven and a half times every day how to overhaul the entire educational system.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph --><p>I retorted, &ldquo;If you want to overhaul the educational system, do it. It&#146;s your baby; you do whatever you like. You know better. Once a minister obstinately removed English from the syllabus and in the process ruined an entire generation of students. Those students are nowhere now; they are not getting any job. Some, after doing B.A., are bleating about, and some after doing M.A., are babbling about. Anyway, you are at the helm of affairs; you do whatever you like. But you just account for the <I>cakra</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=131 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;Your basic premise is wrong. The divinities never had any <I>cakra</I>, nor will they ever have any. This is either your misunderstanding or your optical illusion.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=132 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I queried.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="133"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=133 type=paragraph --><p>He answered, &ldquo;That is actually a spinning wheel, that is, <I>carka&#x301;</I>. The divinities are holding it in their hands.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="134"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=134 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;What are you trying to suggest?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph --><p>Akalmand retorted, &ldquo;What does your linguistics say, or philology or phonetics?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=136 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;The word <I>carka&#x301;</I> has come from the word <I>cakra</I>, and not the other way round,&rdquo; I answered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=137 type=paragraph --><p>Akalmand said, &ldquo;So, there you are!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="138"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=138 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="139"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=139 type=paragraph --><p>He explained, &ldquo;The rules in the divine society are just the opposite of the rules of human society. I mean, according to the language of the divinities, the word <I>cakra</I> has come from the word <I>carka&#x301;</I>. The divinities had spinning wheels in their hands, and the violent humans have made it into <I>cakra</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="140"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=140 type=paragraph --><p>I now understood that Akalmand Singh is an out and out non-violent person. I thought I would go one time to his house and see the changes that have taken place since he became a votary of non-violence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="141"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=141 type=paragraph --><p>The next day, very early in the morning &ndash; even before the crows had started cawing &ndash; I started for the house of Akalmand Singh. As I knocked on the door, a servant said from inside, &ldquo;The master is not at home.&rdquo; The residents forthwith began whispering something amongst themselves. Then I overheard a lady telling the servant, &ldquo;Tell him that he&#146;s at home, but it will take some time to see him.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="142"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=142 type=paragraph --><p>Then the servant said, &ldquo;Sir, the master&#146;s at home but you will have to wait for some time&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="143"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=143 type=paragraph --><p>Whereupon I told the servant, &ldquo;Tell him, that I am Mr. Sarkar; I will not wait even one second, I&#146;m leaving.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="144"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=144 type=paragraph --><p>I had hardly gone two steps when Akalmand Singh, busy putting a guernsey on rushed up to me exclaiming, &ldquo;Where are you going! The servant told you all rubbish without knowing you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="145"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=145 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;Did you instruct him like that?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="146"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=146 type=paragraph --><p>He affirmed, &ldquo;Yes, I only instructed him like that. You see, people visit me with all kinds of motives. In order to escape them, I&#146;ve given this instruction.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="147"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=147 type=paragraph --><p>Holding me [respectfully], Akalmand led me into his drawing room.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="148"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=148 type=paragraph --><p>I told him, &ldquo;Now I won&#146;t sit inside. Better let&#146;s go to the rooftop; we&#146;ll get some fresh air there.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="149"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=149 type=paragraph --><p>As I was about to climb the stairs leading to the roof with his storeroom on our right, I noticed a recently killed, huge rat lying against the outer wall of the storeroom.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="150"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=150 type=paragraph --><p>I blurted out, &ldquo;Shame, shame, shame, shame! What&#146;s this! Fie, fie! What&#146;s this? Such an act of violence in the house of a non-violent person! What an act of cruelty &ndash; an anathema! The sacred vow of non-violence thrown to the winds! This is virtually a slaughtering of nonviolence! Alas! Alas! How has it come to such a pass?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="151"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=151 type=paragraph --><p>The dark face of Akalmand Singh turned violet (had his face been white, it would have turned crimson in shame) as he replied. &ldquo;This is exactly what I was going to tell you. Just look at these corporation people; just see what they have done.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="152"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=152 type=paragraph --><p>I rejoined, &ldquo;How strange! The corporation people stormed into your storeroom and killed the rat, and then themselves disappeared without even caring to remove the dead rat as they saw me entering! Just see what an awkward situation they have actually put you in!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="153"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=153 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;When exactly did the corporation people come?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="154"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=154 type=paragraph --><p>He said. &ldquo;No one came from the corporation&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="155"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=155 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;Then why do you blame them?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="156"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=156 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;Yesterday afternoon the corporation people were watering the streets with a hose. There was a monkey sitting on a tin roof by the wayside. A flippant young boy directed the mouth of the hose towards the monkey for fun. Annoyed and irritated as well as frightened by it, with gritting teeth and grimaces he jumped out of sight. Just nearby there was a huge grazing area &#133; a grazing ground for buffaloes. A huge buffalo, you understand, a <I>ka&#x301;sara&rdquo;</I><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="157"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=157 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Oh yes, yes, of course I know, for sure I know.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="158"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=158 type=paragraph --><p>He resumed, &ldquo;Annoyed by the grimaces of the monkey, a huge Gujarati buffalo weighing some sixty <I>maunds</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> rushed at the monkey. There was a hurdle on the way: a wall made of earth. The wall collapsed as the buffalo dashed against it. On the other side of the wall an elephant was standing. As soon as the wall collapsed on its body, the flabbergasted elephant started running at a speed of two hundred miles per minute. In the course of running, this elephant violently collided against the roadside wall of my storeroom. There were a number of dishes kept against the wall, and the rat, sitting in the chinks between the plates, was happily chewing the bones of a fish.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="159"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=159 type=paragraph --><p>I wondered, &ldquo;Fish bones in the house of nonviolence! Strange&#133;totally topsy-turvy! Alas, alas, see how nonviolence is ruthlessly butchered! It is like seeing a stone floating on water! Whatever fish it may be &ndash; be it <I>shol</I> [large tubular fish] or <I>moha&#x301;shol</I> [a larger variety of <I>shol</I>] &ndash; eating fish is a serious act of violence, surely a serious act of violence indeed!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="160"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=160 type=paragraph --><p>He said apologetically, &ldquo;It is only the servants who eat fish, the residents don&#146;t. Anyway, with the push of the elephant, the utensils fell down noisily, and look; it had to fall on the rat! How can such a small creature of God stand the weight of so many dishes! Consequently it died of suffocation. I have now planned to perform its funeral rites. Then I shall organize a <I>kiirtana</I> of nonviolence. All the big ministers, half-ministers, ministers without portfolio &ndash; all, all will come. I am planning to put up a multi-coloured canopy, and I am trying to see that this particular day is declared a holiday.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="161"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=161 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Holiday? Just for such a petty thing!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="162"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=162 type=paragraph --><p>He said defensively, &ldquo;These days &ndash; reason or no reason &ndash; holidays are very frequent. And when such a heart-rending accident has occurred in the house of someone who is no less than a deputy minister, how can there be no holiday? The day must be declared a holiday, must, must, must.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="163"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=163 type=paragraph --><p>I again asked, &ldquo;Who then has actually killed the rat?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="164"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=164 type=paragraph --><p>He promptly replied, &ldquo;Of course the corporation people. It is their fault that such a mishap took place.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="165"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=165 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Do you know, there is a word, &lsquo;hypocrisy&rsquo; in English. Look it up in the dictionary and see how it is rendered in Bengali.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="166"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=166 type=paragraph --><p>He apologized, &ldquo;I don&#146;t know much English.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="167"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=167 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;How are you doing the job of a minister then?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="168"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=168 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;Oh, for running a ministry you don&#146;t need to know English. I understand things because the secretaries explain it. Then I just put my signature on the place they point to with their forefinger.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="169"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=169 type=paragraph --><p>I wondered, &ldquo;So you can sign then!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="170"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=170 type=paragraph --><p>He admitted, &ldquo;Formerly I was not able to. Then somebody wrote my name. And then, by repeatedly tracing it with ink, I have attained quite some mastery in signing my name.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="171"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=171 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;Before this you used to manage with the fingerprint then?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="172"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=172 type=paragraph --><p>He confessed, &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="173"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=173 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;Do you remember which finger you used for the purpose?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="174"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=174 type=paragraph --><p>He boasted, &ldquo;There is no chance of making any mistake about that.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="175"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=175 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;Which finger, just tell me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="177"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=177 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Then please ask somebody to find out for you the exact Bengali meaning of the word, &lsquo;hypocrisy&rsquo;.&rdquo; </ol><!-- /block --></p>
