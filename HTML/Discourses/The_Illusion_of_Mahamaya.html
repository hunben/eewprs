<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This is the story of Mahamaya, otherwise known as Parvati, the goddess who assumed the form of an old lady.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Using her powers of illusion<br>Mahamaya became an old woman<br>Holding a broken rod in her right hand<br>And a basket under her left arm.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Shiva established a city called Kashii from where both saints and sinners could reach Shivaloka, the Abode of Salvation, after death. Of course, there were many more sinners than saints in Kashii &ndash; saints, being so virtuous, go to heaven wherever they die. Sinners, however, have no other alternative than to die in Kashii. So, there was a huge crowd of them in Kashii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The devotees of Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u weren&#146;t very happy about this and asked Vyasa to build a special city for them. Vyasa complied with their request and built the city of Vyasa-Kashii opposite Kashii, on the other side of the River Ganges. He then announced that whoever died at Vyasa-Kashii would spend eternity in Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha, the Abode of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Thousands of people flocked to the new city, resulting in such rapid growth that the city was soon a jumble of housing estates and congested streets. The sanitation system was in total disarray and there were acute shortages of milk, green vegetables and drinking water. Vyasa-Kashii was bursting at the seams.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What should we do, Parvati?&rdquo; Shiva asked his wife. &ldquo;Kashii will soon be totally deserted &ndash; everyone&#146;s going to Vyasa-Kashi.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Don&#146;t worry, my Lord,&rdquo; replied Parvati. &ldquo;I have an excellent plan.&rdquo; Parvati suddenly assumed the form of a frail old lady.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->With filthy hair and matted locks<br>That&#146;s full of ticks and dust,<br>With sunken eyes that only blink<br>And a chin and nose that quickly sink,<br>With arms and legs completely bent<br>And a back that&#146;s almost double,<br>The Goddess of Fortune has become no more<br>Than a heap of skin and bones.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Parvati stood before Vyasa in her new form. Vyasa assumed that this old woman was also eager to go to Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha. &ldquo;What is the benefit of dying here?&rdquo; asked the old lady.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One goes to Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha, my dear,&rdquo; he replied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Parvati placed her hands behind her ears and said, &ldquo;Can you speak a little louder, please. What&#146;s the benefit of dying here?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One goes to Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha,&rdquo; replied Vyasa a little louder.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Please excuse me,&rdquo; said Parvati, &ldquo;I&#146;m a little hard of hearing. Could you speak a little louder?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Raising his voice even more, Vyasa said, &ldquo;People go to Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha, dear lady, they go to Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Parvati again placed her hands behind her ears and said, &ldquo;I&#146;m terrible sorry, but I couldn&#146;t hear anything at all. Can you please repeat what the benefit is?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Vyasa lost his patience and shouted at the top of his voice, &ldquo;Those who die here become donkeys, you old fool.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Parvati assumed her original form and said, &ldquo;So be it, let them become donkeys.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The news was broadcast by television and radio and within a few minutes was common knowledge. As you can imagine, no one wanted to stay in Vyasa-Kashii after that. &ldquo;Run for your lives,&rdquo; they shouted as they leapt into boats, rickshaws, carts, and anything else with wheels, and moved back to Shiva&#146;s Kashii. Within a few minutes Vyasa-Kashii was as deserted as a market place at night.<!-- /block --></p>
