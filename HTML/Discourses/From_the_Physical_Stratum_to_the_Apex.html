Notes: <p class="Para_Notes">official source: <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12</i></p>
<p class="Para_Notes">this version: is the printed <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 11 &amp; 12,</i> 1st edition, 2008, version (obvious spelling, punctuation and typographical mistakes only may have been corrected). I.e., this is the most up-to-date version as of the present Electronic Edition.</p>
<p class="Para_Notes"><i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch,</i> which was published in December, 1979, and <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12,</i> which was published in 1980, each contained a version of this discourse. There were slight differences between the versions. The two versions may have resulted from two independent transcriptions of the same tape when the tape was available. The <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12</i> version was reprinted in <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 11 &amp; 12</i>. Words in double square brackets [[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]] here in the Electronic Edition are corrections that did not appear in the printed <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 11 &amp; 12;</i> they are mostly words incorporated from the <i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch</i> version where that version seemed more logical.</p>
<p class="Para_Notes">Published in <i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch</i> as &ldquo;A Spiritual Existence&rdquo;.</p>

<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[[<i>Kaos&#x301;ikii</i> is not an ordinary dance. It is, along with physical exercise, a spiritual practice. It is a very, very good dance. The human entity is not only a physical one &ndash; you are something more than a physical structure, you are something more subtle, more sweet, more charming and more fascinating. Your existence is not within the boundaries of your bones and flesh. You are something higher, something greater, something bigger. A man must not forget this rudimentary truth.]] Man is not an ordinary being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The other day I was saying that human existence is more a psychic than a physical one. A man must not forget this truth. For a psychic sentiment, for a psycho-spiritual goal or for a pinnacled psychic existence, a man becomes ready to quit this physical body even. And when the parallelism between the psychic flow and the entitative flow is broken, a man wants to quit this world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This is not the case with other animals, whose existence is more physical than psychic. That&#146;s why we may say that human existence is a psychic existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->You know that the science of homoeopathy is based on the psychic existence of human beings. And because human existence is a psychic existence, there is a spiritual tendency in human beings. In developed animals, the tendency is towards psychic development, and because man himself is a psychic being, in developed human beings the tendency is towards the spiritual goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The physical stratum, the psychic stratum, the spiritual stratum: Animals are more physical than psychic, so in the case of developed animals, that pinnacled physical sense of existence moves towards psychic existence, the psychic stratum; and in man, having a more psychic existence, what happens? [[Being more]] psychically developed, his pinnacled psychic existence moves towards spirituality. So wherever, in any corner of this planet or universe, there are human beings, the developed human beings are spiritually-minded, and it is the natural movement of development. Wherever there is any psychic development in human beings, they are all spiritually-minded, they will be spiritually-minded.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There is no alternative, because psychic existence has certain imperfections of its own. Man, when he wants to go beyond the periphery of psychic existence, naturally resorts to spirituality. There is no alternative. And that is the transformation expressed between a psychic being and a spiritual being, that is, a man becomes more a spiritual being than a psychic one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Monkeys, or, say, dogs, when they get proper training, slowly become psychic and not physical. An ordinary dog is a physical being, but a trained dog is more psychic than physical. It comes nearer to man. It maintains a closer proximity to human existence. Developed monkeys, chimpanzees, gorillas, orang-utans, dogs &ndash; many animals of the canine group, but not of the bovine group &ndash; they are less developed &ndash; when those animals, a bit developed animals, get proper training, they do something extraordinary. Similarly, when a man gets proper training, a training in occult science, be gets more developed and finally he becomes a spiritual being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And his ordinary human qualities are developed to an extraordinary standard of efficiency, and those extraordinarily developed qualities are called &ldquo;occult powers&rdquo;, the powers that one acquires by dint of his cult. That which one gets through cult is an occult power. The person may easily become omniscient, he knows everything, he will know everything &ndash; why?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Because the Supreme Creator knows everything. And why does the Supreme Creator know everything? Because everything is His internal psychic projection, and nothing is external, nothing is without, everything is within. So when, by dint of one&#146;s practice of cult, one ensconces himself in the Supreme Existence, one becomes one with the Supreme, and that is why everything comes within the periphery of his mind &ndash; he also becomes omniscient.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->It is nothing extraordinary. You as the Supreme Being are omniscient, but because of a feeling of &ndash; your feeling of microcosmic existence, you do not realize your own potentialities, and that is the only trouble with ordinary human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->What are you to do? You are to transform your psychic existence into spiritual existence, and ordinary physical and psychic powers into occult powers. And when you become one with Him, the entire Universe becomes your internal psychic projection, rather, intro-psycho-spiritual projection. You know everything. You are one with everything. You love everybody. You cannot hate. Even if you try to hate, it won&#146;t be possible for you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->I said so many times that the Supreme Father, <i>Parama Pita&#x301;,</i> cannot do two things &ndash; one thing, He cannot hate anybody. Even if He so desires, He cannot hate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->One imperfection with Him is that &ndash; He is perfect, but He has two imperfections &ndash; one is that He cannot hate. Suppose He is hating Mr. X. He&#146;ll say, &ldquo;Oh, X, get out.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Then X will ask Him, &ldquo;O Father, everybody says &ndash; and when everybody says it, that means You want everybody to say it &ndash; that&#146;s why everybody says it, You get it said by everybody &ndash; that You are infinite. And You told me to get out. But how can I go beyond the jurisdiction of infinity? It&#146;s impossible. So You have two alternatives: either You should withdraw what You say, or You should change your name, because You no longer remain infinite.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->A dangerous challenge, badly affecting His prestige. [laughter] He cannot hate &ndash; one imperfection.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->And the second imperfection is that He cannot create another <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> like Himself. That is, <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> always remains One. How, why?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->When a spiritual aspirant comes into His contact, develops love for Him, his apexed mind becomes one with Him. He no longer retains his separate entity. So <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> always remains a singular entity. Even if He so desires, He cannot create another <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So the conception of God and Satan is defective. If we accept the existence of Satan, it means there are two Gods, one God positive and the other God negative &ndash; that is, Satan &ndash; and that Satan challenges the authority of <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. That cannot be. So there is no Satan. Everywhere is the rule of <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. Nowhere is the rule of Satan.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Satan is the centrifugal force, the <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force that takes an aspirant, a man, away from the Supreme Nucleus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->So the Satanic conception is a defective conception. There is no Satan. Everywhere you are with <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> and never in this Universe, nowhere in this Universe, are you alone. So you are never helpless. Wherever you may be, do your <i>kiirtana, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; na&#x301;ma kevalam</i>. He is with you. You are never alone. You are never weak. You are never helpless.<!-- /block --></p>
