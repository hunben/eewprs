<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The verbal root <I>kus&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;to extract&rdquo;, &ldquo;to prepare an essence&rdquo;. For example, to draw honey from a honeycomb, to extract honey by squeezing the wax, to extract honey from flowers, to extract floral nectar from flowers, to prepare a floral essence, to extract medicinal material from green papaya and green spinach &ndash; all are functions of the verbal root <I>kus&#x301;</I>. The verbal root <I>kus&#x301;</I> also means, &ldquo;to make a hole in the ground&rdquo;. <I>Kuks&#x301;a</I> is derived from the verbal root <I>kus&#x301;</I> and the suffix <I>sa</I>. The etymological meaning of <I>kuks&#x301;a</I> is, &ldquo;that in which a void or vacuum is created after extracting something&rdquo;. If the abdomen is compressed, then the abdominal air moves. In colloquial usage, the hollow or void that appears in the upper part of the abdomen is called <I>kuks&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><i>Kuks&#x301;i</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><I>Kus&#x301; +ksi = kuks&#x301;i</I>. Usually the suffix <I>i</I> is used both in an affectionate sense and in a general sense; the suffix <I>ki</I> is used in a general sense and to denote result. And the suffix <I>ksi</I> is used in several specific senses. In ancient times certain scholars did not like to use the suffix <I>ksi</I> but other eminent scholars retained it because of its specific uses. You can also retain it since its use does not cause any serious complications. Etymologically <I>kuks&#x301;i</I> refers to that void or nothingness that cannot be seen or discerned from the outside. The suffix <I>ksi</I> has been used here because it has this special connotation. Colloquially <I>kuks&#x301;i</I> means &ldquo;that void created inside the stomach due to hunger or any other reason&rdquo;. Suppose a crocodile is hungry. A <I>kuks&#x301;i</I> or void has been created inside its stomach. In this situation, if it eats a goat, then that <I>kuks&#x301;i</I> will no longer exist. We say that a crocodile has devoured (<I>kuks&#x301;igata</I>) a goat. Generally, if the second part of a compound word ends with the suffix <I>kta</I> or <I>lyut&#x301;</I> then <I>ii</I> is inserted at the end of the preceding part. For instance, <I>bhasma</I> + <I>bhu&#x301;ta</I> = <I>bhasmiibhu&#x301;ta</I> [reduced to ashes]. Here the word <I>bhu&#x301;ta</I> ends with the suffix <I>kta</I>, so <I>ii</I> is inserted at the end of the word <I>bhasma</I>. In other words, the compound word becomes <I>bhasmiibhu&#x301;ta</I>. Similarly, <I>sarala + krta = saraliikrta</I> [simplification], <I>nava + karan&#x301;a = naviikaran&#x301;a</I> [renovation], <I>khand&#x301;a + bhavana = khand&#x301;iibhavana</I> [balkanization]. There is an <I>i</I> in the word <I>kuks&#x301;i</I>, so <I>kuks&#x301;i + gata</I> will not be <I>kuks&#x301;iigata</I> but rather <I>kuks&#x301;igata</I>; the <I>i</I> remains.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><I>Kun&#x301;ati</I> is formed by adding <I>ti</I> in the present tense to the verbal root <I>kun&#x301;</I>. In this case the meaning of the root verb <I>kun&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;to emit sounds intermittently&rdquo;, &ldquo;to eat while making occasional sounds&rdquo;, &ldquo;to move something around&rdquo;. These are the etymological meanings of the word <I>kun&#x301;</I>. The colloquial meaning of the word <I>kun&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;one who moves around in the midst of many others&rdquo;. The Bengali word <I>ekun&#x301;a</I> is derived from this word <I>kun&#x301;</I>. The word <I>ekun&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;accumulation&rdquo; or &ldquo;cumulative figure&rdquo;. If the present tense <I>ti</I> is added to the root <I>kun&#x301;</I> to form <I>kun&#x301;ayati</I>, <I></I>then it means &ldquo;to converse about some important matter&rdquo; or &ldquo;to give advice&rdquo;. If five people sit and discuss an important matter, then we can call their conversation <I>kun&#x301;a</I>; we can also use the word <I>kun&#x301;acarca&#x301;</I>. If a lawyer gives someone advice, we can also call it <I>kun&#x301;ayati</I>. In this sense <I>kun&#x301; + kan = kun&#x301;aka</I>; the word means &ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; or &ldquo;adviser in an important matter&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In dysentery the pain that is sometimes present around the navel area is called <I>kun&#x301;an</I>. The word is derived from <I>kun&#x301; + lyut&#x301;</I>. In colloquial Bengali we also call it <I>pet&#x301;</I> <I>kun&#x301;an</I> [pain in the belly]. By this you can understand that the expression <I>pet&#x301; kun&#x301;an</I> is not native Bengali; it is a Sanskrit <I>tatsama</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

The word <I>kun&#x301;ika&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;that with which non-liquid items (e.g., rice and pulse) are measured&rdquo;, what we call <I>kun&#x301;ke</I> in the spoken language.<!-- /block --></p>

Its second meaning is &ldquo;one who uses a blunt weapon&rdquo;. Another meaning is &ldquo;handicapped&rdquo;, e.g., one who is without fingers, one whose fingers are crooked, a lame person, one who has a hare-lip (<I>ganna&#x301; ka&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>), etc.<!-- /block --></p>

In neuter gender the word <I>kun&#x301;apa</I> means &ldquo;bad smell&rdquo; or &ldquo;foul smell&rdquo;. <ol> <li>The foul smell given off by a carcass is called <I>kun&#x301;apa</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><li>The bad smell of a fetid drain is called <I>kun&#x301;apa</I>, that is, whenever anything smells rotten that foul smell is also called <I>kun&#x301;apa</I>. The bad scent from the leaves of the herb <I>ga&#x301;n&#x32D;da&#x301;l (Paederia foetida)</I> is not <I>kun&#x301;apa</I> because that is its natural scent <I>&ndash;</I> that scent does not come from anything rotten. In masculine gender the word <I>kun&#x301;apa</I>, that is, <I>kun&#x301;apah</I> (declined like the word <I>nara</I>), means &ldquo;the carcass of any animal&rdquo;, &ldquo;an unclaimed human corpse&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><li>The other meaning of <I>kun&#x301;apa</I> is &ldquo;a kind of bird resembling a myna&rdquo; or a <I>sha&#x301;likha</I> [house-myna]<I></I>. However it is not as quarrelsome as a <I>sha&#x301;likha</I>; it lives in groups. It cannot speak like a myna but if it is properly trained it can speak a little. In certain rural areas of Bengal this bird is called a half<I>-</I>myna <I>or</I> half-<I>sha&#x301;likha (guye myna&#x301;</I> or <I>guye sha&#x301;likha)</I>. In chaste Bengali its masculine form is <I>kun&#x301;apa</I>, <I>kun&#x301;apii</I> in feminine gender. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

Its etymological meaning is &ldquo;ugly form&rdquo; or &ldquo;body made of clay&rdquo; or &ldquo;clay image&rdquo; or &ldquo;clay doll&rdquo;. The verbal root <I>tan</I> means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. The word <I>tanu</I> is used etymologically to mean &ldquo;that which increases&rdquo; or &ldquo;that whose nature is to increase&rdquo;. The colloquial meaning of the word <I>tanu</I> is &ldquo;physical body&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

In tropical countries the human body after the age of thirty-nine should be called <I>shariira</I>, that whose nature is to become thin or emaciated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In colloquial usage <I>kutanu</I> means: <ol> <li>An ugly or distorted or mutilated body, or that person who has such a body.<!-- /block --></p>

The ugly mental body of a person, or the person who possesses that mental body, is called <I>kutanu</I>. In other words <I>kutanu</I> means &ldquo;sinful mind&rdquo;. The word <I>kutanu</I> in this sense is in many cases relative. The mother-in-law is good to everyone. She is especially good to her daughter, but to her daughter-in-law she is a quarrelsome shrew with a fish-knife in her hand. The daughter-in-law also is very good to everyone. The people in the neighborhood all praise her. But her mother-in-law is the mote in her eye, what in Hindi we call <I>a&#x301;n&#x32D;kh kii kirkiri</I>. Both of them are good, so they distance themselves from one another, arrange separate stoves, cook in separate kitchens, measure their rice with separate measuring cups from separate earthen jars and set them on their stoves.

How long is your mother-in-law going to live?&rdquo; She will immediately retort: &ldquo;You&#146;ll see; I&#146;ll die and a banyan tree will grow on my grave and even then my mother-in-law won&#146;t die.&rdquo; If you tell the mother-in-law &ndash; &ldquo;Why more? Haven&#146;t you had enough of worldly life? Go, retire to Kashii [Varanasi].&rdquo; She will immediately jump up and say: &ldquo;I have barely turned eighty; is this any age to be going to Kashii? Let me live a worldly life for at least another twenty years more. Let me see my great-grandson be born and then I will think about going to Kashii. I am not going to give up my house keys so easily.&rdquo; In this case the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law are <I>kutanu</I> for each other.<!-- /block --></p>

The etymological meaning of <I>kutapa</I> is &ldquo;that fire which has lost its heat&rdquo;. <ol> <li>The colloquial meaning of <I>kutapa</I> (in neuter gender <I>kutapam&#x301;)</I> is &ldquo;low intensity fire&rdquo;, or &ldquo;smouldering fire&rdquo;, or &ldquo;that fire which is not visible from the outside&rdquo;, burning beneath the ashes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><li><I>Kutapa</I> also refers to one&#146;s daughter&#146;s son, that is, grandson (<I>daohitra</I> or <I>napta&#x301;</I>). <I>Daohitra</I> means <I>duhita&#x301;</I> &#146;s <I></I>[daughter&#146;s] son. The word <I>daohitra</I> has been in use since ancient times. In Sindhi and Punjabi, two languages of West India, containing a large number of words derived from Vedic Sanskrit, the daughter&#146;s son is called <I>dohatara</I> or <I>dohatara&#x301;</I>, derived from the word <I>daohitra</I>. In the remaining parts of North India the daughter&#146;s son is called <I>na&#x301;ti</I>, coming from <I>napta&#x301;</I>. The etymological meaning of the word <I>napta&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;one who prevents downfall&rdquo;, that is, in the absence of the son (<I>puttra</I>: <I></I>one who saves a person from hell is known as <I>put</I>, so two <I>t</I>&#146;s must be retained in the spelling of <I>puttra</I>), the grandson or <I>daohitra</I> was considered eligible to perform the funeral rites. In the present matriarchal and quasi-matriarchal family systems, the daughter&#146;s son is also eligible to perform the funeral rites. One who saves one&#146;s maternal grandfather from downfall by performing the funeral rites is <I>napta&#x301;</I>. Since in ancient times barbers used to help in the performance of funeral rites, one of the words for &ldquo;barber&rdquo; is also <I>napta&#x301;</I>. The word <I>na&#x301;pita</I> [barber] in spoken Bengali comes from <I>napta&#x301;</I>. The words <I>napta&#x301;</I> and <I>na&#x301;pita</I> have almost identical meanings. In modern Bengali the son&#146;s son is also called <I>na&#x301;ti</I>. However the <I>tadbhava</I> word [Sanskrit-derived <I></I>descendant] for &ldquo;son&#146;s son,&rdquo; <I></I>that is, <I>paottra</I>, (<I>paottra &gt; paotta &gt; pota&#x301;: potha&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;scrotum&rdquo;) is <I>pota&#x301;</I>. In North India the word <I>pota&#x301;</I> is used. So one meaning of <I>kutapa</I> is <I>daohitra</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph --><li>The third meaning of <I>kutapa</I> is &ldquo;receding period of time&rdquo;. When it is nine o&#146;clock and somebody asks you what time it is, you reply, &ldquo;It is nine o&#146;clock.&rdquo; By the time you utter the last sound &ldquo;ock&rdquo; it is already a few moments past nine, that is, at that moment nine is already in the past. Similarly, by the time a bell announcing nine o&#146;clock rings for the ninth time, it is certainly a few seconds past nine. That is why the convention in earlier times was that when announcing a particular hour, an additional eight seconds were allowed for the announcement period, that is, here a period of eight seconds would be added to nine as additional time. This additional time was called <I>kutapa</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><p>According to the great sage Maharshi Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da, the first propounder of the atomic theory, instead of fixing only eight seconds for this, the time that is actually spent on the announcement, or expected to be spent, should be regarded as <I>kutapa</I>. This period of time can be less than eight seconds, exactly eight seconds or even a little more. Even though Maharshi Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da&#146;s assertion is logical, it would not be proper to allow an indefinite period of time to indicate a particular hour. So it would be best to continue observing the tradition of adding eight seconds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph --><li>Everywhere at approximately noon the sun is in the middle of the sky. After twelve the sun declines towards the west. As the sun declines towards the west the heat radiated by the sun lessens. One of the meanings of the word <I>ku</I> is &ldquo;to decrease gradually&rdquo;. So from noon onwards one name of the sun is <I>kutapa (kutapah)</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph --><li>That person who can come or go at any time, regardless of whether the sun is <I>tapah</I> (before twelve), <I>kutapah</I> (from twelve to sunset) or <I>atapah</I> (the absence of the sun in the sky, i.e. night), that is, that person who disregards <I>tithi</I> [day], is called <I>a-tithi</I> [guest].

Suppose somebody gives you <I>led&#x301;ikeni</I> [a kind of milk-sweet] to eat. You could well understand before you eat it that it is something delicious. While you understand that it is something delicious before eating it, you cannot determine what its name is; whether it is <I>led&#x301;ikeni</I>, <I>pantua&#x301;</I> or <I>cha&#x301;na&#x301;bar&#x301;a</I> [varieties of similar sweets]. Nor do you know how it is prepared. If you learn about it after eating it, then you might not relish the taste as much as you might have had you known beforehand, nor might you take as long to eat it. You might even think that had I known beforehand, I would have taken a little longer to enjoy it. Then when you come to know that it is made from milk curds &ndash; some ground milk curds [cheese] mixed together with semolina and then mixed with the remaining milk curds &ndash; it becomes all the more delicious. Then if the same preparation is fried in ghee, kept warm and then soaked in warm sugar syrup, its name would be <I>led&#x301;ikeni</I>. Once when Lord Canning came to Kolkata the Bengal government arranged for some famous confectioners to prepare this sweet in order to please the palate of this dignitary. It was given the name &ldquo;Lady Canning&rdquo; in honour of Mrs. Canning. Today it has become <I>led&#x301;ikeni</I> in Bengali, <I>lat&#x301;kanii</I> in Hindi (it is a feminine word; i.e., <I>lat&#x301;kaniya&#x301;n&#x32D; biik rahii hai</I> [<I>lat&#x301;kaniya&#x301;s</I> are on sale])<I></I>. After hearing this, one feels eager to know how it tasted. You should also take your time to enjoy it. Thus you will feel some curiosity to get to know this sweet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Now you may have heard that when dried sweetened condensed milk (<I>ks&#x301;iira</I>) is ground and mixed with milk curds along with some rice powder, its name is <I>pa&#x301;ntua&#x301;</I>. Since it has comparatively more semolina, there is a hint of aristocracy in the flavour and scent of <I>pa&#x301;ntua&#x301;</I>. <I>Pa&#x301;ntua&#x301;</I> should have some syrup inside, but it will not be dripping wet or thoroughly soaked. <I>Pa&#x301;nii</I> means water; <I>toya</I> also means water. But both <I>pa&#x301;nii</I> and <I>toya</I> would be speechless to see the <I>pantua&#x301;</I>&#146;s syrupy water. Thus the confectioners of Bengal towards the end of the Mughal era gave it the name <I>pa&#x301;niitoya</I>. That <I>pa&#x301;niitoya</I> has today become <I>pa&#x301;ntua&#x301;</I>. So it is only natural that you have a sweet curiosity or <I>kutuka</I> to know that <I>pa&#x301;niitoya</I>!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->When the capital of Bengal was transferred from Dacca to Murshidabad towards the end of the Mughal era, the best confectioners there, by order of the Nawab, prepared a milk- curd sweet and gave it the name <I>cha&#x301;na&#x301;bar&#x301;a</I>, and by doing so gave Lalbagh a place in history. Its specialty with respect to other sweets is that it is prepared from fresh, light cow&#146;s milk curds. If it is prepared in good ghee, then it can be made very large. It is said that in olden times, a confectioner in Bahrampur prepared a <I>cha&#x301;na&#x301;bar&#x301;a&#x301;</I> which weighed almost forty kilos. If true it would be rather amazing. So you must naturally have a sweet <I>kutuka</I> to know all about <I>cha&#x301;na&#x301;bar&#x301;a&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Now if you find that the shape of the sweet is elongated, with rice powder mixed with the milk curds, but heated so that it absorbs sufficient syrup, much of which will come out if pressed, and the taste lingers in the mouth for a long time; for example, the <I>lya&#x301;m&#x301;ca&#x301;</I> of Sha&#x301;ktigar&#x301;a (many people mistakenly pronounce Burdwan&#146;s Sha&#x301;ktigar&#x301;a as Shaktigar&#x301;a), then it is only natural that you will be interested in knowing all about <I>lya&#x301;m&#x301;ca&#x301;</I> also.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Talking about the meaning of <I>kutu&#x301;hala</I> reminds me of an incident that happened long ago.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->It was long ago, towards the end of British rule. One evening I went for a walk towards the hills. I was walking rather quickly. Suddenly I felt somebody walking behind me even faster. I ignored it. I did not look back.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->Then I heard someone saying several times in a loud voice: &ldquo;What a rascal, this Hiran&#x301;akashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d, Hiran&#x301;yakashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->I turned back to find a familiar face, Viru da of Monghyr, Viru Roy. But once again I turned away.

<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Yes, your guess is correct. Have I not told you that story of Krishnagar? One night a certain inveterate drunkard who had finished off an enormous <I>kutu&#x301;</I> [bottle] fell in the gutter and was rolling around until he became senseless, exactly when no one knows. This memorable event of that night is not today a part of recorded history. Then dawn broke. The touch of the cold morning breeze and the cold water of the gutter sobered him. He opened his eyes and saw a large gathering of people around him. Someone was saying, &ldquo;Oh, the fellow is dead!&rdquo; Someone else was saying, &ldquo;He drank so heavily that he passed out.&rdquo; Yet another person was saying, &ldquo;The fellow may not be drunk at all; it might be some other malady.&rdquo; The drunkard was listening to everything, but out of shame he kept his eyes closed. Still, how long can one remain like that? One has to shake it off and get up. And so he had to open his eyes. As chance would have it, the moment he opened his eyes and looked at the crowd, he saw his son&#146;s father-in-law standing directly in front of him. Then without any embarrassment at all, he said [to son&#146;s father-in-law]: &ldquo;Brother, it is not that what you think. It is my epilepsy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, I was thinking what I was thinking about Viru Roy. Viru Roy was saying: &ldquo;What a rascal, this Hiran&#x301;akashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d, Hiran&#x301;yakashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->So, as I was saying, it was towards the end of British rule. As far as we know, in the Vedic age there was a tendency towards alcoholism. Perhaps even certain sages and saints also were also not immune to its influence. There was a great demand for bottles full of wine in the wine-seller&#146;s shop [<I>shaon&#x301;d&#x301;ika</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->]. This influence of the Vedic age continued into the pre-Buddhist period, and, it can be surmised, somewhat increased. During wartime, the king, bureaucrats and landlords of Magadha drank plenty of alcohol. Buddha reined in this behavoiur. He was concerned lest the good taste and refinements of society be washed away by alcohol addiction. Buddha spoke out against alcohol consumption. History shows that it was Buddha who directly opposed the consumption of alcohol in an outspoken manner. Buddha did not turn his attention to social reform. Had he done so, it would have been a very happy combination &ndash; <I>sone men&#x32D; sugandh</I> [adding perfume to gold]. Still, owing to the influence of Buddha&#146;s ethical doctrine there was a significant decrease in alcohol addiction, prostitution and gambling in social life. When people from other countries arrived in Sri Lanka for the first time, they were amazed to see the moral standard of the Sri Lankan Buddhist population. There was hardly any alcohol addiction, no visible prostitution and no gambling in their social life. Any rational person is forced to admit the fact that Buddha created an impetus toward morality in the psyche of the people of the world; however, it is not enough to propagate morality in the society. It also requires persons capable of tightly holding the reins of morality and keeping them under control. If there are no restraints in social life then morality flashes and disappears like lightning; it will not last. This is exactly what happened during the Buddhist era. Towards the end of that era, pollution crept into the Buddhist Tantric <I>va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</I> and <I>kula&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</I>, complete darkness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->When the Puranic religion (Brahminical religion) arose in the country, it did not make any attempt to stop the flow of alcohol. Royalty drank freely and that had an influence on their subjects. By then the Jain and Buddhist ethical doctrines had become extremely weak. There was not much heard about the impact of alcoholism among emperors during the Pathan era, but there was no effort to control alcoholic addiction in public life. The great souls who appeared in India towards the end of the Pathan era were people of the highest standard, but while none of them supported drinking, some were silent on the subject and others spoke very little about it. No one dealt a heavy blow to the consumption of alcohol. However, all of them strove to keep the society healthy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->Alcohol addiction decreased significantly in public life in ancient Bengal due to the impact of Maha&#x301;prabhu Caitanyadeva. Even today drinking in the Bengali Vais&#x301;n&#x301;ava community is not only disliked but in fact detasted. Drinking is condemned in the Muslin community on religious grounds. If any Vais&#x301;n&#x301;ava or Muslim is addicted to drinking, then he or she loses all social prestige. It is worth noting that in those places in Bengal where there is a strong Vais&#x301;n&#x301;ava or Muslim influence in social life, raw sugar is prepared from the date palm and palm tree, while in those areas where their influence is non-existence or relatively little the people prepare toddy from these palms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The first influx of western civilization into India began approximately four hundred years ago. The western social outlook and lifestyle have been both beneficial and harmful for India. No doubt the benefit has been greater. But one of the negative effects is that it has led to an increase in alcohol addiction. Since the time of the Portuguese, different types of liquor have been manufactured and imported. Alcohol has gradually spread into the different strata of social life. Many poor and middle-class families have been washed away in a flood of alcohol, burnt to ashes in the fire of alcohol.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->In pre-British India, the city police chief could take action against anyone if they were found inebriated in public, but that system went out of vogue after the Mughal period. Many Mughal emperors and kings were addicted to alcohol. Seeing them alcohol addiction increased among the upper classes. Drinking became a status symbol. This tradition continued during British rule. Rather than decreasing, alcohol addiction has increased after independence &ndash; there is no one whatsoever to curb it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->So, as I was saying, it seemed that Viru Roy was in an unnatural state. Viru Ray, I felt Viru Roy draw close to me. He was saying: &ldquo;What a rascal this Hiran&#x301;yakashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d, Hiran&#x301;yakashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->I assumed that there was singing and dancing throughout the night in the Sahibs&#146; club. Viru Roy was the manager of that club. There must have been some dregs left in the bottom of each bottle. Viru Roy must have poured the dregs of a hundred bottles into five bottles and drunk them off. Still I asked him, &ldquo;O Viruda, who have you found for Hiran&#x301;yakashipu, and who for Pella&#x301;d? Oh I know, the sola hat on your head is Pella&#x301;d. I have been seeing for the last five years that it neither grows nor decays.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  There was a time when very high quality milk was available in the village in great quantities. The sahibs of our area used to visit this place to buy good milk and eat good yoghurt. They used to say, &ldquo;The milk in this village is very nice.&rdquo; Since the sahibs called it &ldquo;milk&rdquo;, the name of the village eventually became Milkichowk. Long ago the people of the villages of Aun&#x32D;gadesha used to give me yoghurt and dry condensed milk which they carried packed in a cloth. Even in those days the yoghurt of that place was so thick; its taste was exquisite and it was mixed with the essence of love.</p>
