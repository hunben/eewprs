<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Although the field was not that large it wasn&#146;t small either, that is, sound from one end would not reach the other. On the far eastern border of this field lay a row of hills. Though now those hills may not have particularly much overgrowth, at the time I&#146;m speaking of there was quite a jungle, and plenty of wild animals too. At the field&#146;s northern boundary was a military encampment. In winter, various kinds of military training would take place there, while at other times there was nothing at all. At the field&#146;s western boundary was a sports ground, and along the southern side a medium-sized lake. Today&#146;s events pertain to the field and the hills.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It was a long time ago. My age then could not have been more than sixteen or seventeen. I was not exactly what you might call sociable at that time (of course, I&#146;m not sure whether or not I am now either). In those days, my regular routine in the late afternoon was to walk around this field three times, then sit down for a while on one side, walk around it once more and return home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->That was the period of British rule. For ease of travel they had constructed a beautiful road surrounding the field, and alongside the road were plenty of large benches with inclined backs. There was a slight drizzle towards the end of the afternoon that day. Disregarding such scanty rain I went out for a stroll as per my usual habit. As on other days, that day also I sat down on a bench after three rounds of the field. The bench was on the border of the field with the pond just behind it. Just to the right was the base of a hill, and ahead across the field was that abandoned military encampment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->I was sitting down. Right behind me was the road encircling the field, across which was a massive tree. From beyond that could be heard the gentle lapping of the lake&#146;s water. The place was of course a bit frightening. After sunset no one would really come this direction alone, and if so, even the foolhardy would get the shivers. The tree behind was extremely large &ndash; a variety of daetya. Some days ago a washerwoman had drowned and died at this place, and after that, I had heard her husband seemed to have strung a noose around a branch of this tree and hanged himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->I was sitting alone. It had rained a little while ago. A sweet breeze was gently blowing from the direction of the lake. I was feeling quite relaxed&#8230; a sleepy daze had crept over my eyes as well. Suddenly I noticed that something largish seemed to be descending from the tree. I figured it must be some kind of monkey. In the trees on that side I had seen lots of monkeys during the day, and so maybe they were swinging about. No, it didn&#146;t seem quite like a monkey &ndash; something else. I continued to look back&#8230; something heavy and dark was descending. Having climbed some distance towards the bottom, that strange thing leaped down from the tree. I gazed at a strange, dark, long-bodied human-like figure. It was difficult to decide whether to call it human or demon.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Startled and bewildered, I gazed at it transfixed. A moment later I gathered my courage and asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; No reply. I asked &ldquo;Who are you&rdquo; in nearly every language that I knew. I did not get any reply. It was staring at me, standing motionless. I started shivering. Next I saw it slowly start forward in my direction &ndash; such a strange gait, such a strange gaze! My transfixed eyes did not blink at all. It was coming close&#8230; closer&#8230; even closer. What is this? &ndash; now he is beckoning me with his finger to follow him! I became really anxious. Slowly, I got up, then walked forward in his direction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->He was walking towards the hill, and I followed behind him. He climbed up the hill, and I also climbed up. The terror of silence pervaded all around. What is this? &ndash; someone seemed to be lurking behind each boulder on every side. But where &ndash; I could not see anyone at all! From behind the boulders voices seemed to laugh out in unison&#8230; Not laughter, a raucous cackle &ndash; ha ha ha! Floating on the wind, that sound dispersed everywhere, stirring the lake&#146;s shadowy water and setting leaves trembling. A shiver arose in night&#146;s dark body. Echoing off the adjacent hill, that sound again wafted to my ears &ndash; ha ha ha!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->He was walking ahead, and I was following right behind. After travelling a great distance we had nearly reached the Ka&#x301;lii temple on top of the hill. Then I saw someone coming from the opposite direction. He was not so fearsome as the earlier strange being. Light-complexioned, calm and peaceful-looking &ndash; a sannya&#x301;sii with matted hair. He said to the fearsome person, &ldquo;Why did you bring him? Why are you troubling such a little boy so late at night?&rdquo; Then looking at me he said, &ldquo;Go, my child, go home.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->I started back. After coming a little ways, it seemed like myriad thoughts were  taking on forms and rushing at me from all sides. It was unbearable! I started running. As I ran I hardly noticed when I had climbed down the hill and when I had crossed the field. After running close to a mile, I started up the overbridge near the station. Electric lights shined in my eyes and I came to my senses. Just then I happened into an old friend on the overbridge. He used to be a cashier in the British club. When there was a dance program at night, he would often have to go to the club at exceedingly late hours. That was the case today, and so he was on his way to the club. Seeing me he said, &ldquo;What? Where are you coming from so late at night?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->I said, &ldquo;Just taking a walk.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->He said, &ldquo;But now it&#146;s nearly midnight!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->I said, &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[Author&#146;s explanation:] <b>Pratisa&#x301;m&#x301;vedanika a&#x301;vesha</b> [Literally, &ldquo;Psycho-reactive self-hypnotism&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
