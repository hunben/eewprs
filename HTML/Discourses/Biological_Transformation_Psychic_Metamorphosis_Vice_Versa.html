<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Biological Transformation Associated with Psychic Metamorphosis and Vice Versa&rdquo;. This applies to the Macrocosm as much as to the microcosms. In the phase of extroversion, one Suprapsychic Entity is transmuted into many Prakrti-influenced physical entities: the Entity which was psychic is transmuted into numerous physicalities. In this connection the Vedas observe: Eko&#146;ham bahusya&#x301;ma &ndash; &ldquo;I am one but I shall become many.&rdquo; This &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is something psychic, an ectoplasmic vibration within or without the realm of the physical structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In this transformation of One into many, or rather in this phase of extroversion, numerous individual physical structures emerge from a singular vibration: thus this psychic Entity is gradually transformed into crude matter. Each and every fractional wave of the vast Cosmic Mind then takes the form of an individual animate or inanimate structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the phase of introversion, the reverse takes place: in this phase, individual microcosms move forward with the ideation of the Supreme One, and their multiplicities are transformed into the supreme unicity. As long as there are physicalities, there are material differences; but as these individual physicalities move towards the Supreme Goal, the final desideratum, their multiplicities rapidly decrease, and ultimately they are converted into one Supracosmic or Macrocosmic Entity. That is to say, the whole process of movement is from the state of unicity in the psychic arena to the multiplicities in the physical sphere, and vice versa. In the extroversial phase of expression [sain&#x32D;cara], the psychic One becomes physically many &ndash; the uni-psychic becomes multi-physical; and in the introversial phase [pratisain&#x32D;cara], multi-physical is transmuted into uni-psychic. This is the eternal sport (liila&#x301;) of Parama Purus&#x301;a [Supreme Consciousness].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the past, [many] millions of years ago, living beings came onto this earth. In those early days in the Tertiary Age and especially in the Cretarian [Cretaceous] Age, there were many gigantic animals and plants; (human beings did not appear until approximately one million years ago). Those huge trees and animals possessed very simple living cells without much complexity; most of the cells were only of one type. There are some trees even now which have the same kind of simple cells, for example ferns, to which I have given the Sanskrit name pura&#x301;n&#x301;ika&#x301;. These types of plants were multi-cellular, but their protozoic structure was uniform in character; the same was the case with some other living beings also. For example, there were gigantic animals like dinosaurs, brontosaurus, kakt&#x301;esiya&#x301;s, etc., which possessed very simple physical structures: the number of cells in their body was great, but the degree of intercellular difference was almost negligible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->These creatures underwent changes according to changes in time, space and person, according to changes in climatic conditions &ndash; not only on this earth but also on other planets which are inhabited by living beings. Suddenly, between one age and the next, there occurred an abnormal situation created by an ice age, when the temperature fell far below zero degrees. During that ice age, whether long or short, the animals went into hibernation. Many of them became extinct and disappeared after hibernation; because of their intellectual deficiency those gigantic creatures of the Cretarian [Cretaceous] Age had to leave the world &ndash; they were vanquished in the struggle for existence. But those creatures which did survive underwent physical changes, and also psycho-physical or bio-psychic changes. The complexity of their cells increased and their bodies gradually became smaller, and eventually their mental power also increased. That is, the physical body first became very big, and after attaining a particular shape, the structure became complicated or complex; and from that moment, in the next stage or phase, as they moved along the path of introversion towards the Supreme Desideratum, their physical body went on diminishing in size and their psychic body was strengthened &ndash; their intellect increased. This is the adjustment or equilibrium or equipoise between biological structures and psychic metamorphosis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->For example, huge reptiles which came onto this earth [millions of] years ago gradually became lizards, crocodiles, alligators and salamanders. Another huge creature which gradually developed into a smaller size was the mammoth which evolved into an elephant; but it did not become an elephant overnight &ndash; there was an intermediary stage between the mammoth and the elephant. Thus big animals became extinct, and in their place small animals appeared. (Once I said that this is not the age of small countries or big animals. Big animals will have to yield their place to the small; and small countries will have to join together in federations and confederations, or else scientific planning and development will not be possible.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Thus in the gradual process of evolution we can observe that the crude physicality of creatures is being converted into subtlety &ndash; their physical strength is fast being metamorphosed into psychic vitality &ndash; and materiality is being converted into consciousness. Similarly, it can be understood that the undeveloped creatures of the present, in whom this physical aspect is all-important, will gradually be transformed in the phase of pratisain&#x32D;cara into more subtle mental beings; gradually their physical aspect will decrease and the psychic aspect will become predominant. This will be true of plants also. As there is increased complexity in the psychic sphere, there will be a corresponding increase of complexity in the physical sphere, as these two are inseparable and must maintain adjustment with each other. In this way the whole universe will gradually become predominantly mental. We see before our very eyes that the gigantic animals of the hoary past, which were undeveloped in intellect, consequently became extinct. Human beings, too, will gradually become totally transformed into completely different creatures: their psychic development will greatly increase, and they will engage themselves in the pursuit of higher knowledge and more and more psycho-spiritual pursuits.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In this process, psycho-physical adjustment will create a great change in the physical body also. For example, the skin of the ancient creatures was very thick, for with this thick skin they used to resist the cold. During the ice age only those creatures with thick skin could survive. The early humans had less hair on their bodies; but the more they evolved psychically, their skin became thinner and the amount of hair increased. Buffaloes are the same as they were in the prehistoric age &ndash; they have no sense of responsibility. If while pulling a cart they happen to pass by a pond of water, they will plunge straight into the pool dragging the cart behind. Cows, on the other hand, have developed somewhat psychically and are more intelligent than buffaloes. The skin of buffaloes is very thick and the amount of hair on their bodies is less, but the skin of cows is thin and there is more hair on their bodies. This indicates that they are comparatively evolved. So the change in the psychic sphere brings about a corresponding change in the physical sphere as well. And thus in the process of evolution at present, living beings are more physical than psychic, but in the future they will become more psychic than physical. Now the element of physicality is predominant, but in future the psychic element will become predominant and the physical aspect will become secondary. All the ectoplasmic and endoplasmic potentialities of the entire creation are fast being converted into psychic potentialities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->So in this phase of introversial movement, when crude physicality is being transmuted into psychic, we can expect that the day is sure to come when the whole world will move from the subtle psychic realm and cross the threshold of the still more subtle spiritual world. And that day when the entire living world &ndash; dashing through a transitory phase of psychic &ndash; will become spiritual will not be in the distant future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The eternal game (liila&#x301;) of Parama Purus&#x301;a is in process (when we do not know the cause of something we call it liila&#x301; and when we discover the cause we call it kriid&#x301;a&#x301;); and due to this eternal game of Parama Purus&#x301;a, matter is converted into mind, and mind into consciousness, and finally unit consciousness into Supreme Consciousness. That is, first the One becomes many and then the many ultimately become One. Parama Purus&#x301;a certainly showers His grace upon the microcosmic beings, because they have all emerged from His Macrocosmic thought-waves. And in the final stage of His Cosmic thought-waves, He absorbs all the individual microcosms into His vast Macrocosmic body. The microcosms emerge from Him and finally merge back into Him.<!-- /block --></p>

Just think, if you were alone in this universe, it would not be possible for you to live &ndash; you would become mad. Is it not so? When you remain together with all your friends and relatives, how joyful you feel! Suppose you meet someone after two months or two years, you say, &ldquo;How are you? What&#146;s the news? I saw you three years ago at Vaesha&#x301;khii Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301; DMC [a spiritual congregation]!&rdquo; In this way you talk among yourselves. And do you not offer liit&#x301;i [an Indian delicacy] to each other at that time, saying, &ldquo;Come, sit, let&#146;s have some liit&#x301;i!&rdquo; Had you been alone, how difficult it would have been!

<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->My Parama Purus&#x301;a was alone &ndash; just imagine what great trouble He had to undergo! He had the capacity to see everything but there was nothing to be seen. One can see only if there is a second entity, but in that phase of creation there was no second entity to be seen. Who was there for Him to scold? &ndash; &ldquo;Why is your out-turn not satisfactory? Give your word that from now on you will work satisfactorily!&rdquo; To whom could He thus speak if there was no second entity to talk to? So Parama Purus&#x301;a thought to Himself, &ldquo;Now I am alone, but I will become many.&rdquo; Parama Purus&#x301;a wants an ever-increasing family so He can play with His dear children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->So your future is bright &ndash; not only bright, but guaranteed. A new spiritual life free from all sorts of dogma is sure to come in the near future. In this phase of introversion, in this eternal game of Parama Purus&#x301;a in which the physical, psychic and spiritual entities are all moving forward, one day the mental realm will be elevated to the spiritual, and unit consciousness will become one with Cosmic Consciousness. Parama Purus&#x301;a is also waiting for that auspicious day. He is with you &ndash; He will give you proper direction so that with His gospels for the salvation of the universal creation, you will reach your goal without much difficulty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->He will do what is necessary. You just go on obeying Him, just go on doing His work and adhere to what He says with all your energy. Let the speed of His introversial thinking be accelerated by your noble actions and by your spiritual pursuits. Let that golden day come at the earliest and make your life effulgent.<!-- /block --></p>
