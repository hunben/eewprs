<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->We shall discuss one of the shlokas [couplets] of the Giita&#x301; today. This particular shloka may be taken as the guiding or controlling shloka of the Giita&#x301;. We will deal with the subject rather elaborately. Here is the shloka &ndash; Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra uva&#x301;ca [&ldquo;Dhritarastra said&rdquo;]:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Dharmaks&#x301;etre Kuruks&#x301;etre samaveta&#x301; yuyutsavah;<br>Ma&#x301;maka&#x301;h Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avashcaeva kimakurvata Sain&#x32D;jaya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[&ldquo;O Sanjaya, now that my children and the children of Pandu have gathered on the battlefield of Dharmaks&#x301;etra, of Kuruks&#x301;etra, eager to fight, what is taking place?&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This is the first shloka of the Giita&#x301;, about which I have spoken to you before. Today I will give you only an introduction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The name of the book is the Giita&#x301;. The root verb gae means &ldquo;to sing&rdquo;. Hence Giita&#x301; means &ldquo;that which has been sung&rdquo;. It is in the passive voice. But the passive voice always carries a sense of something remaining inarticulate in the statement. So it becomes necessary to make that implicit idea explicit. Something has been sung. Who then has sung it? Ya&#x301; Bhagavata&#x301; giita&#x301;, sa&#x301; Giita&#x301; [&ldquo;That which has been sung by Bhagava&#x301;n, the Lord, is the Giita&#x301;&rdquo;]. In this case, since that which has been sung by Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is the Giita&#x301;, Bhagavata&#x301; means Krs&#x301;n&#x301;ena, &ldquo;by Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. Who then is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? That also should be explained in this introduction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Three Interpretations<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word krs&#x301;n&#x301;a has three different interpretations. The word can be derived from the root verb, one of  the meanings of which is &ldquo;to attract&rdquo;, &ldquo;to draw everything to one&#146;s self&rdquo;. The root verb krs&#x301; plus na gives us &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;; that is to say, the being which attracts everything of the universe towards its own self, calling out: &ldquo;Come, come&#8230; come to me&#8230; you have nothing to worry about&#8230; come to me. I am your shelter. I will save you from all dangers. There is nothing to be afraid of, nothing to fear; I am here.&rdquo; The speaker of these words, who is attracting everybody towards Himself, is indeed Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Our mind does not want to go to Him, but even then it runs towards Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->A Vaishnavite poet had this to say:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Uca&#x301;t&#x301;ana mana na&#x301; ma&#x301;ne va&#x301;ran&#x301;a,<br>Shudhu ta&#x301;ri pa&#x301;ne chut&#x301;e ya&#x301;y.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->[The restless mind defies restrictions, and runs only after Him.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->I do not have a mind to go to or to look at Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but even then, it is as if something keeps pulling me. Thus the word &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; means &ldquo;the supreme attractive faculty&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Again, krs&#x301;n&#x301;a has the meaning &ldquo;black&rdquo;. The colour black has the greatest attraction for human mind. Among all colours, our attention is drawn first by black. This is the reason why the colour black is called krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. It should be remembered, however, that the complexion of the historical Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a who lived in Dva&#x301;para Yuga<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> was not black.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->There is also a third meaning of &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; krs&#x301;i bhu&#x301;h or krs&#x301;ibhu&#x301;h. The root verb krs&#x301; means the feeling &ldquo;I am&rdquo;. Don&#146;t you all have a feeling such as this, &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;? In fact every individual has the feeling &ldquo;I am&rdquo;, mya&#x301;y hun, aham&#x301; asmi. Whenever that &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is struck a blow, people get irritated, worried, angry or frightened. Now this feeling &ldquo;I am&rdquo; [is represented by] the root verb krs&#x301;, and the meaning of the root verb bhu&#x301; is &ldquo;to be&rdquo;. Hence the meaning of the word &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; is &ldquo;I am because He is.&rdquo; In other words, it is only because of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a that the world exists and living beings exist. If Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had not been there, living beings and the world would not have been there either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is Parama Purus&#x301;a. In the absence of Parama Purus&#x301;a, neither living beings nor the universe would have existed at all. The world is, only because He is. That is why He is called &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. My individual existence is dependent on His existence. For instance, because Bengal is there, Calcutta is there. The existence of Calcutta as an entity is dependent on the existence of Bengal. Hence it may well be said that Bengal is the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of Calcutta. Similarly, because India is there, Bengal is there. Thus India is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to Bengal. Or, because Asia is there, India is there. Thus Asia is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to India. And because the world is there, Asia is there. So the world is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to Asia. Then there is the solar system with the sun, the planets and the satellites &ndash; because it is there, our little world is there. Thus the solar system is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to the world. And because Parama Purus&#x301;a is there, this solar system, the planets and satellites, stars and nebulae, and the milky way &ndash; all of these entities are there. Hence Parama Purus&#x301;a is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to the entire universe. This is the third meaning of &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. Krs&#x301;ibhu&#x301;h &ndash; the existence of the root verb bhu&#x301;h dependent on the existence of the root verb krs&#x301;; that is, one existence dependent on another existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->About 3500 years ago, in Dva&#x301;para Yuga, a great personality was born in Mathura. His father&#146;s name was Vasudeva. Because He was a son of Vasudeva, one of his names was Va&#x301;sudeva. One of his uncles was Nanda, whose profession was cattle-rearing, and his father Vasudeva was a superintendent of jails in Mathura. One elder brother of his father was Maharshi Garga. When the child was born, Maharshi Garga noticed in him a number of extraordinary qualities, and after much thinking and cogitation, christened him &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. The Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a whom we will discuss, that is, the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the Giita&#x301;, is this Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of Dva&#x301;para Yuga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->I will continue with an analysis of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s three roles simultaneously, in order to demonstrate that ultimately they all coincide at a certain point and that the three Krs&#x301;n&#x301;as are one and the same. As you know, Narottama Das Thakur composed As&#x301;t&#x301;ottar Shatana&#x301;m [&ldquo;The One Hundred Eight Names&rdquo;] of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. In one place he says:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Ananta ra&#x301;khila na&#x301;m anta na&#x301; pa&#x301;iya&#x301;;<br>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a na&#x301;m ra&#x301;khen Garga dhya&#x301;nete ja&#x301;niya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[Failing to find any limit, Garga named the baby &ldquo;Ananta&rdquo; (&ldquo;Limitless&rdquo;); and, enlightened by his meditation, gave Him the name &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;.]<!-- /block --></p>
