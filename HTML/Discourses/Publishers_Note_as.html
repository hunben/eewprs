<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti, the founder of Ananda Marga, dictated the original Bengali A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram to a close devotee as they sat, in a series of night sessions in 1961, on the tiger&#146;s grave in Jamalpur that A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rtijii and the devotees used to frequent. The devotee wrote by the light of a candle. Sometimes the candle flame was sheltered by a glass drinking tumbler as a sort of makeshift lantern.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram means, in part, &ldquo;aphorisms leading to a&#x301;nanda, divine bliss&rdquo;. The su&#x301;tra form has been valued over the centuries as a powerful tool for communicating a deep philosophy in a condensed, memorable way. The literal meaning of su&#x301;tra is &ldquo;thread&rdquo;, implying that numerous jewels of thought can be strung on a single such thread. In the best traditions of su&#x301;tra literature, the eighty-five su&#x301;tras of this book serve, with breathtaking conciseness, as a framework for the entire Ananda Marga ideology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Herein Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti has in a few vivid strokes presented humanity with original concepts of metaphysics, epistemology, ethics and macrohistory. He has set out for the first time a socio-economic approach conceived in the light of a theistic philosophy, blending subjective approach with objective adjustment, that offers the world a well-knit and progressive social system based on economic justice. He designated A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram, together with the complementary book Idea and Ideology, as the darshan sha&#x301;stra (philosophical treatise) of Ananda Marga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram as a whole has appeared heretofore in English in only one edition, the 1967 translation by Shrii Manohar Gupta (reprinted virtually unedited in 1990). Chapter 4 was reprinted in Discourses on Tantra Volume 1, 1993, and a retranslated Chapter 5 appeared in Proutist Economics, 1992.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The editors of the present edition have not striven to retranslate, but have edited the First Edition (or in the case of Chapter 5 the 1992 edition) according to a number of considerations important for the reader.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The editors of this edition have, in the first place, tried to adhere more closely to the author&#146;s pattern of usage of important Sanskrit terms, by preserving those terms in the main text of the translation, while sometimes relegating the English equivalents to editorial square brackets.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The editors have also tried to eliminate the unnecessary repetition of pairs of Sanskrit-English equivalents.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The remaining considerations guiding the editors have been those of grammar, where correction was unavoidable, and consistency &ndash; consistency, for example, in the use or non-use of articles with various philosophical terms. In a very few instances in Chapters 1-3 it was found necessary to aim for greater accuracy by retranslating a sentence, for example the last sentence of Chapter 1. (In Chapters 4 and 5, which appeared in the recent compilations noted above, no retranslation has been done, except that in Chapter 5 the Sanskrit yuga has been rendered as &ldquo;age&rdquo; rather than the previous &ldquo;era&rdquo;. &ldquo;Age&rdquo; seems generally to have been the author&#146;s preference in English, as indicated in Idea and Ideology.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the editors have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Eds.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->To this edition the editors have added an appendix giving word-for-word translations of the su&#x301;tras. Avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; A&#x301;nanda Mitra&#x301; A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya&#x301; deserves special mention for having laid the foundations of this appendix years ago.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the appendix, a certain shorthand preferred by the author of this book has been used for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
