<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->We will discuss Tantra a little in relation to prapatti, viprapatti, and aprapatti. The original propounder of Tantra was Lord Sada&#x301;shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->From the viewpoint of geography, Tantra has two main divisions &ndash; one is the Bengal school of Tantra, the other is the Kashmir school of Tantra. The Bengal school is less ritualistic and more practical, while the Kashmir school is more ritualistic and less practical. And from the viewpoint of spiritual practice, Tantra has five main divisions: Shaeva Tantra, Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, Saora Tantra, and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra. It is said that Shaeva Tantra attaches more importance to the faculty of knowledge and to the elimination of caste and other social discriminations. Sha&#x301;kta Tantra lays greater stress on the attainment of power and its judicious application. Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra aspires to lead humanity towards Parama Purus&#x301;a through the cult of sweet, divine bliss, but there is less social consciousness. Saora Tantra places much importance on medical treatment and astronomical progress, and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra provides inspiration for people who are divided into different social groups to work unitedly.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Here I do not propose to say anything special about Shaeva or Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, but I must say something about Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra. It is said that Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra aspires to lead spiritual aspirants towards Parama Purus&#x301;a through the cult of blissful experiences. (If I ever say anything in the future regarding Saora Tantra, I will discuss it at great length and during that discussion I will point out that Saora Tantra was not only concerned with the sciences of medicine and astronomy. It was much more than that, especially in the Middle East and India about one thousand to three thousand years ago. However, in the present context this is irrelevant.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->While dealing with Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra [Vaishnavite Tantra], we notice that although it had its origin in India, more particularly in southern India, it was later significantly influenced by the Middle East. As a result, the modern Vaishnavism, or rather the Vaishnavism which was prevalent during the Mughal period, was greatly influenced by the Sufism of the Middle East.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Our topic of discussion is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and His life. During Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s lifetime, Sufism was not in vogue in the Middle East. The Vaishnavism of southern India, as enunciated in the Bha&#x301;gavata sha&#x301;stra &ndash; that is, the Shriimad Bha&#x301;gavata [of that sha&#x301;stra], not the Shriimad Bhagavad Giita&#x301; &ndash; came much later than Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The Dravidian Brahmans of southern India had not yet become clearly divided into two branches; later they were to become divided into the Ayengars and the Aiyars. (The Ayengars were Vaishnavites and the Aiyars were Shaivites. One could easily distinguish the Aiyars from the Ayengars by their distinct styles of decorating their foreheads with holy ash.) While the different classifications of Tantra could be found in those days, they were not very rigid or distinct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If the forward march towards Parama Purus&#x301;a through the cult of sweet, divine bliss is the basic spirit of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, then that spirit must have been reflected in both Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. This forward march can be effected only through prapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When a devotee advances through the cult of sweet devotion, he or she prefers to avoid the path of philosophical intricacies. Suppose you have been allotted a certain duty and you have to run hard to perform that duty. If you are offered some delicious sweets you will say, &ldquo;No thank you, not now. Let me run first, then I will take some rest and enjoy the sweets little by little with great pleasure.&rdquo; While running, one&#146;s mind remains at a high speed, tremendously preoccupied. That is why you cannot, at that speed, savour even delicious food. Similarly, when you advance in the cult of sweet devotion, you enjoy more and more sweetness. While advancing, you enjoy bliss at every step. Obviously, at that stage, you do not like the tormenting harshness of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->I have said several times prior to this that prapatti &ndash; that sweetness of divine ecstasy &ndash; was fully developed in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. But as I have also said, the karma yoga which is the hallmark of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is not opposed to prapatti. Now let us analyse whether the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na ma&#x301;rga [path of knowledge, or discrimination], as associated with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, is more consistent with the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na ma&#x301;rga of Shaivism or with the cult of sweet, divine bliss found in Vaishnavism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a demonstrated an enormous wealth of knowledge. All His teachings were based primarily on the cult of knowledge. He taught His philosophy to Arjuna, and it does not smack of negativism or escapism. According to Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, whatever takes place in this universe is designed by the Cosmic will. Nothing can happen without the Cosmic desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Jiivas are compelled to act under the impact of two personalities. One is the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; which craves to accumulate so many things, big or small, and to give so many things to society. The small &ldquo;I&rdquo; creates a world of its own centring around that little &ldquo;I&rdquo;, a world of illusion wherein the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; is entrapped and where it considers itself to be the supreme monarch. But simultaneously there is a larger world, the much larger world of Parama Purus&#x301;a, a world where the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; is a mere bubble. All the hopes and aspirations, all the desires and urges, of that insignificant bubble residing within the vast mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a, attain supreme fulfilment only at the time when it merges itself in the main stream of the Cosmic flow. Otherwise, individual hopes and desires remain forever unfulfilled and unrealized. Human beings cherish thousands of desires in their hearts, but those desires generally remain unfulfilled, because the waves of individual human desire do not maintain parallelism with the waves of the Cosmic desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->It was quite natural for Arjuna to hesitate in slaying His friends and relations on the battlefield. The Kaoravas were his dear kinsmen, and there were many other kings and vassals who were bound in ties of intimate friendship with Arjuna. He felt compassion for all his friends and relatives, but that love and compassion for his relatives and friends was something related to Arjuna&#146;s unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. It had no validity in the Cosmic world. Therefore Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a addressed and exhorted Arjuna in the following manner: &ldquo;Oh, Arjuna, don&#146;t think that you are killing anyone. No one ever kills or is ever killed. Weapons can never kill anyone.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Naenam&#x301; chindanti shastra&#x301;n&#x301;i naenam&#x301; dahati pa&#x301;vakah;<br>Na caenam&#x301; kledayantya&#x301;po na shos&#x301;ayati ma&#x301;rutah.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[Weapons cannot pierce him (the soul), fire cannot burn him, water cannot drench him, wind cannot dry him up.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Who are you to kill? You cannot do anything, for your existence is nothing but a tiny, insignificant bubble within the vast Macrocosm. As the vast Macrocosmic wave advances with its alternate troughs and crests, you move along with the wave, sometimes going up in the wave and sometimes down.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Patana-abhyudayabandhur pantha&#x301;<br>Yuga yuga dha&#x301;vita ya&#x301;trii.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->[Travellers have been moving unceasingly for ages along that high and rugged path of rise and fall.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So what will you do? Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s flow of imagination continues unceasingly. No one can resist that mighty flow of Cosmic imagination. It was erroneous for Arjuna to think that he himself was killing his dear kinsmen, the Kaoravas. Thus Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said: &ldquo;Things are already planned and predestined by Me. I have already planned everything out in My mind. You are just an instrument.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There are two things to note here. The first thing is that according to Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da [the Doctrine of Illusion], the very existence of the material world, though not altogether denied, is given little importance. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s teachings, however, are not actually Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da. In Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, the systaltic movement of the Macrocosm is not altogether accepted. Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dii philosophers argue that the universe is the magic of the miracle-creating Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;: aghat&#x301;ana ghat&#x301;ana pat&#x301;iiyasii Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; [&ldquo;the dexterous hand of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; that can even create things impossible to create&rdquo;]. &ldquo;Nothing is really happening, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is doing everything&rdquo; &ndash; it is strict monism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The second thing to note is that in the teachings of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, there may not be absolute prapatti at first; when Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a advanced so many philosophical arguments, it seemed to be viprapatti, just opposite to prapatti. However, when at the next stage He told Arjuna, &ldquo;I have already set everything in a pre-arranged plan, you are a mere tool in my hands,&rdquo; it was clearly aprapatti. Till then it had not been clearly stated that &ldquo;It is I who do everything. Everything takes place as per My wish. Your wish, your desire has no value.&rdquo; Finally this aprapatti became prapatti when He said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Different entities, different jiivas, are moving according to their respective inherent propensities, their inherent characteristics. &ldquo;Countless jiivas, countless entities, are moving around the Macrocosmic nucleus with their respective sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta]&rdquo; &ndash; Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe brhante tasmin ham&#x301;so bhra&#x301;myate Brahmacakre. &ldquo;This movement, this rotation, will continue until the different entities are able to realize their oneness with that Supreme Nucleus, until they realize the Supreme Entity&rdquo; &ndash; prthaga&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; prerita&#x301;rain&#x32D;ca matva&#x301; jus&#x301;t&#x301;astatastena&#x301;mrtatvameti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->When the jiivas come to know of the Supreme Entity around whom they are moving, the eternal urge to run after Him develops, and this is the stance of total prapatti, the final culmination of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Sarvadharma&#x301;n parityajya Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The innumerable jiivas, with their innumerable propensities and characteristics, are rushing along, but their movement is not always crowned with success. I have already said that progress in the physical and psychic spheres is not possible. Progress is possible only in the spiritual stratum. Sarvadharma&#x301;n means the various propensities or various instincts [of a human being], that is, the various fetters and enemies of the mind. The microcosms, with their numerous sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, are rushing along. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said to them: &ldquo;Stop running after your desires&rdquo;&#8230; Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja &ndash; &ldquo;Follow Me. Take Me as your final refuge. Come to Me and increase your love for Me.&rdquo; (Ananyamamata&#x301; Vis&#x301;n&#x301;ormamata&#x301; premasaun&#x32D;gata&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;Develop love and attachment for Me. Rush to Me, I am ready to receive you on My lap.&rdquo;) Vraja means &ldquo;to move in joy&rdquo;&#8230; Aham&#x301; tva&#x301;m&#x301; sarvapa&#x301;pebhyo moks&#x301;ayis&#x301;ya&#x301;mi ma&#x301; shucah &ndash; &ldquo;I will liberate you from all sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, all bondages. You need not worry at all about your spiritual progress.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The fact is, the more one advances towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, the more one becomes free from blemishes, the more one is cleansed of the dirt and dross of mundane life. Parama Purus&#x301;a lifts His devotees and places them on His lap. This can be considered the last word of the Giita&#x301;, the summum bonum, or goal, of human life. It is the final statement about the supreme human desideratum. Regarding the path of movement, many things are said, but regarding the goal the final word is this: &ldquo;Forgetting all other things, forgetting your desires and aspirations, come to Me.&rdquo; Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja &ndash; &ldquo;take shelter in Me.&rdquo; This is nothing but prapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Now, is there any difference between the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na of Shaivite philosophy and the prapatti of Vaishnavite philosophy? The Shaivite philosophical knowledge is hair-splitting knowledge which aspires to arrive at the goal through the conflicts and clashes arising from affirmation and negation, and through analysis of the law of cause and effect. On this path there is neither prapatti nor aprapatti. In the initial stage one makes use of viprapatti, but after reaching the goal, nothing remains, neither viprapatti nor prapatti nor aprapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->From the earliest times there existed differences of opinion between the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava scholars and the Shaeva scholars. This was an ideological conflict. And though Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s teaching [of prapatti] forms part of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, it is also resplendent in its own brilliance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Initially Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a led Arjuna along the path of discrimination, of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. (Here Arjuna represents the ordinary human being.) When He guided Arjuna along the path of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, it was known as viprapatti. Then He said [expressing aprapatti], &ldquo;It is I who do everything. You are doing nothing.&rdquo; (Actually, people have very little strength. If a person fasts for twenty-four hours, he or she feels fatigued. If a person fasts for forty-eight hours, he or she cannot think. How weak people are!) And in the third stage Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said to humanity, &ldquo;You need not worry about anything. I will do everything for you. Just move along your path and surrender to Me.&rdquo; Whatever hopes and desires people cherish in their hearts find fulfilment when they are in perfect accord with the blissful flow of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not do all this [i.e., did not base His actions on a progression of philosophies]. His magic flute sang only one note &ndash; the note of prapatti. &ldquo;What I do is done; nothing else is done. Remain with Me.&rdquo; The teachings of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a are the same, but the path of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and the path of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a have led humanity, have led spiritual aspirants, in two distinct directions. A sa&#x301;dhaka will act according to his or her respective inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras and will select either Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a or Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a as the only object of his or her adoration, as the only desideratum of all the marches of his or her life.<!-- /block --></p>
