<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is civilization? The subtle sense of refinement that we come across in the different expressions of life is called civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Let me give you an example. Suppose some guests have arrived at our home. We may address them imperatively, &ldquo;Come&rdquo; or we may welcome them by saying, &ldquo;Please come in.&rdquo; This polite address by adding the word &ldquo;please&rdquo; speaks of civilization or a civilized address, for herein the subtle sense of refinement is evident. The imperative word, &ldquo;come&rdquo;, bereft of warmth, only smacks of lack of culture. So we see there are both good and bad sides to culture, but the subtle sense of refinement is the touchstone of civilization. The subtle sense of refinement that we get in culture intrinsically imbibes the human power of discriminative judgement. We may call those human acts We may call those human acts and behaviours &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; that give evidence of this discriminative judgement, in a great measure. It is sometimes noticed in certain groups of people that their actions have the support of judgement, and then again in some others that there is an absence of it. If judgement were based merely on this basis, to call the former civilized and the latter half-civilized would not be fair or desirable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the Indian social system women have been given a motherly status, but in the practical field they are not given the same amount of prestige. Conversely, in the European society, though motherly status is nil, women certainly enjoy equal rights and prestige in the practical field. Now it is very hard to say which of the two is more civilized. But I would say, the greater the support of judgement in action and behaviour, the better shall be the expression and development of civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
