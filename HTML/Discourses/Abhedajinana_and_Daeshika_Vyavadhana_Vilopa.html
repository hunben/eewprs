<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Those who want to become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a must be free from spatial, temporal and personal bondages. But in the physical sphere the spatial factor shall exist; in the psychic sphere also there will remain some bondage; but in the spiritual sphere it is quite possible to remove all bondages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This expressed world is relative. One aspiring to be established in the Absolute must go beyond the scope of relativity. But the question is &ndash; how to do that?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->While doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the mind frequently runs after external things. It is very difficult to concentrate the mind, which is by nature restless, on a certain object or idea. Why is the mind fixed on a particular point in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? Because that point is the veritable link between the relative world and the Absolute; the point exists where the relative world ends and the Absolute begins. This point is representative of the Cosmic Entity. Once this point is controlled, the attainment of the highest state of spirituality becomes easy. To control this point means to be one with Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Therefore to come out from the scope of the relative world, one must concentrate on this point. One will surely continue to suffer in the sorrows and miseries of the relative world till one&#146;s mind becomes one-pointed.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What are the criteria of relativity? Wherever there are svaja&#x301;tiiya, vija&#x301;tiiya and svagata bheda (intra-specific, inter-specific and intra-structural differences), we shall call that entity relative. The moment these differences are removed, the relative entity merges into the Absolute.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><b>Vija&#x301;tiiya</b>: Suppose in an orchard there are various kinds of tree, such as mango trees, ja&#x301;m trees, jackfruit trees, etc. Though all are trees, the different trees are vija&#x301;tiiya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><b>Svaja&#x301;tiiya</b>: Suppose someone has gone to a garden of mango trees. He will see there are many varieties of mango hanging from the branches of various trees. (There are varieties of mango, such as lem&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;, fazli, Bomba&#x301;i, begunphuli, etc.) Though all are mangoes, difference in variety is svaja&#x301;tiiya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><b>Svagata</b>: When one looks at a mango tree, one will see that in the mango tree itself there are branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, etc. The tree is one, but even the one tree contains many parts, which are svagata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Whenever there are the above-mentioned differences, there is the relative world, and when the differences are no more, there is sa&#x301;marasya (equipoise). Sa&#x301;marasya may be established in the psychic and spiritual spheres but never in the physical sphere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Daeshika Vyavadha&#x301;na Vilopa<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;marasya may be established in the psychic sphere if one constantly takes the ideation of one dhyeya [object of ideation]. In that case one&#146;s mind comes in close proximity to the Cosmic Mind, and gradually with the covering of the inner gaps the two minds will become one. The spatial gap between the two minds has been removed, and at once the unit mind will go to the absolute world from the relative world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->This removal of the spatial gap in the psychic sphere depends solely upon the degree of keenness of one&#146;s desire to realize Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. To realize that Parama Purus&#x301;a, one need not look for the help of external objects &ndash; name and fame, wealth and power, etc. None of these can establish anybody in the spiritual stance. The only thing essential is one&#146;s unshaken faith in one&#146;s goal, and persistent efforts. That will please Parama Purus&#x301;a so much that He will most graciously lift the veil of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; from the jiiva [unit being] and make him or her free. Bhakti, or devotion, is the thing that counts in the spiritual sphere.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->[Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  touched the various cakras of a sa&#x301;dhaka (spiritual practitioner) and asked him whom he was seeing in each of his cakras. The sa&#x301;dhaka replied that in every cakra he was seeing only Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. When the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii shakti (latent divine force) reached the ana&#x301;hata cakra (fourth psycho-spiritual centre, or plexus, located at the mid-point of the chest), the sa&#x301;dhaka lost his outward consciousness. He could not sit erect any longer. Even then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; went on saying, &ldquo;Let the eyes not see anything external; let the ears not hear anything; let the nose not smell anything; let the tongue taste only parama rasa (divine taste); let the skin feel only the divine touch.&rdquo; By now the sa&#x301;dhaka had lost all his external activity; even his sensory organs had lost their powers. This physical world of ours lost its meaning and existence altogether to the sa&#x301;dhaka. He was then a man of a different world.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The ordinary human mind, bound by the shackles of ripus (enemies) and pa&#x301;shas (fetters) is drawn easily to the external world; a person&#146;s sensory and motor organs tempt the person to enjoy crude physicality, but they cannot help in spiritual realization. The real destination of human beings &ndash; the world of supreme beatitude &ndash; remains unknown to them. To reach there, the mind must be free from the influence of the indriyas;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> it must proceed towards the world of a&#x301;tma&#x301; [soul]. These very sense organs are the obstructions between the mind and the a&#x301;tma&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->That is why when sa&#x301;dhakas land in the world of spirituality beyond the scope of the sense organs, of course by the grace of guru or Brahma, they enjoy great bliss. Here there is no spatial gap between sa&#x301;dhaka and Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, between bhakta and Bhagava&#x301;n &ndash; they belong to the same world. There of course will be temporal and personal gaps. When these also are removed, one attains nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi. One need not depend upon external things to attain that stance; one is only required to develop kevala&#x301; bha&#x301;va [the feeling that only the Supreme Entity exists], and those who have it are really fortunate. They may be so-called untouchables and low-bred, but still, they are the fittest recipients for God&#146;s grace. Those who have not this love for God are wretched fellows, worse than animals, though they may be high-caste.<!-- /block --></p>
