<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[This discourse centred mainly on the idea that nothing in this expressed universe is to be depended on absolutely because there is nothing absolute. Only one Absolute Entity, who is the very nave of this entire universe, and eternal, is to be depended on absolutely. Absolute dependence should be only upon Him who can do anything and everything, who is omniscient. He does whatever He likes according to His whims. He is not to be guided by anyone&#146;s logic, reasonings and desires. How can He be expected to be guided by reasonings of beings who have been created by Him during His liila&#x301; (divine sport)?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; demonstrated how things can be seen by organs other than the eyes, namely, the skin, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and even without the help of any organ, if so desired by Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->He explained that actually the eyes, nose, ears, etc., are not the organs. They are only gateways through which different waves enter and activate the mind, and the mind starts seeing, smelling, hearing, etc. If the mind can be activated otherwise, the mind can perceive things even without the help of any organs. That can occur only if so desired by Him. Anything and everything can happen if He pleases. A man can be converted into a stone, a stone can be changed into a man. A man can be transformed into a woman or an animal and vice versa. But it is desirable that a stone should be transformed into a man and not vice versa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->If a man is transformed into a woman, then by gradual glandular change the man&#146;s body will be transformed into that of a woman. But if the man is converted into an animal, the man will die, because there is a vast difference between a human body and the body of an animal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Every bodiless mind has a light according to the reactive momenta it is carrying. If a particular person lends a bit of his own ectoplasmic stuff to that bodiless mind, it will get a form (mental body) according to its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta], and the form can be seen. Thus it can be seen what that bodiless mind will be after rebirth, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->After demonstrating thus so many phenomena, as mentioned above, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; concluded:] No use in seeing all these things. Try to see only One.<!-- /block --></p>
