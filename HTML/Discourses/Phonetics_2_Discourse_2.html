<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Phonetics is a completely scientific subject. In the world of action not a single step can be taken without science. Here it will have to be borne in mind that the application of science changes according to the changes in time, place and person. Both place and person can change at the same time. For example, the Vedic ks&#x301;a (k-s&#x301;a) becomes ks&#x301;a (k-cha) with a change in person. Kutsa&#x301; becomes keccha&#x301;. This altered pronunciation takes place in accordance with differences in individual body structure, changes in blood and climatic changes. The spoken language of northern Chittagong is pure Bengali; there is no foreign influence over its style of pronunciation. However, since south Chittagong&#146;s Cox&#146;s Bazar lies near Burma, it has been influenced by Burmese pronunciation, especially in the areas near Teknap. As a result, the pronunciation has become non-Vedic despite the fact that from the linguistic point of view it is pure Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The same thing has happened with Assamese. Although by and large Assamese follows the Yajurvedic style of pronunciation, some altered pronunciation has crept in. The reason for this is that when the people of the Ahom tribes migrated from Burma they brought with them that country&#146;s style of pronunciation and that influenced the local phonetics. For example, in Assamese the pronunciation of ca has become like that of sa. The pronunciation of the t&#x301;a varga is similar to that of the ta varga and there is a mutual interchange that occurs between these two vargas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> For example, kut&#x301;il becomes somewhat similar to kutil. This is due to the influence of different clans. There is not a single trace of Burmese influence in the pronunciation of Rangpuri Bengali in nearby northern Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The pronunciation of the Rarh area corresponds to that of the rest of northern India. It corresponds to that of Oriya except where the Oriya pronunciation style follows the Atharvavedic or Rgvedic pronunciation. For example, the pronunciation of phala [fruit] in Oriya is phar&#x301;a. In Oriya&#146;s Rgvedic style of pronunciation there is a difference between the pronunciation of a&#x301;di la [la at the beginning of a word] and antahstha la [la in the middle or end of a word], but in the rest of northern India they are pronounced the same.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Although there is a difference between a&#x301;di la and antahstha la in the spoken language in some parts of Bihar, Rajasthan and other areas, there is no difference in the written language. In some areas in Bihar kala&#x301; [banana] is called kera&#x301;, ga&#x301;li [abuse] is pronounced ga&#x301;ri, and kapa&#x301;l [forehead] is pronounced kapa&#x301;r&#x301;. In Oriya, Gujarati and the south Indian languages antahstha la is both pronounced differently and used differently, and for this reason there are separate forms as well. However, in Bengali they are written and pronounced the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit phonetics the letters are systematically arranged. There are fourteen pure vowels &ndash; a, a&#x301;, i, ii, u, u&#x301;, r, rr, lr, lrr, e, ae, o, ao &ndash; and two demi-vowels &ndash; am&#x301; and ah. In the Rgveda there is also a long anusva&#x301;ra (<img src="../../HTML/Images/AncientAnusvara.PNG">) that no longer exists in modern Sanskrit. Now the question is, why this demi-vowel?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->A vowel can be pronounced without any additional help, but in the case of am&#x301; and ah, the m&#x301; and the h cannot be pronounced by themselves. Since they cannot be pronounced alone they are called demi-vowels, that is, they are vowels but not full vowels. Thus they are called ayogava&#x301;ha in Sanskrit, that is, these two vowels cannot be pronounced without another&#146;s help. A thousand years ago the visarga (h) existed in Bengali and also in Maethilii; however at that time it was written like the Bengali symbol for &ldquo;four&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x09EA;</span>).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Among the thirty-four consonants, those belonging to the vargas &ndash; ka, kha, ga, gha, un&#x32D;a, ca, cha, ja, jha, in&#x32D;a, t&#x301;a, t&#x301;ha, d&#x301;a, d&#x301;ha, n&#x301;a, ta, tha, da, dha, na, pa, pha, ba, bha, ma &ndash; are pure consonants. Sha, sa, s&#x301;a, ha and ks&#x301;a are called us&#x301;mavarn&#x301;a [aspirates]. When they are pronounced they create heat in the vocal cavity.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> They are consonants but not pure consonants. Ya, ra, la and va are antahsthavarn&#x301;a. They are also not pure consonants. They are pronounced one way at the beginning of a word and another way in the middle or at the end of a word. Ya at the beginning of a word is pronounced like a light &ldquo;ja&rdquo; [as in &ldquo;Germany&rdquo;], for example, yadu, yadi, ya&#x301;ga-yajin&#x32D;a. In the middle or at the end of a word it is pronounced ia. Incidentally, it is worth mentioning that ja is a hard &ldquo;ja&rdquo; sound (palatal), for example, janttu-ja&#x301;nowa&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In Bengali vargiiya ja (hard or palatal) is used in two ways. First, wherever hard ja is used in a Sanskrit word it is retained in Bengali, for example, jat&#x301;hara, janttu, etc. Second, wherever the hard da in Sanskrit has become transformed into hard ja in Pra&#x301;krta (vargiiya ja or palatal ja). For example, adya &rarr; ajja &rarr; a&#x301;j; duhita&#x301; &rarr; juhia&#x301; &rarr; jhia&#x301; &rarr; jhia &rarr; jhi. This change, that is, the passage of these words from Sanskrit to Bengali, took five thousand years. The change went through three phases, from Pra&#x301;krta to Demi-Pra&#x301;krta to old Bengali. Such a transformation will always have the hard ja, for example, duhita&#x301;. Here there is force applied to the du. In Sanskrit the word duhitr is derived by adding the suffix trn&#x301; to the verbal root duh &ndash; in Latin, duhitar; in modern English, &ldquo;daughter&rdquo;. Since the word duhitr contains the letter ha, the English &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; is also spelled with an &ldquo;h&rdquo;, however over time its pronunciation has been lost. From this it can clearly deduced that both English and Sanskrit are Vedic languages, hence the many similarities between the two. For example, the word &ldquo;night&rdquo; is naktram&#x301; in Vedic and [[noctum]] in old Latin. The Latin adjective is &ldquo;nocturnal&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Thus we see that at the beginning of a word ya is pronounced like a light ja, and in the middle or at the end of a word its pronunciation becomes ia. There is less influence of Sanskrit in north India by comparison due to the predominance of Urdu; thus this rule is not followed in Hindi. For example, iaha&#x301;n is written yaha&#x301;n although, according to the rule, if we write yaha&#x301;n it is not correct to pronounce it iaha&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The next letter is ra. When ra comes at the beginning of a word it is pronounced ra. It is pronounced this way when the tongue touches the teeth of the upper palate. One example is ran&#x301;a. If ra is in the middle or at the end of a word it is pronounced without touching the tongue to the teeth of the upper palate, for example, caran&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Then comes la. If la is at the beginning of a word it is called a&#x301;di la.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> For example, la in lata&#x301; is pronounced la. If la occurs in the middle or at the end of a word it is pronounced lra. For example, the correct pronunciation of the word phala is phalra (phalram, phalre, phalra&#x301;ni). This rule is not followed in northern India; thus the Sanskrit pandits there pronounce it incorrectly. In Rajasthan goli is pronounced gori. In  Bhojpuri kapa&#x301;l is pronounced kapa&#x301;r&#x301; and diwa&#x301;l is diwa&#x301;r&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Next comes antahstha va. In Bengali, antahstha va and vargiiya ba are written and pronounced the same. At the beginning of a word antahstha va is pronounced like the English &ldquo;va&rdquo;, as in the pronunciation of &ldquo;van&rdquo; and &ldquo;caravan&rdquo;. That is, it is pronounced by filling the mouth with air, closing it, and then thrusting the lower and upper lips out. In the middle or at the end of a word antahstha va is pronounced like the English &ldquo;wa&rdquo;. This is also the case when va is the second part of a conjunct, for example, vidva&#x301;na. In northern India, antahstha va is mistakenly pronounced &ldquo;wa&rdquo; at all times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Thus these four letters &ndash; ya, ra, la and va &ndash; are antahsthavarn&#x301;a rather than pure consonants. Why? Because in fact they are each a diphthong of two vowels. Specifically, ya = i + a, ra = r + a, la = lr + a, and va = o + a. They are mistakenly taken to be consonants but they are actually not consonants.<!-- /block --></p>
