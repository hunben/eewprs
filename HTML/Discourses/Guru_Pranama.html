<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Let me explain line by line.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Nitya&#x301;nandam&rdquo;. What is nitya&#x301;nandam? Parama Purus&#x301;a is nitya&#x301;nandam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Jiivas enjoy nitya&#x301;nandam and vis&#x301;ya&#x301;nandam. When one acquires something worldly, something mundane, one feels a sort of happiness which is known as &ldquo;vis&#x301;ya&#x301;nandam&rdquo;, and when, by dint of one&#146;s spiritual practices and the grace of the Supreme, one enjoys spiritual happiness, it is known as &ldquo;nitya&#x301;nandam&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->But for what reason is Parama Purus&#x301;a creating the world? Why is He doing so much for created beings? Certainly for a&#x301;nandam. And He Himself is also a&#x301;nandam. So His a&#x301;nandam is created within, merged within, enjoyed within.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->For Parama Purus&#x301;a there are two kinds of a&#x301;nandam: nitya&#x301;nandam and liila&#x301;nandam. What is nitya&#x301;nandam? Nitya&#x301;nandam is His self-satisfaction. The bliss that He enjoys from Himself is nitya&#x301;nandam. He was in nitya&#x301;nandam, He is in Nitya&#x301;nandam, and He will be in nitya&#x301;nandam. When there was no world, at that time also there was nitya&#x301;nandam. And when, in theory, there will be no creation, He will still be in nitya&#x301;nandam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And what is liila&#x301;nandam? When Sagun&#x301;a &ndash; Attributional Consciousness or Attributed Consciousness &ndash; was created, He wanted liila&#x301;nandam. He wanted to enjoy liila&#x301;nandam. And what is liila&#x301;nandam? He creates so many things, so many animate and inanimate objects, so many sons and daughters. And while playing with His sons and daughters, He gets a sort of pleasure. That pleasure is His liila&#x301;nandam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->And spiritual aspirants who are intelligent know this fact. They know that everything in this world is His liila&#x301;nandam. He is playing for liila&#x301;nandam, so there should not be any worries and anxieties in this world &ndash; all things are different phases of His liila&#x301;nandam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In this shloka the first word is &ldquo;nitya&#x301;nandam&rdquo;. &ldquo;O Lord, who art always in nitya&#x301;nandam.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nitya&rdquo; means &ldquo;of permanent nature&rdquo;. Therefore, a&#x301;nandam which is of permanent nature is nitya&#x301;nandam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The next word is &ldquo;paramasukhadam&rdquo;. The happiness that a created being enjoys from mundane objects is called &ldquo;sukham&rdquo;, and all this sukham comes from that Nitya&#x301;nandam Entity, so He is Paramasukhadam for the Jiivas. Here the word is not &ldquo;sukhadam&rdquo;, the word is &ldquo;paramasukhadam&rdquo;, that is, sukha of the maximum degree, sukha to the zenith of its efficiency.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Kevalam&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namurttim&rdquo;. What is the meaning of &ldquo;kevalam&rdquo;? &ldquo;Kevalam&rdquo; means &ldquo;the only entity&rdquo;, the &ldquo;non-dualistic entity&rdquo;. That is, in His realm, in His jurisdiction, there is no second, external entity. There is no scope for any Satan to be there, that is, there is no Satan. He is everything. He plays with His vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;  and avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. That is kevalam. Kevalam means &ldquo;the only entity&rdquo;, &ldquo;the only existence&rdquo;. And when one becomes one with Him, one is said to be ensconced in &ldquo;kaevalya&rdquo;. Kaevalya means &ldquo;nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi&rdquo;. That is when one acquires kevala-hood, that is kaevalya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->You should remember that the conception of Satan is against the non-dualistic philosophy. If we recognize a Satan, we are indirectly recognizing two Parama Purus&#x301;as &ndash; one a good Parama Purus&#x301;a and the other a very bad Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; which is absurd. So there is no Satan. There are only the misdeeds done by avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. And that Satan, as avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, is part of ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the left hand of ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->That&#146;s why Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Daevii hyes&#x301;a&#x301; gun&#x301;amayii mama Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; duratyaya&#x301;;<br>Ma&#x301;meva ye prapadyante Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;meta&#x301;m&#x301; taranti te.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This divine force, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, is My Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, is my power &ndash; &lsquo;Shaktih Sa&#x301; Shivasya shaktih.&rsquo; And those who have taken My shelter will easily surmount this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.&rdquo; Without divine help or divine aid, this ma&#x301;ya&#x301; remains insurmountable. So in order to cross this ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, one will have to take the shelter of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, that is, Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Kevalam&#x301;  jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namu&#x301;rttim.&rdquo; &ldquo;Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namu&#x301;rttim&rdquo; means &ldquo;Cognitive Faculty personified&rdquo;, &ldquo;personified Cognition&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tattvamasi&rdquo; + &ldquo;adi&rdquo; + &ldquo;laksyam&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Vishva&#x301;tiitam&rdquo;. What&#146;s the meaning of &ldquo;vishva&#x301;tiitam&rdquo;? When, as the objective counterpart of the Supreme Consciousness, something concrete is created, something under the strict supervision and bondage and fetters of the static principle, then that created being is called &ldquo;vishva&rdquo;. So vishva is His objective counterpart. And because vishva is His counterpart, He is above the jurisdiction of vishva &ndash; He is vishva&#x301;tiitam. And just as there cannot be any spatial demarcation in the sky, so there cannot be any spatial demarcation within the Macrocosm. That&#146;s why it has been said, &ldquo;Gaganasadrsham.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tattvamasi&rdquo;. Now, when a spiritual aspirant contacts Parama Purus&#x301;a and asks Him, &ldquo;Who am I, who am I?&rdquo; &ndash; when this eternal question is placed before Him, His reply is, &ldquo;Tattvamasi&rdquo;, &ldquo;Thou art That,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;Thou art the Supreme Entity.&rdquo; As I have said so many times, human sadhana is a movement from electronic imperfection to nuclear perfection. The nuclear perfection is That, and this electronic imperfection is you. You are That. The stage of &ldquo;are&rdquo; is your spiritual practice. Your are That, you &ndash; That &ndash; are. This &ldquo;are&rdquo; is the gap to be bridged by sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. So you are That. The Guru&#146;s words, the Guru&#146;s secret instruction, or gospel, or text, or sermon, is, &ldquo;O my little boy, O my little girl, thou art That.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tattvamasya&#x301;dilaks&#x301;yam&rdquo;. Now the entity who always reminds you, &ldquo;O my little boy, O my little girl, thou art That,&rdquo; is the Guru. I think you understand.<!-- /block --></p>
