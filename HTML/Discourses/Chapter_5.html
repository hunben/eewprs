<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Purport: Since no well-knit social order had evolved in the distant past, we may call that age the Shu&#x301;dra Age; in those days all people survived by their manual labour. Then came the age of clan leaders &ndash; the age of the strong and the brave &ndash; which we may call the Ks&#x301;atriya Age. This was followed by the age of intellectuals, which we may call the Vipra Age. Finally came the age of capitalists, the Vaeshya Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When the warriors and intellectuals are reduced to the level of manual labourers as a result of exploitation during the Vaeshya Age, shu&#x301;dra revolution occurs. The shu&#x301;dras have neither a well-knit social order nor sufficient intellect to govern society. Hence, the post-capitalist administration passes into the hands of those who provide the leadership in the shu&#x301;dra revolution. These people are brave and courageous, so they begin the second Ks&#x301;atriya Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In this way the Shu&#x301;dra, Ks&#x301;atriya, Vipra and Vaeshya Ages move in succession, followed by revolution; then the second cyclic order begins.

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Purport: When warriors degenerate into exploiters, sadvipras will establish the Vipra Age by subduing the exploiting warriors. Consequently, the advent of the Vipra Age, which should have occurred through a natural process, is expedited by the application of force. A change of ages in this way may be called kra&#x301;nti [&ldquo;evolution&rdquo;]. The difference between evolution and sva&#x301;bha&#x301;vika parivarttana [natural change] is only this: in evolution the movement of the social cycle is accelerated by the application of force.<!-- /block --></p>

For instance, the establishment of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age after the Vipra Age is counter-evolution. This counter-evolution is extremely short-lived. That is, within a very short time this age is again replaced by the next age or the one after it. In other words, if the Ks&#x301;atriya Age suddenly supersedes the Vipra Age through counter-evolution, then the Ks&#x301;atriya Age will not last long. Within a short time either the Vipra Age, or as a natural concomitant the Vaeshya Age, will follow.<!-- /block --></p>

So the minimum requirements of life should be made available to everybody. In other words, food, clothing, medical treatment, housing and education must be provided to all. The minimum requirements of human beings, however, change according to the change in ages. For instance, for conveyance the minimum requirement may be a bicycle in one age and an aeroplane in another age.

In an age when a bicycle is the minimum requirement for common people, a motor vehicle is necessary for a physician. In recognition of people&#146;s merit, and to provide the meritorious with greater opportunities to serve the society, they have to be provided with motor vehicles.

For instance, today common people need bicycles whereas meritorious people need motor vehicles, but a proper effort should be made to provide common people with motor vehicles. After everybody has been provided with a motor vehicle, it may be necessary to provide each meritorious person with an aeroplane. After providing every meritorious person with an aeroplane, efforts should also be made to provide every common person with an aeroplane, raising the minimum standard of living. In this way efforts to raise the minimum standard of living will have to go on endlessly, and on this endeavour will depend the mundane development and prosperity of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Purport: Society must ensure the maximum development of the collective body, collective mind and collective spirit. One must not forget that collective welfare lies in individuals and individual welfare lies in collectivity. Without ensuring individual comforts through the proper provision of food, light, air, accommodation and medical treatment, the welfare of the collective body can never be achieved.

<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->The absence of spiritual morality and spirituality in individuals will break the backbone of the collectivity. So for the sake of collective welfare one will have to awaken spirituality in individuals. The mere presence of a handful of strong and brave people, a small number of scholars or a few spiritualists does not indicate the progress of the entire society. The potential for infinite physical, mental and spiritual development is inherent in every human being. This potentiality has to be harnessed and brought to fruition.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->[There should be a proper adjustment amongst these physical, metaphysical, mundane, supramundane and spiritual utilizations.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Purport: While promoting individual and collective welfare, there should be proper adjustment among the physical, mental and spiritual spheres and the crude, subtle and causal worlds. For instance, society has the responsibility to meet the minimum requirements of every individual, but if it arranges food and builds a house for everyone under the impetus of this responsibility, individual initiative is retarded. People will gradually become lethargic. Therefore, society has to make arrangements so that people, in exchange for their labour according to their capacity, can earn the money they require to purchase the minimum requirements. In order to raise the level of the minimum requirements of people, the best policy is to increase their purchasing capacity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Proper adjustment&rdquo; also means that while taking service from a person who is physically, mentally and spiritually developed, society should follow a balanced policy. Society will take physical, intellectual or spiritual service from a person depending upon which of these capacities is conspicuously developed in that person. From those who are sufficiently physically and intellectually developed, society will follow a balanced policy and accordingly take more intellectual service and less physical service, because intellectual power is comparatively subtle and rare. From those who are physically, mentally and spiritually developed, society will take maximum spiritual service, less intellectual service and still less physical service.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->As far as social welfare is concerned, those endowed with spiritual power can render the greatest service, followed by those endowed with intellectual power. Those having physical power, though not negligible, cannot do anything by themselves. Whatever they do, they do under the instructions of those endowed with intellectual and spiritual power. Hence the responsibility of controlling the society should not be in the hands of those who are endowed only with physical power, or in the hands of those endowed only with courage, or in the hands of those who are developed only intellectually, or in the hands of those with worldly knowledge alone. Social control will have to be in the hands of those who are spiritually elevated, intelligent and brave all at the same time.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->Purport: The proper use of any object changes according to changes in time, space and person. Those who cannot understand this simple principle want to cling to the skeletons of the past, and as a result they are rejected by living society. Sentiments based on narrow nationalism, regionalism, ancestral pride, etc., tend to keep people away from this fundamental principle, so they cannot unreservedly accept it as a simple truth.

This has got to be accepted, and after recognizing this fact, people will have to progressively utilize every object and every idea.

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  On 13 October 1989 the author gave the discourse &ldquo;Minimum Requirements and Maximum Amenities&rdquo; (Proutist Economics, 1992), and instructed that the essential ideas contained in this discourse should be added to the present chapter. These ideas were summarized by the author as follows: &ldquo;(1) Minimum requirements are to be guaranteed to all. (2) Special amenities are for people of special calibre as per the environmental condition of the particular age. (3) Maximum amenities are to be guaranteed to all, even to those who have no special qualities &ndash; to common people of common calibre. Maximum amenities are to be guaranteed to all as per environmental conditions. These amenities are for those of ordinary calibre &ndash; the common people, the so-called downtrodden humanity. (4) All three above are never-ending processes, and they will go on increasing according to the collective potentialities. This appendix to our philosophy may be small, but it is of progressive nature and progressive character. It has far-reaching implications for the future.&rdquo; &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  In 1959 the author gave five principles in English known as the &ldquo;Five Fundamental Principles of Prout&rdquo;. They were published as part of the discourse &ldquo;The Cosmic Brotherhood&rdquo; in Idea and Ideology. Subsequently, in 1961, the author dictated A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram, whose fifth chapter contains, as we see here, sixteen Sanskrit su&#x301;tras, or aphorisms. Aphorisms 12 to 16 correspond to the Five Fundamental Principles given earlier in English. In this edition of A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram, the author&#146;s original English of each of the Five Fundamental Principles has been printed below the corresponding Sanskrit aphorism. (Though in each case it is the author&#146;s English, it has been presented in square brackets because it was not originally given in the context of this book.) What follows every other Sanskrit aphorism in this chapter and other chapters is a translation of the aphorism rendered by the editors. Thus the bracketed English below the Sanskrit in each of Aphorisms 12-16 is not a translation as such. Note that the word sama&#x301;ja in Su&#x301;tra 5-12 is normally translated &ldquo;society&rdquo;; &ldquo;collective body&rdquo; appears in the English. Parivarttante in Su&#x301;tra 5-16 is normally translated &ldquo;does vary&rdquo; (present indicative); &ldquo;should vary&rdquo; appears in the English. &ndash;Eds.</p>
