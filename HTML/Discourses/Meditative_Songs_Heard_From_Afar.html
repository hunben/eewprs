<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->After completing daily spiritual practice, some of you must have heard a musical sound come wafting from afar, as you are standing, sitting or walking in solitary places. The sound becomes clearer on the solitary high terrains of the Himalayas, on the plains of India, along the solitary sea-shore, on the bank of a pond hemmed in by Palmyra trees in Bengal, at A&#x301;nandanagar and in undulating river girdles. Suppose disembodied entities are singing <I>kiirtana</I> somewhere. Overwhelmed with the devotional flow of <I>kiirtana</I>, you are listening to that ecstatic music. Whenever the mind gets inundated with even a little flow of devotion, it can hear this meditative music coming from afar. This is in fact the great attraction of the Supreme Entity&#146;s cosmic momentum emanating from the Cosmic Hub. It is said that these strains are sung by disembodied entities like <I>apsara&#x301;s</I>. <I>Apsara&#x301;s</I> are those who, from a temporal viewpoint, do not possess bodies made from the five fundamental factors. The virtuous who, after death, have retained a few but not all of the five fundamental factors are called <I>apsara&#x301;s</I>. In bygone days, people imagined that <I>apsara&#x301;s</I> were very handsome or lovely. In colloquial Bengali, they are called <I>parii</I> or fairies, and those who are the paragon of beauty are called <I>da&#x301;na&#x301;ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; parii</I> or fairies whose wings have been cut off. In those days, handsome men were also called <I>apsara&#x301;s</I>. Bridegrooms used to be compared to <I>apsara&#x301;s</I>. During my stay in Thailand, I saw that the name of a main thoroughfare there is <I>Apsara&#x301;</I> Road. In a song of <I>Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita</I>, composed in the Himalayas, there is a line:<!-- /block --></p>
