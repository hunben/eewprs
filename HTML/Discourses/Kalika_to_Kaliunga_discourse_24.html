The etymological meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;related to <I>ka&#x301;la</I> [time]&rdquo;. In common usage it means the following:- <ol> <li><I>Ka&#x301;lashakti:</I> The sensorial measurement of the motivity of action is called <I>ka&#x301;la</I>. If the motivity of this <I>ucchu&#x301;nya&#x301;</I> [unexpressed state of] <I>Prakrti</I> were not there, time would have been flawed by non-existence. Again, in the absence of a measuring mind, the existential entity remains unrecognized. When there is movement, it must be understood that there are at least two entities, and there must be a change of place in at least one of them. Alternately, all existing multiple entities are continuously undergoing change of place. This displacement of one or many is effected by action. Change of place is relative. In an eternal state of equipoise, change of place is impossible. Similarly impossible is absolute pause or absolute speed. This movement, which is essentially relative, and on which the mind acts through sense perceptions, is certainly a dynamic force (<I>calacchakti</I>)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->. One name of this dynamic force is <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> or <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301; shakti</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><li>Whether inanimate or animate, creature or plant, human or non-human, everything has certain generic features and certain specific features. Each of these features can be called a quality. It should be remembered that even defects are qualities (a defect means a negative quality). In a so-called inanimate object, such as gold<I></I>, for example, there are positive qualities [properties] and negative qualities (defects). The identity of gold and its attributes is characterized by the combination of these positive and negative qualities. A gold particle contains, carries and sustains these qualities. It is also the nature of these characteristics that decides with what it can be combined at the atomic stage, and the kinds of changes that would take place in its atomic structure. All these together constitute the goldenness of gold.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><p>Take yoghurt, for example. The introduction of a particular agent [acidic coagulator] like <I>dadhyamla (dambal)</I> brings about chemical changes in lukewarm milk and converts it to yoghurt. The atomic composition of lukewarm milk is not exactly like the atomic composition of ordinary milk. The change occasioned by the introduction of the coagulator (<I>dambal</I>) also involves a further transformation in its atomic composition. So the qualities of milk in these three different stages are not the same. Those who cannot digest ordinary milk may possibly digest lukewarm milk. Again, those who cannot digest lukewarm milk may perhaps digest yoghurt. Furthermore, those who cannot digest yoghurt may be able to digest buttermilk (<I>ghol</I>). This means that there are differences in quality in the same inanimate object, in different places and times or when it passes through a chemical process. The <I>sa&#x301;marasya</I> [balance] is disturbed at this stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><p>Animate horses have particular qualities. Again, there are qualitative differences amongst different species of horses. The all-round development of the world is based on the states, structures, changes and modifications of all these qualitative differences. So no all-round progress is possible while ignoring any entity, irrespective of its molecular, atomic or electronic base. That is why any thought along sectarian lines is fundamentally incorrect. And this is the reason why I am compelled to say that the path of Neo Humanism<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is the only path of welfare &#133; the only path of progress. And this is a path that is predetermined by the Supreme Shelter <I>(prapattinivaddha) &#133;</I> there is no other second path.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><p>Human beings also have different branches and sub-branches. They also certainly have special structural characteristics. Human beings of the same subspecies have differences in their existential composition as well as in their existential awareness. So in the creation of the new world, everyone may have a role to play<I></I>, but the roles are not, and cannot, be the same. It is not possible to lead human beings towards progress by putting them into one single mould and pulverizing their distinctive features with a steamroller. Putting all human beings in the cage of one single &ldquo;commune&rdquo; and forcing them to sing the glory of one single theory in one single tune can never liberate humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><p>In the world of trees and plants, the distinctive features and diversities are more conspicuous. We must give them proper recognition before we move forward. Yes, each tree has certain special qualities of its own. Even in the same species and different subspecies there are differences with regard to quality, nutritional and medicinal values. In myrobalan (<I>hariitakii</I>) there are certain qualities. But in different species of myrobalan there are differences depending on whether it is <I>gaur&#x301;ii</I>, or <I>ma&#x301;gadhii</I> or <I>rohin&#x301;ii</I>. <I>Kandasha&#x301;ka</I> or tuber crops have certain special qualities. But all tuberous plants do not have the same qualities. <I>Ol</I> [arum], <I>ma&#x301;nkacu</I> [a bigger variety of arum]<I>, kha&#x301;ma&#x301;lu</I> [a big size tuber crop]<I>, mukhiikacu, kamalabhog kacu, pa&#x301;niikacu</I> [three different varieties of arum]<I>, a&#x301;lu</I> [potato]<I>, sutalii, sa&#x301;ta&#x301;lu, ra&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;lu</I> [sweet potato]<I>, ciina&#x301;lu, sha&#x301;n&#x32D;ka&#x301;lu</I> [a white edible, extremely sweet fruit] <I>&ndash;</I> all of these are tuberous. All have the generic qualities of bulbous or tuberous vegetables or <I>kanda</I>, but they have specific differences as well. The common attributes of all <I>kandas</I> belonging to the category of <I>kacu</I> are called <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> or <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;shakti</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><p>We should always remember that the inherent properties or inherent qualities of all objects are spatial, temporal or indigenous manifestations of the one <I>Para&#x301;shakti</I> [Introversive Force].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><li>Most of you know that <I>sita</I> or <I>sveta</I> [white] is not an original colour. White is not a particular colour; it is the collection of all colours. Where colour is absent, this is known as <I>asita</I> or <I>ashveta</I> [non-white] or <I>krs&#x301;n&#x301;a</I> [black]. Black is no colour; want of any colour is black. Black colour attracts more attention than any other colour. &ldquo;What attracts&rdquo; &ndash; it is in this sense that the colour black is called <I>krs&#x301;n&#x301;a</I>. The colour white attracts people least; so if black is placed next to white, both become very prominent. White and black are like two opposites &ndash; shade and light. People who are particularly fond of good dressing avoid the colour white because it is least attractive. That is why in India white clothes were prescribed for widows. If a particular object is of white colour, it will not attract your attention much. You will not fear it much either. But the colour black will attract your attention more &#133; and it will frighten you more as well. You will fear a nonpoisonous black snake more and consider it more dangerous than a white snake. White is a positive symbol and black is a negative symbol. The all-black, terrible looking female form, be it a <I>raks&#x301;asii</I> [demoness], or goddess is called <I>Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I><!-- /block --></p>

The rhythmic negativity of this <I>can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301; shakti</I> is called <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301; shakti</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><li>The name of one particular school of philosophy of Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii Buddhism is known as <I>shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da</I>. Everything comes out of nothing. <I>Shu&#x301;nya&#x301;t a&#x301;gacchati, shu&#x301;nye tis&#x301;t&#x301;hati, shu&#x301;nyam&#x301; adhigacchati</I> [everything comes from nothing, remains in nothing, descends towards nothing] &ndash; this is the essence of <I>shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da</I>. According to some scholars, this <I>shu&#x301;nya</I> does not mean exactly zero or cipher. <I>Shu&#x301;nya</I> as if is a symbolic representation of the absence of all conceptions. Whatever the interpretation, according to the literal meaning <I>shu&#x301;nya</I> is certainly zero. In order to counter this Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii <I>shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da</I> and turn a negative philosophy into a positive one <I></I>in the shortest possible manner, Sankaracharya used the word <I>Brahma</I> in place of <I>shu&#x301;nya</I>. It was just a metamorphosis of philosophical negativity into philosophical positivity by replacing the term <I>shu&#x301;nya</I> with <I>Brahma</I>.

The surface meaning is one and the internal meaning is another. The surface meaning is: The boat of compassion is already filled with gold. There is no room to keep silver in this boat. <I>Thoi</I> means <I>thuiba&#x301;r</I> or <I>ra&#x301;khba&#x301;r</I>, &ldquo;to keep&rdquo; &ndash; this verb is still prevalent in the countryside of Bengal).

You need not bear any longer the burden of the inborn <I>sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras</I> of life. At one time (sometime after the reign of King Shashanka), this doctrine of <I>shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da</I> had a strong hold on the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii Buddhism of Bengal. But the Bengali psyche is completely opposed to nihilism because it can turn a person into a cynic, and it has been doing exactly that. So in the land of Bengal, there developed a new Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii school, which was called <I>atisukhava&#x301;da</I> [the doctrine of excessive pleasure or hedonism] &ndash; which was the polar opposite of the Buddhist doctrine of sorrow<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> [or complete pessimism]. However, it is this Naera&#x301;tmadevii <I></I>who is the Buddhist <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301; shakti</I>. Later when, under the influence of Sankaracharya the people of Bengal embraced the Puranic religion, they did not completely discard the Buddhist <I>Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I>; rather, they retained it as one of the different forms of the mythological goddess, Ka&#x301;lii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->.

But in today&#146;s world, melons grow in sand-mixed earth, wherever there is water under the sand, provided the climate is sufficiently warm. Generally, in the northern hemisphere melon seeds are sown towards the end of December, and the fruits are available until the start of rainy season. The plant begins to yield fruit from the time it is just one month old. The fruits take two and half months to ripen. The outer skin of the melon is generally of three kinds: black, green and white. Melons of varied, striped colours have been produced in China since ancient times. Again, melons are of three different types, depending on the colour of its kernel: rosy, dark blue and yellow. In China, melons with yellow kernel are readily available. This melon with yellow kernel may not be very large in size, but it is very sweet. In India, the melons of Bhagalpur were most famous for their size. The melons of Goyalanda (the original name was <I>Goya&#x301;la&#x301;-nanda)</I>, Burdwan <I></I>and Tarakeswar were also famous at one time. At present there is fairly good cultivation of the original Japanese melon in the regions of south Bengal close to the sea. Since this kind of melon grows well in the region near <I>Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sa&#x301;gar</I> [confluence of the Bay of Bengal] it has been named <I>sa&#x301;garashree</I>. Thanks to this <I>sa&#x301;garashree</I>, Bengal is now quite advanced in the melon cultivation. Melons with black or blackish skins are called <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph --><p>In prehistoric times, the melon had a sister fruit. But in the course of time, it branched out in a different direction. As cauliflowers, cabbage, modern broccoli and lettuce are born out of the very ancient broccoli, similarly one branch of the original melon is known as <I>tarmuj</I> [melon] and the other branch is known as <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I>. In <I></I>many respects <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> is <I></I>like a melon. It needs sandy soil and warmth. But while a melon is round shaped, a <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> is oblong. A melon can be eaten only when it is ripe; moreover, it is not cooked. A <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> can be eaten when it is green, but it must be cooked for eating, and it cannot be eaten when it is ripe. The central part of a melon is extremely rich in sugar, while in a <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> the sugar content is almost nil. In taste it is more like <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;kur&#x301;</I> (what is called <I>kan&#x32D;kur&#x301;</I> when green is called <I>phut&#x301;i</I> when ripe) than like cucumber.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph --><p>A melon requires soft soil full of sand. For a <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> the soil need not be so soft, but it must be sandy. A favourite dish of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>in spring and summer is this <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I>. In chaste Bengali, a <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> is called <I>khan&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301;</I>. From the white of a ripe melon and from <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> one can make flour. This flour may not have much nutritional value, but it can help to some extent in filling the stomach of poor people. In areas like Bengal as well as India and other countries where there is an acute shortage of food, one should cultivate on a large scale plants such as melons, <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;os</I>, ground cucumber (<I>ks&#x301;iirika&#x301;s</I> or <I>ks&#x301;iira&#x301;s</I>) and plants of the <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;kur&#x301;</I> family (<I>phut&#x301;i</I> or <I>ba&#x301;un&#x32D;gi</I>) in fallow, riparian lands. This will help immensely in solving the food problems of the world. It is also possible to extract large amounts of cooking oil from the seeds of melon and <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I>. One can certainly extract oil from the seeds of cucumber and <I>phut&#x301;i</I> ; moreover it can be used as a supplement to groundnuts.<!-- /block --></p>

In ancient times the orthodox Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas would never use the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> or <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> because they considered the word as belonging to the Sha&#x301;kta <I></I>register [worshipper of Shakti <I></I>or the operative principle of creation]. The Sha&#x301;ktas <I></I>sacrifice goats &#133; they slaughter goats. So Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas did not use the word <I>ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [cutting<I></I>, slaughtering]. In other words, they avoided using words associated with the rites and rituals of Sha&#x301;ktas. Sha&#x301;ktas <I></I>use <I>jaba&#x301; phul</I> [a red species of China rose &ndash; <I>Hibiscus rosa sinensis</I>]; so Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas would call it <I>or&#x301;phul</I>. The Sha&#x301;ktas <I></I>take the <I>jhol</I> [broth] of meat; so Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas would avoid the word <I>jhol</I> and say <I>rasa&#x301;</I> instead. The Sha&#x301;ktas perform animal sacrifices [literally they cut the animals]. So the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas would not use the expression <I>tarka&#x301;ri ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [cutting the vegetables]; they would use the word <I>ba&#x301;na&#x301;no</I> [making]. They would not call the ink <I>ka&#x301;li</I> but <I>siha&#x301;ii</I>. Even today the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas in the villages of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>follow this practice. This custom is prevalent in Assam also. In Assamese language the word <I>siha&#x301;ii</I> is also prevalent. In the languages of Bihar, the writing ink is also called <I>siha&#x301;ii;</I> in Urdu it is called <I>raoshna&#x301;ii</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph --><li>You are generally familiar with white sandalwood and red sandalwood. Actually the red sandalwood is no sandal at all; it is a tall wild tree with fragrant red wood. It was incorporated into the category of sandalwood in the post-Buddhist period. In botany it is not regarded as sandalwood. Later its use grew among the worshippers of the sun and the worshippers of <I>Shakti</I>, and even today the <I>Saoras</I> [sun worshippers] and the <I>Sha&#x301;ktas</I> use this red sandal when worshiping the goddess <I>Ka&#x301;lii</I>. If any Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava happens to use this red sandal, he would encircle the mark with white sandal or the kind of earth they call the holy clay of Vraja (<I>tilaka ma&#x301;t&#x301;i</I>). In Bengal, however, red sandalwood is still used in the worship of Ka&#x301;lii and the sun, just as the <I>jaba&#x301;</I> [the red China rose] is used. Sandal actually means white sandal. There are primarily two varieties<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn10"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn10">10</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> of white sandal in the world &ndash; one is the Indonesian variety, which is celebrated in Sanskrit as the <I>javadviipiiyas praja&#x301;ti</I> [Java island sandal], and the other is Sri Lankan. Indian white sandal belongs to the Sri Lankan variety. When Mysore was under the rule of the ancient royal family, sandalwood was regarded as the national tree, and felling a sandalwood tree without royal permission was strictly prohibited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph --><p>Another variety of sandalwood with blackish wood is available in very limited quantity in the world. Since its colour is black, people do not use it as a mark on the body, despite the fact that it has a very sweet smell. So there is greater demand for this oil. This black-coloured sandal is called <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

Etymologically <I>ka&#x301;rava</I> refers to one who makes this kind of vulgar noise or harsh sound. In common usage <I>ka&#x301;rava</I> means a jackdaw or a rook. Another meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;rava</I>, which is very rarely used, is <I>bhutumpya&#x301;n&#x32D;ca&#x301;</I> [one of the largest and ugliest species of owl].

<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->When the Aryans came to India they first established a colony in Haritdha&#x301;nya <I></I>[Hariyana] <I></I>after the <I>saptasindhu</I> [Punjab] and then at Praya&#x301;ga [Allahabad] &ndash; in the eastern ends of Brahma&#x301;varta as well as in Brahmars&#x301;idesh (which later became the kingdoms of Shu&#x301;rasena and Shakasena). Then they moved forward along the western bank of the Ganges right up to the River Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii, and then right up to the River Sone along its northern bank. Magadh was famous for its valour during that period. So it was not possible for the Aryans to cross the Sone and enter Magadh. Moreover in Mithila also, the people of Maethilii-Gaor&#x301;ia&#x301;n nature [influenced by Tantra] were inimical to Aryan ideology. So the Aryans did not consider it feasible to enter. Later, of course, they established a colony in Mithila, and the king Mithi made the place congenial to colonial occupation by performing the <I>trihotriya yajin&#x32D;a</I> [a special Vedic ceremony].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->Even after this invasion the Aryans could not enter Magadh for a long time. Since they failed to make inroads into Magadh, they named the place as Magadh in the pejorative sense that it was a place inhabited by <I>magas</I> or people who were opposed to the Vedas and its rites and rituals. It was long afterwards that the Aryans came to Bengal. In Bengal at first they faced invincible resistance on the border of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Unable to enter Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h<I></I>, they perhaps contemptuously named the place as <I>Varjyabhu&#x301;mi</I>.

In common usage <I>ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga</I> means the following: <ol> <li>A middle-sized elephant of the Indian variety. Indian elephants are generally of two kinds &ndash; very large and medium-sized. The large elephants are rather tall in height, though not as tall as the African elephant, but they are quite intelligent. The African elephant cannot be easily domesticated, but an Indian elephant is amenable to domestication. Once upon a time there were plenty of medium-sized Indian elephants, but now they are almost extinct. In the southern part of Assam and in Tripura there were ample medium-sized elephants even during the Mughal period. It is said that during the Mughal and Pathan periods, whenever there were battles between the king of Tripura and the <I>nawabs</I> and emperors, the king of Tripura used to present a few such medium-sized elephants to the <I>nawabs</I> and emperors as terms of the truce. At present we seldom come across these medium-sized elephants in other parts of India. The complexion of these elephants is paler than the complexion of large elephants &ndash; somewhat ashen coloured, in fact. One name of this medium-sized Indian elephant is <I>ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga</I>. Any elephant cub can also be called <I>ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph --><li>India invented and began to use steel a long time ago. At that time, steel was not manufactured by the process followed today. There were neither huge steel plants like those of today nor were there big smithies. The steel was made through an indigenous process. Many of the Ashoka pillars are made from this steel, and they have remained intact for as long as two thousand years. The pillar of Prthviraj near Kutubminar (Delhi) is also made of the steel from that period. There was a time when it was not even possible to move this pillar. People say that in later times, a foreign invader was able to move it. As a result, the pillar became slightly loose. As the pillar became loose, people of the time changed the name of Indraprastha to <I>D&#x301;heilii</I> [leaning or slanting or loose] from which is derived the word &ldquo;Delhi&rdquo;. Whatever may be the formula for producing this Indian steel, it is also called <I>ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga</I>.

<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph --><li>You have noticed that from the end of winter until summer, a variety of bottle gourd that is longish in shape grows in the fields. The gourmets claim that delicious <I>ra&#x301;ita&#x301;</I> can be made with this gourd when mixed with yoghurt. One can make delicious fried chops also by smearing it with powdered rice or powdered pulse. You must have seen such small, pitcher-shaped gourds. These are very good for making a dish of minced and spiced vegetables, cooked almost dry, and a sweet dish prepared by boiling bottle gourd pieces in milk with sugar and other ingredients. You also must have seen round gourds. This round gourd is very good for a dish of vegetables cooked in a little oil, and also a type of preparation having several vegetables including bitter gourd. Many of you must have eaten such dishes made of round gourd. You must have seen club gourd also.

Botanists say that the melon had its origin in Arabia and the Middle East, but its production and use in India can be traced back to very ancient times. Right from the Rgvedic <I></I>era, Aryans and Dravidians were familiar with melons. Moreover in the Vedic language, there are many references to melon. In contrast, the use of <I>sphot&#x301;ana</I> or <I>sphot&#x301;aka</I> (<I>kharmuj</I> or <I>kharbuja&#x301;</I>) and <I>sphut&#x301;ika&#x301;</I> (<I>phut&#x301;i</I> or <I>ba&#x301;un&#x32D;gi</I>) is far less.

<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->Well, although a bit irrelevant, let me tell you that many scholars used to say by mistake that the word <I>ra&#x301;jagira</I> [in Magadh, Bihar] has come from the word <I>ra&#x301;jagrha</I>. I have said earlier and say now that in the Ma&#x301;gadhii language, the word derived from <I>grha</I> is <I>ghar</I>. Had the original word been <I>ra&#x301;jagrha</I>, then today in the Ma&#x301;gadhii language its form would have been <I>ra&#x301;jaghara</I> (<I>ra&#x301;jagrha &gt; ra&#x301;jagarha &gt; ra&#x301;jaghara-a &gt; ra&#x301;jaghara</I>). However, that is not the case; in the present Magahii <I></I>language, the word is <I>ra&#x301;jagira</I>, and this means that the original word must have indisputably been <I>ra&#x301;jagiri</I>, that is, royal mountain. This place [<I>ra&#x301;jagira</I>] was at one time the capital of Magadh. Perhaps this accounts for the name <I>ra&#x301;jagiri</I>, and not because <I></I>it is a high mountain, for there are many higher mountains in the realm of Magadh. Similarly we get <I>mudgagiri&gt;muun&#x32D;gagiri&gt; muun&#x32D;gira&gt;muun&#x32D;ger</I> [another place in Bihar]<I></I>. Furthermore, <I>ra&#x301;jagira</I> cannot be spelt with <I>gii</I> but with <I>gi</I>, because <I></I>in the spelling of <I>giri</I> we have only <I>i</I>.
