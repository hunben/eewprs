<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the eight-fold path of bliss propounded by Lord Buddha, the first point is sam&#x301;yak samkalpa &ndash; proper ideology. There cannot be proper movement unless there is a proper ideology, a right destination. For proper progress and right movement, we need a proper ideology and firm resolve. Establishing your goal, with firm determination to realize it, is sam&#x301;kalpa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When Lord Buddha first sat in contemplation, his goal was not fixed. There was doubt and confusion in his mind. He was not certain of what he wanted. And so, whatever he wanted, he was not certain of getting it. But later, when Buddha sat in contemplation (after eating some sweet rice made in milk which was given to him by Suja&#x301;ta&#x301;), he took a complete sam&#x301;kalpa. He fixed his goal and made a firm determination to achieve it. He resolved that he would not get up from his contemplation until he attained spiritual realization, even if his body perished. Then he succeeded in attaining his goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The firmness of a person&#146;s resolve makes him great. However lowly a person may be, he can become great by his determination. If you have a firm resolve to realize your goal, you shall become great. Without a firm resolution, you cannot achieve anything.<!-- /block --></p>
