<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Of all the defects and internal enemies of human beings, fear is the worst. Fear is expressed in various ways. One way is through the inferiority complex which generally arises due to a sense of imperfection or inadequacy. The poor feel inferior before the rich, the weak feel inferior before the strong and the sinners feel inferior in the presence of the Lord. This expression of fear is most harmful to human beings as it creates formidable obstacles on the path of progress. Suppose one has done something undesirable &ndash; suppose one has committed a serious mistake: the resultant inferiority complex prevents one from undertaking any important task. One is afraid to stand before Parama&#x301;tma, thinking, &ldquo;I am a sinner, how can I face Him?&rdquo; But the scriptures say that human beings should not permit such thoughts to enter the mind. They should never think that they are sinners. If one constantly thinks, &ldquo;I&#146;m a sinner, I&#146;m a sinner&rdquo;, one loses one&#146;s inherent mental strength. Such thoughts are to be avoided. What humans should think is, &ldquo;Whatever I may be, good or bad, I belong to Parama&#x301;tma, so why should my mind be weakened by hesitation, confusion or an inferiority complex?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the Giita&#x301;, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Api cet sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii bhajate ma&#x301;mananyabha&#x301;k<br>Sa&#x301;pi pa&#x301;pavinirnukto mucyate bhava bandhana&#x301;t.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Those who are worse than sinners, to whom do they belong? They certainly belong to Parama Purus&#x301;a. No one is beyond Him or outside Him. When Parama Purus&#x301;a is the owner of this universe, the Supreme Lord of this universe, is He not also the Lord of the sinners? Then why should sinners be afraid of Him? They will also attain Him one day.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Api cet sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii bhajate ma&#x301;nanyabha&#x301;k.&rdquo; A sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii is such a despicable sinner that even ordinary sinners call him a sinner. If the sinners of sinners take shelter in Parama Purus&#x301;a with undivided attention, that is, if they withdraw their psychic propensities from all other objects and direct them towards Him, they will attain Him. They will forget that they are sinners and will remember that they belong to Parama Purus&#x301;a alone. Those who take shelter in Him with this undivided mind will be freed of all their sins and worldly bondages, and will ultimately attain salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->No one should ever think, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I have sinned&rdquo;, but rather, &ldquo;Whatever I may be, I certainly belong to Parama Purus&#x301;a. Whatever wealth I possess &ndash; in body, mind and soul &ndash; has been given by Parama Purus&#x301;a. I will make the best use of this to serve Him, to make Him happy. I have not come to this world for self-gratification, but for one purpose: to make the best use of the wealth that Parama Purus&#x301;a has bestowed on me by serving the progeny of Parama Purus&#x301;a in this expressed world. If I serve His creation, He will certainly be pleased with me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Those who serve humanity, serve Parama Purus&#x301;a at the same time. To please Parama Purus&#x301;a one will have to serve humanity, serve His children. And while doing this one should be free of any kind of inferiority complex or sin. Whatever you may be, you belong to Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus, do virtuous deeds from this very moment. This will surely bring about your well-being.<!-- /block --></p>
