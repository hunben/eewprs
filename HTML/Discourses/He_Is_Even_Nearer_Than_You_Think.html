<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I further repeat;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Dura&#x301;t sudu&#x301;re tadiha&#x301;ntike ca pashyatsvihaeva nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;ya&#x301;m<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Entity, is vast. Not only is He bigger than the biggest, He is more subtle than the subtlest. Is this Entity close to human beings, or is He far away? One of His names is &ldquo;Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u&rdquo; which means that entity who remains covert in everything, who is an integral part of even the minutest particle, who lies covert in the entire expressed universe. So an intelligent person endowed with a universal outlook, without entertaining any inferiority or superiority complex, will look upon everything as the manifestation of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and strive to move ahead in unison with all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->He is everywhere. If, however, one thinks that He is far away, He will remain even further away. In this context, two terms &ndash; &ldquo;dur&rdquo; (far) and &ldquo;sudur&rdquo; (very, very far) &ndash; are used. &ldquo;Dur&rdquo; means quite far but still within the scope of measurement, such as something thousands of miles or light years away. But if the distance cannot be measured and all mathematical calculations miserably fail, the term &ldquo;sudur&rdquo; &ndash; very, very far &ndash; is used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Some people think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is far away and, showing no mercy, has left them deserted in a corner. They believe He thinks about everyone except themselves. To such people my reply is, &ldquo;He thinks about everyone. If He&#146;s not thinking about you, He must be thinking about not thinking about you. If He thinks that He will think about everyone except you, He is also thinking about you.&rdquo; So it logically follows that He thinks about everyone, excluding none. But even so, if someone thinks that Parama Purus&#x301;a does not think about him or her, He may remain a very distant object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->On the other hand, if anyone thinks that Parama Purus&#x301;a is near, that He is right here (in Sam&#x301;skrta, &ldquo;iha&rdquo; means &ldquo;here&rdquo;), He may be so near that the proximity cannot be measured (&ldquo;iha&#x301;ntike&rdquo; means &ldquo;nearer than near&rdquo;). We say &ldquo;one mile away&rdquo; or &ldquo;two cubits wide&rdquo; &ndash; this is &ldquo;iha&rdquo;. But when the object is so near that the gap cannot be measured, it is called &ldquo;iha&#x301;ntike&rdquo;, You think Parama Purus&#x301;a is very near, but may be He is even nearer than that &ndash; His closeness is immeasurable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Pashyatsvihaeva nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;ya&#x301;m&rdquo;. One who has acquired inner vision &ndash; the capacity to look within, to experience or realize something by introverting the optical nerve &ndash; by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is a blessed person indeed. What is that &ldquo;I&rdquo;-feeling in each and every entity? What is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I shall eat&rdquo;, &ldquo;I shall speak&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I shall do&rdquo;? It is that Supreme &ldquo;I&rdquo; which lies hidden in the small &ldquo;I&rdquo;. So let people repeat the is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra, meditate and sing kiirtan for their Supreme &ldquo;I&rdquo; which remains hidden in their small &ldquo;I&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Those who don&#146;t have this feeling and think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is far away, may cry themselves hoarse, yet their sobs will not be heard by Him. The actual truth is that the Supreme Entity lies covert in the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling of all living creatures. So He is not far from anything; rather, He is the very &ldquo;I&rdquo; of each and every microcosm. With this idea or feeling in mind, spiritual aspirants should start their spiritual practice. To be ensconced in this supreme idea is the culminating point of all sadhana.<!-- /block --></p>
