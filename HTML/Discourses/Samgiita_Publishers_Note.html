<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar understood the urgent need of cultural renaissance for the all-round progress of humanity. As a philosopher, following his own intuitive approach, he focused unprecedented light on various aspects of the cultivation of art, literature, and music. This light included revelations of the importance, for the human spiritual journey, of the discovery of aesthetic science; while one of his greatest contributions was to identify the science of supra-aesthetics and to explain how aesthetics is transformed into supra-aesthetics. And on the practical level, he on the one hand founded institutions that wholeheartedly and explicitly supported and encouraged various aesthetic pursuits; and on the other hand personally composed a body of songs called Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita which finally came to total 5018 compositions. The present book is a compilation that consists of his discourses on the subject of <I>sam&#x301;giita,</I> and also of various of his own Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita songs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><I>Sam&#x301;giita</I> is the combination of song, dance and instrumental music, so the organization of this book that obviously suggested itself and that we have followed has been to present first the author&#146;s discourses on <I>sam&#x301;giita</I> as a whole, then his discourses on song, then his discourses on dance, and finally his discourses on instrumental music. Following some of the discourses are one or two of the author&#146;s Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita songs that were found to express nicely some of the themes of the preceding discourse. At the beginning of the book also one such song has been given, and at the end, another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita does not only mean songs written by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar. The word <I>prabha&#x301;ta</I> also means &ldquo;dawn&rdquo;, so Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita heralds the dawn of a new era of music. Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar used the charming and melodious medium of song to doubly ensure that the ideas in his discourses would penetrate the core of listeners&#146; beings and be translated thence into action. It is worth mentioning here that the author referred to his own Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita songs in one discourse of this book, and also included one of his songs in another discourse.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Out of the vast body of Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita songs (5018 songs in all) there are scores of songs which are in conformity with the contents of various discourses of this book. But only twenty of the most relevant songs have been selected and included.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The publishers would like to think of their work on this book as a very small part of the tribute that they should pay to the author in the year 2007, the silver jubilee year of Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The last four discourses of the Sam&#x301;giita part of the book are on the subject of <I>kiirtana</I>. As the author writes, &ldquo;So <I>kiirtana</I> is not just song. Dance is also a part of it, and instrumental music is also a part of it.&rdquo; Therefore <I>kiirtana</I> is <I>sam&#x301;giita.</I> And not only that, &ldquo;. . . among all forms of <I>sam&#x301;giita,</I> <I>kiirtana</I> is the best.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Several of the discourses in the book consist of passages excerpted, for the sake of conciseness, from one or more longer discourses. In order to get a more complete idea of the author&#146;s viewpoints on culture, art, literature, aesthetic science, etc., we suggest that the readers try to go through the full discourses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The author himself selected the discourses for the original Bengali (1987) edition of this book. At the time of making the selection, he decided to change the titles of some of the discourses as compared to titles that had been used previously. This has resulted, in this English edition, in three discourse titles different from the titles used in some previous collection of discourses. In order to help researchers, we have mentioned, at the end of such discourses &ndash; along with the source book for the discourse &ndash; the original title of the discourse. To summarize that information here: the discourse &ldquo;Are Sam&#x301;giita and Supra-Aesthetic Science Inseparable?&rdquo; has appeared previously as &ldquo;Supra-Aesthetic Science and Music&rdquo;, &ldquo;What I Said in Switzerland&rdquo; as &ldquo;Dance, Mudra&#x301; and Tantra&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava <I></I>Dance &ndash; What and Why?&rdquo; simply as &ldquo;Ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->To further assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate at the end of these publisher&#146;s notes &ndash; in addition to the original language of each speech, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if other than in this book, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the translators have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->This book is the result of the assistance and support lent by many persons in various ways. Their sincere efforts are helping us develop an ever more professional system of work, so that the immense contribution of Shrii P.R. Sarkar can be presented in the best possible manner. Some esteemed readers, or better to say, lovers, of Shrii P.R. Sarkar&#146;s books have come forward to make arrangements for the continuous publication of his books over the coming years; thanks to them, progress is being made in building up a committed and dependable sales network. Any interested person can come forward to participate in this effort.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Ideally every new book translation undergoes initially a draft by the main translator, then &ldquo;first editing&rdquo;, then &ldquo;second editing&rdquo;, then final verification. Other important functions include coordination of the different steps, and the development and management of a sales network. Some of those who have contributed to these efforts: Viiresh Bose translated (from the original Bengali) most of the excerpts from <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I>. Deva&#x301;shiis&#x301;a translated &ldquo;The Inner Science of Surasaptaka&rdquo;, &ldquo;Classifications of Flute&rdquo; and the second part of &ldquo;Two Folk Songs &ndash; Bha&#x301;t&#x301;iya&#x301;li and Bha&#x301;oya&#x301;ia&#x301;&rdquo;, and did the final editing of two discourses. Prof. A&#x301;ditya Mohanty translated the first part of &ldquo;Two Folk Songs &ndash; Bha&#x301;t&#x301;iya&#x301;li and Bha&#x301;oya&#x301;ia&#x301;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava Dance &ndash; What and Why?&rdquo; A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Priyashiva&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta translated all twenty Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita songs and did the first editing of all portions of the book that had not previously been published in English. Ga&#x301;yattrii Ghista and Ta&#x301;raka Ghista did the second editing of all portions of the book that had not previously been published in English. Ma&#x301;dhava Basak did typing, DTP work and office work. Avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; A&#x301;nanda Gaorii A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya&#x301; checked and edited ten Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita songs. Shrii Vasanthan Parameswara proofread the entire book after its second editing. A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Nityasatya&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta checked several music-related points for which he was best qualified. Kirit Dave took on sales management and coordination work.<!-- /block --></p>
