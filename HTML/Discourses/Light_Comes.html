<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Through all works, big and small, humanity has to be awakened. Humanity in its fullest sense is Divinity, and its perfection is Brahmatva (Brahmahood). The aspirant must not forget this even for a moment.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The world is a panorama of endless movement, a vast assemblage of rainbow colours. If upon seeing it, people think that they have really attained something permanent, or become intoxicated with the colours, they will make a great mistake. People are attracted to minute portions of this earth, and embracing them, seek the path of self-gratification. But long before they attain satisfaction, those minute portions, those colours, vanish into nothingness, leaving them in endless frustration and lamentation, like blind, headless demons. This is not a decree of God, it is the law of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Cognitive Principle, which is the only knowable entity for all other beings, is the sole permanent entity. To attain something permanent, one must not run after the petty pleasures of the world. Rather, knowing that eternal Entity, that permanent Entity, to be the only goal of life, one has to propel all one&#146;s mental propensities towards Him. One must not waste one&#146;s potentialities mistaking the temporal for the eternal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->All created objects are sitting in the midst of the multitude of finite things, and with the help of a finite unit mind, it is impossible, either in theory or in practice, to think of the Infinite. When the mind becomes intoxicated with the thought of the Infinite, then the finite mind transcends its own limits and loses itself in a state of endless peace. This is the highest attainment.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The innumerable structures which arise as a result of the countless vibrational undulations of the Supreme Entity, have on the one hand enlivened every step of creation with restless vitality and blissful sweetness &ndash; and on the other, given scope for the mistaken understanding of Him as many, not one. From this mistake arises all life&#146;s delicious sweetness, its spicy flavours &ndash; and also its piercing bitter scorpion stings, its heart-rending moans of grief. Hence in One we see many, in all their perfections and imperfections, in all their sweetness and bitterness, all due to the special role of the indriyas &ndash; sense organs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In the first stage of human life, when people notice the colourful processions of various tanma&#x301;tras such as form, taste, smell, colour, touch, etc. they immediately become attracted towards them. The entire universe appears to be a grand caravan of many colours: it seizes their senses and their minds rush after it, taking it to be the goal of life. In the first stage, this enchanting material panorama propels people from their inner world to external life. If at that stage, someone tells them to move towards the internal world, they become irritated and annoyed. They think &ldquo;Oh, I&#146;m quite fine here!&rdquo; Blending their colours with the colours of all, strolling on soft carpets of green grass, they think, &ldquo;All these things are meant for me!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->This material-oriented existence is the first stage of human life. At this stage, one wants to express only one thing with the whole of one&#146;s being, and that is, &ldquo;I exist, only I exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Trials and tribulations compel people to ponder deeply; sorrows inspire them to analyse the law of cause and effect. Their wounded hearts want to be soothed with a healing balm from an Entity greater than themselves. They realize then that there is a greater Entity than their little selves. Whatever might be their relation with that Entity, and whether that Entity is within their reach or not, they cherish the hope of gaining something from Him: they cry out, &ldquo;Save me, protect me!&rdquo; Then they change their mental tune and say, &ldquo;I exist, You also exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->When this relationship of hope and fulfilment fails to remove their internal dissatisfactions, when the greenness of the external world fails to moisten the desert of their minds, when the seeds of their desires do not sprout, then they realize that they will have to go still deeper inside &ndash; the key to the solution lies deeper within. They are still within locked doors and windows; in search of the key, they move inwards, but they are unable to find it. They do not feel that they are even near a guide &ndash; far less in close association. Concentrating all their mental anguish, they begin to shed tears in their minds and, beating their heads, say to the unknown Lord of their life:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I have spent my life in vain;<br>Such a great Lord I did not worship &ndash;<br>I lost the greatest jewel.<br>I am indeed an unfortunate creature;<br>I never enjoyed<br>Even a drop of nectar<br>Of the love of God.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a (the Supreme Consciousness) is the Supreme Cognitive Faculty; nothing is outside Him. He too feels the inner agony of despairing people in the core of His heart, and shows them the soothing path of enlightenment. Then those despairing people cry out in the exuberance of their joy, &ldquo;You exist, O Lord, I also exist!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->They continue to move into the inner world. The charming allurements of the external world no longer keep their minds in thrall. The dazzling splendour of form and colour, their glittering attraction, no longer evokes any response in the innermost recesses of their minds. The radiance of the colourful world and the effulgence of their inner life become one. Just as &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Prasad says, what you were in the beginning;<br>You will become in the end &ndash;<br>Just as bubbles rising from the water<br>Into the water will merge again.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The indriyas&#146; externalization and internalization of tanma&#x301;tras from the external world then appears to be a play of Maya (illusion). The external world merges into the internal world and ultimately there remains only one Entity &ndash; &ldquo;You exist, only You exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->So it has been said, <b>Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nasya&#x301;yam&#x301; bha&#x301;sate na&#x301;nyathaeva &ndash;</b> &ldquo;Of all knowledge, only this remains.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The microcosmic nucleus approaches the Macrocosmic nucleus not through Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na (knowledge) and Karma (action) but through Bhakti or devotion. Then why should the people cultivate Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na or Karma? They do so in order that their devotion may become more intense, not for any other reason. People don&#146;t eat pickle to fill the stomach but to whet their appetite so that they can enjoy their food more. Similarly, devotees cultivate Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and Karma not for their physical growth but to gather the strength to move on the path of devotion with greater acceleration. This movement towards Parama Purus&#x301;a is Bhakti or devotion. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and Karma are aids and therefore Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and Karma should both be cultivated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->(Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram, 152)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->People are heading towards Parama Purus&#x301;a (The Supreme Consciousness) through their devotion. The microcosmic point is heading towards the nuclear point of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The closer it comes, the more it realizes the proximity of the Macrocosmic nucleus and the more the nature of the point changes. The closer a drop of water moves towards the sun, the more it is transformed into vapour. When it nears the sun, it no longer remains a drop of water but becomes transformed into a mass of fire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Let us use a better analogy. A block of iron advances towards the sun. When it nears the sun it loses its solidarity and is converted into molten iron. It melts due to its closeness to the sun. When it comes even closer, it changes from molten iron into gaseous iron. When it comes into closest proximity to the sun it becomes one with the sun as the iron turns into a purely luminous mass. Its existence can no longer be separated from the sun.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->In the beginning the microcosmic point possesses only microscopic qualities. The more the sa&#x301;dhaka advances, the more his or her qualities change. In the process, when one comes into close proximity with the Macrocosmic nucleus, one loses one&#146;s former qualities and assumes the qualities of the object of ideation. When the microcosmic point comes into close proximity to the Macrocosmic nucleus, there can no longer remain two points. They merge into one, the Macrocosmic point. The unit entity will merge with the Supreme Consciousness. In the end there is no dualism. Dualism cannot survive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->(Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram, 150)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The unit entities, the Jiivas, are compelled to act under the impact of two personalities. One is the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; which craves to accumulate so many things, big or small, and give so many things to society. The small &ldquo;I&rdquo; creates a world of its own centring around that little &ldquo;I&rdquo;, a world of illusion wherein the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; is entrapped and where it considers itself to be the supreme monarch.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Simultaneously, there is a larger world, the much larger world of Parama Purus&#x301;a, a world where the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; is a mere bubble. All the hopes and aspirations, all the desires and urges of that insignificant bubble residing within the vast mind of Parama attain supreme fulfilment only at the time when it merges itself in the main stream of the Cosmic flow. Otherwise, individual hopes and desires remain forever unfulfilled and unrealized. Human beings cherish thousands of desires in their hearts, but those desires generally remain unfulfilled because the waves of individual human desires do not maintain parallelism with the waves of the Cosmic desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->(Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram, 41)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The movement of each and every object of the universe is in a particular way, unless redirected in some other way by a stronger mental force. But the case of human beings is different &ndash; they have certain specialties of their own. A river moves from the mountain towards the sea, and also from the sea towards the mountain. But in the case of human minds, of human microcosms, the movement may be from the mountain towards the sea, and also from the sea towards the mountain &ndash; this is the speciality of the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The objectivity of the human mind, unlike other entities of this universe, may move from subtle towards crude, or from crude to subtle. That is why it has been said, &ldquo;Mind is the cause of bondage, and this very mind is also the cause of liberation, of emancipation.&rdquo; If the movement towards crude is encouraged, the mind &ndash; and at the same time the entire existence of the human being &ndash; will be converted into crude matter. It will be a path of negative prati-sain&#x32D;cara (negative evolution). And if the movement towards subtle is encouraged, then the entire existence will be converted either into Cosmic Mind or into Cosmic Cognitive Faculty. If the very I-feeling is surrendered at the altar of Supreme Existence, then the entire existence will become one with the Supreme Cognitive Principle &ndash; one will be come omniscient, and all-knowing entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->(&ldquo;Existential Flow and Its Culminating Point&rdquo;, Calcutta, 1986)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;ottama (the Cosmic Nucleus or Parama Purus&#x301;a) is associated with Jiivas or microcosms; and Jagat or world through His Otah Yoga or pervasive association and Protah Yoga or individual association. It is enormously difficult to be Purus&#x301;ottama. What is the difficulty? He must always remain associated with everything and everyone. None of His created beings should be neglected or slighted: He must associate Himself with the minds of each and everyone, listen to their thoughts and alleviate their sufferings, whether they are literate or illiterate, rich or poor. He must shoulder the responsibility for the entire creation. Then and then alone does He deserve to be Purus&#x301;ottama. He is no Purus&#x301;ottama who remains in His ivory tower, in different to the sorrows and sufferings of the created beings, but accepting their worship. To be Purus&#x301;ottama one has to remain associated with the created beings, both collectively and individually through Otah and Protah Yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The personal relationship with each and every individual, with every particle of dust, every drop of water, is termed Otah Yoga. That is, Purus&#x301;ottama is aware of your individual thoughts and feelings, your joys and sorrows and He takes suitable steps to remove your distress and afflictions. Here I deliberately used the word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo;. It implies that He has to take steps to remove one&#146;s personal wants, sufferings and miseries without jeopardizing the collective interest. For example, if the sunset is delayed for one hour for the good of one individual, it would go against the collective interest. This He cannot do. Although He cannot go against the collective interest, He is bound to pay attention to the needs and feelings of every individual. This is what is called Otah Yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->(Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram, 61)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Suppose there is a clear mirror, and before it you place a large, red rose. If you look at the mirror, what do you see? A red rose. From a distance, one may say that the mirror is red but is it actually so? The mirror is not red. It has only been apparently coloured by the red rose. Just as the mirror becomes apparently coloured red, the human soul is also apparently coloured by virtue and vice. Whenever the unit consciousness comes in contact with any action, psychic thought-wave or mental feeling, it is apparently affected, but not actually so, just as the mirror is not actually coloured red.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->In the same way, when the unit beings (Jiivas) come near Parama Purus&#x301;a, the impact of their good or bad thoughts and actions becomes distinct and is gradually expelled from the mind, because the colours of those worldly deeds, good or bad, cannot go near Parama Purus&#x301;a. When the unit beings come into close proximity to Parama Purus&#x301;a, then there remains only His reflection. When the reflected images merge into the original substance, the images cease to exist. Likewise, when the reflected images of unit consciousness merge with Parama Purus&#x301;a, there remains only One, the real Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is why He says: &ldquo;Accept Me alone, not My reflections. I will liberate you from all sins. Do not worry.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->(Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram, 162)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->An ordinary Jiiva (unit being) can become extraordinary by means of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and Karma, by virtue of refined intellect and selfless service. When such highly evolved individuals merge with Parama Purus&#x301;a, they render the Macrocosmic existence much more meaningful, much more significant. A small drop of the essence of screw-pine flower can add scent to a hundred drops of water. So the absorption of such an evolved being into Parama Purus&#x301;a adds to the charm of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->(Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram, 168)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Suppose you hear some sound (sound is a tanma&#x301;tra or &ldquo;inferential expression&rdquo;); suppose you touch something (touch is another tanma&#x301;tra); you see something and you think something &ndash; these are all Tanma&#x301;tras. The apparent controller of all these inferential expressions is your mind. But there is another entity hidden behind your mind. For instance, while you watch a puppet show, you feel delighted to see how the puppets move their hands and feet, but you don&#146;t see the person who manages the beautiful show by pulling the strings from behind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Similarly, we notice the inferential expressions of microcosms &ndash; we come to know how one sings melodious songs, dances beautiful rhythmic dances, delivers wonderful discourses, etc. But we can&#146;t see the Entity who pulls the strings from behind and runs the show. And the funniest thing is this: the speaker, the singer, the dancer thinks that he or she is the agent, the doer, and takes the entire credit of the performance. People don&#146;t care to think of the Entity that pulls the strings from behind; or if they are more foolish, they think that others see them alone, not the Entity who pulls the strings from behind, so the credit should come to them. There are people who think like this. However, you move and dance under His control. He makes you dance from behind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->(Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram, 179)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->What is the cult of devotion? Each and every object of this universe is attracted to other objects. There is a mutual relationship between a very large star, a planet, or a satellite and a small meteor or even a stone. One attracts the other and because of this mutual attraction, balance is maintained in the universe. If any person even mistakenly thinks in a weak moment that I am a useless entity, that my existence is meaningless &ndash; if a tiny ant thinks that its existence is of no value or if a hundred-year-old lady thinks that her physical existence is of no value whatsoever and as such it matters little whether she survives or passes away &ndash; then he or she is thoroughly mistaken. Everyone&#146;s physical existence is equally valuable. The main question is how one&#146;s existence can be best utilized. There is nothing in this universe which is totally valueless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->There is mutual attraction everywhere. A tiny ant attracts a large entity and the large entity attracts the tiny ant. In the sentimental flow of devotion, when a per son thinks that he or she is attracting the vast universe including Parama Purus&#x301;a, and I am also being attracted, this conscious feeling of mutual attraction is termed Bhakti (devotion) in psychological parlance. Whether literate or illiterate, young or old, one endowed with this element of devotion is said to have a successful career, for the highest fulfilment of microcosmic existence lies in the very capacity of attracting the Great. The greatest Entity is attracting you with a mighty force. You are also attracting the greatest Entity with your limited force &ndash; you are not inferior to anyone.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Here is another question. Why does He create? What is the necessity of creation? Human beings and all other creatures come here to undergo so many sufferings. Then, what is this creation? So many millions of people came here on this earth for the last four thousand years, but they could not give a satisfactory reply to this eternal question. But when the devotees came, they said, &ldquo;It is not at all a knotty problem. It is very, simple. You learned scholars, you cannot give the reply. But I know what is the reply. My Lord was alone in this universe before creation. Just think, if you are alone in the jungle your life becomes miserable. And, in this vast space my Supreme Father was alone. Just to save Himself from the sufferings of monotony He created.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->And, where did the material come from? The material came from His mind, because everything in this universe is within Him; nothing is without. So no material can come from outside. In His ectoplasmic stuff, that is, in His mind, is the material, and He creates everything within His mind. There are so many animate and inanimate objects, but they are all within His mind and not outside. A person may be educated, may be illiterate, may be of fair complexion, may be of dark complexion, may be poor or may be rich, but all are within His mind. All are His psychic creations, all are His loving children, the loving progeny of the loving Progenitor. So, nobody is unimportant, nobody is insignificant. Nobody should be suppressed, oppressed or repressed.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Now, these created beings, they being the progeny of the same father, are members of the same Universal Family. We must not forget this supreme fact. Everybody is within His mind. Can a sinner go beyond the periphery of His mind, when there is nothing beyond His mind? No, nobody can go beyond the periphery of His mind. And, He cannot say, &ldquo;You naughty chap, get out.&rdquo; If such an order is given by Him, that naughty child will then and there say, &ldquo;Oh Supreme Father, where am I to go? Because you are infinite, everything is within you. If you say, &lsquo;Oh naughty chap, get out,&rsquo; then certainly there is something outside Your mind, and I am to go there. And, if there is something outside, then You are not infinite. So, O Supreme Father, either you please withdraw Your order or change Your name.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Sinners are within His mind, and virtuous people are also within His mind.

<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->This is the quality of Parama Purus&#x301;a, that He has created the unit beings, and, it is a sort of drama of His to keep them in bondage. A playwright gives a particular role to a particular person. In the same way this Great Director of the Great Drama has involved everyone in his or her own way. In doing so He finds happiness, and so that is what He does. He also does this to make things more interesting.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->He has involved everyone in one or another role, and He has picked a special role for Himself.

In spite of the possibility of being confused due to the absence of knowledge, or being inert due to the absence of action, one can attain the Supreme Spiritual Stance only through devotion.

But the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma (highest Unqualified Consciousness), because of its eternal freedom from the bondages of Prakrti, can never be the cause of others&#146; liberation. Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma does not even think to give liberation to others. Thus only those who have attained the Supreme Rank by means of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and then have voluntarily submitted to the influence of Prakrti for a limited period, with the vow of doing welfare to humanity, and have assumed a human body &ndash; only they deserve to be called guru. As long as they remain in human form, they remain under the influence of Prakrti. But after giving up the human frame, they again dissolve back into the state of formlessness. So only that Entity beyond the scope of the gun&#x301;as (binding principles) is liberated in the true sense of the term, and it is only that Entity who can be a guru.

Suddenly and forcefully ejecting a ruffian who has occupied a house for a very long time will be extremely difficult, particularly when for long he was treated as a tenant and looked upon as a respectable person. He would never vacate the house easily, without much effort, and would certainly place all sorts of obstacles in the way of the one trying to make him leave.

Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice as taught by the Sadguru is the way to remove Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;: it is only success in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; that can make Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; forsake one. Hence the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; that attempts to subdue Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; will naturally be resisted by its negative force, so that the obstacles created by it may compel one to give up the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Obstacles in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; should therefore be regarded as an indication of success in one&#146;s attempts to remove Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Obstacles are not created by God or by the Sadguru, for they wish every unit entity to become emancipated like themselves.

These fixed days are called upava&#x301;sa<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> or fasting days, since during these days people, keeping their minds engaged in spiritual matters, &ldquo;live closer&rdquo; to God, and any possibility of mental degradation is averted.<!-- /block --></p>

We should think carefully how far human beings have progressed in the physical and psychic spheres during this past million years. There is a marked difference in structure between those prehistoric humans who lived one million years ago, and the humans of today. The brain of those ancient people was small, but the skull was big. The hands were quite long; the lymphatic glands were very active. They could dance and jump well; they could easily jump from one branch of a tree to another branch, just like monkeys of today.<!-- /block --></p>

Those early humans invented various way to win battles, and their nerve cells became more and more developed. They evolved various theories, and sought methods to remember old wisdom. Out of their deep thought they gradually produced drawings to preserve these memories; thus pictorial script evolved. In China today pictorial-based script is still predominant. Human beings developed all these things in order to survive and supply their necessities. In this way they gradually subdued the animal world also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="366"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=366 type=paragraph -->Then the battle amongst themselves began, and in the process those who were less intelligent were destroyed. Those who had little intellect were exploited and degraded. Those who were a bit intelligent were considered as higher caste people, and those who were still more intelligent were considered as the highest class in human society. Thus ensued a war of intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="367"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=367 type=paragraph -->Gradually those early humans developed science in the physical sphere and philosophy and spirituality in the psychic sphere. And while inventing philosophy, they began to search for the answers to many questions. During this period of search, Sada&#x301;shiva appeared, about 7000 years ago. He consolidated all human endeavours, and gave them a particular form and system. As a result, education, medicine, dance and music took a new form, and a new life.<!-- /block --></p>

This may be partially true for a particular planet, but in fact the total thermal death of the universe will never occur. Before the death of any particular planet, the humans of that planet will migrate to other planets by means of developed conveyances. So there is no reason to be alarmed by imaginary fears of the thermal death of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>

Remember, I have not said &ldquo;human welfare,&rdquo; because in our world, not only are there humans, there are also birds and animals, trees and plants. Shiva belongs to all; and for all living beings, He gave His all. Hence the people called Him Sada&#x301;shiva; sada&#x301; means &ldquo;always,&rdquo; and shiva means &ldquo;welfare.&rdquo; So Sada&#x301;shiva means &ldquo;one whose only vow of existence is to promote the all-round welfare of all living beings.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="374"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=374 type=paragraph -->Whenever Shiva noticed tears in the eyes of His devotees He felt restless.

Even though Shiva realized this, He would not change His ways. He never said. &ldquo;I have made a mistake by forgiving those people, by granting them boons.&rdquo; Thus this noble personality, the remover of all the afflictions of the universe, was lovingly called A&#x301;shutos&#x301;a, &ldquo;One who is easily pleased.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

These people, who had been devoid of any social consciousness and mutual love for each other, built a sweet and loving environment revolving around Shiva; they created a social atmosphere of peace and happiness, a cool and shady bower of peace. For the first time in history, people began to realize that they were human beings.<!-- /block --></p>

We all belong to one clan &ndash; Shiva&#146;s clan.&rdquo; Thus the prehistoric humans, united by their common bond of the fatherhood of Shiva, strengthened the foundation of their mutual relationships.

In fact, He worked constantly towards that end. And to live in peace and harmony, there must be a supreme ideology accepted by all, because whenever there are ideological differences, physical conflicts between individuals and groups are bound to occur, and peaceful social life becomes impossible. So Shiva held one ideal before them: &ldquo;Remember, you are all the loving children of the Supreme Father. You are entitled to live in this world as the sons and daughters of one and the same Cosmic Father.

<a name="385"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=385 type=paragraph -->The people of those days were acquainted with rhythm, but not with the musical scale (sura-saptaka). After close observation Shiva concluded that the sounds produced by various birds and animals maintain a harmonious adjustment with the undulations of the sound waves of the universe. Based on the sounds of seven creatures, Shiva evolved seven musical notes. The music of the present-day world is entirely based on those seven musical notes. It is a matter of great regret that people have forgotten this science of music, whose foundation was laid by the intense efforts of Shiva. Nowadays, instead of considering music as a valuable asset to spiritual practice, they take it as a hobby, a means of livelihood, or a mere pastime. The intense effort which Shiva invested in this science is conspicuously absent today.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="387"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=387 type=paragraph -->Shiva observed that in the bodies of different creatures, the various glands were either over-active or under-active, either over-secreting or under-secreting. As a result, those creatures expressed themselves in various ways. Shiva intensively researched all these factors, and finally invented mudra&#x301; (gesture in dance). Each and every mudra&#x301; affects certain human glands in a particular way and thus influences people&#146;s minds accordingly. This was Shiva&#146;s contribution to the world of dance. In those days, people wrongly considered the random movement of the limbs to be dance. Only after the addition of mudra&#x301;s was it elevated to the status of classical dance.<!-- /block --></p>

At such times it stops, becomes confused and begins moving in another direction. When one flow stops and changes into another, that transitional point is called Yuga Sandhi. The particular flow of society is known as Yuga or age. One particular age ends and a new age follows. One set of ideas and values ends and a new set begins. At the transitional point, human beings become confused. They lose the ability to discriminate between Dharma and Adharma, what they should and should not do.

<a name="443"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=443 type=paragraph -->There are two ways to withdraw the indriyas (sensory and motor organs) in order to direct the mind towards the Supreme Consciousness. One is to direct the mind inwardly, and the other is to keep all the indriyas engaged in the same type of work. So while inventing Kiirtana, this science was taken into account. In Kiirtana what does the tongue do? What it does best &ndash; it speaks. The vocal cords move in uttering words. The ears listen to the uttered words and the hands and feet move also. Thus all the indriyas are engaged; they are not permitted to do this or that. Just as ghosts, when not employed, break the necks of their victims (there is a popular story that goes like this), similarly, the indriyas also must be kept engaged. The legs move in the style of the Lalita dance, the hands are engaged, and the ears are engaged in listening. Kiirtana is so popular because in Kiirtana all the ten sensory and motor organs together with the mind are kept engaged.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="444"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=444 type=paragraph -->Moreover, there is also a system for musical accompaniment in Kiirtana, because sometimes while doing Kiirtana our ears may be distracted. For instance, while a person is doing Kiirtana they may also hear a lady saying to another lady, &ldquo;Hello sister, what did you cook today?&rdquo; So normally a mrdanga (drum) is prescribed, for playing of mrdanga serves the purpose of attracting the mind and helping it associate with the vibrations of the Kiirtana. Thus immediately the mind returns to the ideation of the Kiirtana. So there is a large science in Kiirtana.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="652"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=652 type=paragraph -->Human beings emerged on this earth some 1,000,000 years ago. Perhaps some of you have seen the fossils of human beings which are nearly half a million years old.

They will continue to live for some time more, and undergo some more change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="653"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=653 type=paragraph -->Similarly, on other planets as well, the bodies of beings similar to humans, which have been built in accordance with the particular environmental conditions, will also undergo change in the future. The course that changes will take depends upon physical make-up and psychic evolution. If the human brain or its cranium is small in size, it cannot accommodate much intellect. So, for the expression of greater intellect, the human cranium must be large In size. In primitive times, the huge dinosaurs had huge bodies but very small brains. Some of you have seen the fossils of these animals in our museum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="654"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=654 type=paragraph -->The more people advance, the more the body undergoes change. The greater the physical evolution, the more complex the physical structure becomes. It is necessary also, because subtle thoughts and their expression depend upon a complex physical and psychic structure. The mind, which wants to think of so many things, should necessarily possess a developed brain, and to protect the brain one requires a developed cranium. A suitable cranium is not sufficient; one also requires an equally developed nervous system to transmit impulses from the brain to different parts of the body. Moreover, nerve cells and nerve fibres are also not sufficient. One requires developed glands to conceive of new ideas. This means that the human structure must become progressively more complicated. Of all the microcosmic bodies on this planet, the human body is the most complex, for it has to act as the vehicle for the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="661"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=661 type=paragraph -->Human beings have already invented countless destructive weapons which can destroy thousands of people at a time.

Perhaps in future human beings will produce such machines (about which I have already hinted) which have minds also. But even in that case, those minds will be weaker than their creators&#146; minds.
