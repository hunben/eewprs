<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tya&#x301;ja durjana sam&#x301;sargam&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; you should renounce the company of &ldquo;durjana&rdquo;. What is &ldquo;durjana&rdquo;? The man who depraves, who misguides others is called &ldquo;durjana&rdquo;. Now, a particular man may not be durjana for all. Suppose Mr. X is durjana for Mr. Y; he may not be durjana for Mr. Z.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->You see, there are merits and demerits in almost each and every individual. Suppose Mr. X is durjana for Mr. Y. Say, he has got merit worth 20 points and demerit worth 25 points, the resultant 5 points go in favour of demerit, so he is a durjana and he is durjana for Mr. Y. Suppose Mr. Y is a good man, he has got merit worth 15 points and demerit worth 13 points. So the resultant is 2 points in favour of merit. So, he is a good man. But, in his favour the resultant merit is only 2 and in the case of Mr. X the resultant demerit is 5 points. If Mr. Y comes in contact with Mr. X, Mr. X has demerit worth 5 points, Y has merit worth 2 points, and the resultant goes in favour of demerit. Mr. Y will become bad. But, in the case of Mr. Z, suppose merit is 30 points and demerit 15 points, then the resultant is 15 points in favour of merit. Mr. X has only 5 points demerit, so if Mr. X comes in contact with Mr. Z, Mr. X will become good. So for Mr. Z, Mr. X is not durjana; rather he is in a position to uplift the condition of Mr. X. It is not something permanent; it varies from man to man. So this term durjana is a relative term. &ldquo;Tya&#x301;ja durjana sam&#x301;sargam&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; you should avoid the company of a man who is durjana for you, that is, whose resultant demerit is more than your resultant merit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tya&#x301;ja durjana sam&#x301;sargam&#x301;.&rdquo; What should you do? To avoid the company of durjana &ndash; &ldquo;bhaja sa&#x301;dhu sama&#x301;gamam&rdquo; &ndash; you should encourage the company of sa&#x301;dhus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Let us know who a sa&#x301;dhu is? Sa&#x301;dhu means;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Only using a saffron costume does not make a man a sa&#x301;dhu. Sa&#x301;dhu is the inner sa&#x301;dhu. You should be sa&#x301;dhu internally. You may or may not use any external saffron costume. In India, those who were called sa&#x301;dhu used all-white costume and those who were sannya&#x301;siis used an all-saffron costume. Saffron costume for sannya&#x301;siis and white costume for sa&#x301;dhus. The system is that sa&#x301;dhus will use the suffix &ldquo;da&#x301;sa&rdquo; after their names - Govardhana Da&#x301;sa, Yamuna&#x301; Da&#x301;sa, Hari Da&#x301;sa etc. In this way sa&#x301;dhus are to use the suffix da&#x301;sa. And sannya&#x301;siis are to use the suffix a&#x301;nanda after their names &ndash; Viveka&#x301;nanda, Parama&#x301;nanda &ndash; a&#x301;nanda after their names.  This is the technical difference between sa&#x301;dhus and sannya&#x301;siis. In Ananda Marga, they are known as sannya&#x301;siis. An avadhuta is a sannya&#x301;sii. &ldquo;Bhaja Sa&#x301;dhu Sama&#x301;gamam&rdquo;. You should always encourage the company of sa&#x301;dhu people. And now you know the meaning of sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->For each and every living entity one&#146;s personal life is the dearest thing. One loves one&#146;s personal life very much. This is the rule, this is the characteristic of all living beings. But those people who understand this sentiment of living beings and love others with the thought, &ldquo;I should not kill, I should not give them any trouble because they love their life as much as I love my own life&rdquo;, are true sa&#x301;dhus and those who lack this sentiment are not sa&#x301;dhus, they are asa&#x301;dhu. Preaching the gospels of peace, and at the same time slaughtering chickens, is not a proper thing for a sa&#x301;dhu because the one who kills the chickens loves his life and the chickens also love their own lives. So that man lacks the universal sentiment of love. He is not a sa&#x301;dhu. A sa&#x301;dhu must be vegetarian.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhaja sa&#x301;dhu sama&#x301;gamam&rdquo;. You should encourage the company of sa&#x301;dhus. Sa&#x301;dhu &ndash; the detailed meaning is, he who uplifts others in all the strata of life. That is, he who helps others in their physical, psychic and spiritual development is a sa&#x301;dhu. Whoever has got more points than you, more resultant points in favour of merit, is a sa&#x301;dhu for you. This is just like the explanation of durjana. Suppose the resultant merit in your favour is 45 points, and another man has a resultant merit of, say, 60 points. Having 60 points of merit, that man is a sa&#x301;dhu for you. It is a relative term. Utilize each and every moment of your life in enjoying the company of sa&#x301;dhus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Kuru pun&#x301;yam&#x301; ahora&#x301;tram&#x301;&rdquo;. You should be engaged in doing &ldquo;pun&#x301;ya&rdquo; day and night. &ldquo;Ahora&#x301;tra&rdquo; means 24 hours, from sunrise to sunrise. As per occidental calculation, a day is from midnight to midnight and as per oriental system, that is, the system of Asia, a day is from sunrise to sunrise. One day in India means sunrise to sunrise. One day in Europe means midnight to midnight. In Europe, the date changes just after midnight and in India, the date changes after sunrise. That is the system. Day or &ldquo;ahah&rdquo; means from sunrise to sunset and night or &ldquo;ra&#x301;tri&rdquo; means sunset to sunrise, that is, night portion. You should be engaged in doing pun&#x301;ya karma, day and night, ahora&#x301;tram, from sunrise to sunrise. &ldquo;Kuru Pun&#x301;yam&#x301;&rdquo;. What is pun&#x301;yam&#x301;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;dashapura&#x301;n&#x301;es&#x301;u Vya&#x301;sasya vacanadvayam,<br>Paropaka&#x301;rah pun&#x301;ya&#x301;ya pa&#x301;pa&#x301;ya parapiiran&#x301;am.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Vya&#x301;sadeva wrote so many pura&#x301;n&#x301;as. He said that whenever you are engaged in doing some welfare work, you are doing pun&#x301;ya. And when you are working against public interest you are doing pa&#x301;pa. Be engaged in pun&#x301;ya work for twenty four hours; day and night, from sunrise to sunrise. How can one do pun&#x301;yam while sleeping? How can one be engaged in pun&#x301;ya karma? If during wakeful hours one is engaged in pun&#x301;ya karma, then during sleep what will it be? A composure of peace, a composure of welfare. So while sleeping one is also engaged in pun&#x301;ya karma. Be engaged in pun&#x301;ya karma for the entire day and night &ndash; from sunrise to sunrise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In Sam&#x301;skrit, the entire literature is divided into four groups. One is ka&#x301;vya, the second is itikatha&#x301;, the third is itiha&#x301;sa and the fourth is pura&#x301;n&#x301;a. Ka&#x301;vya is &ldquo;Va&#x301;kyam&#x301; rasa&#x301;tmakam&#x301;.&rdquo; When a story has been narrated in a lucid way it is called ka&#x301;vyam. Then itikatha&#x301;: itikatha&#x301; is a proper record of what happened; that is, that which deals with factual statements is itikatha&#x301;. And itiha&#x301;sa is that portion of factual statement that has got educative value and helps you in your upliftment. That portion of itikatha&#x301; is called itiha&#x301;sa. The English term for itikatha&#x301; is &ldquo;history&rdquo;, in French &ldquo;histoire&rdquo;, but there is no English term for itiha&#x301;sa. And the last one is pura&#x301;n&#x301;a. Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a is not a fact, not at all a factual statement, but a story. That story has got educative value. That story helps you in your physical, mental and spiritual upliftment. The Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yana is a pura&#x301;na, the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata is itiha&#x301;sa and the history taught in schools and colleges is itikatha&#x301;. Itiha&#x301;sa is not taught in schools and colleges nowadays. And pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, just now I told you, is a story, but it has educative value. Vya&#x301;sadeva wrote eighteen pura&#x301;n&#x301;as. What was the central idea? Why did he write so many pura&#x301;n&#x301;as? His intention was to preach to the world that pun&#x301;ya means to help the people in their all-round development and pa&#x301;pa means to degrade the people, to misguide the people in all spheres of life. So here the word pun&#x301;ya has been used. You should be engaged in pun&#x301;ya karma, in helping others, for all the twenty four hours.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Smara nityamanityata&#x301;m&rdquo;. You should always remember that you are in a world of passing shows, moving panorama. No picture, no position, no stance shall remain as they are just at present. That is, everything will change, everything is to undergo changes and you should be ready to adapt yourself, to adjust yourself with those changed phases.<!-- /block --></p>
