Who was there to name it, who was there to tell others about it? No one, because human beings had not yet come on earth.

The word ra&#x301;r&#x301;h originated in the ancient Austric language and means a land of red (laterite) soil.

They were linked by [land] that lay sometimes a little above the water level, sometimes a little below.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In that world uninhabited by human beings, the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of those days was older than any other land. The snow-covered mountains of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h gave birth to numerous rivers. These rivers, fed by melting snow, flowed some to the east and some to the southeast, towards the ocean.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Days passed, time passed, from beginninglessness to endlessness. Rainstorms and thunderbolts struck the mountains, and gradually the mountains diminished. Their snowy crowns fell off their heads, their height decreased. As the mountains became smaller and smaller through erosion, each river basin that lay between two mountains became higher. The undulating red soil that we see today in the west of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the undulation that advances ahead of us till it mingles in the remote blue, the undulation that gives a hint of some lost address as it recedes behind us &ndash; that undulating land is our Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>

That plain [to the east of eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h] is known as Samatat&#x301;a in the Sanskrit language and Ba&#x301;gr&#x301;i in the Bengali language. Farther to the east, the sand and silt borne by the rivers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h mingled with the sand and silt of the Brahmaputra and formed Vaun&#x32D;ga,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn10"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn10">10</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  or D&#x301;aba&#x301;k. The people of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h migrated to eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and set up habitation. This happened some lakhs of years ago. If human beings appeared a million years ago, then those inhabitants of the western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of a million years ago found eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h to have been in a ready condition for them even before their birth. Even a portion of northern India arose before the origin of human beings. Samatat and D&#x301;aba&#x301;k, however, originated a little after the appearance on earth of humans. The people of western and eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h removed the forest cover and dwelt in Samatat-Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Human beings originated at a few particular points on this planet. Even without getting into a detailed discussion as to which humans appeared first and which appeared later, I can say that the origin of humankind in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is very ancient. No trace can be found of any more ancient human habitation.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn15"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn15">15</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  When forests appeared on earth, dense forests spread over the hard [e.g., granitic] rock, the metamorphic rock, the igneous rock and the sedimentary rock of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. This very forest of that time provided vital nectar to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h as a human habitation. This very forest reined in the rivers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Again, it was this forest, after the erosion of the snow-covered mountains, that invited rain clouds to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. And the rain-god conferred his abundant and inexhaustible blessings on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. This is our land of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; a living onlooker to many a cycle of creation, preservation and destruction, a mute witness to a host of changes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Countless were the wild creatures in the forests of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Human beings appeared on the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h after the ice age had retreated from its heart. The enormous animals were gradually becoming smaller. The mammoths (aera&#x301;vatas in Sanskrit) had been frozen in ice and fossilized, leaving behind elephants as their descendants. The age of gigantic dinosaurs, guntosaurs and kakt&#x301;esiya&#x301;s was over, and other kinds of large animals took their place. The forest-dwellers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, clad in leaves, bark and animal skins, lived by hunting. The human beings of today may disregard them, but those people were the epitome of simplicity, they were the representatives of the undulating soil and the thunderous reverberation of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the underdeveloped humans of that time who were the revered ancestors of the people of today, and the dust of whose feet we touch to our heads as we march ahead.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Afterwards, those people learned how to tend animals, and slowly learned a little agriculture. The flaming colours of the pala&#x301;sh [Butea monosperma] forests in the month of Pha&#x301;lgun [mid-February to mid-March, when the pala&#x301;sh tree blooms] set their minds as well into a colourful dance. A fire for self-expression stirred their hearts as well. This was many thousands of years ago. Surely, they did practise tapasya&#x301; [suffering or austerity for the attainment of a certain goal]. But what was it for? How did they do it? Who taught them? No one but the Lord of their inner world, the Supreme Master of their life, taught them &ndash; &ldquo;Search, search, someone is there &ndash; someone is coming &ndash; someone will give you what you need to journey forward, and help you properly direct your efforts to reach the target.&rdquo; This was their nameless, silent tapasya&#x301;. When the Aryans started coming into India, at a time when some had already come, and some were about to start from the barren, arid lands of Central Asia &ndash; Lord Sada&#x301;shiva, that great personality, the life and soul of everyone, was born. The people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h came in touch with His eternal gospel and infallible guidance and received the much-desired touch of the enlivening wand of their Abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn16"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn16">16</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Thus Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h became the cradle of civilization.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn17"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn17">17</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was not only the starting-point of civilization, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h represented the first-ever steps towards cultural progress. The intermingling of the basins of small and big rivers, and the exchange of activities and ideas, laid the foundation for the civilization and the culture of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, whose splendour in turn ushered in a golden dawn not only in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, but also in the life of all of the underdeveloped humanity of that dark age. People of many lands started converging on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h to hear the pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cajanya, the clarion call, of humanity, and to join in singing the paean of humanity. China called Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h by the name of &ldquo;La&#x301;ti&rdquo;, Greece called it &ldquo;Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; Rid&#x301;i&rdquo; and the Aryans called it &ldquo;Ra&#x301;t&#x301;t&#x301;ha&rdquo;. This civilization and culture of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were not confined to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h alone &ndash; they could not be confined, and it would have been wrong to confine them. They sailed by sea from its port of Ta&#x301;mralipta [modern Tamluk], responding to the call of its far-off nameless and unknown friends.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s contribution to the building of a social structure was also extraordinary. There was no stratum of life, no vein in the tender leaf of life that did not throb to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s touch. The ancestral land of the majority of the Brahmans of modern Ba&#x301;m&#x301;la&#x301; was Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Hence they call themselves Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Brahmans even today. Wherever they are now, the Bandopadhyays (of Bandyaghati village of Birbhum), the Mukhopadhyays (of Mukhoti village of Bankura in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h), the Chattopadhyays (of Chatuli village of Burdwan in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h), the Gangopadhyays (of Gangoli village of Burdwan) and the Ghosals<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn18"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn18">18</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  (of Ghosali village of Manbhum) had their roots in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and subsequently set off for other parts of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Though intellect is what makes a human being most venerable, one&#146;s ks&#x301;a&#x301;tra shakti [soldierly strength] and ks&#x301;a&#x301;tra shaoryya [soldierly valour] can in no way be ignored. Vijaysingha, the son of Singhabahu the king of Singhapur<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn19"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn19">19</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  of southern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, conquered Lanka [now Sri Lanka], and as a mark of his victory gave it the name Singhal. Pandu Basudev, the nephew of the sonless Vijaysingha, ascended the throne of Singhal in c. 534 BCE and conquered the south-western coast of India. The transplanted people of Bengal laid the foundation of the Nair society of Kerala. The Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Brahmans of Bengal set sail for the coast of Konkan where they set up the Gaor&#x301;iiya Sa&#x301;rasvata Brahman society. Sahasrabahu, another prince of Singhapur, founded the Thailand dynasty and named the country Shya&#x301;mdesh. None of the above went as a conqueror; wherever they went they became sons of the soil and merged with the local inhabitants. This is a matter of great joy. The superiority of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h did not lie, as a hidden agenda, in the conquest of those lands; it lay in devoting themselves to the service of those new places. This was Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h the starting-point of civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
