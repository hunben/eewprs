<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->To remain satisfied with a little is contrary to human nature. That is why, since the dawn of creation, human beings have been worshipping the Supreme Entity. People longed for supreme knowledge, for indirect and direct spiritual realization. This fundamental human yearning for supreme expansion led people to discover the practical cult of spirituality. Moreover, it created in the human mind the sense of inquisitiveness, the spirit of dedication, and the thirst for knowledge. It is because of these noble qualities that human beings have become what they are today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The divine revelations experienced by the sages of the ancient Vedic age through their meditative vision have been compiled in the Vedas. Thus the Vedas have to some extent quenched the human thirst for intellectual knowledge. But they have not quenched the thirst for supreme knowledge, the fundamental thirst of human life. That thirst can only be quenched through the illuminating realizations of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practice].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is no reliable evidence to suggest that in the Vedic period spiritual knowledge was handed down from preceptor to disciple. As far as we know from the history of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, Lord Shiva was the first to propound it, and He gave this spiritual cult the name Tantra. Tantra is the secret behind spiritual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The scriptural definition of tantra is Tam&#x301; ja&#x301;d&#x301;ya&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah tantrah parikiirttitah [&ldquo;Tantra is that which liberates a person from the bondages of staticity&rdquo;]. Tam&#x301; is the acoustic root of staticity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Tantra has another meaning as well. The Sanskrit root verb tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. So the practical process that leads to one&#146;s expansion and consequent emancipation is called tantra. Thus sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and Tantra are inseparable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Strictly speaking, theoretical knowledge cannot be called Tantra. Tantra is a practical science. Hence in Tantra the importance of book knowledge is secondary. The practical process of Tantra begins with the physical and progresses to the physico-psychic, then to the psycho-spiritual, then ultimately results in [the supreme spiritual stance,] ensconcement in the a&#x301;tma&#x301; [self]. [This scientific process sets it apart from many other schools.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->As the practical aspect is the most important factor in Tantra, the greatest emphasis is placed on the preceptor-disciple relationship. The disciple must do intense spiritual practice to be worthy of the preceptor&#146;s instructions at every stage of development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->And it was for this reason that Sada&#x301;shiva never wanted the Tantric teachings to be written down. However, in course of time, due to a lack of competent preceptors and disciples, Tantra was about to be lost to society. It therefore became an imperative necessity to put the teachings in book form to save them from total extinction. There are presently sixty-four Tantric texts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Tantra is broadly composed of two parts &ndash; nigama and a&#x301;gama. The former is mainly theoretical; the latter practical. As the Vedic scriptures are not based on practical instructions, some people are inclined to categorize them as nigama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->According to the Rudraya&#x301;mala Tantra,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->No serious or sincere Tantric can agree with this shloka [couplet]. Why should the science which was propounded by Lord Shiva need to  be &ldquo;approved by Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;? The Rudraya&#x301;mala Tantra was formulated much later than Lord Shiva. This shloka was cleverly included in the Rudraya&#x301;mala Tantra by the protagonists of the Vedas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Guru and Disciple<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;urasya dha&#x301;ra&#x301; nishita&#x301; duratyaya&#x301;. [Literally, &ldquo;The edge of a razor is very sharp and difficult to walk on.&rdquo;] This path, to walk upon, is like a path strewn with sharp razors. The disciple has to tread the path with extreme caution. The disciple needs the help of the guru [preceptor] at every step. Without this supervision, any defect in the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; as imparted by the guru, or the least negligence on the part of the disciple in following the instructions, inevitably leads to the disciple&#146;s downfall. For success on the path of Tantra, the proper preceptor and the proper disciple are both essential. So the first step in Tantra is the selection of a competent preceptor and a worthy disciple.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The situation can be explained through the following analogy with agriculture: The disciple&#146;s heart is a field; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the ploughing and irrigation of the field; and the preceptor&#146;s initiation is the sowing of seeds. If the seeds are defective they will not sprout; if the field is infertile the harvest will be poor; and even if the seed and the field are ideal, yet the field is not properly ploughed or irrigated, the harvest will be poor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->According to Tantra, disciples are of three categories. The first category are likened to pitchers placed inversely in a tub of water. Such pitchers contain water as long as they are kept in the tub, but as soon as they are taken out, all the water pours out. These disciples acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from the preceptor they forget all his teachings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The second category of disciples are like people who carefully climb a plum tree and pick plums from its thorny branches. Unfortunately they become so absorbed in climbing down the tree that they completely forget about their carefully-collected plums, which fall out of their bags and break open on the ground. Such disciples learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The best category of disciples are like pitchers positioned right side up. When such pitchers are put in a tub of water, there is water both inside them and all around them; and even when they are removed from the tub, they remain full to the brim with water. These disciples carefully preserve in the jewel caskets of their hearts whatever they learn from their preceptor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->According to Tantra there are also three types of preceptor: the inferior, the mediocre, and the superior. Inferior preceptors are those who deliver high-sounding speeches but do not bother about whether the disciples follow their teachings or not. Mediocre preceptors impart knowledge to their disciples, no doubt, and also check on whether the disciples are following their teachings, but they are not too demanding. Superior preceptors, however, take meticulous care to ensure that their disciples follow their teachings. If they discover that their disciples are negligent in any way, they compel them to practise more painstakingly by applying circumstantial pressure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In the Vedic system there is no such strong preceptor-disciple relationship, for Vedic knowledge is completely theoretical. In Tantra emphasis is placed not only on the selection of competent masters and worthy disciples, but also on the need for disciples to make a total surrender to the preceptor in the early stages of the Tantric path.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The qualities of the best preceptors have been outlined in the Tantrasa&#x301;ra:<!-- /block --></p>

One who has controlled all the indriyas, and perfected the actions of the indriyas in shravan&#x301;a, manana and nididhya&#x301;sana, is called da&#x301;nta, or one who has acquired full control over the indriyas.<!-- /block --></p>

In the spiritual sphere this person must be daks&#x301;a (well-versed in the practical and theoretical aspects of the spiritual cult). One who has only acquired theoretical knowledge is called vidva&#x301;na [scholarly]. A preceptor must [be more than] vidva&#x301;na, a preceptor must be daks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

They must also be a&#x301;shramii [married], for according to Tantric injunction only a married person can be the guru of married people. It is not enough that preceptors impart lessons on dhya&#x301;na to their disciples, they must be dhya&#x301;nis&#x301;t&#x301;ha (fully established in dhya&#x301;na). They should also be visha&#x301;rada [well-versed, i.e., both daks&#x301;a and vidva&#x301;na] in Tantra and mantra.<!-- /block --></p>

One who is of noble soul, of noble conduct and of tranquil mind, who is modest and reverent, and possesses a sharp memory and perseverance, who has all-round competence and is zealous in the practice of raising the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, and who is well-informed and self-restrained, is an ideal disciple.&rdquo; One who does not possess these qualities should not be accepted as a disciple.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Stages<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The practice of Tantra can be divided into several stages. Everyone has his or her own individual sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, and there is no denying that at the initial stage human beings are normally animals (and have hence been called &ldquo;rational animals&rdquo;). A human being who lacks viveka [discrimination] is actually worse than an animal. Animals are undeveloped creatures, and thus certain behaviour on their part may be condoned. But humans are developed, so improper conduct by them cannot be condoned. The initial stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is meant for people of animal nature and is thus called pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra or pashubha&#x301;va [pashu = &ldquo;animal&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->When sa&#x301;dhakas advance in the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, guided by the instructions of the preceptor, they develop an ideation proper for human beings. At this stage they are called viira [heroic]. Just as animals are controlled through external pressure, in the stage of pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; disciples must be controlled by the external application of pressure of circumstances. This will help establish them in viirabha&#x301;va. But those who are more elevated than animals do not depend on external pressure for spiritual progress. Their progress is determined by both external pressure and internal urge.<!-- /block --></p>

When spiritual thirst awakens in animal-like people they become viira, and when they are fully established in viirabha&#x301;va they become devata&#x301;s [gods].&rdquo; The science of Tantra is based on this truth. Hence there is no contradiction between Tantra and science. People are found at all different stages, according to their ideation &ndash; animal-like, heroic, or god-like &ndash; as they ascend on the scale of evolution. A competent preceptor imparts lessons to his disciples after considering the degree of their spiritual and psychic elevation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->Tantra can be roughly divided into two branches, one crude and the other subtle.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  The subtle aspect of Tantra is also called the yoga ma&#x301;rga [path of yoga]. Sada&#x301;shiva was the propounder of both branches of Tantra, hence there cannot be any contradiction between them. Under ordinary circumstances the human mind is dominated by animal propensities. Of course, these baser propensities are not equally strong for all people. Those who have intense animal desires rush toward objects of physical enjoyment. Such people cannot just suddenly give up their objects of enjoyment in favour of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Those whose desire for physical enjoyment is less intense can easily abstain from physical objects, but what are the first-mentioned people to do?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->If such people try forcibly to turn their minds away from their objects of enjoyment, they will face disastrous consequences. Psychologists are well aware of the dangers of attempting to suppress or repress one&#146;s desires. One may be able to maintain saintliness for a certain time, but the raging storm cannot be contained forever. It is not unusual for those who remain virtuous early in life to fall prey to immoral desires later in life. The dark shadow of immorality fell across the lives of many sannya&#x301;siis and sannya&#x301;siniis or bhiks&#x301;us and bhiks&#x301;uniis [monks and nuns] in the past for this very reason, that they had tried to suppress their desires by force. Some people pretend to be virtuous but indulge in immoral deeds secretly; if their numbers increase in society it is an unhealthy sign. The practice of the Five M&#146;s was formulated for those people who harboured secret desires for crude physical enjoyment. But for those guided by subtle propensities, the subtle Pain&#x32D;camaka&#x301;ra, or yoga ma&#x301;rga, was prescribed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->The main idea behind the practice of the crude Pain&#x32D;camaka&#x301;ra is to carry out sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; while in the midst of crude enjoyments. While carrying out this practice, they will limit the degree of their indulgence.  By limiting the use of objects of enjoyment they will gradually increase their psychic power, and will ultimately rise above the allurement of enjoyment. For example, a wine addict will drink a controlled measure of wine as a part of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. A fish-eater will follow certain restrictions: he or she will limit the quantity of fish eaten, and will not eat female fish in their spawning period.<!-- /block --></p>

Those who think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is confined within idols made of clay, stone, metal, or wood, are simply torturing their bodies with penances &ndash; they will surely not attain salvation without self-knowledge. If an idol produced out of the human imagination can bring about salvation, then can a person, by creating a kingdom in his dreams, become a king in the real sense? Liberation is not attainable by penance, sacrificial rituals, or hundreds of fasts. Living beings attain liberation when they realize, &lsquo;I am Brahma.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ndash;Eds.</p>
