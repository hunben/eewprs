<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->An action may be treated as &ldquo;finality&rdquo; if it satisfies the following conditions: (1) it has been fully complied with, and (2) the result of the compliance is in hand. [This is &ldquo;finality&rdquo;, or &ldquo;completion&rdquo;.]<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->We repeat siddha mantra (Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; na&#x301;ma kevalam) to different tunes.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  What is the [completion] of it? Let us take an example. I cross the threshold, and as a result of it I enter the room. The utterance, internal or external, of the first syllable of a mantra is like crossing the threshold and entering a new world. The proper accomplishment of work after entering the new [world] culminates in a result which gives a feeling of bliss and perfection. This feeling is an embodiment of pleasure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In day-to-day life, we first inhale and then exhale. The mantra is repeated according to the syllabic rhythm of inhalation and exhalation. This act of breathing in the mundane sphere has no end in individual life. Breathing is an action, so a living being is always engaged in some sort of action. This constant effort is known as yatama&#x301;na. This is the first stage of progress. In the second stage, one wants to rise high with the firm determination to achieve one&#146;s goal. And while doing so one is in a position to have control over some or other of his or her mental propensities for some time, but has no control over the other propensities at all. This stage is known as vyatireka. In this stage one achieves concentration for some time and then again loses it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Then comes ekendriya, which is the third stage of progress in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. This is the stage when one has control over a particular mental propensity, and that control is more lasting. Due to constant repetition, the mantra is sounding in one&#146;s ear. While sitting in meditation, a sa&#x301;dhaka can see his or her Is&#x301;t&#x301;a moving around him or her, and the fragrance of sandalwood or rose comes from the body of the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a. Sometimes one gets it and sometimes one does not get it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The fourth stage is known as vashiika&#x301;ra. There one is established in the ideation of Parama Purus&#x301;a, to satisfy whom one is doing kiirtana. Here one completely surrenders himself or herself before Parama Purus&#x301;a, and he or she is under the complete control of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So there are four stages &ndash; four stages once at the time of inhalation and four stages again at the time of exhalation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So in all there are eight facets, and a siddha mantra must necessarily have eight syllables &ndash; it must be as&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;ks&#x301;arii,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> [just as] each and every syllable of an Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra has got its own importance. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; na&#x301;ma kevalam is a siddha mantra. When the first syllable ba&#x301; is uttered, the feeling should be, &ldquo;I am crossing the threshold and entering the new world;&rdquo; and when the last syllable ma is uttered, the feeling should be, &ldquo;I have accomplished my duty.&rdquo; If the kiirtana is done with these feelings, within two or three minutes the effect will come into play.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The whole siddha mantra should be uttered fully in each phrase of the tune &ndash; Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; na&#x301;ma kevalam &ndash; and not a part of it &ndash; while doing kiirtana. If this is not done, the kiirtana cannot be said to be a perfect kiirtana. Everything must be done in a methodical way. Then you will enjoy and get the [completion] of kiirtana properly.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  Sanskrit equivalent of &ldquo;completion&rdquo; that was  unclear in the typed notes omitted here. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)   When Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; na&#x301;ma kevalam is sung  to a tune, an extra vowel is added to kevalam for the sake  of the tune &ndash; kevalama. With this addition the mantra has  eight syllables, a point that will be discussed below. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  Eight-syllabled. &ndash;Eds.</p>
