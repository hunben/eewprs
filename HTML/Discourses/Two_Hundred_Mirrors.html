<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In Switzerland I said there are three categories of devotees: A, B, and C. The C category of devotees says, &ldquo;<i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is the creator of everything, He is the creator of the entire Universe, and I am also a part and parcel of this Universe, so he belongs to me also.&rdquo; The B category of devotees says, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is mine, but because others are also creations of Parama Purus&#x301;a, <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> belongs to others also.&rdquo; But the first thought is that <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is &ldquo;mine&rdquo;, and the second thought is that <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> belongs to others also. The A category of devotees says, &ldquo;I am ready to share everything with others, but regarding <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> I am selfish. <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> belongs to me only, and to nobody else.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now let us see which one amongst these three is philosophically correct, or psychologically or scientifically correct. Suppose there is a flower and there are two hundred mirrors. The reflection of the flower is in all two hundred mirrors. Will it be incorrect if each particular mirror says, &ldquo;The flower is mine only&rdquo;? So it is not selfishness, it is a fact, it is a crude reality, that for each and every entity, <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is a personal entity, <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is non-transferable. It is a fact, that is, <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is personal property. What is spiritual practice? It is the movement of the mirror towards the Nucleus, towards that flower.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->So B- and C-category people are defective in their thought. It will not be possible for them to enjoy the supreme beatitude. All should be of A category.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What&#146;s the meaning of &ldquo;devotee&rdquo;? There are two requisite points. The first point is, the person must be a devotee of <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i>  not a devotee of wine, money, name or fame. A devotee can only be for the Infinite Entity. If the object of ideation be finite, the term &ldquo;devotion&rdquo; should not be used; &ldquo;addiction&rdquo; is the proper language. Where the object is infinite, then the psychic movement is called &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. The second requisite factor concerns whether the psychic action should be unilateral or mutual, a knotty question. You see, you are giving money to  shopkeepers to get something. The relation is &ldquo;give and take&rdquo; &ndash; mutual. In the case of the Supreme Entity also &ndash; that is, devotion &ndash; the relationship, we can say, is mutual. But in this case what are you to do?<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In the case of devotion, you have to give your very existence, your very self. You are giving yourself and getting Him in return. But after giving yourself, who is there to get Him? You become one with Him. Even though the motive was a mutual one, finally it cannot remain mutual. It becomes unilateral.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So the two requisite factors in devotion are one, that the object of devotion has to be infinite, otherwise it is addiction; and, two, that it is unilateral, because in the process of giving and taking, you become one with Him and there is nobody to take anything from Him. You become one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->A devotee naturally becomes a universalist. A devotee knows <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is all-pervasive, is universal.  So a devotee is universal, too. So a devotee will always try to serve all, and his desire is that everybody try to move towards the Supreme Goal. He helps everybody. This universalism is called <i>Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava</i>-ism in Sanskrit, and a universalist is called a &ldquo;<i>Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava</i>.&rdquo; This Universe is an expression of <i>Parama  Purus&#x301;a</i>. I love <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> that&#146;s why I love His expression, the Universe, also. This is the central idea. A devotee cannot hate anybody. <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> cannot hate anybody.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is omnipotent, but He cannot do two things: one, He cannot create another <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a;</i> and, two, He cannot hate anybody. Whoever comes near Him becomes one with Him. So <i>Parama  Purus&#x301;a</i> remains a singular entity. Secondly, <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> creates everybody in His mind; He cannot hate his own mental creation. So <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> although omnipotent, cannot do these two things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is omnipotent, but He never discourages anybody.  Suppose there is a display of <i>kaos&#x301;ikii</i> dance before <i>Parama  Purus&#x301;a</i> and the display is very, very bad. What will <i>Parama  Purus&#x301;a</i> say? &ldquo;Very bad, very bad&rdquo;? No, <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> will say, &ldquo;Excellent, excellent.&rdquo; He wants everybody to be encouraged to move towards the Supreme Goal of human life, the Supreme Desideratum of human existence.<!-- /block --></p>
