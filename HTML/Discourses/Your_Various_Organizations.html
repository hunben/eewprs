<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The purodha&#x301;s of Ananda Marga will elect the members of the Central Committee from among themselves. The purodha&#x301; pramukha will be the ex-officio president of the Central Committee, and he will constitute the Central Executive Committee according to his choice. If he wishes, he can include in the Central Executive Committee a maximum of three members from outside the Central Committee. The highest number of members of the Central Committee will be sixty and the lowest number will be fifteen. The number of the Central Executive Committee members will be decided by the president.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The chairperson of the Bhukti General Committee, or in his/her absence the chairperson of its higher body, or in his/her absence, the president of the Central Committee, will nominate the village organizer. The village organizer will form the village committee according to his/her choice. If the villagers become dissatisfied with the village organizer&#146;s function, or in the event of his/her demise, the nominating chairperson or president will nominate another organizer who enjoys the confidence of the villagers. A village will have only an Executive Committee. The organizer will decide the number of members of the Village Executive Committee at his/her discretion. Either a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s or ta&#x301;ttvikas or, in their absence, other persons of the Marga, may be nominated as members of the Village Executive Committee.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If it be deemed expedient to form a committee higher than the Bhukti Committee and below the Central Committee - for the province, or state, or country - the president of the Central Committee will nominate the chairperson of such a committee. The chairperson will select the members of the concerned Executive Committee. The chairperson will also decide the number of its members and as far as possible will select members from among those who are both a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s and ta&#x301;ttvikas. If such qualified persons are not available in adequate numbers, the chairperson can even select members from among the general Margis. Such a committee will generally be considered as the Executive Committee. But if necessary, a General Committee may be formed with the approval of the president of the Central Committee, after ascertaining from the president the number of General Committee members. This Committee will extend all possible help to the Executive Committee. A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s and ta&#x301;ttvikas within the Committee&#146;s territorial jurisdiction will elect the Committee members from among themselves. The number of members of this General Committee will be determined [amended] by 80 per cent of the aforesaid members. Where there is an elected General Committee, even when the chairperson of the aforesaid Committee has been nominated by the president, the chairperson will constitute the Executive Committee only from among the members of the General Committee. If, however, qualified persons are not available in sufficient numbers, even persons outside the General Committee can be included in the Executive Committee with the approval of the president of the Central Committee. In case the number of members appointed from outside the General Committee exceeds three, the chairperson will have to obtain the special permission of the president of the Central Committee.<!-- /block --></p>

For example, the committee immediately subordinate to the Central Committee will contribute 1/8 of its income to the latter. The Central Committee will utilize this money for the entire universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->(7) The Central Committee functions will be in English. In the absence of persons knowing English, the work of the District or Village Committee will be carried on in the local language.<!-- /block --></p>
