<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Yesterday I talked about the Puranic gods and goddesses. In this connection let me tell you one thing more. Various types of Puranic methods, such as nya&#x301;sa, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, etc., have now become accepted in the Puranic mode of worship, but in fact these methods are of Tantric origin and not related to the Puranas. When doing pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma one will have to concentrate one&#146;s mind on a certain point. This is a Tantric method; when the mind is concentrated on a point it gets confined to a particular space. This method, confining the mind to a certain space, is called Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hira vidya&#x301; in yoga sha&#x301;stra. That is, this was invented by the first Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava brother, Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hira.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->However, I will have to say something more about the Puranic system of worship. There are many Puranic worship practices which people are inclined to believe to be very old; many believe that they are as ancient as the Vedas. But that is not the fact of the matter. None of the Puranic systems of worship, or Puranic rituals, is older than 1200 or 1300 years. All those systems of worship are post-Buddhistic, or developed somewhat prior to the period of Buddhist Tantra [which came one thousand years after Buddha himself], or developed, at the earliest, contemporaneously with Buddha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Numerous Buddhist gods and goddesses later became accepted as Puranic gods and goddesses &ndash; for example, the Buddhist goddess Shiitala&#x301; became converted into a Puranic goddess because of the fear of smallpox &ndash; and some of the Buddhist Tantric gods and goddesses also became converted into Puranic gods and goddesses. For instance, the Buddhist Tantric deity Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is now accepted as a Puranic deity; these days many Hindus accept Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; Devii. You will find many persons with names such as Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;da&#x301;s, Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;pada, etc. (Similarly, the Hindu Tantric goddess Ka&#x301;lii has been accepted in Buddhist Tantra.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->For these reasons I was saying that no Puranic ritual or mode of worship is older than 1200 or 1300 years. In the wake left by the collapse of Buddhism [in India], the Puranic religion or neo-Hindu religion emerged, and the Buddhist Tantric gods and goddesses became accommodated in the new religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->A new religious movement called the Na&#x301;tha Cult emerged during the period of transition from the Buddhist Era to the Puranic Era. Many gods and goddesses of the Na&#x301;tha Cult can also be detected [in the Puranic religion], for instance Bur&#x301;o Shiva. In fact, most of the Puranic gods and goddesses receiving great reverence in our country are not older than five hundred or six hundred years. If any of them are 1200-1300 years old, that is indeed the maximum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Some people believe that the worship of Durga&#x301; is something very old, but that is not true at all. This worship became popular during the Muslim period; that is, it is of quite recent origin. The system of Durga&#x301; worship was in existence at the time when Krttiva&#x301;sa first composed the Bengali Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Since Durga&#x301; worship was a contemporary matter, Krttiva&#x301;sa mentioned the goddess Durga&#x301; in his Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. For instance, he mentioned that Ra&#x301;macandra worshipped the goddess Durga&#x301; with 108 lotus flowers. But in the original Sanskrit Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, Valmiiki&#146;s Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, these stories are absent. The worship of Durga&#x301; was popular during the time of Krttiva&#x301;sa, and therefore he inserted the story into his Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. But even in the Ra&#x301;macaritma&#x301;nas composed by Tulasii Da&#x301;s, the story is conspicuously absent. Thus we can conclude that it was only created in the imagination of Krttiva&#x301;s. So the idea that the system of Durga&#x301; worship is quite old is entirely unfounded.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->One of the characteristics of Tantra is this, that the different gods and goddesses originate from one idea or other. Those ideas were conceived in order to arouse and develop the finer sensibilities of the human mind. Thus a person conceived of a certain idea, and to make concrete that abstract idea, an image was invented. But such an idea, whether good or bad, is not an integral idea, it is a non-integral idea. If human beings try to give expression to one such idea out of many, that means that other ideas are excluded. Anyway, this is how there arose the various gods and goddesses, through a process of giving external form to abstract ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the term devata&#x301; is feminine. In this respect there is no fundamental difference between Buddhist and Hindu Tantra, although there is a difference in terminology. For instance, there are Buddhist Tantric goddesses called Ma&#x301;riici, Vajrabara&#x301;hii, Ba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii, Vajrayoginii, Vajrata&#x301;ra&#x301; and Bha&#x301;nata&#x301;ra&#x301;. And then there are Ka&#x301;lii and the Dashamaha&#x301;vidya&#x301;s [ten goddesses known as the Ten Maha&#x301;vidya&#x301;s], all Hindu Tantric goddesses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->These various gods and goddesses represent one idea or other. For instance, Anucchu&#x301;nya&#x301; Prakrti, the state of Prakrti at the stage prior to creation: that idea is represented by Ka&#x301;lii. But this is just a non-integral idea, not an integral one.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->With a particular idea in one&#146;s mind, one experiences a particular state of existence in life, and accordingly one or another Maha&#x301;vidya&#x301; has been thought of. For instance, Dhu&#x301;ma&#x301;vatii is described as vivarn&#x301;a&#x301; [colourless], vidhava&#x301; [widowed], with sunken eyes and wizened face, wearing dirty, dishevelled clothing. Crows hover over her head; in her hand she is holding a broken winnow. The entire description gives an idea of an impoverished deity, shorn of all glory and opulence.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> When people are shorn of everything, the idea of Dhu&#x301;ma&#x301;vatii symbolizes that idea. Tantra holds out one or another idea of that type. It is not proper to create images, ostensibly for religious worship, such as that. As ideas are very pleasing to the human mind, if we draw or paint a picture on any surface, it will give us aesthetic pleasure, but what is the benefit in worshipping such things? If you worship one idea, maybe you will have some control over that idea, but you will not have influence over other ideas. After all, one particular image is not Parama Purus&#x301;a, it is just one of His partial expressions. Take for instance the case of Ka&#x301;lii. She is described as meghavarn&#x301;a, black. Why the black colour? Because it was conceived that there was no creation at that time. At the time when this world had not been created, there was no colour, and want of colour is black, so the idea of want of colour is represented by Ka&#x301;lii. It is not possible to think of any other colour, because there was no other colour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Then again Ka&#x301;lii is conceived of as vigatavasana&#x301;, having no clothes. Why no clothes? Because, is it possible to cover an all-pervading entity with clothes? Can we conceive of clothing the Infinite Entity? What does logic say about this? If the Infinite Entity is covered with clothes, can it be called infinite? Here metaphorically all the directions are Her clothes. She is further described as shavashiva&#x301;ru&#x301;d&#x301;ha&#x301;. When Consciousness has not been metamorphosed into the different successive stages of manifestation, Shiva [Consciousness] is just like a dead body, because at that stage Shiva cannot do anything, there is no expression of consciousness. Only Parama&#x301; Prakrti is the creative entity. She carries on Her eternal dance of creation. She is also conceived as three-eyed, because she is witnessing all the phenomena of the past, present and future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In fact there is no such thing as Ka&#x301;lii, it is just an idea. In the deity&#146;s hands are a human head and a sword; those hands are in vara&#x301;bhaya mudra&#x301;. She is wearing a garland around her neck, a garland dotted with forty-nine severed heads, each face representing one particular acoustic root, and one hand, as mentioned, is also holding a head. (I have already told you that in that Vedic period people did not know how to write. Script had not yet been invented.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->) The fifty sounds from a to ks&#x301;a were represented by the fifty faces. The first face, symbolizing the a sound, was the one held by the hand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Yata shona karn&#x301;aput&#x301;e sab-i ma&#x301;yer mantra bat&#x301;e.<br>Ka&#x301;lii pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;shat varn&#x301;amayii varn&#x301;e varn&#x301;e vira&#x301;j kare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->[Whatever you hear with your ears are the mantras emanating from the Causal Matrix. Ka&#x301;lii is a combination of fifty letters; she is associated with all the letters.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->At the time when the universe had not been created, the sounds were already present, and all those sounds were merged in the dark void of Maha&#x301;ka&#x301;lii [Supreme Operative Principle].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In the poem Ka&#x301;lii is described as Narashrim&#x301;ghakhad&#x301;gavara&#x301;bhayashobhana&#x301;. Here khad&#x301;ga [sword] is a symbol of the fight against evil and sin, and abhaya means &ldquo;fearlessness&rdquo;. When we confront the illusions of creation and destruction, the Supreme Entity tells us, &ldquo;Don&#146;t be nervous, don&#146;t be afraid, there will again be creation.&rdquo; And what is bara? &ldquo;I will again create.&rdquo; And in her hand there is a container of nectar. This is an excellent idea, but it is just an idea, it should not be worshipped. If people do so, they will be metamorphosed into that idea only; they can never attain the supreme goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->All such Tantric ideations are very beautiful images of the different aspects of the Supreme Entity, and human beings start moulding clay statues depicting those ideas. So this Ka&#x301;lii, this Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;, and all the Dashamaha&#x301;vidya&#x301;s, are one or another mental ideation, born out of the human mind. The total expression of all these ideations is what is called the human psychic expression. If a follower of Tantra or Purana remains preoccupied with a particular idea, the total development of the mind will remain an impossibility. That&#146;s why all these ideas of [this school of Tantra] should be rejected. The great mystic Ra&#x301;mprasa&#x301;d said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Hrdipadma ut&#x301;hbe phut&#x301;e, maner a&#x301;ndha&#x301;r ya&#x301;be t&#x301;ut&#x301;e<br>Dhara&#x301;tale par&#x301;bo lut&#x301;e, &ldquo;Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;&rdquo; bale habo sa&#x301;ra&#x301;.<br>Tyajiba sab bheda&#x301;bhed, ghuce ja&#x301;be maner khed,<br>Shatashata satya ved, &ldquo;Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;&rdquo; a&#x301;ma&#x301;r nira&#x301;ka&#x301;ra&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->[The lotus will bloom, the darkness of my mind will disappear, I shall roll on the earth<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> with the holy name of Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; on my lips. All sorts of distinction will be obliterated, all the afflictions of my mind will be totally removed; the scriptures are right when they declare that Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is formless.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->So if people concentrate their minds on a particular idea, their progress will remain a far cry away from total progress. So sa&#x301;dhakas must try to realize Parama Purus&#x301;a, and not any non-integral entity. There is no other way.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Similarly, each of the [Puranic] gods and goddesses has a particular quality of its own. Yes, one may acquire some quality, but one will never attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence the only object of meditation of human beings should be Parama Purus&#x301;a. One can never attain the Macrocosmic vastness if one meditates on a limited idea, a finite entity. The Tantric gods and goddesses, whether we are speaking of Hindu Tantra or of Buddhist Tantra, have equally limited powers. Moreover, as each of the gods and goddesses has its own vehicle, and it is unscientific to meditate on that vehicle, the Tantric gods and goddesses are not to be accepted as objects of meditation. And Tantra has also emphatically said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->It is also stated in Tantra that if a person wants only to attain limited progress, one may practise on certain limited ideas. But those who are genuine seekers of Brahma will never agree to worship any finite idea. Those who want the Supreme Entity will have to ideate on Parama Purus&#x301;a alone. People may attain limited achievement in terms of occult power through the grace of the gods and goddesses, but they will remain far away from the attainment of the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
