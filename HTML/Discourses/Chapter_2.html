And so, small happiness fills nobody&#146;s bill. One wants endless happiness. This endless happiness is a condition beyond the precincts of weal and woe, because the sense of happiness that is perceivable with the help of the senses oversteps the limit of the sense organs when established in limitlessness. This limitless happiness is what is known as a&#x301;nanda [bliss].<!-- /block --></p>

It is not possible for limited objects to quench one&#146;s thirst. Brahma is the only limitless entity, and so establishment in Brahma&#146;s bearing alone puts an end to all thirsts or cravings.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Purport: Since happiness is the cherished goal of all, and the desire for happiness is not to be satiated without the attainment of limitlessness, and then again since this attainment of limitlessness itself is dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, then dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is indispensable for every living being. Creatures inferior to humans cannot do dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; due to their undeveloped minds. But humans can, and the one who does not do it ill fits the epithet of human being.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Purport: In spiritual parlance the Soul is one. In whatever condition the mind be &ndash; manifest (e.g., in animate beings and plants) or unmanifest (e.g., in inanimate earth, iron, etc.), the A&#x301;tma&#x301; goes on reflecting itself on it and its objects &ndash; the crude objects. The reflection of the Soul on the mind is called the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;, and in that case the Reflector-Soul is called Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; [Supreme Soul] or Pratyaga&#x301;tma&#x301;. (Pratiipam&#x301; vipariitam&#x301; ain&#x32D;cati vija&#x301;na&#x301;ti iti pratyak [&ldquo;That which takes a stance opposite to a thing and witnesses that thing is pratyak&rdquo;].) The jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; may also be called an&#x301;ucaetanya [microcosmic consciousness]. Similarly we may call Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; by the name of Bhu&#x301;ma&#x301; Caetanya [Macrocosmic Consciousness]. The totality of microcosms is the Macrocosm. In a way this assertion is true, because every mind or crude entity is holding the Supreme Spirit according to its individual capacity. Their collective capacity is indeed the capacity of the Macrocosmic Mind. The Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is the ultimate knower of the Macrocosmic Mind, and that is why Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is called Bhu&#x301;ma&#x301; Caetanya.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Purport: The object-entity finds its substantiation in the receptacle of the citta; the receptacle of the citta in the Doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;, or Owner &ldquo;I&rdquo;, that is, in the Aham&#x301;tattva; the receptacle of the Doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;, or Owner &ldquo;I&rdquo;, in the sense of existence (i.e., in &ldquo;I am&rdquo; or Mahattattva). The knowledge of the &ldquo;I am&rdquo; entity, that is, &ldquo;I know I am&rdquo; &ndash; in the absence of this knowership, the entitative sense of &ldquo;I am&rdquo; or &ldquo;my existence&rdquo; remains in jeopardy &ndash; unsubstantiated. And so at the root of everything remains &ldquo;I know&rdquo; and the next that follows is &ldquo;I am&rdquo;. This &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I know&rdquo; is the Soul, and so the sense of all entities depends on the A&#x301;tman.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Purport: Purus&#x301;ottama, the Nucleus of the universe, is the witness of and is directly concerned with every unit entity. This association of His is called ota yoga [the yoga of individual association]. Evidently Purus&#x301;ottama is the collective entity of the universe as well as witness of the collective mind. This association of His with the collectivity is called prota yoga [the yoga of pervasive association]. In other words, it may be said that the one who is associated with His objects through both ota and prota yogas at the same time is Purus&#x301;ottama.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Purport: Every created object obeys the law of cause and effect. In our quest for the cause of action in pratisain&#x32D;cara, we arrive at the five fundamental elements. Similarly, in our quest for the cause of action in sain&#x32D;cara, we arrive at the Mahat of the Great. The mind having no locus standi beyond the Mahat, such a state is the supra-mental state of the mind. In this supra-mental state, it is beyond the capacity of the mind to determine the principle of cause and effect, for further probings will entail the fallacy of infinite regress; that is to say, to think of the existence of the mind in a state where it does not exist is indeed fallacious. Hence the query as to when did the creation take place, and why, is redundant and untenable.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Purport: Brahma is Satya [Truth], that is, unchangeable. But we cannot say that the changes that are perceived apparently on the body of Brahma under the influence of Prakrti and the three fundamental relative factors of time, space and person are false, nor can we say that they are eternal truths. All that we can say is that they are relative truths, for the apparent changes are dependent on the relativity of these three factors, that is, time, space and person. The unit-entity or the unit mind, also, in its progressive bearing, is involved with these three factors, hence its existence also is a relative factor. One relative entity appears to be a spiritual truth to another relative entity, and so the changeable world appears to be a truth to the changeable living unit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->2-15. Purus&#x301;ah akarta&#x301; phalasa&#x301;ks&#x301;iibhu&#x301;tah bha&#x301;vakendrasthitah<br>gun&#x301;ayantra&#x301;kashca.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Purport: That Purus&#x301;a is established at the nucleus of all entities is true of both individuality and collectivity. This very Purus&#x301;a of the nucleus of the collectivity is Purus&#x301;ottama. When energy is begotten in the object-body in the wake of the flow of the Operative Principle, then the controller of this energy is called karta&#x301;. Purus&#x301;a does not control this sort of energy, on the contrary, He, being established at the nucleus of the gun&#x301;as, controls those very gun&#x301;as through which energy emanates. Hence the controller, Purus&#x301;a or Purus&#x301;ottama, is not subject to the gun&#x301;as but is the governor or sovereign head thereof.<!-- /block --></p>
