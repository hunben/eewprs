<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Normally menstruation occurs once in a lunar month. Though as a rule, it occurs every twenty-eight days, the interval may be twenty-nine or thirty days for some and twenty-six or twenty-seven days for others, according to the woman&#146;s physical condition. Usually menstruation lasts for three to five days. If the menstruation does not follow the above pattern according to the lunar month or if it lasts for a week or two; or if it sometimes occurs and sometimes does not; or if sometimes there is excessive bleeding and sometimes very little; then it may be termed &ldquo;irregular menstruation.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In a healthy woman the menstrual discharge is usually about one-fourth seer. If for any reason the quantity is less than normal, it is called &ldquo;hypomenorrhoea.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->If there is no menstrual discharge on the fixed date, or if the menstruation stops for two or three months in spite of the woman not being pregnant, then the condition is termed &ldquo;amenorrhoea.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In tropical countries a woman&#146;s fertility lasts from the age of twelve or fourteen up to the age of forty-five or fifty-five, and in cold countries it lasts from fourteen or sixteen up to fifty or sixty. A regular interval of monthly menstruation and a regular amount of discharge throughout these years is a sign of good health. Every month in a fertile woman the uterus prepares its endometrium (uterine lining) to be the first home for a possible embryo. All of the glands that maintain the youth of the body help directly or indirectly in this work of forming the embryo. These glands also cooperate in providing blood to the uterus to develop the embryo. When the sperm comes into contact with the ovum and an embryo gets an opportunity to form, that blood supply is used in building the body of the embryo. But if, for any reason, no embryo is formed, then the uterus, now full of blood, breaks up the endometrium, and the accumulated blood, not being of any other use to the body, is expelled with the remains of the endometrium. This unnecessary blood is called &ldquo;menstrual discharge.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Anaemia is the main cause behind all types of abnormal menstruation &ndash; menorrhagia [excessive flow], hypomenorrhoea, and irregular menstruation. When women suffer from anaemia, the glands that help maintain youth also suffer from debilities and as a result the endometrium cannot develop. And in the case of anaemia, sufficient blood cannot be stored in the uterus to form an embryo. This condition brings about hypomenorrhoea. When, owing to the meagre blood supply or to any defect in the organs of the body (conditions which may be found in both thin and fat women), very little blood is stored in the uterus; and the woman also suffers from upward-moving <i>va&#x301;yu;</i> then her menstrual flow may stop completely, and this is called &ldquo;amenorrhoea.&rdquo; In such a situation, the accumulation of impure blood may create many disorders in the body which can lead to premature death. This type of woman with a weak constitution often also suffers from tuberculosis, asthma and similar chronic diseases. Amenorrhoea can cause hysteria or even temporary insanity. A woman may also become irritable in disposition due to the disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The reasons behind irregular menstruation are liver defects, constipation and excessive sex.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->When the blood becomes over-acidic and weakens the liver and other blood-purifying organs, the poisons of the body are thoroughly flushed out along with the menstrual discharge. This state is called &ldquo;menorrhagia.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->During the menstrual period only easily-digestible and nutritious food should be eaten. All types of fruit juice, milk, leafy vegetables and vegetable soups are excellent foods during this period. Non-vegetarian food, too much fried or parched food, and too much ghee, oil or spicy food are to be rejected. Of spices, asafoetida [<i>Ferula foetida Regel</i>] and clove are very useful, but they should not be taken in large amounts.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->During the menstrual period sleeping during the day, staying awake at night and hard physical labour should be avoided. Bending forward to lift heavy loads is forbidden, because such pressure may displace the blood-filled uterus. Warming oneself by the fire is also forbidden, because staying too long in the heat of the fire may excite the body and mind. Women who have no one to assist them in cooking may cook meals outside the kitchen in the open air, using a portable stove. As much as possible they should keep away from the food; otherwise there is a high possibility that the menstrual discharge will come in contact with the food and contaminate it.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> To keep the body completely free of excitement, menstruating women must not touch adult males. In order to save their husbands and children from any harmful effect from their menstrual discharge, they should sleep on separate beds. And those beds should be kept dry, warm and comfortable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Women should keep away from strenuous acts such as singing, dancing and blowing conch-shells during their menstrual period, and for the sake of their minds and bodies should keep engaged in light, restful chores or amusing conversation. Finally, they should utilize as much of the day as possible in <i>Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na</i> [meditation] as taught by an <i>a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In so many cases at present we see that the above dos and don&#146;ts are not being followed, and this is leading women in greater numbers to suffer from menstrual problems.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->There is no objection to bathing during the menstrual period, but bathing in very cold water is to be avoided. On the first day of menstruation one may bathe in normally-cool water unless it is uncomfortable. On the second and third day one should bathe in sun-warmed water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->During menstruation, using tampons of cotton or linen which block the vagina is harmful. Instead, women should wear shorts over a <i>kaopiina</i> [a tight-fitting kind of underwear] or a cotton pad.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->A woman with a healthy liver may consume butter or ghee with rice.

<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->2. Take 3 or 4 <i>d&#x301;a&#x301;lim</i> [pomegranate &ndash; <i>Punica granatum Linn.</i>] flowers ground in raw milk twice a day during the period.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Women who are adverse to physical labour, and who generally are from rich or upper middle-class families, are found suffering from this disease. Due to lack of physical labour, or due to physical debility for any reason, the uterus and the ovaries become weak and cannot stand the pressure of blood during the menstrual period. As soon as the blood starts entering the uterus, both the uterus and the ovaries start reacting adversely and that adverse reaction expresses itself as pain in the abdomen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Women doing adequate physical labour seldom suffer from this disease. If mental dissatisfaction is added to the lack of physical labour, then the disease is aggravated. When women in upper-class society are compelled to lead dissatisfied sex lives on account of various social restrictions, they also suffer from this disease. This disease is one of the reasons for infertility.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Special attention should be paid to see that the food is alkaline. All types of fruits, and vegetable soups, are good in this disease. Fried, parched and non-vegetarian food, too much oil, ghee, garlic and onions, and too-spicy foods are to be avoided. Even after recovering from the disease, a woman should not have intercourse with her husband for at least four months.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->1. 10 to 12 <i>ashoka</i> flowers without stems should be boiled in a mixture of 4 seers of water and 1/2 seer milk, until the mixture boils down to 3/8 seer.

<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->2. Tying the root of a [[<i>ca&#x301;ra&#x301; bel</i>]] around the waist will relieve the pain of this disease.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->If a woman suffers from anaemia for whatever reason, the organs of the body become incapable of supplying an adequate amount of blood to the uterus. In such a case, the inadequate supply of blood get mixed with other fluids of the body, turns whitish, and is flushed out of the uterus &ndash; and the woman suffers from white leucorrhoea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Abortions and miscarriages also make women anaemic and cause leucorrhoea. Similarly, too much administration of medicines and injections weakens the blood, and leucorrheoa is the result.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Excessive sexual intercourse invites constipation, which pollutes the blood and brings on acidity, and this causes leucorrhoea. Virgins with the unnatural habit of masturbation invite a similar reaction, and leucorrhoea may occur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->When both the liver and pancreas become weak, the blood will show an increase in acidity, and generally blood leucorrhoea occurs. In bloody leucorrhoea, unlike white leucorrhoea the patient may not be suffering from anaemia, but her blood will be more polluted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->If due to ignorance adolescent girls and unmarried women leave the vagina unclean, they suffer from a certain type of discharge.

<a name="77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->The uterus lies in a suspended position supported by a few ligaments behind the navel region. So it is not at all unusual for the uterus to get displaced or to change sides. Since the uterus is situated in between the urinary bladder and the rectum, any displacement of it may hinder defecation or urination. The uterus has an elastic quality and can shrink and expand. This is why a positional change of the uterus may cause great disorder in the lower trunk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->Though constipation is not the only cause of this disease, it is the main one. Because, due to accumulation of stool, the colon gets swollen, putting pressure on the uterus, and causing it to change its position.

<a name="79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->During menstruation, when the uterus remains full of blood, bending forward to do any heavy chore, or lifting heavy pots from the stove, may also lead to the displacement of the uterus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->Due to excessive sexual intercourse, the nervous system of the lower portion of the body may suffer from all-round debility.

<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->But some women in this situation undergo surgery to remove the uterus or ovaries. Obviously, such surgery cannot bring about a cure. Rather, this is like trying to cure a headache by cutting off the head. The loss of these important glands makes a woman sexually neuter and brings about great changes in body and mind. Different mental disorders appear, and often the woman goes mad. So as soon as a woman realizes that she has a displaced uterus, she should be especially careful to avoid constipation and to see that her urination remains normal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="93"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->If a woman between the ages of sixteen or seventeen and thirty or thirty-five is unable to conceive in spite of having sexual intercourse, this may be considered a case of sterility or infertility. However, the sterility may or may not be that of the woman. Often it is due to sterility of the male partner that society considers a woman sterile.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->Behind sterility or infertility there can be a number of causes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->1. The ova, produced in the ovaries, pass through the Fallopian tubes to reach the uterus. When the Fallopian tubes are weak, diseased, or blocked by contaminated matter, the ova either fail to reach the uterus or die on the way. Consequently, conception cannot take place even if living spermatozoa are present in the uterus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->2. The ovaries, the ova-producing organs, are situated a little above the groin on either side. Due to lack of physical labour, anaemia, physical debility or any other physical defect, or any congenital defect, the ovaries may not be able to produce ova, or only overly-weak ones. When this takes place, women will be sterile or give birth to still-born babies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->3. In the case of women who are very bad-tempered, that is, dominated by the <i>va&#x301;yu</i> or <i>pitta</i> factor a little of the <i>pitta</i> can enter the uterus and be stored there. This poisonous <i>pitta</i> kills the sperm and destroys the chance of conception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->4. Excess body fat can cause the female genitals to become somewhat misshapen. As a result, the sperm cannot reach their destination and conception cannot take place. To such women intercourse becomes frustrating, and their sexual dissatisfaction makes them both over-desirous and quarrelsome, and destroys the peace of their domestic life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph -->5. Excessive intercourse makes the nervous system of the lower portion of the body weak and insensitive, and conception cannot take place. For just this reason, prostitutes are generally infertile.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph -->6. Excessive acidity of the body, many a time, does not allow the foetus to draw the fluids or blood necessary for its development, so the foetus dies a premature death; that is, the woman tends to have still-births. Women who are excessively fond of eating non-vegetarian food but do not undertake adequate physical labour suffer from over-acidity of the blood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->7. Those males who develop the unnatural habit of wasting their semen excessively before they attain the age of twenty-five or twenty-six tend to lose their capacity to produce healthy sperm. The sperm of such persons cannot produce an embryo.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="104"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=104 type=paragraph -->8. In the case of males who, even after attaining adulthood, live intemperately, the testes cannot produce healthy sperm; in this case also conception cannot take place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="105"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=105 type=paragraph -->9. If a male suffers from excessive <i>pitta</i> secretion, that <i>pitta</i> destroys the ova in the uterus and does not allow any embryo to be formed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->10. If the spermatic duct becomes diseased, weak, hardened or full of impurities, then a person becomes infertile, and conception cannot take place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="107"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->Treatment<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph -->The causes behind sterility and infertility are many. Therefore one particular remedy cannot be applied in all cases. The original defect in the male or female which has caused the sterility should be treated properly. Removing the defect or defects will bring good results with the sterility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph -->Inability to bear a second child, after bearing one, should be treated in just the same manner.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->Many people think that infertility can occur due to leucorrhoea or displacement of the uterus. But this impression is not entirely correct. Because even during such conditions the link between the ovaries and the uterus through the Fallopian tubes remains unaffected. But it is true that, if these diseases are present, the chance of still-births is greater.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph -->If the testes of the male or the ovaries of the female are underdeveloped for congenital reasons, that type of sterility if very difficult to cure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph -->Very often the opening of the vagina becomes flaccid or stretched, and the vagina almost protrudes.

<a name="123"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->CONCLUSION<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph -->At present a large number of women in society suffer from one female disease or other. The main reasons are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->1. Lack of nutritious diet and consequent anaemia;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->2. Unnatural way of life;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->3. Lack of proper observation of the dos and don&#146;ts during menstruation;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->4. Lack of sexual restraint by males and females;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=129 type=paragraph -->5. Ignorance regarding sexual matters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph -->Though female diseases may not be obviously fatal, they slowly sap the vitality of the individual, and children, who are the hope of society, are born with mental and physical defects which remain throughout their lives. What a terrible situation this is for society can easily be imagined. On account of female diseases women often die prematurely. In most cases, if not all, lack of self-control by the male is one of the causes of female disease. It is certainly not desirable for women to go to their graves prematurely due to the intemperance of men. Sexual over-indulgence is also harmful to the men, because it causes excessive wastage of <i>shukra,</i> which [in the lymph stage] nourishes the brain. Remember that self-control is the greatest thing in life.<!-- /block --></p>

In the absence of a bathtub or an earthen trough, a wet towel may be wrapped around the areas to be bathed, but in order to compensate, cold water must be poured constantly over the towel, and the towel which is to be used for the massage must be kept wet.
