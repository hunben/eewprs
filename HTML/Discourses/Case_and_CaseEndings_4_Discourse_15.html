<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discussion is the locative [adhikaran&#x301;a] case. Adhikaran&#x301;a is derived by adding the prefix adhi and the suffix anat&#x301; to the verbal root kr. In Sanskrit the suffix abhi means &ldquo;great&rdquo; and the suffix adhi means &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; or &ldquo;collective&rdquo;. The word adhikaran&#x301;a means &ldquo;that extensive land or field which gives rise to a completed action [karan&#x301;a]&rdquo;. This extensive land or field is dependent upon time, place and person. In order for anything to be established, it has to be established on the basis of place or land, idea or time. For this reason the grammarian Panini accepted three bases of things &ndash; time, idea and base. The three types of locatives were created on the basis of these three &ndash; the locative of time, the locative of idea and the locative of base.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Nowadays the locative of idea does not enjoy widespread acceptance, however it cannot in any way be negated. If we say sa&#x301;hitye nipun&#x301;a [skilled in literature] then since sa&#x301;hitya [literature] is an idea, it is classified as the locative of idea. In the word sa&#x301;hitye, e is the indicator of the seventh case. When the inflection mayat&#x301; is added to the root word gun&#x301;a it becomes gun&#x301;amaya. Gun&#x301;amaya means &ldquo;one who is filled with qualities&rdquo;. Gun&#x301;a [quality] is a base. The meaning of the word deshagata is &ldquo;that thing or person which is within a country&rdquo;. Desh [country] is a base, thus these belong to the locative of base. If we say sandhya&#x301;bela&#x301;y [evening] then it refers to a particular time or a measure of time, a division of time, so it is the locative of time. Thus time, place, idea &ndash; all three can serve as a base. So these three have to be accepted as the locative case, that is, the locative of time, the locative of idea and the locative of base.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It is said that the locative is the seventh case. This hard and fast rule is followed in Sanskrit, however there are distinctive case-endings in Sanskrit that differ from word to word. In Bengali there are three endings used for the seventh case &ndash; e, te and ete. If a Bengali word ends in i, ii, u or u&#x301; then e is not added. In all other cases e is the ending. For example, Kalika&#x301;ta&#x301;-e (Kalika&#x301;ta&#x301;y), Pat&#x301;na&#x301;-e (Pat&#x301;na&#x301;y), but instead of Kashii-e or Pa&#x301;la&#x301;mu-e it is Ka&#x301;shiite and Pa&#x301;la&#x301;mute. If a word ends with hasanta pronunciation (whether it is spelled that way or not) then ete can be added instead of e. For example, Varddhama&#x301;ne or Varddhama&#x301;nete, Krs&#x301;na&#x301;nagare or Krs&#x301;n&#x301;anagarete, and so on. Cuncr&#x301;o, however, is not spelled with ete because there is no hasanta pronunciation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Hindi me is used to indicate the locative case except in the case of pronouns. In the case of the pronouns tu [you - affectionate form] and maen [I] first jha is added and then e or me &ndash; tujhe, tujhme, mujhe, mujhme.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Oriya re is added for the seventh case. Of course sometimes te is used in poetry; in such instances the seventh case replaces the first. In Bengali, for example, there is the saying pa&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; bale, cha&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; kha&#x301;y [what won&#146;t a fool say, what won&#146;t a goat eat!]. In Assamese at is used, for example gharat. In old Bengali te and ete were used more than e. For example, deshete a&#x301;ila Ra&#x301;m a&#x301;nanda sava&#x301;r. However it should be pointed out that the language of poetry and the language of prose are not the same; poetry enjoys more leeway.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In Maethilii ma or ma&#x301;n are used for the seventh case, however in poetry moy [in me] and toy [in you] were used and continue to be. In one composition of the ancient poet Vidyapati this line appears: daya&#x301; janu chor&#x301;avi moy. More used to be used in Hindi poetry for the seventh case, however since this is a matter of poetry the grammar should not be based on it. Often doggerels do not follow properly the rules of grammar. In dialects as well it is often seen that the rules of grammar are not obeyed. In all such cases not only is the seventh used to replace the first and second cases, but in addition they go outside the fundamental grammatical structure. For example, in Burdwan District there is a lullaby which goes like this:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;o re a&#x301;o re ba&#x301;cha&#x301; a&#x301;o<br>Kii la&#x301;gi ka&#x301;nda re ba&#x301;cha&#x301; kii dhan ca&#x301;o<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[Come child, come/why are you crying? What treasure would you like?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Nowadays the people of Burdwan District do not say a&#x301;o; they say a&#x301;y or a&#x301;i. For example, in Oriya if we say &ndash; amar&#x301;a (la) dhavar&#x301;a (la) pa&#x301;r&#x301;e (la) la&#x301;guchi manda madhura ha&#x301;oya&#x301;/Mote kabhu na&#x301; dekhilun kabhu na&#x301; sunilun emati taran&#x301;ii vaoya&#x301; &ndash; then according to grammar these two lines are incorrect, but as far as usage goes they are not incorrect. Another example is: Mastakare dei ha&#x301;t ka&#x301;nducchanti ra&#x301;ja&#x301;m&#x301;ka ma&#x301;ta&#x301;re/Ker&#x301;hen (n&#x301;a) gelun mor putra mo dhana re? From the standpoint of proper Oriya grammar mo dhana re should be mor dhana re but in poetry mo dhana re can be used. Anyhow, all languages need the three locatives &ndash; the locative of time, the locative of idea and the locative of base.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->English uses the locative indicators &ldquo;in&rdquo;, &ldquo;into&rdquo;, &ldquo;on&rdquo;, &ldquo;upon&rdquo;, &ldquo;unto&rdquo;, &ldquo;above&rdquo;, and &ldquo;within&rdquo;. The preposition &ldquo;in&rdquo; is used when something is inside of something else, for example, &ldquo;He is in the room.&rdquo; If someone is outside and then comes inside then the preposition &ldquo;into&rdquo; is used, for example, &ldquo;He went into the room&rdquo;. It is most unfortunate that many people nowadays do not observe this distinction between &ldquo;in&rdquo; and &ldquo;into&rdquo; though they should. &ldquo;Within&rdquo; means &ldquo;being inside&rdquo; and &ldquo;without&rdquo; means &ldquo;remaining outside&rdquo;. &ldquo;On&rdquo; is used when something is above something else and touching it, for example, &ldquo;The book is on the table&rdquo;. When something is over something else but not touching it, that is, when there is a space between the two, then &ldquo;upon&rdquo; is used, for example, &ldquo;The ceiling fan is upon the head&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ldquo;Above&rdquo; is similar to &ldquo;upon&rdquo;. The difference is that &ldquo;above&rdquo; is used equally for material and immaterial situations, but &ldquo;upon&rdquo; is not used so much for immaterial cases. For example, &ldquo;He is looked upon as an elder brother but he is above all prejudice&rdquo;. In certain cases a long-standing idiom violates this rule. An example is &ldquo;Let him stand upon his own legs.&rdquo; When a person stands on their own legs, they stand right on their legs, not above them, thus in this case &ldquo;on&rdquo; is more proper. Of course some people do use &ldquo;on&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;He stands on his own legs,&rdquo; however &ldquo;He stands upon his own legs&rdquo; is more idiomatic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->At one time the word &ldquo;unto&rdquo; was very common in English. Nowadays this is no longer the practice though it is still used to some extent in biblical English. &ldquo;Unto&rdquo; used to be used in the sense of &ldquo;to&rdquo; and &ldquo;from&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Often we knowingly violate the rules of grammar for ease of use but this occurs in certain limited cases so it cannot be accepted as historical truth or ars&#x301;a prayoga.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  It would be better to consider it a common error. One cannot issue a grammatical ordinance and declare such usage forbidden. It is like saying in Bengali tini ekjan sambhra&#x301;nta pariba&#x301;rer santa&#x301;n [Literally, &ldquo;He is the child of a &lsquo;respected&rsquo; family&rdquo;] to mean tini ekjan abhija&#x301;t pariba&#x301;rer santa&#x301;n [&ldquo;He is the child of an aristocractic family&rdquo;]. The word sambhra&#x301;nta has been derived from sam &ndash; bhram + kta and its actual meaning is &ldquo;one who has made a big mistake&rdquo;. The Bengali words a&#x301;m [mango], lebu [citrus fruit], a&#x301;slo are such kinds of common errors. Similarly, many people use the words itipu&#x301;rve [formerly], itimadhye [meanwhile], nishcayata&#x301; [certainty], prasa&#x301;rata&#x301; [extension, width], etc. incorrectly. The same thing happens in Hindi when people say bhijin&#x32D;a for abhijin&#x32D;a and abhijin&#x32D;a for anabhijin&#x32D;a. Another example is maha&#x301;nata&#x301;; it should be mahattva&#x301; &ndash; in Sanskrit there is no such word as maha&#x301;nata&#x301;. Similar is the case with dar-asalme; it should be dar-asal &ndash; the word is Farsi and it means asaliiyat me. If someone says dar-asalme then this becomes asaliiyatme me. The same occurs with bepha&#x301;jul to mean ba&#x301;je [worthless]. Pha&#x301;jul means ba&#x301;je. If the Farsi prefix be is added then its meaning becomes &ldquo;that which is not worthless&rdquo;. If one says bepha&#x301;jul ba&#x301;t nahii karnii ca&#x301;hiye, then its meaning becomes &ldquo;one shouldn&#146;t say things that are not worthless&rdquo;, that is, one should say things that are worthless. Just see what it has come to!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The abstract noun for the adjective adhika [more] is a&#x301;dhikya or adhikata&#x301;, not a&#x301;dhikyata&#x301; because a&#x301;dhikyata&#x301; has a substantive-forming suffix added twice. However both you and I will agree that the literary quality that a&#x301;dhikyata&#x301; possesses (a&#x301;dikhyeta&#x301; in the spoken language) is not found in either adhikata&#x301; or a&#x301;dhikya. When we sit around gossiping and slandering during the rainy season, keeping time with the rain and eating our fried puffed rice, we use this word adikhyeta&#x301;. It is incomparably suggestive; we all agree on that. How can adhikata&#x301; or a&#x301;dhikya compare with such a delectable expression. It is like taking a hot potato cake right from the frying pan to your tongue.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Earlier I said that the locative case is used in most languages, especially in those languages that have a systematic grammar &ndash; they certainly have it. It cannot be denied that the locative case uses the seventh case-ending but it cannot be claimed that if the seventh case-ending is used then that necessarily makes it the locative case. In Bengali the seventh case is often used in place of the first. For example, pa&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; bale, cha&#x301;gale ki na&#x301; kha&#x301;y [What won&#146;t a fool say; what won&#146;t a goat eat]. In Hindi the seventh is used in place of the second, for example, saying mujhe ma&#x301;lum nehii [I don&#146;t know] instead of mujhko ma&#x301;lum nehii. In Bengali as well, the seventh case is used in place of the second. For example, a&#x301;ma&#x301;y da&#x301;o [give me] can be used instead of a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke da&#x301;o.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I was discussing the use of the prepositions &ldquo;in&rdquo;, &ldquo;on&rdquo;, and so on. The French pronunciation of &ldquo;in&rdquo; is a&#x301;yn. The pronunciation of &ldquo;in&rdquo; became in when it crossed the English Channel from the shore opposite Dover and arrived in Cornwall, however &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;upon&rdquo; did not come from French. The French un means &ldquo;one&rdquo;. The English &ldquo;an uncle&rdquo; is un oncle in French. &ldquo;An aunt&rdquo; is une tante. Anyhow the English indeclinable &ldquo;in&rdquo;, indicating the locative case, came into existence in this way but it does not have the same meaning in French as it does in English. All the locative-indicating indeclinables were created like this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Apart from the locative-indicating indeclinables, in all those cases where the case is created by changing the word form, the seventh case word form becomes removed from the original word. However the change is less in all those words which end in an antahstha letter. For example, the seventh case singular form of the word nara is nare; ra is an antahstha letter. If any letter other than an antahstha letter is present then the distance increases. Hindi and Urdu follow the same rule in this regard. In the languages of Bihar man or ma&#x301;n are used. In other words, we can see that all languages have a locative case and a seventh case, even though they do not have a separate seventh case form as Sanskrit does. Instead, a seventh case indeclinable is used to indicate the locative case. It is my firm opinion in this matter that the locative case exists and should be accepted as such.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The next subject of discussion is the vocative case. The vocative case has been accepted in Sanskrit but it has no fixed case-ending; it is not the eighth case. In some grammars the vocative has been accepted as a part of speech but not as a case. When considered from the standpoint of case and case-ending the locative case is the last case, but even so the vocative cannot be dismissed. In ancient times there was a need to call others from a long distance in the deep forest and this was the genesis of the vocative. In those days it was very important.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Although the vocative case has no direct connection with the verb it certainly has an indirect connection. This indirect connection appears especially in the imperative mood. For example, shuncho da&#x301;da&#x301;, ekva&#x301;r a&#x301;sbe [Listen Dada, come sometime]. Here the imperative verb a&#x301;sbe maintains an indirect link with the vocative da&#x301;da&#x301;. From some points of view, the vocative has to be accepted as a case when it maintains a link with the verb. How can we not accept the vocative as a case when we accept the dative so emphatically? Moreover, often the word form or case-ending in the vocative is different from the nominative. For example, the third person singular of the word ma&#x301;tr [mother] is ma&#x301;ta&#x301; but in the vocative it becomes ma&#x301;tah. &ldquo;Mother, come&rdquo; will be ma&#x301;tah a&#x301;gacchatu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Incidentally, words that end with the suffix trrn&#x301; add a visarga (h) in the vocative, for example, ma&#x301;tah, bhra&#x301;tah, pitah, and so on. The interesting thing is that these words which end with the suffix trrn are related to Latin, French, English and also a little to Farsi. One example is the Vedic word pitr (Its Rgvedic pronunciation is pitar, the Yajurvedic pronunciation is pitr, and the Atharvavedic pronunciation is pitru):<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Latin &ndash; pater<br>French &ndash; pere<br>English &ndash; father<br>Farsi &ndash; pedar<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Vedic bhra&#x301;tr (Its Rgvedic pronunciation is bhra&#x301;tar):<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Latin &ndash; frater<br>French &ndash; frere<br>English &ndash; brother<br>Farsi &ndash; bera&#x301;dar<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Vedic ma&#x301;tr (Its Rgvedic pronunciation is ma&#x301;tar):<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Latin &ndash; mater<br>French &ndash; mere<br>English &ndash; mother<br>Farsi &ndash; ma&#x301;da&#x301;r<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->It is worth pointing out that each of these words ends in ra or &ldquo;r&rdquo;. The fixed rule for these words ending in trrn&#x301; is the sixth case ending uh and the vocative case-ending ah. For example, the sixth case is ma&#x301;tuh, pituh, etc. and the vocative is ma&#x301;tah, pitah, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Up to now we have discussed different cases and case-endings. To sum up the discussion on case, the different case and case-ending forms can shown through a shloka:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The Inclination for the Creation of Words<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The inclination within people to create words has a limitless value for the alteration of language and linguistic style. Many places in India and Southeast Asia have been named with the words pura, nagara, etc., added on. In Sanskrit small cities used to be called pura and large cities were called nagara (incidentally, the word pur is actually Farsi). The difference between the two was that a nagara used to be completely encircled by a wall which was called nagaraves&#x301;t&#x301;anii in Sanskrit. Those who used to live within the walls of the nagara were called na&#x301;garika. The word used today in English as a synonym for na&#x301;garika, &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;, bears no relation to the ancient word na&#x301;garika. Na&#x301;garika means &ldquo;inhabitant of a nagara&rdquo;, while &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;, the way it is used today, refers to any resident of a country whether they live in a city or in a rural village.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Actually the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; means a resident of this kind of wall-enclosed city. Neither the English &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; nor the Bengali na&#x301;garika refers to the resident of a particular country. In other words, the pure English expression for the English word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;, as we use it today, as well as for the word na&#x301;garika in Bengali, is &ldquo;bonafide inhabitant&rdquo;. The Farsi word for this is mulkii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->This wall-enclosed city used to be called ha&#x301;belii in Urdu and ha&#x301;olii in Bhojpuri. There is a place in Monghyr District by the name of Habelii Kharagpur. According to the practice of those days the main gate of the ha&#x301;belii or nagara used to be closed at nine at night and the key used to remain with the city-father or the sheriff.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Many places in India and Southeast Asia were named with the words pura, nagara, upanagara, etc. added on. We have taken many of these words from Farsi, for example, the Urdu word man&#x301;d&#x301;i meaning &ldquo;marketing centre&rdquo;; in Sanskrit it is called vipan&#x301;ana kendra or vipan&#x301;i, that is, &ldquo;where commodities are taken for the purposes of selling, or vipan&#x301;ana&rdquo;. Many people mistakenly use the word &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; to refer to shopping. Actually &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; means selling. The villagers go to the market or bazaar to sell their goods and produce, that is, they go for marketing. We go to the market to buy potatoes or pat&#x301;ol [wax gourd], that is, we go for shopping. The pure Bengali word for &ldquo;marketing centre&rdquo; or man&#x301;d&#x301;i is posta&#x301;. There is a Posta&#x301; Bazaar in Calcutta. Have you all read the famous poem by Sukumar Ray? Shunte pelum posta&#x301; giye/Toma&#x301;r na&#x301;ki meye viye [When I went to market/ I heard about your daughter&#146;s wedding].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->If a place has a village and a flourishing market for buying and selling then it is called a gain&#x32D;ja (ganj-a). The English distorted the pronunciation to ganj (spelled &ldquo;gunge&rdquo;). In this way the place called Ballygunge came from the name of Mr. Bailey, Tolleygunge from Mr. Tolley, and so on. The actual pronunciation should be Baligain&#x32D;ja, T&#x301;a&#x301;ligain&#x32D;ja. The common people of east Bengal say Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;gain&#x32D;ja, Munsiigain&#x32D;ja. They pronounce these names correctly. Now if someone persists with a faulty pronunciation should we follow them blindly or should we open their eyes to their error? You tell me.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->There is another word in Bengali &ndash; ha&#x301;t&#x301;. The word ha&#x301;t&#x301; comes from the Sanskrit word hat&#x301;t&#x301;a. For example, if many ha&#x301;t&#146;s are strung together then it is called hat&#x301;t&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301; in Sanskrit. Certainly many of you have read the story &ldquo;Hat&#x301;t&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In Sanskrit a very large ha&#x301;t&#x301; is called hat&#x301;t&#x301;ika. Hat&#x301;t&#x301;a plus the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;ik makes hat&#x301;t&#x301;ika. Although grammatically speaking the meaning of hat&#x301;t&#x301;ika should be &ldquo;small ha&#x301;t&#x301;&rdquo;, in actuality it was used to mean &ldquo;large ha&#x301;t&#x301;&rdquo;. The Bengali word which is derived from hat&#x301;t&#x301;a is ha&#x301;t&#x301;, for example, ra&#x301;ja&#x301;rha&#x301;t&#x301;, ba&#x301;gerha&#x301;t&#x301;, ma&#x301;jherha&#x301;t&#x301;, and so on. The Bengali word derived from the Sanskrit hat&#x301;t&#x301;ika is ha&#x301;t&#x301;i. For example, naeha&#x301;t&#x301;i comes from navahat&#x301;t&#x301;ika, nalaha&#x301;t&#x301;i from nalahat&#x301;t&#x301;ika, gaoha&#x301;t&#x301;i from guva&#x301;kahat&#x301;t&#x301;ika, etc. In south Bengal there was a tendency to pronounce ha&#x301;t&#x301; ha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; and gha&#x301;t&#x301; gha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;; as a result we get Pa&#x301;thuregha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, Belegha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, Murgiiha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, Darama&#x301;ha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, Gariya&#x301;ha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>

Previously the name of this region was the Saptasindhu. Bear in mind here that the Vedic word sindhu means both &ldquo;sea&rdquo; and &ldquo;large river&rdquo;, as does the Farsi word dariya&#x301;. Anyhow, when the Aryans encountered the Sindhu River they gave this very large river the designation nada [large river] and named it the Sindhu.

<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->When they arrived in The Punjab and discovered an environment eminently suited to farming they became very happy and began to settle there.

The modern languages descended from this Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta are Panjabi, Pahari (previously it was called Pahari-Panjabi) and Dogri. The Multani language, being a mixture of Panjabi and Sindhi, shows the influences of both Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta and Pahlavii Pra&#x301;krta. Even today these languages use many words derived from Vedic, for example, ind, pin&#x301;d&#x301;a, pin&#x301;d&#x301;i, etc. The village that was settled by the Rawal Brahmans of south India is Rawalpindi. Although sugar is called kha&#x301;nr&#x301; (which comes from the Vedic word khan&#x301;d&#x301;a) in Panjabi, sugar, especially red sugar, is called sharkara&#x301; in Vedic and Sanskrit. Since we learned how to make sugar from the Chinese it was given the name cinii in the spoken language. Sharkara&#x301; is an ancient word from which comes the pure Hindi sakkar, the Marathi sa&#x301;n&#x32D;kar, the Tamil sa&#x301;kar, the Latin [saccharum] and the French sucre.

The place which had an abundance of these sha&#x301;l trees or indravrks&#x301;a was known as Indrapura &rarr; Indpur &rarr; Indpur, which is a village in Bankura District. The Pahlavii Pra&#x301;krta word put&#x301;t&#x301;ara or put&#x301;ra&#x301; comes from the Sanskrit word puttra. It is the same in modern Sindhi. The Panjabi word dohtar comes from the Sanskrit word daohitra, however in many areas of north India daohitra is called na&#x301;ti which comes from the Sanskrit word napta&#x301;.

According to the social practice of the time, those with whose help one was saved from social downfall during the period of mourning also used to be called napta&#x301;, na&#x301;pita or na&#x301;pte. From the Vedic nupta comes the Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta nutta, in Demi-Pra&#x301;krta nuta and in modern Panjabi nu which means &ldquo;daughter-in-law&rdquo;.

After that the two rivers gradually converged until they met up at Praya&#x301;ga. The area lying between these two rivers was the ancient Brahma&#x301;vartta or Brahmars&#x301;idesha which later on became Shu&#x301;rasena and even later was given the name Do-a&#x301;b in Farsi, that is, &ldquo;the land of two rivers&rdquo;. The ancient capital of Brahmavartta was Vrs&#x301;n&#x301;ipura (today Vit&#x301;hur near Kanpur). Later on, after its name had changed to Shurasena, the capital became Mathura. Before Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the king of Shurasena was Kam&#x301;sa. His capital was also at Mathura. The Kayasthas of north India that live in the former Brahmavartta or Shurasena still call themselves Ma&#x301;thur. Since this last part of Brahmavartta was eminently suited for living, farming and all sorts of developed undertakings, the Aryans gave it the name Praya&#x301;ga (pra &ndash; yaj + ghain&#x32D; = Praya&#x301;ga).

Thus, &ldquo;the place where action is performed in an excellent way&rdquo; is called praya&#x301;ga. The Aryans used to believe that this place was extremely holy. It was their conception that if one took a bath at Praya&#x301;ga then all one&#146;s sins would be washed away, so even now there is a custom among a certain class of people in India to immerse the remains of the deceased at Praya&#x301;ga.

Much later, during the Pathan-Mughal era, it grew into a crowded city and became susceptible to flooding during the rainy season. So during the Pathan era a new city was established not very far away and given the name A&#x301;lla&#x301;h-A&#x301;ba&#x301;d, or the &ldquo;abode of Allah&rdquo;. Later on the Shias gave this place, A&#x301;lla&#x301;h-A&#x301;ba&#x301;d, the name Ila&#x301;ha&#x301;ba&#x301;d. In modern Hindi it is called Ila&#x301;ha&#x301;ba&#x301;d. Both names, A&#x301;lla&#x301;ha&#x301;bad and Ila&#x301;ha&#x301;ba&#x301;d, are used in Urdu. One thing to keep in mind is that all those cities which have the word a&#x301;ba&#x301;d added at the end of their names were all named during the Pathan or Mughal era, or else later on, for example, Farrukhabad, Muzaffarabad, Alidabad, Jekovabad, Nasirabad (Mymensing), Jahangirabad (Dhaka), Islamabad (Chittagong), Phaejabad (Ayodhya), Shershahabad (Malda), Sharifabad (Burdwan&#146;s Paragana), etc. The new name of Burdwan is Va&#x301;r-e-Dewa&#x301;n and the name of Paragana is Sharifabad.

Thus the people of Bengal and The Punjab still refer to the people of Uttar Pradesh as Hindustanis. Some people wonder why should only the people of Uttar Pradesh be called Hindustanis if all of India is Hindustan, however, those who call the people of Uttar Pradesh Hindustanis are not entirely wrong because Hindustan does not refer to all of India.

The reason behind this confusion is that in old Farsi we come across the word gain&#x32D;ja, while at the same time the word gain&#x32D;ja has been used in the spoken languages of north India since ancient times. So we can say that the word gain&#x32D;ja is as much Indian as it is Farsi.

However in Bengal the word neci with its special characteristics has found its way into our kitchens and pots and pans and rolling pins and mortars. Since ancient times the city of Burdwan has been influenced by north India so some of the residents of Burdwan say lei instead of leci or neci. Lei is actually a Hindustani word. The equivalent Sanskrit word for luci is shakkulii or sham&#x301;kulii. Luci and puri are not the same thing.

<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->That is, if one eats white brinjal, red spinach, ciciun&#x32D;ga&#x301; and hill kalmia then even the twice-born versed in the Vedas and Vedanta will meet their downfall.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, this white brinjal is called [&ldquo;eggplant&rdquo;] in American English. The proper English for all varieties of begun is &ldquo;brinjal&rdquo;. Brinjal is called va&#x301;ta&#x301;yu&#x301; in Panjabi. This word comes from the Sanskrit word va&#x301;rta&#x301;ku. Brinjal came to our country from China a long time ago. There are many other names for it also in Sanskrit. Those of you who have an almanac at home will discover that on certain dates it is forbidden to eat va&#x301;rta&#x301;ku and on others vrnta&#x301;ka. At any rate, the be of the word begun is not a Farsi prefix.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->Another very common word in Bengali is ba&#x301;ha&#x301;dur. Many people think that this word may have come from Farsi. At first glance this seems to be so but actually it has not. There was a common word in Vedic, bhagadhara, which meant &ldquo;fortunate&rdquo;. This bhagadhara became bahadara in Pra&#x301;krta, from that baha&#x301;dar in Farsi, baha&#x301;dar in Panjabi, baha&#x301;dar or baha&#x301;dur in Urdu, bahadur in Hindi, and in Bengali we clean up this baha&#x301;dur, dress it in a dhoti and a shawl and set it loose as ba&#x301;ha&#x301;dur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->There is a place in Mymensing District known as Bahadurabad. The word a&#x301;ba&#x301;d is, of course, Farsi but while the word ba&#x301;ha&#x301;dur may appear to be Farsi it is originally Vedic. In Bengali names one often comes across a mixture of two languages, for example, Ha&#x301;za&#x301;rila&#x301;l (Farsi-Hindi), Banoya&#x301;rila&#x301;l (Vrajabha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;-Hindi), and Phajle Karim (Arabic-Farsi). If the latter were written in only Farsi then it should have been Kudrat-i-Khuda&#x301; and if it were only Arabic then it should have been Phazal-ul-Karim.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->The rule for compound words in Bengali is that if the first word is an adjective ending in a and the second word is suffixed by anat&#x301; or kta then the first word ending becomes ii. For example, bhasma + bhu&#x301;ta = bhasmiibhu&#x301;ta, nava + karan&#x301;a = naviikaran&#x301;a. stagita + karan&#x301;a = stagitiikaran&#x301;a, ghana + bhu&#x301;ta = ghaniibhu&#x301;ta, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->In many people one can recognize a tendency to exclude foreign words. They like to say a&#x301;ra&#x301;m keda&#x301;ra&#x301; for &ldquo;easy-chair&rdquo; and jharn&#x301;a kalam for &ldquo;fountain pen&rdquo;, however both a&#x301;ra&#x301;m and keda&#x301;ra&#x301; in the word a&#x301;ra&#x301;m keda&#x301;ra&#x301; are foreign words. What is the justification for importing the foreign words a&#x301;ra&#x301;m and keda&#x301;ra&#x301; to replace the foreign word &ldquo;easy-chair&rdquo;? Although the word a&#x301;ra&#x301;m also exists in Sanskrit it has a different meaning. A&#x301;ra&#x301;m in Sanskrit means &ldquo;small house&rdquo; or &ldquo;garden house&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->Although the word jharn&#x301;a in the word jharn&#x301;akalam is native Indian, the word kalam is foreign. This kind of tendency cannot be considered beneficial from any point of view. People import and use words as a matter of necessity, and out of necessity we will sit in our &ldquo;easy-chair&rdquo; and write in our &ldquo;diary&rdquo; with our &ldquo;fountain-pen&rdquo;. When we feel the need we will even take a look at our &ldquo;notebook&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> No one can object to this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->Look, many of you cultivate [ca&#x301;s&#x301;-a&#x301;ba&#x301;d] your land, so even if it is a little outside the scope of this discussion I would like to point out that if you tell anyone ca&#x301;s&#x301;-a&#x301;ba&#x301;d kari [I cultivate] then you should know that the word ca&#x301;s&#x301; is a pure Bengali word and the word a&#x301;ba&#x301;d is Farsi. You mix the two when you cultivate. The blue-bloods or orthodox nobility in the world of grammar may find scholarly fault in this but I see no cause for objection. You can say ca&#x301;s&#x301;-a&#x301;ba&#x301;d just as happily as you practise it. The more you practise ca&#x301;s&#x301;-a&#x301;ba&#x301;d and develop it, the more you will find solutions to food problems. Right then. Pick up the plough and the yoke and take to the soil.<!-- /block --></p>
