<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Cognitive Principle is the singular entity, but people give Him so many names according to their respective cogitative projections. A spiritual aspirant has nothing to do with the quarrel or the controversy regarding the magnanimity of these many names as the spiritual aspirant knows that the inner spirit of all these names is the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now, let us take these names one by one. The most popular name is Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. What is the inner meaning of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a? The word &ldquo;Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a&rdquo; has been composed of Na&#x301;ra + Ayana and the inner meaning of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is Parama Purus&#x301;a. The word Na&#x301;ra has got three meanings in Sam&#x301;skrta. One meaning of &ldquo;Na&#x301;ra&rdquo; is devotion ( Bhakti). You know there was a great sage, Na&#x301;rada, which means the donor of Bhakti. &ldquo;Da&rdquo; means donor, so Na&#x301;rada means one who distributes devotion. Another meaning of &ldquo;Na&#x301;ra&rdquo; is water. (niira) The third meaning is Supreme Operative Principle or Parama&#x301; Prakrti. Then what is the meaning of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a? Sometimes the word &ldquo;Prakrti&rdquo; is erroneously used for nature. We say &ldquo;it is a natural creation&rdquo;, but there is a difference between nature and Prakrti. Nature is the functional style of Prakrti, Prakrti is not nature. So Prakrti &ndash; the Operative Principle gets shelter in Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, as &ldquo;Ayana&rdquo; means shelter. Then Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a means the shelter of the Supreme Operative Principle, who is the superstratum of Supreme Operative Principle. It is Parama Purus&#x301;a the Supreme Cognitive Principle, which is the transcendental and all-pervading entity. So Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a means Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Then another popular name is Shiva. Shiva and Shakti are the two aspects of the same reality. Shakti is not a separate entity: Shakti is the immanent principle and Shiva the transcendental. &ldquo;Shakti&rdquo; means Operative Principle. In every action, two principles are required, one cognitive and another operative. Suppose you are a machine-man, you are operating a machine. In that case also two principles are working. You are operating the machine according to the dictates of your brain. So here this power of regulating the machine acts as the cognitive principle; the links, that is the muscles with which you are operating the machinery, become the operative principle. The universe is also created by principles &ndash; the Cognitive Principle, Parama Purus&#x301;a and the Operative Principle &ndash; Parama&#x301; Prakrti. Though it sounds dualistic in theory it is monistic in its spirit. The composite name of Shiva and Shakti is Brahma. So here Shiva means this Cognitive Principle which means the Caetanya, the Cosmic Consciousness. Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a means the Supreme consciousness and Shiva also means the Supreme consciousness, so there is no difference between Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a and Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, let us take another word &ndash; Ma&#x301;dhava. In Sam&#x301;skrta &ldquo;Ma&#x301;&rdquo; has got three meanings. One meaning of &ldquo;Ma&#x301;&rdquo; is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, as for example, &ldquo;Ma&#x301; Gaccha&rdquo; &ndash; don&#146;t go. Another meaning of &ldquo;Ma&#x301;&rdquo; is indriya &ndash; the sensory and the motor organs. This is why the tongue is also called &ldquo;Ma&#x301;&rdquo;. The third meaning of &ldquo;Ma&#x301;&rdquo; is the Supreme Operative principle &ndash; Laks&#x301;mii, Parama&#x301; Prakrti. &ldquo;Dhava&rdquo; means controller, &ldquo;Dhava&rdquo; means husband. That is why a lady who has lost her husband is called Vidhava&#x301;. Another meaning of dhava is also white. Hence &ldquo;Madhava&rdquo; means the Controller of Prakrti. Who is the Controller of Prakrti &ndash; the Operative Principle? It is Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence, Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, Shiva and Ma&#x301;dhava denote the same thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now, let us take another word &ndash; Ra&#x301;ma. The meaning of &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma&rdquo; is Ra&#x301;mante Yoginah Yasmin Iti Ra&#x301;mah. The Sam&#x301;skrta root is &ldquo;Ram&rdquo; which means to enjoy the supreme beatitude. Ram + ghain&#x32D; = Ra&#x301;ma means shelter of Supreme beatitude. It is Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence one should not quarrel regarding the greatness of the different names of different deities. All have got the same import &ndash; the same meaning. Another meaning of Ra&#x301;ma is Rati Mahiidhara Ra&#x301;ma &ndash; the most dazzling, the most glittering entity. All accept Parama Purus&#x301;a as the most glittering entity. Another meaning of Ra&#x301;ma: Ra&#x301;van&#x301;as&#x301;ya Maran&#x301;am iti Ra&#x301;ma. What is Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a? You know human mind has got both the subtle and debasing propensities. As subtler propensities are directed towards the Self, there is no question of their extroversial expressions. Only the debasing propensities of human mind are expressed in ten directions - east, west, north, south, north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west, above and below. The pu&#x301;rva, pashcima, uttar, daks&#x301;in&#x301;a, urdhva, and adhah are known as &ldquo;Pradisha&rdquo; in Sanskrit and Isha&#x301;na, Va&#x301;yu. Agni and Naert &ndash; these four corners are known as An&#x301;udisha. Six Pradisha and four An&#x301;udisha taken together are the ten directions in which microcosms express debasing propensities. As they are directed towards the mundane objects, the microcosm goaded with debasing propensities is called Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a. This is why in Hindu mythology Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a is represented as having ten heads. Now, what is the duty of a sa&#x301;dhaka for spiritual enlightenment. The sa&#x301;dhaka will have to fight against Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a, against those debasing propensities which are the causes of illusion and cloud the spiritual vision of mankind. So to be established in Parama Purus&#x301;a, one will have to crucify Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a. This is why Ra&#x301;ma has been said Ra&#x301;van&#x301;sya Maran&#x301;am iti Ra&#x301;ma. When the Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a dies the sa&#x301;dhaka comes in contact with the universal flow of divine nectar. Then Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a dies and the reign of Ra&#x301;ma is established. So Ra&#x301;ma means Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; Purus&#x301;ottama. This is why it is said that Ra&#x301;van&#x301;asya Maran&#x301;amiti Ra&#x301;ma. What is the first letter of Ra&#x301;vana &ndash; &ldquo;Ra.&rdquo; and what is the first letter of Maranam &ndash; Ma. So Ra&#x301;+ Ma = Rama, because when the spiritual aspirant ideates on Him Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a dies. Hence Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, Shiva, Ma&#x301;dhava, Ra&#x301;ma &ndash; all are the same. But for a sa&#x301;dhaka, the most valuable thing is his Is&#x301;t&#x301;a Mantra. With the help of the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a Mantra or his personal incantation, a sa&#x301;dhaka will attain enlightenment.<!-- /block --></p>
