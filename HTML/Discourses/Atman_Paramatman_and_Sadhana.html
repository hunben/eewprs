<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Due to internal clash and cohesion amongst the three immanent principles (sentient, mutative and static), the resultant force bursts out at any one vertex of the triangle formed due to the ever-flowing eternal force. Purus&#x301;a, or Consciousness, is the Nucleus from whom commences the process of sain&#x32D;cara, or uniform movement from the subtle to the gross, from the one to the many. Mahattattva, Aham&#x301;tattva and citta are formed as a result of increasing crudeness, and mind is born at the stage where all three &ndash; Mahattattva, Aham&#x301;tattva and citta &ndash; are present. The original entity is the unqualified undivided Macrocosm. By further crudification the citta gets metamorphosed into five fundamental factors, namely, ethereal, aerial, luminous, liquid and solid. Right from Nucleus Purus&#x301;ottama to the crudest solid, there is no change in Purus&#x301;adeha. The action and interaction of the three forces of Prakrti cause a change in appearance whereby the Transcendent Entity appears to have lost its transcendentality. This phase of evolution, named sain&#x32D;cara, is the inanimate phase of creation, and represents the Cosmic Mind, or Macrocosm, in different stages. In the living bodies after the formation of crudest ks&#x301;ititattva, or solid factor, division and association of matter result in the formation of mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The process of pratisain&#x32D;cara commences at this point. It is the counter-movement wherein the unit mind gets dilated ever-increasingly, the volume and mass of the unit mind increases due to increasing reflection of Cosmic Consciousness, and matter gets decimated continuously, till in the end the unit mind achieves mental liberation. Philosophy terms it savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Throughout pratisain&#x32D;cara the unit mind or microcosm exists in different stages. Thus the inanimate phase of creation, or sain&#x32D;cara, is a stage of the Cosmic Mind, and the animate phase of pratisain&#x32D;cara is the stage of unit minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Each and every atom and molecule of the Macrocosm is nothing else but Purus&#x301;ottama. It is He who radiates Himself everywhere; it is He who is omnipresent as the witnessing entity as well. As the sun by its radiation pervades the solar system, so does Purus&#x301;ottama His system by His Citishakti. Thus in the Cosmic Mind both the radiated stuff and the witnessing entity are Purus&#x301;ottama Himself. In the second phase of evolution, that is, at the different stages of the unit mind, Purus&#x301;ottama is the witnessing entity, all other objects being crude derivatives of citta. In the phases both of sain&#x32D;cara and pratisain&#x32D;cara, Purus&#x301;ottama is the Consciousness. He witnesses the microcosms and Macrocosm. Purus&#x301;ottama is, therefore, also called &ldquo;Collective Consciousness&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As witnessing entity Purus&#x301;ottama connects Himself to his mental object with the help of His Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and reflects Himself on the object as Citishakti. This reflection is not like a reflection in a mirror but a reflection involving association like the rays of the sun. Association of Purus&#x301;ottama with the Cosmic Mind, whereby He functions as the witnessing entity, is called prota yoga; association of Purus&#x301;ottama with the unit minds separately and individually, whereby He functions as the witnessing entity for each individual unit mind, is called ota yoga. His association with the unit minds in collectivity is also termed prota yoga. Thus in sain&#x32D;cara there is only prota yoga but in pratisain&#x32D;cara both prota yoga and ota yoga are there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It has been fully explained previously that the resultant force of Prakrti bursts out from one of the vertices of the triangle of forces of Prakrti, and that this is the origin of creation. The mid-point of this triangle of forces from whose vertex the bursting occurred is Purus&#x301;ottama. The mid-points of these triangles of forces having bursting vertices coincide, and hence Purus&#x301;ottama is a singular entity. Philosophers have defined Parama&#x301;tman as the collective name for Purus&#x301;ottama, His prota yoga in sain&#x32D;cara and ota and prota yogas in pratisain&#x32D;cara. Parama&#x301;tman signifies &ldquo;conscious of creations&rdquo;. It is the consciousness in the Nucleus and the consciousness in the Macrocosm and microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Macrocosm and microcosms themselves have not been included in Parama&#x301;tman. The collectivity of Parama&#x301;tman, Macrocosm and microcosms is Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, that is, Brahma in which Prakrti appears in manifestation. In Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, Purus&#x301;ottama is the Nucleus Consciousness and so the latter is also named Ku&#x301;t&#x301;astha. The Nucleus Consciousness or the A&#x301;tman in the unit structure is also called ku&#x301;t&#x301;astha caetanya. Its controlling station is the middle point between the eyebrows, the place where the functioning of the pituitary gland is located.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Sain&#x32D;cara is movement away from the Nucleus &ndash; the Nucleus itself being the centre of Brahma Cakra, or the great cycle of creation. The force of sain&#x32D;cara is, therefore, centrifugal. Philosophy refers to this outward movement as domination by Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or illusion of ignorance. Under the effect of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; creation moves from the subtle to the gross, finally reaching the farthest point in sain&#x32D;cara where the crudest solid or ks&#x301;ititattva is formed &ndash; where the metamorphosed form of the citta possesses the maximum chemical affinity, with no possibility of any further reduction in the intermolecular and interatomic spaces.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Depending on conditions, either the unit structure bursts at this point or jad&#x301;asphot&#x301;a occurs, or the mind is formed by a process of division and association of matter. The formation of mind is the start of the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara or the cycle for the unit to progress from the crude to the subtle. This progress is effected by the domination of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or illusion of knowledge, whereby the direction of motion is towards the Nucleus Purus&#x301;ottama, the centre of all creations. Every step in this direction is a step nearer the centre, the destined goal of all, the ultimate result of all creations. This force is centripetal and is associated with the growing attraction of Purus&#x301;ottama. This attraction is His blessing by which He leads every being of His towards the kindly divine light. The associated reflection of Purus&#x301;ottama increases the proximity of the unit mind to Purus&#x301;ottama. The mind proportionately expands and progresses till the gradual expansion brings about similarity of the microcosm and the Macrocosm and the former gets merged into the latter. This process occurs in pratisain&#x32D;cara under the centripetal force of attraction from the Nucleus Consciousness, Purus&#x301;ottama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The unit mind, however, can accelerate the speed of this motion by realizing His blessing more and more and thereby acquiring a psycho-spiritual parallelism with greater speed. This attempt to accelerate the movement towards the ultimate goal is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Only human beings possess the ego to perform this sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is nothing but the attempt to accelerate the motion of pratisain&#x32D;cara and thereby cover up the painful hours of divine separation as early as possible. The touchstone of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is therefore the feeling that &ldquo;I am tending towards Him.&rdquo; Every delayed moment of life is only a moment of pain. That alone which brings His realization is His spiritual practice, all other actions being ritualistic ostentations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Consciousness in the psycho-physical unit structures gets manifested in the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara when Purus&#x301;ottama by His ota yoga associatively reflects on the unit psychic plate. It is through this process, pratisain&#x32D;cara, that the Ever-Merciful elevates each creation of His by the force of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. As already discussed, the physical and psychic clash and the attraction of the Great cause psychic dilation, and ultimately the unit psychic body can attain its final liberation or mukti by its spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Different unit minds exist at different levels and experience varying degrees of His love and proximity depending upon their progress in the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara. The auspicious day of infinite a&#x301;nanda descends, and all the bondages of Prakrti shatter down, when Brahmatva is attained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Such individuals set the ideal for humanity and, in turn, humanity starts paying homage to them. Only such elevated beings can and should be called Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a, meaning thereby elevated psychic beings. Unto their holy feet, one can offer the flowers of devotion and aspiration, but they desire no crude earthly flowers and offerings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The advent of Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a is misinterpreted as incarnation. Incarnation is an illogical hypothesis. The whole universe being created out of Him and by Him is His incarnation. The term avata&#x301;ra means a &ldquo;derivation&rdquo;, and the application of this term to individual units who are far advanced in the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara is a misleading misnomer. It is illogical to consider that the Macrocosm metamorphosed Himself directly into some unit structure, in most cases a human being. Human beings are the most evolved individual units as a class in His creation, and every stage of the elevated psychic Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a is the result of sain&#x32D;cara and then pratisain&#x32D;cara. It is a gradual elevation and not an abrupt descent or occurrence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Logically speaking, therefore, it will be correct to designate any unit consciousness as incarnation of God or to say that the Messenger of God traverses the path of sain&#x32D;cara, goes through a process of evolution and importance, and through psychic dilation in the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara reaches different stages of elevation. The incarnation theory, or avata&#x301;rava&#x301;da, however, hypothesizes that the incarnated being is the direct descent of the Almighty, the rest of His creation remaining unexplained as to its source of origin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The word avata&#x301;ra [derives from ava &ndash; tr, which means] &ldquo;descend&rdquo;, &ldquo;derive&rdquo; or &ldquo;degenerate&rdquo;. The incarnated being, according to this dogma of degeneration of Purus&#x301;ottama, cannot have an equal status with Purus&#x301;ottama. When the psychic status of a created being assumes sameness with the Cosmic Entity, the unit psychic entity actually merges into the Cosmic Mind leaving no dualism. Hence how can any equal status with Purus&#x301;ottama be imagined existing as a separate entity in any stage within Brahma Cakra? The whole theory of incarnation or avata&#x301;rava&#x301;da is, therefore, not convincing and rational for an intellectual analysis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Behind the superstitious belief of avata&#x301;rava&#x301;da lies one more social current created by a class of vested interests. Inquisitiveness and reasoning is a natural impulse in human beings. Due to certain pressing circumstances or intellectual renaissance there was a reaction against the illogical faiths and superstitions prevalent in society. These superstitions provided a strong basis for exploitation of society by intellectual parasites who had learnt to live on the blood and labour of others. To maintain their domination through a system of superstitious belief, these parasites invented means to curb this growth of reaction and intellectual rationalism and presented to the mass a sentimental appeal. Any command, rational or irrational, was enforced on society with so-called divine force by enunciation of the incarnation theory. Corruption was perpetrated in the name of God, and all those raising their heads against such commands or preachings were called reactionaries, atheists, and curbed drastically. &ldquo;Give the dog a bad name and hang it,&rdquo; was their motto. They went to the extent of manipulating, polluting and misinterpreting even the precious writings of many great philosophers whose work had been respected as religious treatises from ancient times &ndash; all with an ulterior motive, to get their interests served.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Ta&#x301;raka Brahma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In Brahma Cakra (the collective name of sain&#x32D;cara and pratisain&#x32D;cara) there is no uniformity of flow. The speed of the sentient force is greater than that of the mutative, and the mutative has more speed than the static. Thus in the beginning of sain&#x32D;cara the speed is greater. Similarly, after elevation, under the influence of the sentient force or reaching sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya deha (a stage beyond the hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a where the unit mind experiences only the sentient force), the speed is greater. The speed of the unit mind far exceeds the normal flow in the Cosmos, and it gets accelerated if the unit mind as a result of spiritual practice tends itself towards the Nucleus Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Since the beginning of creation humans have been aspiring for this merger with the Nucleus Consciousness. The non-uniformity of speed changes the movement of the unit mind to an elliptical force, and the motion changes to oval from circular. They get merged in Purus&#x301;ottama who aspire for Him as the ultimate destiny, but those who aim at moks&#x301;a, where sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the complete surrender of self into That (Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, the Objectless Consciousness), get out of this Brahma Cakra by a tangential touch. At this point of tangential touch is the abode of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma (who resides within the scope of both Nirgun&#x301;a and Sagun&#x301;a Brahma). Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is a concept of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In Tantra the whole creation is known as sambhu&#x301;ti. When Ta&#x301;raka Brahma by His own will takes the help of the five fundamental factors (the pain&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tas), His physical entity comes within the scope of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, otherwise He is Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. When Ta&#x301;raka Brahma takes the assistance of the five fundamental factors, according to Tantra it is called His Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->In Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or in Ananda Marga sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one whose goal is Purus&#x301;ottama merges in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, and one who aims at Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma becomes surrendered into the Objectless Entity. It is only in Tantra that the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma has been specially defined distinct from the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Nirgun&#x301;a and Sagun&#x301;a and has its own peculiarity. Theoretically speaking, Sagun&#x301;a Brahma has infinite sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, and so for an infinite time to come Sagun&#x301;a Brahma will continue to enjoy the fruit of Its own past actions. Nirgun&#x301;a is the Objectless Entity with no action or derivation, but Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is the middle point and can fulfil the function of both. He guides, loves and favours His affectionate sons and daughters. His children say that He cannot live without loving them and address Him, &ldquo;O our great Father, our affectionate Mother, our All, we remember Thee, we adore Thee. O Witnessing Entity, we offer our homage to Thee, Thou art the only rescue in this crude worldly ocean, so to Thee we surrender ourselves.&rdquo; This complete surrender is the summum bonum of all spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, which only can lead to Him from where decline is not even imaginable. Really blessed is one who has attained this complete surrender unto Him, like the piece of salt which went to measure the depth of the ocean &ndash; but a momentous divine jerk and an attraction occurred and the bit of salt was lost, no one knows where.<!-- /block --></p>
