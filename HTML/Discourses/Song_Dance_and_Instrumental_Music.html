<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Once a certain boy asked me to say something on music and dance. I said that the subject was very interesting, that I would write an essay on it in the future &ndash; that would be better. Now I will only say something in brief.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Everyone knows that Sada&#x301;shiva was the original propounder of the science of music in this world. The same Sada&#x301;shiva was the propounder of A&#x301;yurveda, the science of medicine. At the same time He invented dances, songs, the science of instrumental music and many other things. Besides these, He found the link between the exhalation and inhalation of breath on one side, and dance, song and instrumental music on the other. This is called <I>Svara Sha&#x301;stra</I>. The collective name of dance, song and instrumental music is <I>sam&#x301;giita</I>, or music. The word <I>giita</I> is derived from the root <I>gae</I> plus the suffix-<I>kta</I>. Now the question is, why was Sada&#x301;shiva so interested in the arts of dance, song and instrumental music?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I have already said on many occasions that ours is a subjective approach with objective adjustment &ndash; that is, to proceed through objective adjustment towards the fundamental cause. Adjustment means to arrange everything in such a way as to be acceptable. For instance, while cooking something, an expert cook always takes care that things are neither salty, pungent nor sour: everything is in proper proportion. For instance, while preparing pulses (legumes), additional spices are fried in cooking oil and then the whole thing is thoroughly mixed into the dish. This is called <I>Samba&#x301;ra</I> [mixing] or <I>santulan</I> in Bengali. Actually, <I>Santulan</I> means to bring a mixture to the point of being tasty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When Sada&#x301;shiva introduced the science of intuitional practice, He had to keep in mind that there must be adjustment in the objective life of those who followed Dharma sadhana. In the absence of this adjustment, the mind becomes irritated and degenerates, and no concentration in sadhana is possible for such a mind. Thus Shiva selected three things which are very much in use in the objective world but which are, at the same time, immensely helpful in spiritual life as well: these three are collectively known as <I>sam&#x301;giita</I>, of which the first part is <I>giita</I>, or song.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Songs [vocal] are rooted in the physical world, but their impact is on the subtler layers of the human mind. The mental world is the ectoplasmic world, the world composed of ectoplasmic stuff (<I>citta&#x301;n&#x301;u</I>). Songs produce a vibrational wave which makes our mental waves straight, and these straightened mental waves in turn ultimately touch the point of the soul. Now to touch the embodied soul, the songs must have rhythm, melody and feeling (<I>bha&#x301;va</I>). If there is no feeling, the song will lack sweetness. Therefore, songs must have deep ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Simultaneously, Lord Shiva invented two more things: <I>va&#x301;dya</I> [playing of instruments] and <I>nrtya</I> [dance]. What is <I>va&#x301;dya</I>? Indo-Aryan music is divided into two main schools: Hindustani music and Deccan or Carnatic music. The basic characteristics of those two schools of music are that, based on specific <I>ra&#x301;gas</I> or <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;iis</I>, they give expression to different feelings. Then again, there are other sub-schools of music. Each person tries to please <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> in a particular style which is unique to him or her; these styles are known as <I>ghara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;s</I>. In Bengal there is <I>Vis&#x301;n&#x301;upuri ghara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;</I>. In kiirtana there are different musical styles or <I>ghara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;</I>, such as Manoharshahi, Ranihati, Garanhata, Mandaran,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The speciality of these <I>ghara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;s</I> is that they channelize a specific mental feeling towards the Supreme Desideratum through the structures of the <I>ra&#x301;gas</I> and <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;iis</I>. Songs have  <I>bha&#x301;va</I> [suggestive meanings] and rhythm and melody also. But their soul is <I>Bha&#x301;va</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><I>Va&#x301;dya</I> [playing of musical instruments] is not like that. Then what is the role of <I>va&#x301;dya</I>? It vibrates the mind and hence directly vibrates the ectoplasm and maintains parallelism with <I>bha&#x301;va</I>. Once <I>va&#x301;dya</I> loses its basic property to maintain parallelism with <I>bha&#x301;va</I>, it becomes useless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, regarding dance: dance expresses inner psychic feelings through <I>chanda</I> [rhythm] and <I>mudra&#x301;</I> [specialised gestures], without the help of language or words. In occidental dance, there is more beauty in rhythm. But oriental dance utilizes both rhythm and <I>mudra&#x301;</I>. These <I>mudra&#x301;s</I> because of their close association with rhythmic qualities, have become more expressive and beautiful than the rhythmic occidental music. For instance, when we offer something, we perform a particular <I>mudra&#x301;</I> which is called <I>samprada&#x301;n mudra&#x301;</I>. Similarly, there are other <I>mudra&#x301;s</I> which also indicate different styles of offering, for example, <I>praks&#x301;epa</I> and such type of <I>mudra&#x301;s.</I> We can offer things in any style we choose; we can direct a person to stop with a variety of <I>mudra&#x301;s</I> also. Here we express ourselves without the use of words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now, how do these <I>mudra&#x301;s</I> originate? The source of all sound is <I>Para&#x301;shakti</I> [primordial desire for expression], which is such a vast entity that it cannot be explained in words. Next comes <I>madhyama&#x301; shakti</I>, in which we try to translate the <I>bha&#x301;va</I> or mental form into action. The next stage is <I>vaekharii shakti</I>. When translating <I>bha&#x301;va</I> into action, we need to take the help of our vocal cords. Then comes <I>dyotama&#x301;na&#x301; shakti</I>. At first we try to express something: we may or may not be able to do so. In your own life, sometimes you might have experienced that you are unable to exactly remember a person, for instance Hari Babu, whom you have seen numerous times: you feel that you have something in your mind to express, but you cannot give any outward expression to your mental image. This is <I>dyotama&#x301;na&#x301; shakti,</I> that is, feelings that you actually want to express.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The last stage is <I>shrutigocara&#x301; shakti</I>. Now the characteristic of dance is to use <I>mudra&#x301;s</I> to give expression to this last item, that is <I>shrutigocara&#x301; shakti</I>, without the help of words. The <I>mudra&#x301;s</I> of dance are directly related to the ectoplasm: thus the specialities of oriental dance are easily appreciated by all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now, for objective adjustment in the physical world, Shiva propounded song, dance and instrumental music in such a manner so that it would directly vibrate the ectoplasm, so that the ectoplasmic movement converges into one point touching the soul point. That is why great people of all ages have encouraged all three aspects of music. In the history of saints, it is known that Mahars&#x301;i Na&#x301;rada played violin, sang songs and danced at the same time. In more recent times, Mahaprabhu Caetanya Deva also encouraged these three things: he said that the lyrics of the song should directly reflect <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> Himself. And this category of song, directly reflecting <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is known as <I>kiirtana</I>. The other category of song that also reflects <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</I> but which expresses many ideas before returning to the one central idea of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</I> is called <I>bhajana</I>. This is the basic difference between <I>bhajana</I> and <I>kiirtana</I>. In this respect, I fully agree with the previous propounders: I also encourage these three things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now <I>lalita ma&#x301;rmik</I> dance can maintain adjustment with <I>kiirtana</I> without causing fatigue in the human body. That is why <I>lalita</I> is prescribed in <I>kiirtana</I>. Mahaprabhu also prescribed it as part of <I>kiirtana</I>. Now, <I>ma&#x301;rmik</I> means that which touches the innermost recesses of the heart: so it is called lalita <I>ma&#x301;rmik</I>. The inventor of this <I>lalita</I> dance was Parvati: Shiva himself did not invent it. He did invent <I>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I> however. The inner motivation of <I>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I> is the following: &ldquo;Destruction is inevitable, but I will continue to fight against destruction through struggle.&rdquo; So there is a skull in one hand and a dagger in the other. The skull represents destruction, and the dagger represents fight. The underlying feeling is, &ldquo;I will not surrender to destruction or death. I will continue the struggle with this dagger.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Furthermore, it is found that human beings are sometimes affected by various minor diseases; therefore they face minor, if not major, difficulties in practising sadhana. For instance, many small diseases such as liver trouble may cause problems from time to time, and to remove these types of hindrances, I invented the <I>kaos&#x301;ikii</I> dance on the 6th of September 1978. This dance serves as an antidote to twenty-two types of disease. All these things are intended to accomplish the following through objective adjustment: to stir the ectoplasmic stuff, to vibrate it, and finally to concentrate it at a point and to touch <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->This is, broadly speaking, a reply to the question of the boy. If I am to reply in greater detail, I will write a longer essay on the subject, which I propose to do in the future.<!-- /block --></p>
