<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The idea that Brahma comprises both Shiva and Shakti was consummated five thousand years after Shiva&#146;s advent. This is the idea of Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva. It was imagined that Shiva was one: His  right side was like that of Shiva, and His left side was like that of Shakti, or Gaorii. One side was plain white, the other side was fair-complexioned; one side was covered with a tiger skin, the other with linen cloth; on one side there was a hooded snake, on the other, the matted locks of Gaorii&#146;s hair. This idea of Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva [Shiva Half Man and Half Woman] represents the inner spirit of Shiva Shaktya&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma. True, A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> was not composed then, but the idea was there deep in people&#146;s minds. This Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva was not known in the days of Shiva Tantra, but was very much present in the days of Post-Shiva Tantra. Later on it was accepted in the Puranic Shiva Cult, but subsequently this idea disappeared from people&#146;s minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->I saw the figure of Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva in one of the 108 temples on the Burdwan-Guskara Road to the west of Burdwan town. This Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva is a personification of a philosophical idea: that Shiva and Shakti [the Supreme Cognitive Faculty and Supreme Operative Principle] &ndash; knowledge and energy - work in harmony. Energy is a blind force. A little child may die of electrocution, because electricity is merely a form of energy devoid of consciousness; being a blind force, it never stops to think that it is killing an innocent child. Thus there should be proper coordination between energy and cognition. This energy, unless guided and controlled by consciousness, may indulge in destructive activities. Thus all the actional expressions of Prakrti [the Operative Principle] are performed only on the vast body of Supreme Consciousness. If Shakti takes one step away from the body of Shiva, it may be harmful. So Ardha-Na&#x301;riishvara Shiva is a symbolic form of this creation by Shiva and Shakti. Shiva is only working as a witnessing entity and controlling the movements of Shakti with His characteristic firmness, simplicity, and love for creation.<!-- /block --></p>
