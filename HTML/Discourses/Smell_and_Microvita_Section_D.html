<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhalolupa</b>. I have already said that all living and non-living objects in this world have smell. In fact, every living being has a collective smell as well as an individual smell which is determined by one&#146;s inherent reactive momenta, food habits and physio-psycho-spiritual practices. Flies, being guided by smell, move to various objects.  In the human body, the smell which emanates from a subtle part is different from that which emanates from a crude portion. The negative microvita of various diseases which are carried by smell also spread disease. Through smell, flies can easily understand where a wound or boil is located on the human body, so they start hovering around the ulcerous wound. This practice is more applicable to the large variety of flies which hover around overripe mangoes and jackfruits on rainy days in India, than to the small variety of flies. The large variety has a greater attraction for smell. If you break open a ripe jackfruit in the late spring, you will find that small flies will soon come buzzing around, but not the large ones. Large flies usually come on extremely damp, rainy days and hover around overripe or rotten mangoes and jackfruits.  After the mangoes and jackfruit season is over, they move to other regions.  This type of fly have a special capacity which is attracted by the smell inference and is called &ldquo;gandhalolupa&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
