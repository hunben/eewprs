<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[I appear before a person according to his or her desires. His or her whole being will be filled with My being. All the jiivas of this universe are rushing towards Me, knowingly or unknowingly.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Who is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? What is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? The word krs&#x301;n&#x301;a has so many meanings. One meaning of krs&#x301; is &ldquo;to plough the land&rdquo;. And another meaning of krs&#x301; is &ldquo;to attract&rdquo;. He who draws, He who attracts, everybody towards Him, the Nucleus of the Universe, is &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; means the Nucleus of the Universe. The third meaning of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is bhurva&#x301;cak &ndash; &ldquo;the Entity who lives within one&#146;s &lsquo;I&rsquo; feeling&rdquo;. &ldquo;I am, because   Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is &ndash; I exist because Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a exists.&rdquo; This is the meaning. That is, if Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a does not exist, I also do not exist. My existence, my very existence, depends upon His existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->You know, for each and every entity there is an acoustic root; that is, each and every entity creates a special type of vibration in this universe, and that special type of vibration is known as the acoustic root. In Sanskrit it is called a biija mantra. Now, the acoustic root of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is klrm&#x301; (= ka + la + anusva&#x301;ra [am&#x301;]). Why is klrm&#x301; the acoustic root of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? Ka is the acoustic root of the objective world. Parama Purus&#x301;a creates the world from His divine body, and that&#146;s why I say each and every existence is the divine existence. Each and every boy, each and every girl, and each and every living creature is an avata&#x301;ra [incarnation] of the divine entity, so nobody can be hated or ignored. You are all divine children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When Parama Purus&#x301;a creates something, in that phase as Creator, Parama Purus&#x301;a is Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma, because He is the cause. [Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a = &ldquo;cause&rdquo;.] He is the Causal Entity, and the created universe which He creates is Ka&#x301;rya Brahma, because He is the effect. [Ka&#x301;rya = &ldquo;effect&rdquo;.] Now, for Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma the acoustic root, the biija mantra, is on&#x32D;m, and for Ka&#x301;rya Brahma, the created universe, the acoustic root is ka. That is why ka is the first letter of our consonants. In the Sanskrit alphabetical order, ka is the first consonant, because ka is the acoustic root of this created world, of Ka&#x301;rya Brahma, the Effect Brahma, the creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the word ka has several meanings. First, it is the first consonant. Secondly, ka means &ldquo;water&rdquo; &ndash; jalam&#x301;, niiram&#x301;, toyam&#x301;, udakam&#x301;, pa&#x301;niiyam&#x301;, kambalam, ka. Ka means &ldquo;water&rdquo;. One day I told you that the land covered with water, surrounded by water, is kaccha, or &ldquo;kutch&rdquo;. (Ka + chad + d&#x301;a = kaccha.) Kutch is a part of India that is [covered] with water. The third meaning of ka is the Effect Brahma, Ka&#x301;rya Brahma, the objectivated Brahma. The acoustic root of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is klrm&#x301;. The first letter is ka, because He controls this expressed universe, He attracts this expressed universe, He loves this expressed universe; so the first letter of His acoustic root is ka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And where does He stand? Does He stand on ether or water or something luminous? No, He lives with all living creatures; that is why He lives in bhu&#x301;tatattva, ks&#x301;ititattva [the solid factor]. The acoustic root of ks&#x301;ititattva is la. Controlling the ka and standing upon this la, that is, ks&#x301;ititattva, is klrm&#x301;, that is, ka + la + anusva&#x301;ra [am&#x301;]. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is the Lord of the Universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a says: Ye yatha&#x301; ma&#x301;m&#x301; prapadyante &ndash; &ldquo;Whatever we touch, whatever we see, in this universe, is of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rdquo; According to your desires, according to your propensities, whatever you want from Him, you will get. Whatever you demand, He supplies. &ldquo;Whoever worships me with whatever desires, I serve him accordingly.&rdquo; If you want money from Him you may get money, but you will not get Him, because you wanted money, not Him. If you want name and fame you may get name and fame, but not Him, because you did not want Him, you wanted something from Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Perhaps you wanted that He should destroy your enemies. If you are on the path of dharma, that is, if your demands are justified, He will kill your enemies, but you will not get Him, because you did not want Him. If you want mukti [liberation] or moks&#x301;a [non-qualified liberation] from Him, if you are a suitable candidate then you may get it from Him, but you will not get Him, because you did not want Him. So an intelligent spiritual aspirant will say: &ldquo;I want you, I do not want anybody else. And why do I want you? Not because your presence will give me pleasure, but because your presence will give me the scope to serve you, because your presence will give the chance to give you pleasure &ndash; not to give pleasure to  myself.&rdquo; That is why an intelligent spiritual aspirant will say: &ldquo;I do not want anything from you, I want you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There is a story that once Rama and Lakshmana were crossing the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; [Ganges] with Maharshi Vishvamitra and were going to Mithila. Upon reaching the other bank of the river, the boatman saw that the boat was not wood, it was gold. &ldquo;Certainly that little boy Rama is not an ordinary boy,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It is because of his touch that the wooden boat has become gold.&rdquo; Then the boatman&#146;s wife came with all the wooden furniture &ndash; whatever wooden furniture was in the house was brought. She brought everything and got the things touched, and they all turned into gold. Then the boatman said, &ldquo;O my lady, you are a foolish lady, you do not know what to do. You are not at all practical. Now you see, the attributions lie with those feet. If you are intelligent, take those feet to your house and get everything converted into gold. This is the secret. There lies the secret.&rdquo; So what will an intelligent spiritual aspirant say? He will say, &ldquo;I do not want anything from You. Everything cometh from You, so You be mine.&rdquo; And what for? Just to serve Him. Why to serve Him? Not to get pleasure but to give Him pleasure. The man who wants to give Him pleasure is called gopa in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Gopa&#x301;yate yah sah gopah &ndash; &ldquo;He whose only duty is to give pleasure to others, is called a gopa&rdquo; &ndash; and not those who rear cows. [Cowherds are popularly called gopas.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Ye yatha&#x301; ma&#x301;m&#x301; prapadyante tam&#x301;stathaeva bhaja&#x301;myaham&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;Whoever wants whatever from me, I supply him with that thing. That is my duty. It is up to you to demand according to your necessity, according to your requirement, according to your mental propensities.&rdquo; Mama vartma&#x301;nuvarttante manus&#x301;ya&#x301;h Pa&#x301;rtha sarvashah &ndash; &ldquo;But one thing you should remember, Arjuna, is that the path, the route, chalked out by Me, is to be finally followed by everybody without any exception. It is the path of pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> One cannot avoid this path of pratisain&#x32D;cara, and one will have to move round me with a short radius or a long radius. The radius may be short, the radius may be long, but one will have to move round me. There is no alternative.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the atomic structure electrons will have to move round the nucleus. Similarly, in this expressed universe, everybody will have to move round the Nucleus of the Universe. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is that Nucleus, and all living beings are just like electrons.<!-- /block --></p>
