<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This morning a boy asked me a question. He said: &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;, Ravana was considered a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii [great sinner]. But the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a says that after death he attained moks&#x301;a [non-qualified liberation]. A question naturally arises here - &lsquo;How could a great sinner such as Ravana attain liberation?&rsquo;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Well, this is indeed a very pertinent question. You know that the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a is a highly educative pura&#x301;n&#x301;a [mythological story with a moral import]. There are many things in it which deserve to be learned. Anyway, we may make an attempt to answer the young man&#146;s query.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Suppose someone commits a gravely unjust action, for which there is no provision for social atonement, the evil impact of which affects society recurringly; that unjust action is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka. True, Ravana certainly was a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii in this sense. There is an instructive story in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a that explains this. Let me narrate the story:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Fierce fighting was going on between Rama and Ravana. At a stage when Ravana was on the verge of being finally vanquished, he appealed to his favourite god, Shiva: &ldquo;O Shiva, save me; I will die in this fight.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->But Shiva did nothing to save Ravana. Pa&#x301;rvatii said to Shiva, &ldquo;Ravana is a true devotee of Yours. His life is at stake. Why don&#146;t You save him?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Shiva replied, &ldquo;No, Ravana is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii. The death penalty is the punishment he deserves.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->But where will a person go after death? He will merge with Shiva, become one with Him. There is nowhere to go outside Shiva. But in the material world, the death penalty is the punishment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii objected, saying, &ldquo;Why so! How can Ravana be a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii? Maybe he is an atipa&#x301;takii [major sinner] at the most.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->According to the social code prevalent in India in those days, abduction of someone else&#146;s wife was regarded as atipa&#x301;taka; because the code in those days said that once a woman had been abducted, she would not be allowed re-entry into society. (Frankly speaking, this was not at all a commendable system. The stigma caused by abduction meant that the victimized lady&#146;s life would be permanently damaged.) Hence from this point of view Ravana was of course an atipa&#x301;takii. Atipa&#x301;taka is an offence for which there is no scope for atonement, which cannot be set right. So Ravana was certainly an atipa&#x301;takii. So Pa&#x301;rvatii said: &ldquo;Why should he be called a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In reply Shiva said, &ldquo;Well, if Ravana had carried Sita off dressed just as a thief, then he would be an atipa&#x301;takii. But he came in the guise of a sa&#x301;dhu [saint]. Can you imagine the implications of such conduct? Ravana disguised himself as a saint to carry off a housewife. As a result no housewife will henceforth believe a saint. Suppose a genuine saint comes to a family house and begs for alms. The housewife may well fear that he is a thief in the guise of a saint, like Ravana. Ravana has committed a crime which will have its effect on society in future. Moreover, the effect of Ravana&#146;s evil deed will be a recurrent one. For this reason Ravana is not an atipa&#x301;takii but a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Shiva&#146;s answer was beautiful indeed. Nevertheless, Pa&#x301;rvatii said, &ldquo;Whatever the case may be, I will save Ravana.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You may try,&rdquo; Shiva said, &ldquo;but I tell you, you will not be able to save him.&rdquo; And ultimately that which had to happen, happened. Ravana died at the hands of Ramchandra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So this morning a boy asked the question: &ldquo;How could Ravana, as a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii, attain liberation?&rdquo; It is a good question: how could liberation be possible for a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii such as this? Now see who was Ravana&#146;s dhyeya [object of ideation]. On whom was he always meditating? Who was he always thinking about? Remember that Ravana was thinking about Rama twenty-four hours a day. People generally think about their enemies more than they do about those whom they love. Suppose you have a bitter quarrel with someone. When you sit down to eat later on, you will find that you don&#146;t feel like eating. The image of your enemy will come up again and again in your mind. And you will be thinking: &ldquo;I should have hit him a couple of good ones!&rdquo; On that day you will have no appetite at all. If you have love and affection for anyone, you will have a good appetite, but if you have enmity with anyone, you will have no appetite at all. Because on that day your mind will be fully occupied with thoughts of your enemy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now, what was the state of Ravana&#146;s mind prior to his fight with Rama? He was thinking only of Rama, discarding all other thoughts. His kingdom was lost, the happy and prosperous Lanka was burnt to ashes, and all of his sons and grandsons had been killed. Everything was finished. Yet even then Ravana went on fighting Rama, thinking all the time only of Rama. The scriptures say: Shraddhaya&#x301; helaya&#x301; va&#x301; [&ldquo;With reverence or with indifference&rdquo;]. If you think about Parama Purus&#x301;a with reverence, that is good; but if you think about Him helaya&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;with disdain&rdquo; &ndash; your mind will be the same as if you are thinking about Him with reverence. You will be continuously revolving around Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a also has an instructive story about this. While Sita was a captive in Ravana&#146;s Ashoka Ka&#x301;nan [Ashoka Forest], she was surrounded by a number of cer&#x301;iis [guard-women]. These cer&#x301;iis were fallen angels. The story is that because of a downfall on the path of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, they had been reborn as cer&#x301;iis. But because of their virtuous deeds in previous lives, they got the opportunity to come in contact with the glorious Sita. What did the cer&#x301;iis tell Sita? Ravana&#146;s repeated instructions to the cer&#x301;iis had been: &ldquo;Don&#146;t allow Sita to utter the name &ldquo;Rama&rdquo;!&rdquo; Accordingly, the cer&#x301;iis would say: &ldquo;Sita, don&#146;t utter the name &lsquo;Rama&rsquo;.&rdquo; Through saying this, Ravana is taking the name of Rama, and the cer&#x301;iis also take the name of Rama. When the cer&#x301;iis would say, &ldquo;Sita, don&#146;t utter the name of Rama, Sita, don&#146;t utter the name of Rama,&rdquo; it means that they were repeatedly saying &ldquo;Sita-Rama, Sita-Rama&rdquo; [a popular Vaishnavite expression]. Hence whether with reverence or with irreverence, the fact remains that the name of Rama is being taken.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->So Ravana was thinking only about Parama Purus&#x301;a. The fact is that whoever thinks of Parama Purus&#x301;a as an enemy, receives a death sentence from Parama Purus&#x301;a and meets physical death &ndash; but the person gets moks&#x301;a. Ravana died in this way. Who killed him? Parama Purus&#x301;a. Even at the moment just before Ravana died, Rama was in his mind. Ravana won liberation by looking upon Parama Purus&#x301;a as his enemy. Of course it is a story; but it is an educative story.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The scriptures as well as the Tantras have this to say:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Api cet sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ro bhajate Ma&#x301;mananyabha&#x301;k&#8230;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<p class="plain"><center>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</center></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->[I will save you from all sin, have no fear about that.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->If one worships Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; as an enemy, Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; gives that person a death sentence, but rescues the person as well. Ravana has been characterized in the story in this way. Such a battle is not fought out of hatred of one another; it is an ideological battle. Good people fight for ideologies, not out of personal hatred or antagonism. The story has this also to say: When Ravana was just about to die, Rama approached him and said, &ldquo;You are indeed learned and intelligent. You understand so much. Compared to you, I know very little, and am junior in age. So please give me a few words of advice.&rdquo; Ravana then gave him two very valuable pieces of advice &ndash; Shubhasya shiighram, ashubhasya ka&#x301;laharan&#x301;am &ndash; which are still highly popular in Indian society. Very good indeed are these two pieces of advice. Follow these rules at every step of your life; you will benefit greatly from it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Shubhasya shiighram. Ravana said: &ldquo;Look here, Rama, as soon as a desire to do something good arises in your mind, don&#146;t delay at all, start on it immediately. Because other people may come and influence you not to do it; or with the passage of time, your desire may also wane. You may think: &lsquo;I don&#146;t want to do this any more.&rsquo; So Shubhasya shiighram &ndash; &lsquo;Be prompt in taking up whatever is good.&rsquo; Whenever a desire arises in your mind and you feel like accomplishing such-and-such good actions right now, take up the work then and there. Suppose you meet a beggar; he has no clothing; it is bitingly cold, he is suffering much from the cold; and the desire arises in your mind to give him some clothing. If before actually giving it to him you ask someone in your family, they may advise against it. They may say: &lsquo;There are so many cases like this one! How many people can you give clothing to?&rsquo; Hearing this, you change your mind. &lsquo;Yes, that&#146;s true, maybe I won&#146;t give the clothing.&rsquo; So when you want to do something good, never ask anybody anything. This is what is meant by Shubhasya shiigram. Start on a good work as soon as you can; there is no need to ask anyone. Why do you need to ask? Since it is a good work, the blessings of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; must be there. You can never fail.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ashubhasya ka&#x301;laharan&#x301;am. Suppose the desire arises to do something bad. In this case, even if you keep telling yourself that you will do it, keep putting it off. &lsquo;Not today, tomorrow&#8230; not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow&#8230;&rsquo; In this way, keep delaying the action. In this case ask anybody and everybody, &lsquo;Should I do this or not?&rsquo; You will see that many will tell you not to do it. By that time your mind will have become purified, and you will see that your mind no longer wants to do that bad action.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Yes, this was Ravana&#146;s advice to Rama: Shubhasya shiighram ashubhasya ka&#x301;laharan&#x301;am [&ldquo;Whatever is good, do it right away; whatever is bad, delay it as long as possible&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Worshipping Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; as an enemy &ndash; that is exactly what Ravana did. There are other stories like this as well, which tell us of many dacoits and demons doing the same thing. The story of Gayasura is one of them. Although the Puranic stories are not real, they were created for the purpose of educating the masses. The story of Gayasura is one such story. He was a terrible demon. Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u had blessed Gayasura with a boon. Strengthened with the boon, he conquered heaven, earth and hell, and established a big empire. Ambitious of expanding his empire, he ultimately started to fight Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u himself. The dethroned gods of heaven approached Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and appealed to him plaintively: &ldquo;O Lord, because of your boon Gayasura has become immeasurably powerful, irresistible. You please stop him.&rdquo; So Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u went to fight Gayasura, but even he was defeated, because through the boon of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u himself Gayasura was invincible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->This morning I said, regarding the question &ldquo;Who is more intelligent, the devotee or God?&rdquo; that the devotee is more intelligent. But if you put the question before a devotee, the devotee will reply: &ldquo;I am; but I got my intelligence from Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;.&rdquo; Similarly, Gayasura acquired his power as a boon from Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. Anyway, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u was defeated, and Gayasura bound him tightly to a big tree. A devotee of course has the right to bind his Bhagava&#x301;n. Bound thus, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u said: &ldquo;Look, Gayasura! Before I granted you a boon. Now you grant me a boon.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Gayasura said, &ldquo;My Lord, I am yours, so whatever you want I will give you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Then Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u said, &ldquo;You see, I want you to turn to stone.&rdquo; Gayasura fell prostrate on the ground. Starting from the lower parts of his body, he began to turn to stone. Gradually Gayasura&#146;s whole body was turning to stone. Then Gayasura said: &ldquo;I am ready to grant you the boon you are asking for, but on three conditions. The first is that you put your divine feet on my chest &ndash; you must put them there.&rdquo; Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u said: &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo; The meaning is that Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u was installed in Gayasura&#146;s heart. &ldquo;The second condition is that whoever worships you will certainly attain mukti [liberation] and moks&#x301;a [non-qualified liberation]. To anyone in the world &ndash; even a sinner or a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii &ndash; who worships you, you must give mukti and moks&#x301;a.&rdquo; Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u agreed to this also: &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo; &ldquo;The third condition is, if anyone worships you and does not attain mukti and moks&#x301;a, then Gayasura will rise again.&rdquo; Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u said: &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo; Now see the beautiful way Gayasura has been characterized here!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Even sinners, dura&#x301;ca&#x301;riis [those of wicked conduct] and hiina&#x301;ca&#x301;riis [those of low conduct] are sure to attain mukti and moks&#x301;a if they perform the upa&#x301;sana&#x301; [worship] of Parama Purus&#x301;a in the right way. What exactly is the meaning of the Sanskrit word upa&#x301;sana&#x301;? It is &ldquo;guiding oneself to Parama Purus&#x301;a&rdquo;. The word upa means &ldquo;close to&rdquo;, &ldquo;near&rdquo;. Upa&#x301;sana&#x301; thus signifies moving one&#146;s a&#x301;sana, one&#146;s sitting-place, nearer to Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is to say, upa&#x301;sana&#x301; means sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Human beings are ordinarily far away from Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence to gradually move towards Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is the essential meaning of upa&#x301;sana&#x301;. Upa &ndash; as + n&#x301;ic + lyut&#x301; + t&#x301;a&#x301; = upa&#x301;sana&#x301;. (And not merely moving towards Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, but remaining perfectly close to Him, is what is called upava&#x301;sa. Upa means &ldquo;near&rdquo; and va&#x301;sa means &ldquo;to live&rdquo; or &ldquo;to remain&rdquo;. Nowadays upava&#x301;sa has come to mean not eating, or voluntary abstention from food &ndash; what is called &ldquo;fasting&rdquo; in English. But upava&#x301;sa is not fasting. Fasting or refraining from food is anas&#x301;ana in Sanskrit. Thus anas&#x301;ana and upava&#x301;sa are not synonymous. On Eka&#x301;dashii [&ldquo;eleventh&rdquo; day after the new moon or full moon], the full moon and the new moon very little food should be taken &ndash; almost like not eating at all. One should keep the body light and keep the mind close to Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; alone. You should minimize your daily work and spend most of your time in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. This is called upava&#x301;sa.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->One who worships Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; with sincere devotion, even if he or she is a [sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii] &ndash; a greater sinner than a sinner &ndash; is sure to attain mukti and moks&#x301;a The Giita&#x301; says: Api cet sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ro bhajate ma&#x301;mananyabha&#x301;k&#8230; [&ldquo;If even the most wicked people worship Me with a concentrated mind&#8230;&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Who is a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii? A person who causes your downfall if you come in contact with the person is a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii for you. If a sinner comes in contact with a maha&#x301;tma&#x301; [elevated soul], that will not cause the downfall of the saint, rather it will have an uplifting effect on the sinner. So that sinner is not a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii for the maha&#x301;tma&#x301;. But that sinner is a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii for you, because coming in contact with that person will lead to your downfall. Thus one who is a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii to an ordinary person is not so in relation to a saint. When a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii comes in touch with a maha&#x301;tma&#x301; and takes shelter in him, the dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii is changed to a person of noble character; while it may happen that for you to come in contact with that same dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii will cause your downfall. For this reason, everybody should keep at a distance from persons who are dura&#x301;ca&#x301;riis to them. When you feel that association with such-and-such person will have a degrading effect on you, you should keep away from that person. Sa&#x301;dhus and maha&#x301;tma&#x301;s never keep away from anybody, because they do not risk degradation through association with anybody; rather those who come in contact with the sa&#x301;dhus and maha&#x301;tma&#x301;s will be uplifted. That is why is has been said Bhaja sa&#x301;dhusama&#x301;gamam [&ldquo;Associate with the virtuous&rdquo;]. There are, however, different rules for different people. What are they?<!-- /block --></p>

People of this type are durjanas to ordinary people. But if it is absolutely necessary to be in contact with such a person, then what should you do? Suppose your good qualities are four per cent, while the bad qualities of the durjana are ten per cent. What do you do? Well, when you contact that person you take two or three other persons with you. As a result, the combined good qualities of you and your companions will come to twelve or thirteen per cent. The bad qualities of the wicked person being only ten, the influence of those bad qualities can be overcome. The effect will be like that of satsaun&#x32D;ga [good company]. That is why all sa&#x301;dhakas should assemble for dharmacakra [collective meditation].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Mucyate bhavabandhana&#x301;t &ndash; &ldquo;They will be liberated from earthly bondages.&rdquo; What does the word bhava [sometimes translated &ldquo;the earth&rdquo; or &ldquo;the expressed universe&rdquo;] mean here? It means the minimum reactive momenta &ndash; that is, the minimum part of the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta] of any individual&#146;s actions, the unrequited sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, for which the person will have to be reborn, will have to come to earth again. Bhava is the very small part of the acquired sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras that is left over as a residual and that causes rebirth in the world; those minimum residual sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are called bhava.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Unless one goes beyond these accumulated sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, this accumulated bhava, there can be no mukti or moks&#x301;a. That is why we speak of the bhavasamudra or bhavasa&#x301;gara [&ldquo;ocean of bhava&rdquo; or &ldquo;sea of bhava&rdquo;]. Liberation from earthly bondages is extremely difficult for someone who has not yet tasted the fruits of his or her previous actions, or whose sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, though they have begun to take effect, have not yet been exhausted. But an individual who has surrendered to Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; will attain liberation from the bhavasa&#x301;gara. And the extraordinary sa&#x301;dhakas, the best sa&#x301;dhakas, will certainly attain liberation. Even hiina&#x301;ca&#x301;riis and dura&#x301;ca&#x301;riis will certainly attain mukti and moks&#x301;a. So for no reason, under any circumstances, should anyone worry.<!-- /block --></p>
