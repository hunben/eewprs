<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Whenever anything is created, there must be three factors: first, the creator; second, the creative faculty; and third, the material. In case of this universe, other factors include the Supreme Creator or the Parama Purus&#x301;a and the Operative Principle or Parama Prakrti with its dexterity of creation. Then, who is the Causal Matrix? Not the Operative Principle, but the Supreme Consciousness, who desires to create.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->That Supreme Entity, that Supreme Consciousness, is the Causal Matrix, and is a singular entity. The creative entity, Operative Principle functions according to His desire and the creative faculty, rather the dexterity is His.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Here is another question. Why does He create? What is the necessity of creation? Human beings and all other creatures come here to undergo so many sufferings. Then, what is this creation? So many millions of people came here on this earth for the last four thousand years, but they could not give a satisfactory reply to this eternal question. So many people, engaged in so many types of actional faculties, came. They tried to find out the proper reply, but they failed. But when the devotees came, they said, &ldquo;It is not at all a knotty problem. It is a very simple issue. You learned scholars, you cannot give the reply. Even you, the heroes of actional faculty, you don&#146;t know the reply. But I know, What is the reply. My Lord, my Supreme Father, was alone in this universe before creation. Just think, if you are alone in jungle or in a village, your life becomes miserable. And, in this vast space my Supreme Father was alone. Just to save Himself from the sufferings of monotony He created.&rdquo; And, where did the material come from? Material came from His mind, because everything in this universe is within Him; nothing is without. So no material can come from outside. In His ectoplasmic stuff, that is, in His mind, is the material, and He creates everything within His mind. So many animate objects, so many inanimate objects are there, but they are all within His mind and not outside. A man may be educated, may be illiterate, may be of fair complexion, may be of dark complexion, may be poor or may be rich, but all are within His mind. All are His psychic creation, all are His loving children, loving progeny of the loving Progenitor. So, nobody is unimportant, nobody is insignificant. Nobody should be suppressed, oppressed or repressed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, these created beings, they being the progeny of the same Father, are members of the same Universal Family. They have got a common tie of the Universal Fraternity. We must not forget this Supreme fact. Now, everybody is within His mind. Can a sinner go beyond the periphery of His mind, when there is nothing beyond His mind? No, nobody can go beyond the periphery of His mind. And, He cannot say, &ldquo;You naughty chap, get out&rdquo;. If such an order is given by Him, that naughty child will then and there say, &ldquo;Oh Supreme Father, where am I to go? Because you are infinite, everything is within you. If you say, &lsquo;Oh naughty chap, get out&rsquo;, then certainly there is something outside Your mind, and I am to go there. And, if there is something outside, then You are not infinite. So, either You please, oh Supreme Father, withdraw Your order or change Your name.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Sinners are also within His mind, virtuous people are also within His mind. The sinners are His naughty children, and He always wants that His naughty children should become good children by their conduct. He cannot expel anybody from His mind, from the arena of His universal mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, after creation, after being freed from the tortures of monotony, what does He do? He is playing His eternal game with His loving children, and this is the world. So, nobody should suffer from the psychology of melancholia. None should feel that he or she is alone in this Universe. None should feel that he or she is helpless or hopeless. And, nobody should suffer from inferiority complex or superiority complex. When the Supreme Father is with you, when you are within His mind, then you should not be afraid of any physical or any psychic enemy, that would be stronger than your Supreme Father. When the Supreme Entity is omniscient and omnipotent, no power in heaven or hell can do anything bad for Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What is the system of thought-process? What is thought? Some portion of the ectoplasmic stuff takes a particular form, and that form is a crudified form of ectoplasm; when projected internally, it takes form. Similarly this quinquelemental universe is a projected crudified form of Cosmic ectoplasm. And, after that, due to internal and external clash and cohesion, energy is created, light is created, psychic structure is created in individuals. And, as a system of thought-process, it finally gets merged into the nucleus from which it came.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So, the final goal, the Supreme Desideratum of each and every living being is that Parama Purus&#x301;a, is that Supreme Father. So, all living beings and all inanimate objects came from the same source, they live in the same ectoplasmic field of the Supreme Entity. And, their final goal, their desideratum is that Supreme Home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->All human beings, all spiritual aspirants should always remember this fact, and move along the path of beatitude, collectively singing the song of the Lord, singing the praise of the Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>
