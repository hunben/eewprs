<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Perhaps you already know what aesthetic science is. Aesthetic science is the expression of something, not in ordinary, crude language, but through the refined expression of subtle ideas. Suppose I see something external, and I develop a loving or affectionate feeling for that object or entity. When this loving feeling is expressed in sweet, charming or subtle language, it comes within the scope of aesthetic science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->For instance, some sunflowers may be strewn on the floor, but when someone picks up and carefully arranges them in an aesthetic manner, this too comes within the scope of aesthetic science. Now the question is, what is the primary factor that imparts joy and delight to people? I love those flowers&#8230; I like their decorative arrangement&#8230; I appreciate a particular style of expression. This is the basic psychology of aesthetic science. This is how dramas and plays were first created; this is how people developed the art of recitation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If the one who loves is the subject, the one who is loved is the object, and in this process of loving a stage comes where the object becomes the subject; that is, the process is reversed, until finally the concerned individuals lose their individualities in their mutual love. As long as I love something, my individuality is kept intact: only because I exist can I love some thing else. However when I too am loved by that entity, when I become an object of love, then my individual identity will gradually be merged in that entity. The starting point of this process of merger of one&#146;s individuality into the Supreme Entity is termed Mohana Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na or supra-aesthetic science, and the Entity into which my individuality is being merged is Mohana (the Attractive one). Parama Purus&#x301;a the Supreme Consciousness, is Mohana because He has kept all His created entities completely enthralled: otherwise no one could remain in this world. Imagine how many problems people have to face in their lives; afflicted with such torments and difficulties, they would have left the world long ago &ndash; they do not do so only because of the inextinguishable love for that Mohana. They may not like this world but they love Parama Purus&#x301;a, so they cannot think of going away with Him. Based on this innate and indissoluble love for Parama Purus&#x301;a, people developed Dharma (the universal religion): in this way Dharma first originated in the human society.<!-- /block --></p>
