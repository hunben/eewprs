<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><I>Kambal + an&#x301; = ka&#x301;mbal</I>. Etymologically <I>ka&#x301;mbal</I> means &ldquo;one who is wrapped in a <I>kambal</I> [blanket]&rdquo;. In common usage, it means one who is oversensitive to cold. You must have come across some people who use a sweater or a muffler at the slightest cold weather; they will stop taking bath if they have a little cough. Such people are called <I>shiitka&#x301;ture</I> or &ldquo;oversensitive to cold&rdquo;. In chaste Bengali you can use the word <I>ka&#x301;mbal</I> for such people.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The word <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> is obtained by adding the suffix <I>lyut&#x301;</I> to the verbal root <I>kr</I> in the causative. According to some scholars, when [the vowel <I>a</I> in] the word <I>karan&#x301;a</I> is elongated, it becomes <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> and assumes a special distinction. Then it is neither causative nor is it <I>an&#x301;</I>-suffixed. Thus etymologically <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;the root entity transformed into a sequence of cause and effect that has now become an effect in the present moment&rdquo;. In common usage, it means many of the theories discussed below: <ol> <li><I>Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> means the causal matrix.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><p>In the ancient world, when human beings reached the first stage in forming a society, it was a matriarchal society. In addition to maternal lineage that was already in force, there were regulations regarding maternal heritage. In other words, the family line was determined by looking at the mothers of a family. When one asked a person&#146;s name, one asked the name of the mother, the name of the mother&#146;s mother, then her mother and so on. This custom was observed in the case of both men and women. After marriage the husband assumed the surname of his wife&#146;s family line. This means that a man marrying a woman living on the hills, that is, in a particular <I>gotra</I> [lineage] had to take on the title of that <I>gotra</I> in all respects. (The practice is prevalent in some communities even today.) The law of inheritance was also matrilineal; that is, the children used to inherit the property of the mother. This system was prevailing in the world for a long time. The only flaw was that in this system, though the mother was identified, the father was not, and unless the father is also identified, it is not possible to determine the qualitative excellence of a person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><p>Both the patriarchal system and the matriarchal system have their merits and demerits. However, because man is physically stronger, ultimately the patriarchal system came to prevail. Though the patriarchal system had many defects, which I have referred to earlier, it had two advantages. First, in the matriarchal social system the woman had to shoulder all kinds of responsibilities, as a result of which her life became miserable. In the patriarchal system the man, that is, the father, was obliged to share a large part of the responsibility. Secondly, the institution of marriage came into force to help divide the responsibilities and identify the father. Even after the introduction of the patriarchal social system, many men did not easily accept the institution of marriage, because they wanted the rights of domination but without accepting their responsibilities. Lord Shiva was the first to shoulder this great responsibility, and compelled men to take part in the marriage system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><p>In India, which is otherwise a predominantly patriarchal society, among the Bengalees there are still remnants of the matriarchal social system. Here a nephew [sister&#146;s son] inherits the property of a childless maternal uncle. If the maternal uncle has no children, the nephew becomes entitled to perform the last rites of his maternal uncle after observing three days&#146;, impurity rites. On the death of her father, a daughter has to observe similar impurity rites and has to organize a <I>shra&#x301;ddha</I> ceremony [obsequies] on the fourth day of the death of the father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><p>In Kerala the matriarchal social system is a little more dominant than in Bengal. There the nephew [sister&#146;s son], instead of using the surname of the father, uses the surname of his maternal uncle, that is, the maiden name of his mother. He inherits the property of his maternal uncle and assumes the name of his mother even if born of an inter-caste marriage. A hundred percent matrilineal social system is prevalent today only in a certain community in Meghalaya. When the mother-dominated social system prevailed, a man used to assume the same <I>gotra</I> [community name] of the mother, which was the same as that of the mother&#146;s mother, and so on; and the mother was considered as the leader of that community. And the chief of all chiefs, the original chief or the primal mother was considered as the causal matrix. <I>Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> means this primordial cause or causal matrix.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><li>In <I>Kan&#x301;a&#x301;diiya Nya&#x301;ya</I> it is said, <I>Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;va&#x301;t karya&#x301;bha&#x301;vah</I> &ndash; &ldquo;If there is no cause there is no effect.&rdquo; The movement and nature of everything in the world &ndash; big or small, great or insignificant &ndash; is governed by this cause-and-effect theory. When we look at a tree, we realize that there must have been a seed behind its growth. Again, when we look at a seed, we realize that it must have come from a tree. If we trace this backwards &ndash; from tree to seed, from seed to tree, and so on &ndash; then we will arrive at a stage where the Mind becomes the effect, but as its cause we find only the absence of Mind. In other words, what was the cause at one stage was the effect at the previous stage, and this effect had a cause at a still earlier stage. If we proceed backwards along the line of cause and effect &ndash; if we move on from the tree to the seed and so on &ndash; finally we will get the tree as the effect. While looking for the seed [i.e., its own seed], the mind that is looking for its effective cause arrives at a stage where the mind does not exist. How can the mind understand or experience something at a stage wherein the mind itself is not functioning? To attempt to think about something or argue about something at a stage wherein the mind does not exist is known as <I>anavastha&#x301; dos&#x301;a</I>, that is, the fallacy of infinite regression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><p>While tracing back the cause-effect relationship, the stage immediately preceding the stage where the non-existential fallacy arises, that final stage, is called <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> or &ldquo;primal cause&rdquo; &#133; the causal factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><p>The name of the great sage Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da eventually featured in our discussion of the cause-effect theory. This Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da was the first inventor of the atomic theory. Many people knew about this cause-and-effect theory in a casual, perfunctory manner both before and after Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da, but he was the first person to establish it as a systematic and fundamental theory. He was the first to say, <I>Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;va&#x301;t karya&#x301;bha&#x301;vah</I>. These two parts of <I>Kan&#x301;a&#x301;diiya</I> <I>Nya&#x301;ya</I> (the atomic theory and the cause-effect theory) later helped greatly in unravelling many knotty problems of the world. It is worth mentioning in this connection that Indian theistic theory developed into three distinct, original branches of philosophy: two <I>sa&#x301;m&#x301;khyas</I>, two <I>miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301;s</I> and two <I>nya&#x301;yas</I>. The oldest of these is Kapila&#146;s <I>Niriishvara Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya</I>. The great sage Kapila, the proponent of this philosophy, hailed from a village named Patijhalda in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h region. He attained divine grace on the hill of Kapila&#x301; near Jhalda and established his <I>mat&#x301;h</I> [monastery] at Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sa&#x301;gar &#133; an oceanic island. The second system of <I>Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya</I> is known as <I>Seshvar Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya</I>, introduced by the great sage, Patain&#x32D;jali. He was born in the village Patun situated near Burdwan of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h region. The third theory was known as Purva Miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301; Darshana. The great sage Jaimini, the exponent of this philosophy, was a man of southern India. There was a time when his Purva Miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301; was widely accepted by the ordinary people of India. Kavikaun&#x32D;kana <I></I>Mukundara&#x301;ma writes:<!-- /block --></p>

He also belonged to southern India. The great sage Gaotama, who founded the Gaotamiiya Nya&#x301;ya darshana, belonged to a place near Kamtaul of Mithila ... and the exponent of the second <I>nya&#x301;ya darshana</I> or <I>vaeshes&#x301;ika darshana</I> was the great sage Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da (Kan&#x301;a&#x301;diiya Nya&#x301;ya). He was born in Purus&#x301;pur (Peshavar) of the then Gandha&#x301;ra [the border region of Afghanistan and northwest India]. Although Gaotamiiya Nya&#x301;ya had originated and developed in the beginning in Mithila, it was <I>navyanya&#x301;ya</I> [new logic theory] based on it that brought glory to Navadvip [Nadia District, West Bengal]. Raghunath Bhattacharya (Raghunath Shiroman&#x301;i), one of its interpreters, was born in the district of Burdwan near Navadvip. The famous <I>nya&#x301;ya</I> of Raghunath, <I>navya&#x301;nyaya</I> and Raghunath &ndash; all three became almost identical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><p>Although there are thousands of varying opinions among scholars regarding the six forms of atheistic philosophy, these can be broadly divided into three categories [the first of which is Jaena Darshana (Jain Philosophy)].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><p>The first Jaena Darshana is Digambar Jaena Darshana. Although Jain philosophy believed in spirituality, it is called atheistic philosophy because it does not state clearly its views regarding <I>a&#x301;tman</I> and <I>Parama&#x301;tman</I> due to its opposition to the Vedas. According to the old school of thought, a philosophy that does not believe in any of the three &ndash; Vedas, the <I>a&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> [soul, spirit] or <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> [Supreme Subjectivity]&ndash;is called atheistic. Belief in any of these three absolves one of the charge of atheism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><p>The second Jaena Darshana is Shveta&#x301;mbara Jaena Darshana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><p>There are two sub-branches of Buddhism based on the Buddhist <I>Abhidhammapit&#x301;aka</I> [main Buddhist scripture] branches &ndash; [the first] Thera&#x301;va&#x301;da, or Sthavirva&#x301;da (Hiinaya&#x301;nii Darshana &ndash; the southern school of Buddhistic philosophy) and the second, Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii, the northern school of Buddhistic philosophy). The latter has four sub-branches: 1) Saota&#x301;ntrika, 2) Vaebha&#x301;s&#x301;ika, 3) Ma&#x301;dhyamika and 4) Baoddha <I></I>Yoga&#x301;ca&#x301;ra &ndash; <I>Ks&#x301;an&#x301;ena ja&#x301;yate ks&#x301;an&#x301;ena mriyate, tayaeryogaphalam</I> [&ldquo;Born in a moment, dead in a moment: life is the <I></I>sum <I></I>of these&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>

It was Devaguru Brhaspati who introduced atheistic philosophy only to refute it in order to strengthen theistic philosophy. While propagating this theory of atheism, Brhaspati introduced himself as &ldquo;Ca&#x301;ruva&#x301;k&rdquo; [&ldquo;One Who Says Sweet Words&rdquo;]. This Ca&#x301;ruva&#x301;ka became Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka, the name by which he was later known.<!-- /block --></p>

Everyone was afraid that the tremendous pressure of such a huge volume of water might split the heart of the earth. However, Lord Shiva caught that water in His matted hair and then gradually released it, letting it flow downwards. According to the Puranic account, this water then divided into four parts:<!-- /block --></p>

There is a ripe mango on a tree. You see the mango. Your mind perceives the act of your seeing the mango. On seeing ripe mango you desire to eat it &ndash; there is thus a development of sympathetic vibration in your mind. You then take off your shirt, tuck your dhoti up above the knees, quickly climb up the tree &#133; pluck the mango &#133; eat it &#133; and throw away the seed. Behind all these actions of yours &ndash; wearing the dhoti in the style of a wrestler, taking off the shirt, climbing the tree, eating the mango, throwing away the seed of the mango (I do not know whether you washed your hands and mouth afterwards) &ndash; lies a psychic impulse.

<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph --><li>Whether a literary work is aesthetically sound or not, there is a point in its expression when one obtains almost a complete grasp of its flow and nature. One gains an idea of the entirety of that drama, narrative or fiction. The particular point in a literary work at which one gains an understanding of the remainder is called <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I>. Sometimes we get an idea of the whole after hearing or reading just a little, sometimes we realize it only in the final stage, and sometimes again only after the completion of the reading. The farther on in the story we get this idea, the greater is the suspense in that drama or novel, whatever may be the case. The greater part of this suspense depends on the skill of the artist, and very little depends on the liveliness of the subject.<!-- /block --></p>

This act of deliberately leading someone astray by persuading them to take the path of evil or the path of hell and thus darken the brightness of their future with the small dark cloud of petty selfish interest &ndash; this mean mentality or mean thought &ndash; is also called <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph --><li>In the huge expanse of time, we decide on some unit [of measurement] according to our convenience. The time that the moon takes to go once around the earth, that is, the time taken by the moon to go around all the houses of the zodiac, is called a lunar month. The lunar month is thus one unit. The time taken by the moon to cover one particular star in its orbit is called a lunar day or <I>tithi</I> [a day of the moon]. The lunar day is part of the previously-mentioned unit. Twelve lunar months make one lunar year. This lunar year is twelve times the lunar month. The extra month that is added [to the lunar calendar] approximately once in three years is meant to bring about parity with the unit of the solar year. The time taken by the earth to go around the sun along the zodiac in 360 degrees makes one solar year. This solar year is also a unit. The earth takes twenty-four hours to revolve on its axis and bring every part of its surface to face the sun. This period of twenty-four hours is also a unit in the measurement of time. All these units are also called <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph --><p>One of you was asking about <I>maha&#x301;shaun&#x32D;kha</I>, is that not so? Then listen.

These words should not be prefixed by <I>maha&#x301;</I> when used in the normal sense (<I>mahain&#x32D;chabdah na yujyate</I>). <I>Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;tra&#x301;</I> does not mean a great journey, <I>maha&#x301;ya&#x301;tra&#x301;</I> means death; <I>maha&#x301;nidra&#x301;</I> does not mean a long sleep, <I>maha&#x301;nidra&#x301;</I> means death; <I>maha&#x301;ma&#x301;m&#x301;sa</I> does not mean plenty of meat or very good meat, <I>maha&#x301;ma&#x301;m&#x301;sa</I> means human flesh. <I>Maha&#x301;shaun&#x32D;kha</I> does not mean a large conch shell, <I>maha&#x301;shaun&#x32D;kha</I> means a human skull; <I>maha&#x301;shu&#x301;dra</I> does not mean a great Shu&#x301;dra <I></I> [a person belonging to the lowest caste], but a milkman.<!-- /block --></p>

In the Vedas, at some places, the word <I>shiks&#x301;a&#x301;</I> has been spelt as <I>shiiks&#x301;a&#x301;</I> for the sake of rhythm. Even if we accept it as an exceptional sagacious application, we cannot ignore the grammatical flaw, because in the verbal root <I>shiks&#x301;</I>, only <I>i</I> was used, both in common parlance and in Vedic Sanskrit. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

Since the end <I>ma</I> is not the phonemic end-<I>ma</I> one has to write <I>gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;</I> and not <I>gam&#x301;ga&#x301;</I>.</p>
