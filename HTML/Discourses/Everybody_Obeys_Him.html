<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Lord says, &ldquo;This Divine Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; of Mine is very powerful, so it is not possible for any living being to surmount it. But &lsquo;Ma&#x301;meva ye prapadyante Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;meta&#x301;m&#x301; taranti te&rsquo; &ndash; &lsquo;those who take shelter in Me can easily surmount this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; with My help.&rsquo;&rdquo; So there it is clear that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is His &ndash; &ldquo;Shaktih Sa&#x301; Shivasya Shaktih.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; you know there are two things, Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the centripetal force and the centrifugal force, one helping aspirants in their movement towards the Nucleus and the other driving them away from the Nucleus, increasing the radius from Him. And there are certain functions, certain actional expressions of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; as well as Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. When there are two Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;s, it is not at all logical even to think that only Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; will function: Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; will also do something. That is why there are opposite, rather, sometimes contradictory expressions in Parama Purus&#x301;a. Why these cyclones, why these earthquakes, why these floods? They are all expressions of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. But because the balance is maintained the expressions of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; in the universe are in a position to maintain their equipoise. In the Vedas it has been said regarding this nature of Parama Purus&#x301;a, regarding the fact that He functions through both Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301;, that sometimes His actions are beneficial, and sometimes His actions appear to be non-beneficial; that is, prima facie they are not beneficial, but actually they are also beneficial, because Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is also His. When He punishes, this punishment, this action of punishing, is done with the help of Avidya&#x301;. But what is the intention? The intention is good.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the Vedas it has been said, &ldquo;Anejadekam&#x301; manaso javiiyo.&rdquo; Anejat, not ejat &ndash; not moving, that is, fixed. Why is He fixed, why is He stationary? Because He is above the periphery of time, space and person. There is neither any time, nor any space, nor any person. So can there be any movement, can there be any speed, not to speak of velocity? There cannot be. So He is anejat, meaning non-moving. (In Sam&#x301;skrta the root verb ejat means to move. Sama&#x301;nam ejati ityarthe sama&#x301;jah, that is, a group of people moving together is Sama&#x301;jah.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ekam&rdquo; The very word ekam is self-contradictory because regarding the Supreme Entity you cannot use any numeral. Whatever you think comes within the arena of your mind, of mental creation. So how can you bind Him with something that is of your mental creation? You cannot. But even so we must say that he is Ekam, that He is Singular Entity. What is the reason? The reason is that only when the mind of a sa&#x301;dhaka becomes one-pointed can he realize Him. So if any numeral is to be used for Him, that numeral should be ekam, not two or three.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It has further been said, &ldquo;Manaso javiiyo&rdquo;; that is, &ldquo;faster than the mind.&rdquo; The mind moves very fast, and He moves faster than the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Just now it was said He was anejat, not moving; here it has been said that His movement is very fast. How is this possible? Manaso javiiyo &ndash; it defeats the mind. As far as movement is concerned, it wins the championship. How? Unit minds, or microcosms, have certain movements, and those movements are faster than any worldly, quinquelemental movement. It takes some time for a person to travel to the moon from this earth, but for the mind it will take no time. The mind is faster than any quinquelemental movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Movement of the mind means movement of the microcosm. And, as the microcosm is a microscopic fraction of the Macrocosm, the Macrocosm is faster than all microcosms. And as the Macrocosm is a transformed form, a cruder form of Cosmic Cognition, certainly Cosmic Cognition is faster than the Macrocosm. That&#146;s why it has been said, &ldquo;Manaso javiiyo.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Naenaddeva&#x301; a&#x301;pnuvan pu&#x301;rvamars&#x301;at.&rdquo; Deva means expressions. And here deva means the indriyas, the sensory and motor organs. The sensory and motor organs are less speedy than the mind, so your organs cannot catch Him. If there is, say, a mile race among so many persons &ndash; say your ten indriyas and Mr. X, Y, Z, A, B, C, all having the ten indriyas &ndash; and the Macrocosm and the microcosm &ndash; who will be the champion? Certainly the Macrocosm, the Cosmic Mind, will be the champion. So how can you catch Him with the help of your indriyas, with the help of your eyes and ears?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Some people say, &ldquo;I want to see Him.&rdquo; How can your eyes see Him or catch Him when they have less speed than His?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->So &ldquo;Naenaddeva&#x301; a&#x301;pnuvan pu&#x301;rvamars&#x301;at&rdquo; &ndash; no indriya, no sensory organ or motor organ can catch Him. When there is a race, He surpasses everything. So how can you catch Him with the help of your logic, your philosophy, your science, and so many things? You cannot. It is a futile idea, it is a foolish idea, to try to catch Him with the help of any of your binding ties, with the help of any of your binding tethers, with the help of any of your mental creations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Taddha&#x301;vato&#146;nya&#x301;natyeti tis&#x301;t&#x301;hat tasminna&#x301;po ma&#x301;tarishva&#x301; dadha&#x301;ti.&rdquo; Everybody obeys Him. Everybody will have to do according to His desires, according to His laws, according to the laws created by him for the welfare of the entire creation. And that is why air, water, light and so many entities are doing their prescribed duties, and will have to do their prescribed duties. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
