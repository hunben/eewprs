<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is a land of rough and undulating red soil. Even if this does not completely hold true for eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is a rather high and arid land compared to Bagri. So the air of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is clear and the climate is conducive to good health. The clean air blowing across western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h can hardly be found anywhere else. And its water is equally good. Adequately rich in minerals, it is, as it were, nectar (sudha&#x301;). A long vein that runs from Bakreshwar to Nannur (in Birbhum District) in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, sometimes beneath the surface, sometimes above, is rich in sulphur ore. Hence the water there is warm and healthful. Besides, it contains some special kinds of minerals and gases, some of which, if not all, are good for health. The milky fountain of Bankura in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is a magnificent gift of nature. Its water is crowned with milky froth and is like nectar (amrta) as a drink. This kind of thing is rare in the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The undulating soil, the clean air and the mineral-rich water can make Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h an attractive destination for those who want to recover their health. So I think that if cheap health resorts or sanatoriums are built in selected places, people may come here from outside in order to regain their broken health quickly and at little expense, and in this way the local poor people will get an opportunity to earn some money.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A dreaded disease in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is leprosy. Why does leprosy break out in such an incomparably healthy place as this? In no way is the soil, water, climate or nature responsible for this. It is only a defective man-made socio-economic system that is at fault. People cannot live on water and air alone. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is trapped in extreme poverty. A large part of the population cannot fill their stomachs with nutritious food. It is due to this malnutrition that they contract leprosy. If poverty is removed through people&#146;s efforts &ndash; the efforts not only of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h themselves, but of everyone &ndash; the bodies of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h will once again resemble those of the Greek heroes as seen in sculptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->While discussing the health of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the pu&#x301;rva&#x301;dra theory needs to be discussed. [Pu&#x301;rva = &ldquo;east&rdquo;. A&#x301;dra = &ldquo;damp&rdquo;.] Basically the rule is that the farther east the land is, the damper or more moist the climate is, the more unhealthful the place is, and the more unhealthy and the more averse to labour the people are. In other words, &ldquo;east&rdquo; and &ldquo;damp&rdquo; are basically correlated. Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k is in the extreme east, hence it is very moist. The people there are in ill health and unable to toil much. Samatat-Bagri is on the west of Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k and is a little less moist and a little more healthful, and the people are healthier and more hard-working. In comparison, eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is farther to the west and hence more arid and more healthful, and the people are still more hard-working.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is in the extreme west and is very dry, so the climate there is very healthful, and the people are healthy and very hard-working. The people of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h come to eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h to earn a living as labourers, but the people of eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h do not go to western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h to work, because they cannot compete with the local people as regards manual labour. When Pratapaditya, the local king of Jessore, was preparing to fight against the Mughals, one part of his preparations was to beef up his infantry with a large number of Bagdis from the Burdwan area of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. He settled them with landed property in Jessore and Khulna, and their descendants have remained there permanently.<!-- /block --></p>
