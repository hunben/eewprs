Every vibration also represents a particular idea, and hence each idea has a vibrational sound and vibrational colour. Many vibrational waves are too long or too short to be perceived by human beings - we cannot hear their sound or see their colour &ndash; but they do exist. We can speak of them as causal matrices in the realm of vibrational colour; and consider them as the biija mantras [acoustic roots] of the ideas with which they are concerned.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Although a indirectly controls the seven musical notes, it chiefly controls the first note, s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja. This note is represented in the surasaptaka or sargam [gamut of notes] by its initial letter, sya. Remember that in the vilambita [prolonged] technique of pronunciation of this note, the vowel sound a&#x301; is not employed;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> rather the sam&#x301;vrta [lengthened]<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  pronunciation of a is employed. That is, the vowel here will not be pronounced a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;-a&#x301;, but will be pronounced somewhat like aya, as they do in northern India. (More precisely, the pronunciation will be intermediate between aya and a&#x301;). If singers were to pay more attention to proper pronunciation, they would benefit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As the sound a is the acoustic root of the note s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja, the letter a is the first step in the learning of music. In Occidental music, the octave (do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do) has evolved in a similar way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The difference between Occidental and Oriental music is that in the former the first note, s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja [or &ldquo;do&rdquo;], is repeated at the end to form an octave. Thus in Oriental music we say surasaptaka or musical &ldquo;septave&rdquo;  (&ldquo;collection of seven notes&rdquo;) whereas in Occidental music we say &ldquo;octave&rdquo; (&ldquo;collection of eight notes&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sada&#x301;shiva arranged sounds in the form of the surasaptaka, which contributed on the one hand to the acoustics of science, and on the other hand to the rhythmic phonetics of music. Hence in the study of music we cannot afford to forget his unique contribution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->A little while ago I said that every sound has colour too. Alternative words for ram&#x301; [&ldquo;colour&rdquo;] are varn&#x301;a [which also means &ldquo;letter&rdquo;] and ra&#x301;ga. The word ra&#x301;ga is derived from the root-verb ran&#x301;j plus the suffix ghain&#x32D;, and means &ldquo;to colour&rdquo; something. By permutating and combining different sounds, Shiva created various ra&#x301;gas and arranged them in a perfect orderly sequence. In this way He created six ra&#x301;gas and thirty-six ra&#x301;giniis. This was an immense contribution to the world of music and earned him the epithet Na&#x301;datanu [Embodiment of Divine Sound] in the Vedas. Of course it was Mahars&#x301;i Bharata who popularized these ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis amongst intellectuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->These ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis are subject to changes according to the shortening or lengthening of their notes. Following this system, Indian music is divided into two main branches: northern Indian music (colloquially &ldquo;Hindustani music&rdquo;), which is popular to the north of the Vindhya Hills, and Deccan music (or &ldquo;Karnatak music&rdquo;), which is popular to the south of the Vindhya Hills. Many new ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis are being evolved today and will be evolved in the future. There can be no end to this process of evolution. In Prabha&#x301;ta Sam&#x301;giita<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> also, a few new ra&#x301;gas and ra&#x301;giniis have been evolved, but they have not yet been given names.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The sound a&#x301; is the acoustic root of rs&#x301;abha, the second musical note. This acoustic root directly controls rs&#x301;abha and indirectly controls ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;ra (ga&#x301;), madhyama (ma&#x301;), pain&#x32D;cama (pa&#x301;), dhaevata (dha&#x301;) and nis&#x301;a&#x301;da (ni). In the Vedas other than the Rgveda, we usually come across komala [soft] ni and sa&#x301;dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a [ordinary] ni. In the older portions of the Rgveda, kad&#x301;ii [hard or high-pitched] ni was used. It could be uttered with both sides of the uvula. The seven Vedic and Tantric notes, the seven Vedic metres and the two bha&#x301;va&#x301;tmaka svara [spiritual sounds] constitute the sixteen prominent sounds which in Indo-Aryan phonetics are known as s&#x301;od&#x301;asha dhvanikala&#x301; [the &ldquo;sixteen sounds&rdquo; of Brahmavidya&#x301; &ndash; intuitional science &ndash; and gandharvavidya&#x301; &ndash; the science of music]. These musical notes were used in music and incantation in different combinations according to the waxing and waning of the moon and according to the time of day or night. Accordingly, a specific period of the month and time of the day was fixed for the performance of each ra&#x301;ga and ra&#x301;ginii.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Each of the letters of the Indo-Aryan alphabet, from a to ks&#x301;a, is an acoustic root. That is, these fifty sounds are the vibrations corresponding to the colours of the fifty propensities. The third letter of the alphabet, i, is the acoustic root of ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;ra (ga&#x301;). It directly controls ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;ra and indirectly controls madhyama (ma&#x301;), pain&#x32D;cama (pa&#x301;), dhaevata (dha&#x301;) and nis&#x301;a&#x301;da (ni).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The sound ii is the acoustic root of the fourth note of the surasaptaka, madhyama (ma&#x301;). This sound directly controls madhyama, and indirectly controls pain&#x32D;cama (pa&#x301;), dhaevata (dha&#x301;), and nis&#x301;a&#x301;da (ni). In ancient times, the very prolonged pluta ii was used in musical notation to denote kad&#x301;ii [hard or high-pitched] ma&#x301;, but in modern languages there is no separate letter for pluta ii.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The short u sound is the acoustic root of pain&#x32D;cama (pa&#x301;), the fifth musical note.

<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->R<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The r sound is the seventh letter and seventh vowel of Southeast Asian alphabets, as well as of the Indo-Aryan alphabet. It is the acoustic root of the seventh musical note nis&#x301;a&#x301;da (ni). Nis&#x301;a&#x301;da is derived as follows: ni &ndash; sad + ghain&#x32D;. A sa sound occurring in any root-verb after the prefix ni may be changed into the letter s&#x301;a, that is, nisa&#x301;da and nis&#x301;a&#x301;da are both permissible. Similarly, upanis&#x301;ad and upanisad are equally correct. But in Bengali there is a convention of using s&#x301;a in such spellings. Now, if nis&#x301;a&#x301;da is written with s&#x301;a, then both the Rgvedic and Yajurvedic pronunciations must be accepted.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Of course singers singing scales need not utter the complete word nis&#x301;a&#x301;da, but only ni.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The sound r directly controls the seventh musical note, nis&#x301;a&#x301;da.

<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The rr sound is the acoustic root of on&#x32D;m. You may say, Since on&#x32D;m is the acoustic root of creation, preservation and destruction, and the acoustic root of Sagun&#x301;a and Nirgun&#x301;a [it is used to symbolize Nirgun&#x301;a], how can rr be the acoustic root of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->What is the sound on&#x32D;m (<span class=Bengali>&#x0993;&#x0981;&#x09AE;</span>, <span class=Bengali>&#x0950;&#x092E;</span>)?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->On&#x32D;m consists of five symbols: a, the acoustic root of creation; u, the acoustic root of preservation; ma, the acoustic root of destruction, (.), the symbol of the unmanifested universe; and ([BENGALI CRESCENT SYMBOL]), the symbol which signifies the process of manifestation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->A is not only the acoustic root of s&#x301;ad&#x301;aja, it is also the acoustic root of the force of creation. When the idea to create something arises  in the  mind  of  Parama Purus&#x301;a,  or in the microcosmic mind, its acoustic root is the sound a. Since a is the acoustic root of creation, from which everything else proceeds, a is the first letter of the alphabet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The sound u is the acoustic root of the fifth musical note, and is also the acoustic root of a few other factors, the force of preservation being one of them. When the desire to maintain the created entities arises in the mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a, or in the individual microcosmic mind, then the acoustic root of that sort of desire is u.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The sound m with hasant [indicating that its pronunciation is m rather than ma], as well as being the acoustic root of the tendency [prashraya vrtti] to treat someone or something indulgently, is the acoustic root of the vina&#x301;sha [destruction] that occurs in the course of time. When people feel that something has become monotonous, they want to change it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->It should be remembered that vina&#x301;sha does not mean complete annihilation, but transformation or metamorphosis. Complete annihilation is called prana&#x301;sha. (In fact, nothing in this physical universe is subject to prana&#x301;sha or complete annihilation. But philosophically, prana&#x301;sha means that change which takes an entity back to its original form. If sugar made from sugar cane is transformed back into sugar cane, that will be the prana&#x301;sha of the sugar. Thus from a philosophical point of view, if a microcosm, through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, merges into that Parama Purus&#x301;a from whom it originated, that will be the prana&#x301;sha of that microcosm.) This m sound is the acoustic root of annihilation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The manifested universe is constituted of creation, preservation and destruction (a-u-m). A + u = o, hence a + u + m = om. But that is not the end of the story; the dot (.) and the crescent ([BENGALI CRESCENT SYMBOL]) that form part of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra are also important. The former represents the unmanifested universe; the latter represents the principle of transmutation from the unmanifested to the manifested.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn9"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn9">9</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Hence, on&#x32D;m is the acoustic root of creation, preservation and destruction, plus the principle of transmutation from the unmanifested to the manifested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The source of most acoustic roots is Tantra, although some of them already existed in the Vedas and were later accepted by Tantra. On&#x32D;m is one of the latter. Those Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra Tantrics who do not want to accept annihilation as the last word, and thus do not want to place the acoustic root of destruction as the last sound, utilize the full letter ma as opposed to the half-letter m, and place the letters in the following order: u + ma + a = uma&#x301;. According to Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra Tantra, &ldquo;Uma&#x301;&rdquo; is another name of Parama&#x301; Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is also called pran&#x301;ava (pra + nu + al), which literally means &ldquo;that which helps tremendously in attaining the supreme stance&rdquo;. In the Tripa&#x301;davibhu&#x301;tina&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a Shruti it has been said, Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma [&ldquo;Brahma is in the form of pran&#x301;ava&rdquo;]. Elsewhere it has been said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Etaddhyeva&#x301;ks&#x301;aram&#x301; Brahma etadeva&#x301;ks&#x301;aram&#x301; param<br>Etadeva&#x301;ks&#x301;aram&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva&#x301; Brahmaloke mahiiyate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->[This is the immutable Brahma, this is the supreme sound. After knowing this supreme sound, one attains the divine realm of Brahma.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Now even though on&#x32D;m (which includes the dot and crescent) can serve as the acoustic root of this expressed  universe, since on&#x32D;m is nevertheless a combination of sounds, it requires an acoustic root of its own. The acoustic root of another root is called atibiija or maha&#x301;biija. So rr is the maha&#x301;biija of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. This rr sound is necessary from the viewpoint of phonetics and of sandhi [the science of combining sounds]. Since it is an important acoustic root, it is imperative to decide whether such a letter should be deleted from the alphabet [as some linguists have suggested].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The Indo-Aryan alphabet consists of fifty letters from a to ks&#x301;a. If any of these fifty letters is deleted, the entire alphabet will become defective and the acoustic importance of the letter concerned will be jeopardized. It is up to you to think over and decide whether rr should be retained in the alphabet or not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->LR<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The sound lr is the acoustic root of the sound hummm and of its inner import. The sound hummm is itself the acoustic root of struggle, of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and according to Tantra, of the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii. As hummm is the acoustic root of struggle, people call it the battle cry. You may have noticed that when sa&#x301;dhakas progress along the spiritual path and attain bliss they sometimes release the sound hummm spontaneously during the practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. It has been mentioned that the utterance of hummm during sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is a sign of progress in Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->According to Tantra the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is the sleeping divinity. By virtue of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and with the help of mantra&#x301;gha&#x301;ta [striking at the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii with powerful incantative vibrations] and mantra caetanya [conceptual understanding of and psychic association with a mantra], and<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->by smashing all obstacles, the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii can be raised to the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra. The practice adopted to raise the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is called purashcaran&#x301;a in Tantra. The kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is the sleeping divinity. To arouse it from slumber and raise it upwards is quite a struggle and hence hummm must also be the acoustic root of the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii. The controlling point of the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, is called man&#x301;ipadma or maha&#x301;man&#x301;ipadma in Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na Buddhist philosophy. The Tibetan Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;niis recite On&#x32D;m&#x301; man&#x301;ipadme hummm while turning their dharma cakras [prayer wheels]. I have seen On&#x32D;m&#x301; man&#x301;ipadme hummm inscribed on the walls of Tibetan caves.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Lrr is the acoustic root of the sound phat&#x301; (which is the acoustic root of putting a theory into practice) and is thus the atibiija, or maha&#x301;biija [super-acoustic root], of the phat&#x301; biija. It is just like the sprouting of a seed, like a sudden awakening from slumber. When something which is sleeping or dormant suddenly bursts into the realm of light, we say colloquially [in Bengali] that it is making a phat&#x301; sound. Lrr is also the acoustic root of the removal of lethargy. Hence, considering its enormous importance, it should not be deleted from the Bengali alphabet.<!-- /block --></p>

The shakti [energy] with which unit beings discharge their physico-psycho-spiritual actions is called apara&#x301;shakti. Apara&#x301;shakti is by no means insignificant &ndash; it helps microcosms to maintain their existence and achieve greater evolution and elevation. But the energy with which microcosms direct their physico-psycho-spiritual efforts towards the divine and reach the highest rung of the evolutionary ladder by piercing every tender layer of microcosmic existence, is called para&#x301;shakti (this para&#x301;shakti, which is the primordial phase of vocalization, is not the same as the para&#x301;shakti or Supreme Operative Principle in the unbalanced triangle of forces). Here we are concerned with the ways of expression of language. All the potentialities of vocal expression lie dormant in the form of para&#x301;shakti at the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra. Para&#x301;shakti is raised step by step and finally leads to the vocal expression of language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->If vocalization remains dormant in seed form at the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, it is neither audible nor perceivable in the practical world. The latent para&#x301;shakti has got to be awakened. Human beings visualize whatever they want to communicate, sometimes only for a fraction of a second, consciously or unconsciously. If they are already aware of the name and form of the visualized object, they can progress further in the process of expression, otherwise that name or form will continue to remain in the abstract world. This stage, in which one can mentally visualize what one is going to communicate, is the second stage in the process of vocalization. Its controlling point is the sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra. The energy which causes the visualization is called pashyanti. Pashyanti is derived from the root verb drsh plus shatr, and means &ldquo;that which is seeing&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

This is the second stage of vocalization. Of course just to visualize the perceived object (with the help of pashyanti shakti) is not enough; other people cannot see your mental images or mental words, because those things belong to the psychic world. Linguistic expression pertains to the mundane world. Words are transmitted in the outer world through the medium of air or electro-magnetic waves, or some such medium. Mental images can be projected in the external world with the help of vital energy, but this sort of psychic projection is beyond the capacity of pashyanti shakti.<!-- /block --></p>

The same sound, when uttered with a different mental ideation, acquires different meanings, and the effect it has varies from person to person. The word bet&#x301;a&#x301;, for example, can be used as an endearing term for one&#146;s child. A parent may say, A&#x301;ja&#x301; bet&#x301;a&#x301;, kha&#x301;na&#x301; kha&#x301;le [&ldquo;Come, my dear child, come and eat your food&rdquo;]. In this case bet&#x301;a&#x301; (&ldquo;my child&rdquo;) sounds very pleasing to the ears; when the child hears it s/he feels very gratified. But one could also say, A&#x301;y bet&#x301;a&#x301; toke dekhe noba; tor caudda purus&#x301;er shra&#x301;ddha karchi. [&ldquo;Come here you wretch, I&#146;ll teach you a lesson!

The acoustic root of the poisonous mentality which utters poisoned words is am&#x301;. The acoustic root of that pleasant ideation which adds sweetness to a word is ah.

People who live in a country where not even a blade of grass grows, where people die of starvation, and which imports huge quantities of food grains from other countries, become so infatuated with their country that they say it has an abundance of water, has a bountiful fruit harvest, and is a net exporter of food to other countries.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="154"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=154 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;lagata moha is blind attachment for a particular period of time. One becomes so attached to a certain period of time that one is unable to discern its positive or negative aspects. Some people complain that the behaviour of the present generation of children is disappointing. They say that when they were young they could easily digest iron pans, but the present generation has trouble digesting even water! They lament the great misfortune that has befallen the present age.<!-- /block --></p>

Thieves, in the shock of the moment, always make a quick getaway from the scene of the crime. Later, however, they brood repeatedly about the place, and often return, straight into the hands of the police! A person who uses an object for a long time develops a fascination for that object. This is called a&#x301;dha&#x301;ragata moha [fascination for an object]. There are many rich people who have a strange weakness for some old, battered object such as a rickety chair with one arm broken off. I know a story about how a pretty pot made of bell-metal was the cause of a bitter quarrel among the daughters-in-law of a certain family, so bitter that it led to the eventual break-up of the family.

It may be possible to control this propensity of wild fascination temporarily by intimidation or by enacting laws, but only temporarily. Those who believe in the equal distribution of the world&#146;s wealth, naively underestimate the power of moha vrtti. The human mind can be sublimated only by spiritual ideation, not by any high-sounding philosophy. This utopian idea has proved ineffective in the past and in the present and will continue to prove so in the future.<!-- /block --></p>

Hence literally mrgacarma means not only &ldquo;deerskin&rdquo;, but the skin of any wild animal. In those days the kings hunted not only deer, but also other wild animals. <br> Later on, perhaps, the deerskin became somewhat rare, so people introduced the use of cotton in its place. Even today in certain sections of Indian society people wear a piece of deerskin during the holy-thread ceremony.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn14"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn14">14</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: This straight posture symbolizes that although one may or may not be straight in all mundane activities, one is as simple and straight as can be before the entity being revered.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn15"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn15">15</a></b>)  Author&#146;s note: Dance should not be called shilpa &ndash; literally, &ldquo;that which is done with the hands&rdquo; &ndash; because in dance, the legs, neck, chin and other parts of the body are also used. In some dances every part of the body has a certain role to play.</p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn17"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn17">17</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: Not only am&#x301; and ah, but all sixteen vowel sounds, are located at the vishuddha cakra. For correlation of other sounds with their respective cakras, see &ldquo;Plexi and Microvita&rdquo;  in Yoga Psychology.</p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn19"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn19">19</a></b>)  Editors&#146; note: The lokas of the Macrocosmic Mind are Its different &ldquo;levels&rdquo;, or &ldquo;layers&rdquo;, or &ldquo;spheres&rdquo;. They represent different stages on a continuum from subtle to crude. And the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a represents such a stage in both the Macrocosmic Mind and the microcosmic mind. The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the microcosm is its &ldquo;crude mind&rdquo;, as it is the layer of mind closest to the physical body. It is concerned with physical sensations and physical desires.</p>
