<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->To come in direct contact with the Supreme Father, you are to serve the universe as His ideal daughters and sons. You needn&#146;t be anxious, you must not have any worries for your personal problems. Your problems are to be solved by the Supreme Father. As the ideal daughters and ideal sons of that Father, serve the children of the Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Those who observe and run after the glamour of creation, and those who are continually obsessed with the fear of its possible destruction &ndash; both of them are racing toward the world of darkness. A sa&#x301;dhaka will look upon both creation and destruction with equanimity. The scientists who only worship the creation, and the hermits who ever remain in constant consternation of destruction &ndash; both tread the wrong path, which is not the path of salvation. One who moves judiciously, accommodating both of them, alone attains salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->One who knows the truth about creation and destruction becomes established beyond the scope of death. This observable world is subject to the game of creation and destruction. The man who has understood the secret of creation and destruction has thoroughly understood the world system. For him alone is it possible to be established beyond the orbit of this system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So many things now done directly by the Supreme Consciousness may be done in the future through the medium of individual human beings. Before the creation of developed minds, all worldly phenomena were directly controlled by the Cosmic Mind, including the transmutation of energy. In the future when the human brain is more developed, more will be done through its medium. Be a perfect machine, be a good medium, so that He may do more and more work through your structure. This universe is His, and because He is yours, it is your universe. Serve your universe!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Appreciate the significance of the sam&#x301;gacchadhvam mantra. Be ever united. Solve all problems, large or small, always in a united manner. Remember that the suffering of one person is the suffering of all; the injury to one person is the injury to all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Human society is a singular entity. It is one and indivisible; since the Father is common to all there cannot be two societies. The relation between man and man is that between brother and brother; there is to be no quarrel. Mankind has the same origin and the same destination, the same goal. All are coming from God and going to God. Everything comes from God and everything remains in Him and everything goes back to Him. This cycle is life and life is a struggle; life is a fight. You come from the abode of peace and go to the abode of peace, but life is a constant struggle to maintain an equilibrium. Life is a fight against depraving forces and degenerating propensities. But you are not only to fight against these depraving forces, you are also to encourage elevating forces. If you try to keep at a safe distance from this fight, you cannot say that you are a human being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The path that lies before thieves who steal out of need is extremely narrow. The solution wholly depends on the strong economic foundation of the state concerned and of the whole world. If anybody is to be blamed for the poverty and social injustice which leads to crime, we all have to blame every national leader in the world. Those who make a beast of a person by making him a victim of circumstances, to my mind, are the very people to stand trial, if anyone is to be tried and judged at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The marching together of all in unison is termed society. Instead of despising those who have lagged behind, help them to advance. This alone will be your social dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->You have no right to hate even a single living creature. What at best you can do is to serve only. Remember, you are to serve bearing in mind that every creature is verily the living manifestation of God. Remember also that the credit of service is not yours; it is due to Him and Him alone who has given you the strength to serve &ndash; Whose Ideation has inspired you to acquire the capability of rendering service.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Slander, jealousy, party politics, lethargy, grandiloquence and so on are the various kinds of social evils which, if given scope, make great criminals of people. These evils are very evident in the modern world, and the reason for this is political bias. The loathsome race for political status will not relax its grip over society unless the human mind is freed from the lust for power. It is time for men to be very cautious lest this political tendency continue to shape people into criminals. If the nature of the entire human race becomes infected with criminality, if people become intolerant of others&#146; opinions and beliefs, if they become corrupt and sell all their good judgment and talent for the sake of status, then man&#146;s age-old civilization will end in smoke.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The innate spirit of the word sama&#x301;ja, society, is to move together. If we take into account the proper spirit of the word, we may unhesitatingly assert that man has not yet learned to build a society worthy of the name.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The entire mankind of this universe constitutes one singular people. The whole humanity is bound in fraternity; those who are apt to remain oblivious of this very simple truth, those who are prone to distort it, are the deadliest enemies of humanity. Today&#146;s mankind should identify these foes fully well and build a healthy human society totally neglecting all obstacles and difficulties.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->It must be borne in mind that as long as a magnificent, healthy and universalistic human society is not well-established, man&#146;s entire culture and civilization, his sacrifice, service and spiritual endeavour [sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;] will not be of any worth whatsoever.<!-- /block --></p>
