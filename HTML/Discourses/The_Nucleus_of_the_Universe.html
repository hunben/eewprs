<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Purus&#x301;ottama is the nucleus of the Universe, the centre of the Universe, just as the Sun is the centre of this solar system. Similarly Purus&#x301;ottama &ndash; the Parama Purus&#x301;a is the centre of this entire cosmos. Just as so many planets directly and so many planets indirectly are moving around the Sun knowingly or unknowingly, similarly, so many animate and inanimate objects are moving around the Parama Purus&#x301;a knowingly or unknowingly. They will have to. There is no other alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the case of a solar system, a planet may go beyond the range of a solar system and come within the range of another solar system. But in the case of the cosmological order, the system is a singular one. For the entire cosmos, there is a singular cosmological order, and Parama Purus&#x301;a is the centre &ndash; the nucleus. Nobody can go beyond the periphery of this cosmological order. All are moving around Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Those who do not practice Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; unknowingly they are moving away from Him. Their radius, the radius between that entity and the Parama Purus&#x301;a increases, but he cannot go beyond the cosmological order. Not to meditate on Him, not to do His work means increasing the length of the radius, going away from the nucleus of the Universe. But they will have to remain within the cosmological order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Those who meditate on Him, those who are on the path of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the radius between that spiritual aspirant and the Cosmic Nucleus, the Parama Purus&#x301;a, goes on decreasing and decreasing. The position of a man doing Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is like this [Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; makes hand motions showing an object moving closer to the centre of a circle]. For men of materialistic outlook, going away from Him, but moving around and around Him, this is the position [Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; makes hand motions showing a large circle]. Suppose a man is a very bad man, a depraved man, he is here [far away]. But if he will do Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, what will happen? [Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; shows with motions the circle getting smaller and smaller until the circling finger touches the stationary finger in the centre of the circle]. He will become one with Him. Even if he is a bad man, a degenerated, depraved person, if he practices Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, does meditation, leads a pure life, his radius with the Parama Purus&#x301;a will go on decreasing, and a day will come when his radius will be zero and he will be one with the Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is the goal of human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->You should always remember that you are the children of Parama Purus&#x301;a and it is your birthright to be one with Him. It is your birthright to sit upon His lap. Nobody can debar you from this birthright. That is why, knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously, you should all move towards Him and be one with Him. This is the path of humanity, and this is the main factor that differentiates an animal from a man.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When one doesn&#146;t do Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, what will happen? The distance will go on increasing. He will drift away from the Parama Purus&#x301;a. It is the path of animality. You should never support any ideology &ndash; any philosophy that goads a man into the path of animality. Yours is the path of spirituality. When you have been blessed with a human body, be cent percent human, and go on decreasing your distance from the Parama Purus&#x301;a. And finally, be one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
