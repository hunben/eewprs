Notes: <p class="Para_Notes">official source: <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12</i></p>
<p class="Para_Notes">this version: is the printed <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 11 &amp; 12,</i> 1st edition, 2008, version (obvious spelling, punctuation and typographical mistakes only may have been corrected). I.e., this is the most up-to-date version as of the present Electronic Edition.</p>
<p class="Para_Notes">This discourse originally appeared in <i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch</i> as &ldquo;Psycho-Spirituality&rdquo;. It thereafter appeared in <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12</i> as &ldquo;Beyond Temporary Experience&rdquo;, and finally, inadvertently, in <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 34</i> as &ldquo;Plus and Minus Make It Zero&rdquo;. It will be omitted from <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 34</i> when that book is reprinted.</p>
<p class="Para_Notes">At the time of publishing <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 34,</i> this discourse was transcribed from a tape. There was clearly more at the beginning of the actual discourse than was on the tape. The tape begins with the words &ldquo;. . . and psycho-spiritual.&rdquo; The first paragraph of the discourse as it appears here follows the <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12</i> version.</p>

<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Last night I said that human expressions are trifarious in character: physical, psychic and spiritual. And human approaches are four in number: physical, physico-psychic, psychic and psycho-spiritual.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The woes and anxieties, the pleasure or composure, that a man or an animal enjoys in the physical stratum are extremely limited. That is, the waves of woes and anxieties, or pleasure, function within a short sphere, and that is why they are purely of a temporary nature. The person or the space is also extremely limited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the case of humans, and also in the case of a few developed animals &ndash; animals like dogs or monkeys &ndash; there are physico-psychic pleasures and physico-psychic pains also. Although the jurisdictions of those pleasures or those pains are limited, those jurisdictions are bigger than the first one, that is, bigger than the jurisdiction of purely physical pleasure or physical pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the case of humans, there is psychic pleasure or psychic pain. In the case of animals, most of them have their pleasures and pains only in the physical stratum, and they come, or they are created, as an inborn instinct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->But in the case of developed animals and humans, all is not only inborn; some things are imposed. And not only imposed, there are some things developed by themselves. In them, that is, in developed animals and in humans, there are both genius and technician. But in the case of undeveloped animals, there is nothing like a genius or technician.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You know, genius is an inborn faculty. And what is a technician? &ldquo;Technician&rdquo; means that an ordinary faculty is developed to an extraordinary degree of efficiency. This can be done by developed creatures and humans. Tamed dogs, tamed monkeys, may do many a thing, because although animals, they are developed animals. But genius you will hardly find in any developed animal. You will find it only in humans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now when a man gets the chance to enjoy physico-psychic pleasures, he does not find any interest in physical pleasures, because physical pleasure is not only crude in quality, but also of very temporary nature. It lasts for a short span. On the psychic level, man is the dominating living being. He does something new, he wants to do something new, to get more psychic pleasures; and he invents so many things, and engages himself in psychic pursuits. These things cannot be done by [undeveloped] animals or even by other developed creatures. And here lies the speciality of human beings. But I will not say that it is the speciality of human beings, because in psychic spheres the pleasure you get is nothing but a sort of positive projection of your mind. It creates nothing concrete, nothing lasting. And whenever this sort of positive projection takes place, there comes another projection, a negative projection, just to bring the mind back to normalcy. That is, the psychic pleasure that you get is counteracted or neutralized by a negative projection &ndash; by the pain you get due to a negative projection. Plus and minus make it zero. So I said there cannot be any development or any progress in physical or psychic spheres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now in the case of psycho-spiritual approach, what happens? Human approach towards spiritual affairs means fighting against the limitations of time, space and person. So it is the best wont of human beings. And here lies the difference between man and animal. Even the developed animals cannot do it. Now in the course of this psycho-spiritual advancement, when the particular aspirant crosses the silver line of demarcation between relativity and absolute, he goes beyond the touch of all mundane bondages. And that is the final destination, and that is the desideratum, of all human beings. And this approach of humans is called <i>Bha&#x301;gavata dharma</i>. It is the proper dharma, it is the actual dharma. All other ideas are based on isms and dogmas. They can function within the scope of three relativities &ndash; temporal, personal and spatial factors. The man who is intelligent should from his very childhood move along this path of psycho-spirituality. The sooner a man starts or moves along this path of psycho-spirituality, the better it is. He is the blessed one.<!-- /block --></p>
