<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Once there was a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law who used to quarrel fifty-eight times every day. One day they were working together in the kitchen. The mother-in-law was rolling rotis<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and the daughter-in-law was cooking them. The mother-in-law yawned sleepily and said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What a nuisance this yawn is. I&#146;ve got a feeling<br>It portends the death of my daughter-in-law&#146;s brother.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The daughter-in-law shook with indignation from head to toe. She also yawned, and said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This yawn is such a nuisance. I&#146;ve got a feeling<br>It portends the death of my father-in-law&#146;s brother-in-law.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The mother-in-law was outraged by this remark, but had to keep her feelings to herself. It was definitely a case of &ldquo;tit for tat.&rdquo; The mother-in-law had overlooked one of the basic principles of life &ndash; always think of the consequences before abusing others &ndash; and had to pay for it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This calls for a change in tactics,&rdquo; thought the mother-inlaw. &ldquo;I&#146;d better be a little more cunning.&rdquo; The next day she announced, &ldquo;We&#146;re going to make seven hundred varieties of cake today.&rdquo; So the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law went off to the kitchen together to make cakes. They made so many cakes: steamed cake, steamed rice cake, fried cake, juicy-cake, condensed-milk cake, banana cake, cake-to-win-over-your-sister-in-law, cake-to-win-over-your-mother-in-law, and cake whose aroma fills the whole neighbourhood. The crows were standing nearby, waiting hopefully; the kites were looking on greedily from afar; the neighborhood&#146;s small children were anxiously waiting; and the old folk of the locality were thinking, &ldquo;If one or two bowls happen to be thrown in this direction, it won&#146;t be such a bad thing.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->There was still enough time to eat before the evening prayer so the mother-in-law served everybody with bowls full of cakes. But not even once did she say, &ldquo;Daughter-in-law, would you like to taste one or two cakes?&rdquo; The daughter-in-law realized that the mother-in-law was getting her revenge. Suddenly the mother-in-law left the kitchen. The daughter-in-law seized her opportunity and greedily stuffed four hot fried cakes into her mouth. Unfortunately the mother-in-law returned as suddenly as she had left, putting the daughter-in-law in a most difficult situation. She couldn&#146;t swallow the cakes, nor could she spit them out, nor could she chew them, nor even could she speak. She was really in quite a fix!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The mother-in-law asked, &ldquo;Daughter-in-law, why aren&#146;t you speaking?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mmmm&#8230; mmmm&#8230; mmmm&#8230; mmmm,&rdquo; said the daughter-in-law.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The mother-in-law asked, &ldquo;Daughter-in-law, why isn&#146;t your mouth moving?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Mmmm&#8230; mmmm&#8230; mmmm&#8230; mmmm,&rdquo; said the daughter-in-law.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The mother-in-law asked, &ldquo;Daughter-in-law, why are your cheeks so swollen?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Mmmm&#8230; mmmm&#8230; mmmm&#8230; mmmmm,&rdquo; said the daughter-in-law.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The perplexed mother-in-law called an assortment of doctors &ndash; homoeopaths, allopaths and ayurvedic physicians &ndash; but none of them could do anything for her daughter-in-law. A famous pathologist carried out an extensive examination, but was unable to diagnose the disease. X-rays were also taken, but didn&#146;t help the physicians make a clear diagnosis either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The mother-in-law stretched out her legs, hit herself on her forehead, and burst into uncontrollable sobs. &ldquo;Oh, what&#146;s happened to my daughter-in-law?&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;She&#146;s caught a disease that even Shiva can&#146;t cure. Oh, poor daughter-in-law! She can&#146;t speak any more. Oh, poor daughter-in-law! Her cheeks look like two footballs. Oh, won&#146;t anybody come and save my daughter-in-law?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->An elderly ayurvedic doctor heard the mother-in-law&#146;s laments and felt sorry for her. &ldquo;I&#146;ll try to cure your daughter-in-law,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You won&#146;t have to pay me anything.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The mother-in-law retorted, &ldquo;What, I won&#146;t have to pay you anything. What a humiliating proposal! If you cure my daughter-in-law, I&#146;ll give you as many juicy cakes as your stomach can hold.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The ayurvedic doctor went up to the daughter-in-law, and softly whispered,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Either spit out the cakes or swallow them down<br>Let the trouble go away and the doctor have his pay.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The daughter-in-law had put up with the discomfort of a mouth stuffed with cake for so long that she wasn&#146;t prepared to spit them out. So she swallowed the four cakes &ndash; gulp&#8230; gulp&#8230; gulp&#8230; gulp. The daughter-in-law&#146;s swollen cheeks deflated, her lips started to move, and she could speak again. Seeing this, the mother-in-law was overcome with joy. &ldquo;This is what I call real talent!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What a good doctor he is! He has brought our daughter-in-law back from the grave.&rdquo; After a short pause she continued, &ldquo;Oh, reputable doctor! Oh, reputable doctor! Come and eat a giant bowl of cakes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cakes!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor gleefully. &ldquo;But why only one giant bowlful? I wouldn&#146;t have any objection to eating four. I read in the scriptures that these cakes cure three diseases and increase the appetite.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->That same day the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law made a vow to never eat cakes again for the rest of their lives. The mother-in-law thought, &ldquo;By now it must be common knowledge that I didn&#146;t give my daughter-in-law a single cake to eat. Dear, dear, dear. What must people think of me? I hereby vow that I will never eat another cake for the rest of my life.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The daughter-in-law thought, &ldquo;By now it must be common knowledge that I ate cakes secretly. Dear, dear, dear. I hereby vow that I will never eat another cake for the rest of my life.&rdquo; From that day onwards the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law never ate cakes again. They both died a timely death and became fisheating ghosts because they were very greedy. They are now the closest of friends. The daughter-in-law rolls lucis<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and the mother-in-law cooks them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You are in the prime of youth,&rdquo; says the mother-in-law. &ldquo;Please eat first.&rdquo; &ldquo;How could I do that, dear mother,&rdquo; the daughter-in-law replies, &ldquo;You have become aged, and therefore you should eat first.&rdquo; Then the mother-in-law says, &ldquo;Daughter-in-law, you are so young, and yet work the whole day and night. It&#146;ll do you good to have a stroll in the park.&rdquo; And the daughter-in-law replies, &ldquo;Dear respected mother, even though you have become quite elderly, you continue to stand beside the kitchen stove the whole day. I think it better that you go and get a breath of fresh air in the park.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->And so the ghost in-laws go to the park together every day for a breath of fresh air. The respected ayurvedic doctor, a good man, went to heaven where he now eats bowlful after bowlful of condensed milk cakes.<!-- /block --></p>
