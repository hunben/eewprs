<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->And similarly, when the human mind is influenced by vidya&#x301; shakti [introversial force], what happens? All of a sudden it feels that &ldquo;I should do something. I have a human structure. I am a human being. I should do something. I should act like a human being. I should try to goad myself to the realm of divinity, it is my dharma. I should follow dharma, I should strictly adhere to the code of dharma.&rdquo; This idea is a gift of vidya&#x301; shakti, and this particular expression of vidya&#x301; shakti is called sam&#x301;vit shakti. Conscience, when it is roused all of a sudden, is called sam&#x301;vit. &ldquo;I should do something, I should do something.&rdquo; As soon as it comes in contact with sam&#x301;vit shakti, in the next moment you feel, &ldquo;I should do something practical. Theory won&#146;t help me; I should do something concrete, I should do something practical.&rdquo; And when this desire to do something practical is created in the mind, this created force is called hla&#x301;dinii shakti or Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti. With the help of this Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti one can move towards that Cosmological Nave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Cosmological Nave is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, because He attracts everything. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;the supreme charmer&rdquo;, &ldquo;the supreme attracter&rdquo;, who attracts everybody towards Him with the help of His &ndash; what? His supreme flute. That supreme flute is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. He creates universal acoustic waves, and those waves bring people towards Him; that is why He is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. And microcosms come in contact with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a with the help of that particular expression of sentient vidya&#x301; shakti which is known as Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti. And when with the help of Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti the microcosm comes in contact with the nave Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Purus&#x301;ottama, then we say it is the union of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. (Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is not a male being of Vrindavan, and Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; is not a lady. You should understand it properly.) Now, this Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti is the cogitative faculty, the subject matter of today&#146;s discourse; it is the cogitative faculty, and it is the divine force, and it is the devotional principle, it is devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
