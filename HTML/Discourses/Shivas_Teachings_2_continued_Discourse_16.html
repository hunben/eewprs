<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Mind has primarily two qualities: thinking and recollection. Thoughts are also of various types: first, thoughts regarding the existing environment; second, thoughts regarding the past environment; third, thoughts without any environment; and fourth, fantastic thoughts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The first category of thoughts relates to the existing environment in which one is living, for instance, the earth, grass, trees and plants, rocks and stones, friends and foes, etc. For instance, when people see a snake at a distance, they forget everything else and start thinking about the snake. When a deer sees a tiger, it thinks only of that tiger; when someone is cooking, that person thinks only of salt, spices, oil, etc. Seated in the examination hall, the students think only about their question papers. These are all thoughts concerning the existing environment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The second category is the thoughts of the past environment. When a prince falls into difficulty and is compelled to eat stale rice and gourd, then naturally he thinks about the delicious dainties of his royal palace. Those who have spent their childhood in luxury and comfort tend to reminisce about their happy childhood days during the hardships of their later years. A student who once stood first in his class, but who later fails in his examinations, sighs and remembers his achievements of the past. These are thoughts concerning past environments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The third is thoughts having no environment. When someone is in a very disagreeable situation, passing his days in great misery and suffering, then he paints brightly coloured dreams and launches imaginary balloons in his mental sky. In the dazzling light of the golden pictures of his mental world, his mind starts glittering.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Raungiin nimes&#x301; dhu&#x301;la&#x301;r dula&#x301;l<br>Para&#x301;n&#x301;e char&#x301;a&#x301;y a&#x301;biir gula&#x301;l<br>Or&#x301;na&#x301; or&#x301;a&#x301;y shra&#x301;van&#x301;er meghe sain&#x32D;carama&#x301;n nrtya<br>Hat&#x301;ha&#x301;t a&#x301;lor jhalka&#x301;ni lege jhalmal kare citta.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->There is still another type of thought which we may call &ldquo;fantastic thoughts&rdquo;. The substance of any thought is not divorced from the real world; that is, whatever people see in imagination or think in contemplation, the materials of these thoughts are all collected from the external world. People cannot think of anything which they have not previously seen or perceived with their sense organs. This is the greatest imperfection of the human mind. One of the main qualitative differences between the unit mind and the Cosmic Mind is this: all the thoughts of the Macrocosm are original, each one is constantly new. The Macrocosm does not need to receive anything from the external world through sense organs. Even the minutest fraction of any Cosmic thought is completely novel: Bha&#x301;va&#x301;tiita abhinava dehi padam [&ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a who is ever-new and beyond the range of mental cognition, give me shelter at your feet&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->No two human faces are exactly the same, no two entities are identical in any respect. Because of this all-embracing originality of the Macrocosm, there are no identical entities anywhere in this universe. They may be similar, but not identical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When people mentally combine some part or whole of an entity, with a part or whole of another entity, and then with a part or whole of still another entity &ndash; and, by blending all of these component parts, create an altogether new entity in their imagination, this is called &ldquo;fantastic thought&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->While painting pictures, people gather materials from thoughts of the existing environment, from thoughts of the past environment, from thoughts having no environment, or from fantastic thoughts. People resort to fantastic thoughts, or thoughts having no environment, out of fear, or sometimes due to disease, or in the hope of attaining happiness &ndash; but mostly to escape easily from the consequences of their misdeeds. Out of fear of tigers people imagined a tiger-god; out of fear of crocodiles, they imagined a crocodile-god; to overcome difficulties in the forest, they imagined a forest-goddess; in hot and humid climates where snakes abound, out of fear of snakes, they imagined a snake-god. These types of imagination, as I have said earlier, mostly arise due to fear or other such propensities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Greedy people, in the hope or obsession of accumulating more wealth, and that, too, without any hardship, imagine a goddess of wealth. Students who do not want to labour hard to acquire knowledge, imagine a goddess of learning in the hope of easily passing difficult examinations. And instead of sustained individual effort, straightforwardness and utmost sincerity, which are essential to achieve salvation, people cherish the hope of attaining it from various imaginary gods and goddesses by ritualistic worship with easily-obtainable paraphernalia and by chanting a few mantras. All human imagination is based on elements collected from the external world. People cannot think an original thought; that is, they cannot think of anything which does not actually exist in the quinquelemental world. Only Parama Purus&#x301;a can do so. Hence when people create imaginary idols out of fear, greed, or any other propensity, none of those is original and none has even ta&#x301;nma&#x301;trik existence, much less material existence. Had Parama Purus&#x301;a conceived of those idols, they would have had physical existence, but in that case also, they would not have had absolute existence, because only Parama Purus&#x301;a has absolute existence; other things are merely imaginations of imaginations.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Hence in the first part of the shloka it has been said, Manasa&#x301; kalpita&#x301; mu&#x301;rttih [&ldquo;An idol produced out of the human imagination&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->I said a little while ago that lazy people, to achieve something easily, weave various types of imaginary nets, and spreading their wings over the hard soil of this earth, soar far, far, very far, into the distant blue sky. They do not think that one day they will have to come down to this dusty earth. People seek liberation and salvation in order to gain something in earthly life. Just as people try to gain something easily in the material world by flattery or deceit, they apply the same process to attain liberation or salvation. They do not know, they do not understand, that spiritual salvation is an entirely different matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->All living beings have minds. Some minds are dormant, some are undeveloped, some are developed, some are highly developed. Human beings possess such highly-developed minds. Yet, however developed or expanded a human mind might be, after all it is still a unit mind; whereas the all-expanded mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Cosmic Mind. All the pains and pleasures of human beings come from the unit mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Mana eva manus&#x301;ya&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; ka&#x301;ran&#x301;am&#x301; bandhamoks&#x301;ayoh;<br>Bandhastu vis&#x301;aya&#x301;saungi mukto nirvis&#x301;ayam&#x301; tatha&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->[Mind is the cause of human bondage and liberation;<br>Bondage means attachment to objects, and liberation means freedom from attachment.]<!-- /block --></p>
<p class="plain"><center>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</center></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->[It is mind which works and mind which sins &ndash;<br>For the mind which is immersed in the thought of God there is no virtue, no vice.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->It is the mind which carries the burden of pains and pleasures. In the mind is the gloomy black curtain of sorrow, and through this dark curtain pierces the silver light and golden glow of momentary happiness. As long as there are other entities outside the unit mind, there will continue to be sorrows and afflictions, desires, passions and pains. As a result of various types of physical or psychic clashes with other entities, the feelings of pain and pleasure rise and fall like bubbles in the mind. If, through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, people can merge their unit minds with the Cosmic Mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a, then the unit minds themselves become the Cosmic Mind: their individual identities are merged in that Cosmic &ldquo;I&rdquo;. In that condition, there remains nothing outside. Thus, there is no longer any possibility of physical or psychic clash with any external entity or object. All objects, all ideas, arise out of one&#146;s mind. This is the state of liberation &ndash; a state of Cosmic bliss far above the domain of mundane pleasures and pains.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The unit consciousness is the witness of the unit mind, but we do not call the unit consciousness the Supreme Cognition, because this unit consciousness is simply a reflection of the Supreme Cognition on the unit mind. When spiritual aspirants totally surrender their all to the Supreme, they merge their unit consciousness into the Cosmic Consciousness with the unflagging speed generated by Tantric blessing.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> That mental state, devoid of sam&#x301;kalpa and vikalpa, is the state of moks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->As we have explained earlier, the human mind creates various idols from thoughts of the present environment, thoughts of the past environment, thoughts having no environment, and fantastic thoughts. Now, all the movements, gestures and postures of these idols are confined within the scope of the unit mind: when the unit mind so desires, they exist; when it does not, they disappear. That is, their existence depends entirely upon the human mind &ndash; they are wholly created by human beings, maintained by human beings, and ultimately will merge into the human mind. So how can they liberate human minds from psychic bondage and establish them in the Macrocosmic stance? Can they free human minds from sam&#x301;kalpa and vikalpa and merge the unit consciousness into Supreme Cognition?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->It has been said, &ldquo;When a person creates a kingdom in his dream&#8230;&rdquo; What is a dream? To dream is to think while sleeping. This thinking may also be of four types: of the present environment, of the past environment, without environment, and fantastic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->During sleep these thoughts, in the absence of contact with the hard realities of the external world, appear to be real. Thus people who are not at all affected in the waking state by propensities of fear, anger, etc., may be deeply affected by them during dreams; because, as I said earlier, in the waking state, people know that they are imagining; but during sleep, they do not realize that the play of their imagination is going on. So during that period their dream-thoughts become hard reality for them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->During the time of waking, because there is much resistance from the external reality, there is not much speed of imagination; but during sleep, in the absence of this resistance, there is great acceleration. Within one second people can imagine a vast epic like the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata. Sometimes during dreams the dreamers, propelled by such propensities as anger or greed, restlessly move their limbs about. If those moving limbs come in contact with any hard object, the imaginary dream is broken, the dreamer&#146;s sleep is disrupted and the dreamy fantasy woven in nets of imagination comes abruptly to an end.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Svapna yadi madhur eman<br>Hok se miche kalpana&#x301;<br>Ja&#x301;giyo na&#x301; a&#x301;ma&#x301;y ja&#x301;giyo na&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->[If a dream is so sweet, let it be<br>A false imagination &ndash;<br>Don&#146;t awaken me, don&#146;t awaken me.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->When people mentally create a dream kingdom with four imaginary palaces and take their seat on an imaginary throne of gold, in that case they become monarchs in their dream, no doubt, but in reality, are they truly monarchs? Upon awakening they find that they were all along sleeping on a tattered mat with a ragged blanket. Just as becoming the monarch of a kingdom created in the imagination is fantastic and totally false, similarly to expect that idols created by the human imagination can grant liberation and salvation is not only a remote hope but a disappointment from beginning to end. Thus Shiva stated in clear language: svapnalabdhena ra&#x301;jyena ra&#x301;ja&#x301;nah ma&#x301;nava&#x301;statha&#x301; [&ldquo;can a person, by creating a kingdom in his dreams, become a king in the real sense&rdquo;]?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->[Those who think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is confined within idols made of clay, stone, metal or wood,<br>Are simply torturing their bodies with penances &ndash; they will surely not attain salvation without self-knowledge.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->In the previous shloka it was said that people seek to fulfil their aspirations and needs easily by creating idols in their imaginations. But in this shloka it is said that people not only imagine those figures in their minds but also give external shape to those imaginary creations with the help of the five fundamental factors. Sometimes they use clay, sometimes metals like gold or silver, sometimes wood. They spend a great deal of money making these idols and ritually worshipping them. Elaborate arrangements are made to confine Parama Purus&#x301;a, who has created each and every entity of this universe, within that clay, stone, metal or wood &ndash; to bathe Him, to place Him in a very soft bed, to dress Him in royal apparel for specific festivals, and to prepare special delicacies to please Him. In some places the various items of offering to the deity are sold at exorbitant prices. Then, at night, the deities are placed on their appointed beds, and the doors of the temples are closed. It is then declared that the god is now sleeping. The god is sleeping! Parama Purus&#x301;a is asleep! Then how is the administration of the universe continuing? These are deceptions of the imagination: to imagine idols, and then to imagine that the god is asleep! By this false imagination people confine God within idols of clay or stone, mental or wood &ndash; and to propitiate these false gods and goddesses, how many hardships people endure, how much wealth they waste on pilgrimages! And what is at the root of all of this? &ndash; the far-fetched conceptualization of idols. By ascribing godhood to those idols, people bear so many hardships.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Nothing in this universe happens in vain. Then is it futile to bear hardships for an idol of clay? No, this also is not futile. Suddenly one fine morning, when people realize that these hardships have not the least absolute value, they become vehement opponents of these dogmas. If they do not get the opportunity to speak out against dogma due to circumstantial pressure, they lament internally and pray to Parama Purus&#x301;a, &ldquo;O Lord, I now realize my mistake. Now lead me along Your path.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Rigorous penance does not lead to the least spiritual realization &ndash; far less to liberation or salvation. Rather the mind becomes gradually narrower and narrower. The only way to attain salvation is through self-knowledge, and for this one requires pure conduct in the external world, pure thought in the mental world, and whole-hearted surrender to the Supreme Entity &ndash; the shelter of all, the one who is hidden in each and every entity &ndash; as the polestar of one&#146;s life.<!-- /block --></p>

When the unit mind, in its unbounded love for God, merges its individual feeling of existence, all its sweet vibrations, all its rhythmic ideations, in the eternal bliss, in the Supreme Entity, and arrives, temporarily or permanently, at a state of mind without any sam&#x301;kalpa or vikalpa, this state of highest wisdom, the state of union with Supreme Cognition, is the state of turiiya. The state of turiiya is the state of eternal bliss, and thus it has no external expression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->The state of wakefulness means the state of mind in which the conscious mind assimilates, transmits and projects vibrations to and from the external world of the five fundamental factors with the help of the sense and motor organs through the afferent and efferent nerves. Or, in this state the conscious mind may think or recollect something directly through the vibration of the nerve cells without the aid of the sense and motor organs or afferent and efferent nerves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->During the state of wakefulness, at every moment, the external stimuli of human life strike the nerve cells through the afferent and efferent nerves. Sometimes this is pleasurable, sometimes painful. In this state people cannot live even a moment without inferential contact, that is, without the experience of the sweetness or harshness of the material world. Thus in the waking state they think and recollect thoughts which are entirely derived from the vibrations in the nerve cells.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->The influence of the thoughts and recollections derived from the vibrations of the nerve cells is not as great as that of the perceptions of the afferent and efferent nerves. When one&#146;s mental concentration is slightly increased, even temporarily, or when the mind becomes slightly introverted, the influence of the pains and pleasures experienced in the physical world temporarily decreases; and at that time the influence of the thoughts and recollections derived from the vibrations in the nerve cells increases. A person in this condition, by means of a certain process and increased mental force, can temporarily suspend the functioning of another person&#146;s afferent and efferent nerves and exert his or her will-power on that other person&#146;s nerve cells, movements, thoughts and recollections. This process is called &ldquo;hypnotism&rdquo;. Dr. Mesmer, a famous psychologist of Europe, invented a therapeutic system to cure diseases with the help of hypnotism. This system is now called &ldquo;mesmerism&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Of the three expressed states of the human mind, only in the wakeful state is there the maximum utilization of the mind. In this state people can materialize many of their internal thoughts and can do much good to the society and the world at large. To one who has received proper training in life, this state of wakefulness is like a crimson dawn; all people should try to remain in this wakeful state for as long as possible without endangering their health. The assimilation of knowledge from the external world and its implementation in the world, occurs wholly in this waking state. Those who sleep too much, whose eyes are always half-closed in drowsiness, can utilize only a small percentage of their physical and psychic existence. Thus it has been said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->The wakeful state in human beings is expressed because of the wish of Parama Purus&#x301;a, because of His grace; people have no right to boast about it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->I said a little while ago that dreaming means thinking or recollecting during sleep. Now the first question that arises is this: Why do people not always think or recollect during sleep? During the wakeful state, people are always thinking or recollecting. Even when people meditate in the wakeful state, they are thinking of, or recollecting, Supreme Consciousness. In the waking state, the mind never remains inactive. Then why does it not always dream during sleep?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The answer is, the sleeping state means a state of rest for the mind. But if, before or at the time of sleep, one is tormented with deep sorrow, or becomes overjoyed with extreme happiness, or is afflicted with a serious disease, or is brooding over imaginary pains and pleasures &ndash; then during sleep if the gases in the body rise and create vibrations in the nerve cells, one starts thinking and recollecting. That is why people do not always dream during every sleep.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->Very often, whenever there is concentration of mind for any reason, during sleep vibrational waves from the all-knowing unconscious mind stimulate the nerve cells, and the dreamer gets the answer to questions which were haunting his or her mind. But these answers can never be received during the state of disjointed thinking. One thing more should be remembered in this regard, that the answers from the unconscious mind, the repository of all knowledge, are received primarily during dream and only secondarily during the wakeful state; but much of the knowledge thus gained during dream is immediately forgotten as soon as the dream is over. On rare occasions, a little of that knowledge lingers in the mind even after arising from sleep.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->Although the knowledge from the unconscious mind flows down to the subconscious only secondarily during the wakeful state, when it does flow down, in most cases it remains well-imprinted in the subconscious mind and thus easily enters the conscious mind from the subconscious.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Many diseased or distressed persons, in order to gain the solutions for their sorrows, prostrate before the idols in the temples. In this situation, they are constantly thinking of their diseases and the remedies of their sufferings and the ways to remove them. This ultimately leads to the temporary concentration of the mind. When, after remaining in this state of concentration for a while, their minds ultimately become benumbed, then from the all-knowing unconscious mind the sought-after solution penetrates into their subconscious. Since such a state is a state neither of wakefulness nor of sleep nor of dream, the answer can easily penetrate the subconscious mind, and from the subconscious enter the conscious. People may think that the remedy to their distress was the boon of such-and-such god or goddess, but this was not actually the case at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->Normally the temporary or permanent concentration of mind occurs as a result of one of five mental processes: ks&#x301;ipta [restlessness],<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha [attachment], viks&#x301;ipta [scattered thinking], eka&#x301;grata&#x301; [concentration], and nirodha [mental suspension].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->Those who are lying before the idols are receiving the solution to their problems from their unconscious minds into their subconscious minds as a result of their temporary eka&#x301;grata&#x301;, mental concentration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->The state of dream is a very peculiar state. Although in ninety-five per cent of the cases, dreams do not come true, in five per cent they do. During dreams a beggar lying on tattered rags becomes a king, while a king becomes a beggar, lying on his dusty bed. In dreams, people cry out in unbearable agony, and in dreams they are transported in the joy of attaining everything they desire.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->Even in the waking state their lives are drenched in the drowsy sweetness of that dreamy atmosphere, and then in their lives, that dream becomes a reality. As a result, the waking state for them becomes meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->Then cannot those dreamy persons do any good to the society? Yes, certainly they can, and in a better way. This state of drowsiness is not dullness or crudeness; rather it is the golden opportunity to fully utilize one&#146;s existence by touching the feet of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma,  as long as there is life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->The human propensities that operate in the mundane sphere are five in number: a&#x301;ha&#x301;r [food], nidra&#x301; [sleep], bhaya [fear], maethuna [begetting progeny] and dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practice]. Of these five, only the first four play a part in the lives of animals. The peculiar nature of these five propensities is this: if they are given indulgence, they increase. And they easily come under control with a slight effort; only in the initial stage, one must struggle a little to control them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->Of these propensities, the first four are primarily physical and secondarily mental, and the fifth one is equally physical, mental and spiritual. The amount of the first four required for physical and mental health is minimal; but the need of the fifth, dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, is unlimited &ndash; the more the better. If the need for any of the first four is channelled into the fifth, then so much the better, there may no longer be any necessity for that propensity at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->Yes, we were discussing sleep. After labouring beyond a certain point in the wakeful state, one&#146;s nerve fibres become exhausted and one feels the need to rest. In the wakeful state, as the nerve cells are constantly performing the functions of thinking and recollecting, they become fatigued. Thus for psychic and physical health, one needs to sleep &ndash; the exhausted nerve cells and fibres will fall into sleep of their own accord. The nerve cells of those who do physical labour become extremely exhausted, and that is why the moment they go to bed they immediately fall asleep.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->Those who do a lot of mental labour combined with a little physical labour, also fall asleep immediately upon going to bed, due to the tiredness of their nerve cells. But those who perform some mental labour, but proportionately less labour of the nerve fibres [that is, physical labour], suffer from insomnia. They use various types of drugs and injections to induce sleep by forcing the nerve cells and nerve fibres to stop functioning. So it can be imagined how dangerous and harmful is the effect of those drugs and injections.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->Getting the amount of sleep necessary to maintain physical and mental health should not be criticized. But as with any of the four vrttis, if sleep is encouraged, people can spend twenty-three out of the twenty-four hours of their day in sleep. This kind of sleep is as bad as death. Human beings have come onto this earth to do some work. Now if they spend most of their time in sleep, when will they work? If a major portion of life is spent only in sleep, is that not another name for death?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->It is due to Parama Purus&#x301;a that all these three states, waking, dreaming, and sleeping, are manifested; due to His existence the minds of human beings enter the states of wakefulness, dream, sleep and turiiya. All these states are gifts of His grace &ndash; the blessings of His blissful play. The slightest expression of His grace gives rise to the feelings of existence of all creatures &ndash; due to His blessing the entire universe from Brahma&#x301;, the Cosmic Creator, to a blade of grass, is billowing and swinging in endless waves. When people attain self-realization in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, then they realize, &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, You are vast, You are unfathomable &ndash; and I am small and insignificant. But I am a small fraction of Your immeasurable limitlessness, and I will completely surrender to You all the feelings of sam&#x301;kalpa and vikalpa of my mind and totally obliterate the distinctions between &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;You&rsquo;.&rdquo; When these distinctions of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;You&rdquo; are dissolved, people become liberated from all bondages.<!-- /block --></p>

But when, remembering Parama Purus&#x301;a, they surrender all the sweetness of their existences to Him, then and only then can they attain permanent liberation from those three bondages.
