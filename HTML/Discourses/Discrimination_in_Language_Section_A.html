<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->During the last million years of human history, proper justice has not been done to humanity; a particular section has been given greater importance than others, and in this process the other sections of humanity have been neglected. For instance, when a soldier sacrifices his life on the battlefield, his death is announced in bold headlines in newspapers; but the same newspapers do not mention anything about the great hardships that his widow faces to raise their small family after the death of her husband. This is how one-sided justice has been meted out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Though the matter concerns grammar and is not easy to change overnight, yet the &ldquo;man&rdquo; in common gender includes both man and woman. Then why does not &ldquo;woman&rdquo; also mean both woman and man This is also lopsided justice. &ldquo;Man&rdquo; is in masculine gender, but &ldquo;man&rdquo; is also common gender.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Human beings have limped forward in their journey of history for the last million years bearing the burden of this defective social system; all were not given equal justice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->That is why I say that neither has justice been done to humanity (the abstract idea of human beings) nor has justice been done to humanism (the abstract idea of the works performed by human beings). Now it is high time to make a reappraisal of the downtrodden humanity, of the downtrodden humanism.<!-- /block --></p>
