<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&#x301; sam&#x301;vadadhvam&#x301; sam&#x301; vo mana&#x301;m&#x301;si ja&#x301;nata&#x301;m,<br>Deva&#x301;bha&#x301;gam&#x301; yatha&#x301;pu&#x301;rve sam&#x301;ja&#x301;na&#x301;na&#x301; upa&#x301;sate.<br>Sama&#x301;nii va a&#x301;ku&#x301;tih sama&#x301;na&#x301; hrdaya&#x301;nivah,<br>Sama&#x301;namastu vo mano yatha&#x301; vah susaha&#x301;sati.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&#x301;&rdquo;. Here the prefix &ldquo;sam&rdquo; means &ldquo;in the proper style&rdquo;, &ldquo;in the proper way&rdquo;, &ldquo;in the proper rhythm&rdquo;. Now, everybody moves, everything as a whole moves, and each and every entity in its individual capacity also moves. And what is movement? Movement means changing place. Movement denotes velocity. The Sam&#x301;skrta root verb &ldquo;gam&rdquo; denotes velocity. It denotes life also. So each and every living creature will have to move. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->But not all movements are &ldquo;sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&#x301;&rdquo;. What is society, what makes it up? What is sama&#x301;j? &ldquo;Sama&#x301;nam ejati iti sama&#x301;jah&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ejati&rdquo; means &ldquo;gacchati&rdquo;. For movement, for walking, there are several verbs in Sam&#x301;skrta &ndash; gacchati<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->, calati, carati, vrajati, ejati &ndash; so many verbs having different meanings and different imports. Now, here we have so many people moving together. Here &ldquo;moving together&rdquo; does not mean march or double march, here &ldquo;moving together&rdquo; means that all portions of society, all portions of the collective body, should have the spirit to move ahead. Suppose you have gathered sufficient money, and there is no dearth of food in your house, but the remaining portion of society, your neighbours, your friends, are suffering from a dearth of money, or food, or clothes. Then it means that you are not following the spirit of &ldquo;sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&rdquo; means to build a strong, well-knit society where there shall be no exploitation, no superiority complex or inferiority complex.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Just to represent the spirit of &ldquo;sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&rdquo;, I propounded the theory of PROUT. So the entire theory of PROUT stands upon this Vaedika sermon of &ldquo;sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Then &ldquo;sam&#x301;vadadhvam&rdquo;. In Sam&#x301;skrta the verb &ldquo;va&rdquo; means &ldquo;to speak&rdquo;. Everybody speaks, so what is the import of &ldquo;sam&#x301;vadadhvam&rdquo;? &ldquo;Sam&#x301;vadadhvam&rdquo; means that you are to be guided by that supreme Spirit that makes you speak in the same line, that is your language must not have any ambiguity. It should be free from all ambiguities. It should be clear, conclusive and decisive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sam&#x301;vo  mana&#x301;m&#x301;si ja&#x301;nata&#x301;m&rdquo;. &ldquo;Vah&rdquo; means &ldquo;your&rdquo; in the plural, &ldquo;Vah&rdquo; is old Sam&#x301;skrta, that is, Vaedika. In Laokika Sam&#x301;skrta, that is, later Sam&#x301;skrta, the term for &ldquo;your&rdquo; is &ldquo;yusma&#x301;kam&rdquo; but in old Vaedika Sam&#x301;skrta it is &ldquo;vah&rdquo;. The root verb is &ldquo;vah&rdquo;. &ldquo;As&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;ah&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;as&rdquo; and &ldquo;ah&rdquo; are the same thing, so it is &ldquo;vah&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sam&#x301;vomana&#x301;m&#x301;si  ja&#x301;nata&#x301;m&#x301;&rdquo; means &ldquo;vo mana&#x301;m&#x301;si sama ja&#x301;nata&#x301;m&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->You should know that the source of all creation, and also the source of all microcosm, is the Supreme Progenitor. You should know that from the Supreme Progenitor cometh all the microcosms. You should never forget this fundamental truth. The difference among the units is the difference in their microcosmic reactive momenta, but you should remember always that the source of all these microcosms is the Singular Entity, the Singular Macrocosm. Then the relationship among human beings will become closer and closer. &ldquo;Sam&#x301;vo mana&#x301;m&#x301;si ja&#x301;nata&#x301;m&rdquo;. You should know this fact, you must not forget this fact.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Deva&#x301;bha&#x301;gam&#x301; yatha&#x301;pu&#x301;rve sam&#x301;ja&#x301;na&#x301;na&#x301; upa&#x301;sate&rdquo;. Now, the word &ldquo;deva&rdquo; comes from the root word &ldquo;div&rdquo;. &ldquo;Div&rdquo; means &ldquo;a divine existence&rdquo;. So &ldquo;deva&rdquo; means &ldquo;a divine existence&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Those divine vibrations, those divine manifestations, the vibrating attributions of the Divine Father, are deva. &ldquo;Deva&#x301;bha&#x301;gam&#x301; yatha&#x301;pu&#x301;rve&rdquo; &ndash; that is &ldquo;the divine vibrations of the past&rdquo;. Why has the word past been used? Because from the very dawn of human civilization there have been these divine vibrations, and these divine vibrations know no differentiations. And in the actional sphere also, there have been no differentiations. Equality and parity have always been maintained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Just see the case of air, light, water, respirations and everything. The need for these things is the same for all individuals. There have been no differentiations. These differentiations that we see in society are creations of vested interests, creations of depraved persons, of degenerated, immoral people. So you should not support these actional defects of immoral persons. You should follow the divine vibrational system, that is, you must not try to find any differentiations among individuals. &ldquo;Deva&#x301;bha&#x301;gam&#x301; yatha&#x301;pu&#x301;rve sam&#x301;ja&#x301;na&#x301;na&#x301; upa&#x301;sate.&rdquo; It is the wont of divine expressions that there be no differentiations, no class of exploiters and exploited. That is, this wont of not creating any differentiations was not only their duty, it was their upa&#x301;sana&#x301;, the desideratum of their existential march.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sama&#x301;ni va a&#x301;kuti&rdquo;. When everything cometh from the same source, from the same Progenitor, and when finally everything goeth back to the same desideratum, there must be the same aspirations, the same longing, in the heart of each and every individual. But due to the depraving actions of immoral people, those exploited, those downtrodden people are forced to forget their goal. They are drifted away from the desideratum of their life. This should not be done. Everybody should get the chance to develop their natural longings for Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sama&#x301;na&#x301;hrdaya&#x301;nivah&rdquo;. When everything comes from the same Progenitor and moves along the same path towards the supreme culminating point, then should there be any cordial difference between man and man? No, there must not be. Everybody should be given the scope, or circumstances should be created, such that nobody gets the scope to feel that their future is sealed forever, is blocked. So let everybody feel that everybody in this expressed universe belongs to the same big human family. &ldquo;Ek caoka&#x301;, ek culha&#x301;, ek hyay ma&#x301;nav  sama&#x301;j&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sama&#x301;namastu vo mano.&rdquo;  All microcosms come from the same Macrocosm, and finally, all microcosms will become one with the same Singular Macrocosm. So, while they are in society, while they are in the phenomenal world, they should remember this Supreme truth: that actually they are one, one Entity expressing itself through so many different corporeal structures. And when this is done &ndash; and it is not at all a difficult job to do it - then what will it be? It will be a society in the proper spirit of the term. And this is the loftiest, it is the highest mission of all human beings. Those who do not recognize this fact, or those who want to forget this fact, are actually enemies of human society. Those who support casteism, racialism, provincialism, parochialism, nationalism, even internationalism, are enemies of the big human society. Human society is, rather should be, based on only one ism, and that ism is universalism.<!-- /block --></p>
