<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Let us take the case of Pa&#x301;rvatii. What is the meaning of the word Pa&#x301;rvatii? Some may derive it as Pa&#x301;rvatasya duhita&#x301;, pa&#x301;rvatasya kanya&#x301; (using s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurus&#x301;a<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->) &ndash; that is, &ldquo;daughter of a hill&rdquo;. Obviously the question will arise, and quite logically, how can a human girl whose body is made of five fundamental factors be the daughter of a hill? A river may be called the daughter of a hill, but in the case of a human girl we cannot say that. So the derivation of Pa&#x301;rvatii as pa&#x301;rvatasya kanya&#x301; is not logically acceptable; rather the proper derivation is pa&#x301;rvatadeshiiya&#x301; kanya&#x301; ityarthe Pa&#x301;rvatii (using madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;ray<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> ): &ldquo;a girl born in the hill state.&rdquo; So when people say that Pa&#x301;rvatii was the daughter of the Himalayas, it does not mean that she was the daughter of a person named Himalaya, but that she was a person born in the Himalayan Range. This Pa&#x301;rvatii was fair-complexioned; that is, she was an Aryan girl.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the then India, the mutual relations between the original inhabitants of India (Austrico-Mongolo-Negroids) and the outsiders, the Aryans, were by no means cordial. The Aryans, out of deep-rooted contempt for the indigenous people of India, used to call them sometimes asuras [monsters], sometimes  da&#x301;navas [demons], sometimes da&#x301;sas [slaves], sometimes shu&#x301;dras. The Aryans did not accept those people in their society; rather, they declared them to be outcastes. But these ancient people of India, of Austrico-Mongolo-Negroid blood, had their own civilization and culture. They were also developed people: they had their science of Tantra, and their medicine. There was a prolonged conflict between these people and the Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii was the daughter of an Aryan King, Daksha, who ruled in the Himalayan regions. Many people were hopeful that after the marriage between Pa&#x301;rvatii and Shiva, the relations between the Aryans and the non-Aryans would improve. During the period of penance that Gaorii (another name for Pa&#x301;rvatii) undertook in order to attain Shiva as her husband, she used to dress in the fashion of a Shavara girls (the Shavaras were one of the non-Aryan communities.) She used to stitch turmeric leaves together to make improvised outer garments. One of the Sanskrit synonyms for &ldquo;turmeric leaves&rdquo; is par&#x301;n&#x301;a. As she would wear par&#x301;n&#x301;a as her clothes, she was called par&#x301;n&#x301;ashavarii. Later, after she became successful in her penance, people requested her, &ldquo;Now please set aside the turmeric leaves and wear fine clothes.&rdquo; When she actually discarded the crude turmeric leaves, she was nicknamed Apar&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301; [&ldquo;without leaves&rdquo;]. Unfortunately, even after the marriage between Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii, the relations between Aryans and non-Aryans did not improve; rather they became more strained &ndash; the conflicts became more acute than before. Gaorii&#146;s father, Daksha, and the Aryans continued their slanderous campaign against Shiva, and finally, to humiliate Shiva, they held a yajin&#x32D;a [sacrificial ceremony] to which Shiva was not invited. Pa&#x301;rvatii went to attend the yajin&#x32D;a, and, unable to bear the insults to her dear husband, immolated herself in the sacrificial fire.<!-- /block --></p>

Stop, Father, stop!&rdquo; After that self-immolation the relations between the Aryans and the non-Aryans improved.<!-- /block --></p>
