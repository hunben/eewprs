<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->It has been said, &ldquo;Purus&#x301;ah akarta&#x301;&rdquo;. What is Purus&#x301;a? There are several interpretations, but the most common interpretation is &ldquo;Pure shete yah sah Purus&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; He who remains as the central point of all activities is Purus&#x301;a. Another interpretation is, &ldquo;Purasi asti yah sa Purus&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; He who remains in the forefront of everything is Purus&#x301;a. That is, &ldquo;Purus&#x301;a&rdquo; means the &ldquo;Cognitive Faculty&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Supreme Cognition&rdquo;. That Purus&#x301;a is akarta&#x301; (non-doer).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You know that both karma and kriya&#x301; are relative. Change of place of anything is called karma, and also kriya&#x301;. There must be change of place. Now, the agency or the guiding faculty that effects that change of place is karta&#x301; (kri + trn). Purus&#x301;a is akarta&#x301;, that is, He Himself does not do anything; He gets everything done by others. So here you should remember that akarta&#x301; does not mean that His role is passive. He is active but He gets everything done by others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->For example, take the owner of a big confectionery shop. The owner does not prepare the rasagolla&#x301; or jila&#x301;pii himself. Agents are there, workers are there; they prepare it, but they do it at the direction of the owner. Purus&#x301;a is akarta&#x301; of that type. He Himself does not do anything, but He gets everything done by Prakrti. That is why He is akarta&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Though He is akarta&#x301;, He is also kriya&#x301;sa&#x301;ks&#x301;iibhu&#x301;tam&#x301;. Whenever any kriya&#x301; is done, He is the witnessing entity (kriya&#x301; means &ldquo;finalization of an action&rdquo;. It is called &ldquo;work&rdquo;. Work is kriya&#x301;. Action is called karma in Sam&#x301;skrta). Whenever any kriya&#x301; is done He is the witnessing entity. He sees the entire process: how the karma functions and how the actional manifestations become finalized in kriya&#x301;. He sees everything and He also sees the finalization, that is, samyak karma&#x301;nta is witnessed by Him. &ldquo;Kriya&#x301;sa&#x301;ksiibhu&#x301;tam&rdquo; &ndash; without His sa&#x301;ks&#x301;ii, without being witnessed by Him, no action can take the final form of kriya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Shuddhasattvavishes&#x301;a&#x301;d va&#x301; premasu&#x301;rya&#x301;m&#x301;shu sa&#x301;myabha&#x301;k<br>Rucibhishcittama&#x301;srn&#x301;ya krdasao bha&#x301;va ucyate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Bha&#x301;va is the subtlest parallelism between human existence and the spiritual flow. When that subtle parallelism is established in a person, one may say that he or she is in the stance of bha&#x301;va. In colloquial Hindi we call such a person a &ldquo;bha&#x301;vuka&rdquo;. This bhava possesses a dynamic force; it is not something static, but has a strong dynamic force working behind it. And He is the central point, He is the nucleus of this bha&#x301;va. (Bha&#x301;va cannot be represented by the English term &ldquo;abstract&rdquo;; a term which contains many ambiguities. In the word &ldquo;bha&#x301;va&rdquo; there is no ambiguity. It is unambiguous.) And He is the Nucleus, He is the central point, He is the controlling point of bha&#x301;va. Hence He is bha&#x301;vkendrasthitah (located in the centre of bhava).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Gun&#x301;ayantrakashca&rdquo;. Gun&#x301;as, the operative principles, the tethering cords, function and do their duty as per the desire of the Cosmic Purus&#x301;a. They are not free to work according to their own whims, and that is why Parama Purus&#x301;a is known as &ldquo;Gun&#x301;a&#x301;dhiisha&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Lord of all the gun&#x301;as&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lord of all the operating principles&rdquo;. The jiivas, which have been created by the gun&#x301;as in accordance with the direction or with the permission of the Cosmic Purus&#x301;a, are gun&#x301;a&#x301;dhiina &ndash; under the gun&#x301;as or bondages. Jiivas are gun&#x301;a&#x301;dhiina and the Cosmic Purus&#x301;a is Gun&#x301;a&#x301;dhiisha. If the jiivas want to go beyond the bondages of the gun&#x301;as they will have to take His shelter. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
