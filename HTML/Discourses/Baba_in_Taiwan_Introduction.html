<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->SHRII SHRII A&#x301;NANDAMU&#x301;RTIJII is the spiritual guide for millions of spiritual aspirants all over the world. He is called BABA, which means &ldquo;beloved&rdquo;. From His early childhood, men and women of all ages have been drawn to Him by the power of His love. Living an ordinary life, as a child, as a schoolboy, as a railway officer in a small town in India, at the same time, He was teaching many sincere seekers how to realize the Truth within themselves. Soon, the number of His disciples was multiplying so rapidly that He began to train others to teach the practices of self-realization; and thus the organization ANANDA MARGA, the Path of Bliss was founded and spread rapidly all over the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Those who follow His teachings find their lives transformed; the confining walls of their egos dissolve, and an all-embracing cosmic feeling begins to fill their hearts. They begin to look on all people as brothers and sisters, as manifestations of the Supreme. They want to serve these manifestations. They cannot bear to see others in pain and they want to share with all the bliss which they themselves enjoy. From Hong Kong to Buenos Aires, to New York, many people are working tirelessly in the service of humanity, motivated by His indescribable love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The 1979 World Tour of Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rtijii marks the first time in 9 years that He has left India. Previously He has visited Philippines twice. Taiwan is the first place on this historic tour that Baba gave Darshan. After leaving Taiwan, Baba went on to tour Europe, Middle East, North and South America.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->All of Baba&#146;s darshan talks given in Taiwan have been collected in this book, including the DMC address, &ldquo;Man and His Ideological Desideratum&rdquo;. While Baba was in Taiwan, He made a tour through the whole island, and was received as a VIP guest of the Taiwan government.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->A glossary of Sanskrit terms has been provided at the back of the book. Baba makes frequent use of Sanskrit terms, all of which appear in boldface in the text. In Roman Sanskrit, a is pronounced as in up, a&#x301; as in father, e as in say; am&#x301; as ung; c as ch; s&#x301; as sh, jin&#x32D;a as gya and ks&#x301; as kh.<!-- /block --></p>
