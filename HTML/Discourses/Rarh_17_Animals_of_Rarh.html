<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is approximately thirty crore years old. It can be assumed that the first vibration of life in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h came at the same time as the first vibration of life on earth. The atmosphere of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h reverberated with the sounds made by animals at the same time that the atmosphere of the earth first reverberated with such cries. When western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was first created, there was no animated world there, but when the sand and silt carried by the rivers of the undulating western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h formed the plain lands of eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, different kinds of flora and fauna appeared there. It is assumed that eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was formed before the appearance of human beings on earth. The fossils that we have found in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h lead us to assume that Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h pulsed with the vibration of the animated world at the very dawn of [animate] creation. The fossils bear witness that hard-bodied tiny animals moved on the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h after unicellular tiny animals, and ekadharmii multicellular tiny animals [multicellular tiny animals sharing one characteristic], had come into being. Thereafter came the age of large animals on the earth, and the fossils of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are proof of that age also. All of this concerns western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. It does not seem that an age of large animals ever occurred in eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. At least no proof is available for that. It is also assumed that if there were lofty mountain ranges in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of that time, between the mountains there were very deep gorges, some of which had a link with the seas. We should remember that the whole of northern India and Samatat-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k were deep in the seas, and that for this reason we have found fossils of sea animals in the mountainous areas of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the past a short-lived ice age engulfed the world. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was not excepted. It is assumed that the large animals and other living beings of the prehistoric age were frozen to death for want of heat. We have found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h the fossils of animals that had been frozen to death in this way. But after the ice age, in the post-ice age, when Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h basked in warmth again, various kinds of animals appeared in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; because Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h got its heat back within a very short time. We can find fossils of lions and lion-type animals, mammoths, monkeys, monkey-type men and ancient human beings of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of this time. They did not become crippled and die out due to cold, because no ice age followed their emergence in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. They probably died from earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Today&#146;s Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h does not fall [geologically] in the volcanic belt. But in those times the volcanic belt probably went along the western end of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, because between those days and today a polar shift has occurred. Instead of having decomposed naturally, these suddenly-expired animals and men were transformed into hard fossils. We have found samples of all these kinds of fossils.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I have said before and will say again now that Samatat, Vaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; and Barendrabhu&#x301;mi, which had come up from the sea, were not the habitats of lions, but of large tigers. And Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was the habitat of large and medium-sized maned lions. It cannot be said, however, that there were not a small number of tigers in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. (In western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, in common parlance, lions are called tigers.) Tigers like damp climates and dense jungles, while lions like dry weather and less-dense forests. So it is assumed that tigers came via the north-east corner from the direction of China; but lions came to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h from no direction; lions are children of the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. As ancient Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h abounded with lions, the word sim&#x301;ha [lion &ndash; &ldquo;Sinha&rdquo;] is associated with the names of many a person and many a village. Scattered all around in the east of Ranchi District, and all around the Bagmundi, Dalma, Meghasini, Tilabani, Jaychandi and Panchakot hills in the west of Purulia District, and around [the Shushunia Hills], there are heaps of different fossils, known, or unknown, or unrecognized &ndash; the fossils of all those lion, mammoth, rhino, monkey and human species.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The small-sized indigenous cows that are found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, besides being small, do not give so much milk; but the milk is very nice-tasting and nice-smelling. These cows are the descendants of the ancient cow-type forest animals of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Once upon a time the forests in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h teemed with wolves. The traditional story goes that when the Aryans first tried to enter Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, from their side, set their pet lions and wolves on them. It forced the Aryans to declare Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h as Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avavarjita [forsaken by the Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avas] or ana&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta [not part of A&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta, the land of the Aryans]. As long as King Shashanka was alive, the Aryans were unable to exert a pervasive influence on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Of the many reasons for this, one was Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s fearful forests. After the death of Shashanka, there was no one with governmental power to save Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. So the land-hungry Aryans entered Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h through different waterways and did everything to rob Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of its freedom, and later on destroyed the priceless asset of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, its forest cover. In the wake of the destruction of the forests came the destruction of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s wildlife and natural beauty. Today Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is no better than a neglected desert. This all happened about 1750 years ago. Since then Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, bereft of its own rhythm of life, has remained as a colony of A&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h has never been recognized as a part of A&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta, but it had to live a life of disgrace under the rule of A&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta.<!-- /block --></p>
