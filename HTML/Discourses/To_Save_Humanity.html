<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Wise people say that in the past there have been so many crises in human society. Crisis is quite natural for something moving. Wherever there is movement, there is struggle &ndash; struggle against the inertia of the earth. In the past, there have been crises in the course of movement, crises in different branches of civilization, crises in the realm of education, and so on. But nowadays, the entire human society is facing the crisis of civilization as a whole, and particularly a crisis in the field of existence. Human society is now to decide whether to live or to die. If this mud-slinging and intolerance are encouraged, humanity has no future &ndash; the future is dark, the future is sealed forever. But you know, I am not a pessimist. I am always an optimist. And I want all my sons and daughters to be optimists. And I want them to struggle against this death signal of humanity, and come out successful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->And I am sure that you boys and you girls must be optimists; and it is your duty to save humanity. And I hope you will be able to save humanity, because, just like me, you are also optimistic. You should know that great, or good, people are few in number, they are not many. They do not come within the scope of millions or billions. They are always few in number. And these few, they are the torchbearers of human society, they are the pioneers, they are the vanguards of human society. So it is your duty to save humanity. And those who are unable to shoulder their own bags and baggages &ndash; their responsibilities are to be shouldered by you. You should remember that the life of a spiritual aspirant is a mission. One&#146;s entire life is a mission, one&#146;s entire existence is a mission. And your mission is &ndash; what? To save humanity from this crisis. I hope you will be successful. And I not only hope, I am sure that you will be successful.<!-- /block --></p>
