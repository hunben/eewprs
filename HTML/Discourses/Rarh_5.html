<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Shashanka, a king of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, was an orthodox Shaivite. In fact, everyone in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were adherents of Shaivism at that time. King Shashanka could not tolerate the Buddhists at all. He obliterated a number of Buddha idols in Magadh [on the west of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h]. In food matters, the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, being influenced by Shaivism, were sentient. They adopted the Shaivite ideology in all spheres of their life. So we see for example that in the vratakatha&#x301; [verses recited during the domestic worship of a deity] of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h only the glory of Shiva is preached again and again. The Carak, Ga&#x301;jan and Bola&#x301;n festivals of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are all completely Shiva-centric. Even Rabindranath, a poet of the modern age, has referred to the worship of omnipresent Shiva in his poems:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Even innumerable rural folk-rhymes prevalent in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are paeans to Shiva. A liberal Shaeva [Shaivite] ideology permeated every existential vibration, every cell of the bone and marrow of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. For this reason the women of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h always enjoyed more liberty than those of other countries. They had absolute freedom to move anywhere &ndash; in the markets and fairs, in the villages and towns. They still enjoy the same amount of liberty today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the past, men and women shared equally in the hard work of the fields and farms. They continue to do so today. Even on the battlefield women stood beside their men and actively fought in wars. There were no artificial social restrictions. Even Bagri [Samatat] and Barendrabhumi<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  did not allow women as much freedom as Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, what to speak of Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k. Moreover, there were numerous restrictions based on caste.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Shankaracharya came to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h only [not the rest of Bengal]. Hence many Buddhists and Jains of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h embraced Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma. D&#x301;aba&#x301;k being marshy land, neither Shankaracharya nor any of his disciples with leadership qualities visited there much. So the inhabitants of that land remained Buddhists and later embraced Islam on a large scale. It can be said that Muslims are scarce in modern-day Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, except for some in eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Hindus and Muslims are almost equally numerous in Bagri. But in D&#x301;aba&#x301;k Muslims are in great number. The reason is this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The history of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is not the history of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h alone, it is the history of Bagri, D&#x301;aba&#x301;k, Barendra and Orissa also. Wherever the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h have settled down, they have mingled and become one with the local people. So it can be observed that there exists a close link between the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and the people of Orissa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->It has been said before that severe caste discrimination arose in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h due to the influence of the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma propounded by Shankaracharya &ndash; an evil which created fatal rents in the otherwise well-knit social fabric of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. A man who showed outstanding wisdom while rescuing Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h from the sway of that horribly destructive system was Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (Vishwambhar Mishra). He formed a new group, the Vaishnavite group, with those people who were not socially recognized by the high-caste Hindus. The people of this Vaishnavite group are still spread in many places throughout Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Mahaprabhu&#146;s historic contribution still permeates every atom of the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. So no one can lose caste so easily today.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
