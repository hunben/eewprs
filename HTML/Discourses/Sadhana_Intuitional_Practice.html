<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->(v) Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na: This is to have firm faith in Iishvara (the Cosmic Controller) in pleasure and pain, prosperity and adversity, and to think of oneself as the instrument, and not the wielder of the instrument, in all the affairs of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->(d) No creature should be allowed to starve to death. Even a ja&#x301;ta shatru (born enemy) should not be starved to death, nor left mutilated.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->(4) An animal life is given to carnal pleasure human life is for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;; but, for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the body is necessary &ndash; so in order to maintain the body, you will have to be vigilant about everything in the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->(5) Everything requires a base; if life does not have a strong base, it is disrupted by an ordinary storm. Brahma is the strongest base.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->(6) Dharma (spirituality) is an internal thing. One who is hollow within conceals it in ringing brass bells, beating drums and making noises all around.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->(7) One will not be able to know anything unless one develops the psychology of &ldquo;I know not.&rdquo; It is the fundamental spirit of a true aspirant.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->(9) When the flow of the mind is not impeded by selfishness, narrowness, and superstitions that alone is mukti (liberation).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->(10)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Whatever you speak or do,<br>Forget Him never;<br>Keeping His name in your heart,<br>Work, remembering it is for Him,<br>And, endlessly active, drift in bliss.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->(11) Through all works, big and small, humanity has to be awakened. Humanity in its fullest sense is divinity, and its perfection is Brahmatva (Brahma-hood). The aspirant must not forget this even for a moment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->(12) When one notices a defect in oneself, and does not find the means for sha&#x301;sti (corrective punishment), one should purify the mind by fasting.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->(13) Before censuring anyone for some fault, make sure that you do not have the same defect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->(14) When one is established in Yama and Niyama, as&#x301;t&#x301;a pa&#x301;sha (the eight fetters) fall from the mind. One who is not fettered can never have superstitions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->(15) Actions and not logic establish one&#146;s superiority.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->(16) Do not try to assume superiority by belittling others, because the other person&#146;s inferiority will become lodged in your mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->(17) Overcome censure by praise, darkness by light.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->(18) Not to call a thing what it is, but to call it something else, is known as slander. Therefore those who in the name of the beginningless, endless, formless Brahma worship idols, are indulging in deliberate slander. You must not give indulgence to this type of Mahapa&#x301;pa (great sin).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->(19) By pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; and dhya&#x301;na (lessons of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;: vital-energy control, withdrawal, concentration and meditation), the enemies of mind are controlled. You will have to bring the fetters and the enemies under your control &ndash; you should not be controlled by them. But in the very nature of living things, human beings will always have these fetters and enemies of the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->(20) The major part of the slander in the world is based on falsehood. Some indulge in it unknowingly, some because their petty interests are hurt, and others, under the compulsion of him&#x301;sa vrtti (the mental propensity of harmfulness). With a cool mind you should explain this to the slanderer, but before doing so, make sure there is not even a farthing&#146;s worth of truth in his statement. If there is even a little fault in you, you should keep your mouth closed and accept it all, and you should thank the person for pointing out your fault and ask for punishment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->(21) You should always bear in mind that you should not try to convince by argument anyone who criticizes your Is&#x301;t&#x301;a (Goal), A&#x301;darsha (ideology), Supreme Command or Conduct Rules. If this occurs you should adopt a hard and uncompromising attitude.<!-- /block --></p>
