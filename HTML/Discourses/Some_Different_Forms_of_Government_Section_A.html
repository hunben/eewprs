Bureaucracy means ruling as per the whims of government officials. Oligarchy means ruling by a small party. A kingdom is a state having a king as the ruler.

<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Feudalism is a system where power and properties are in the hands of landlords, earls and barons. Feudalism may exist both in a republic and a kingdom. A feudal chief or local chieftain is a king under a big king.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Democracy is where a government is elected by [[the]] people through restricted or general franchise. A democratic country having a democratic head is a republic. A democratic country having a non-democratic head is not a republic. It is either a kingdom (monarchy), or an oligarchy, or a restricted republic. India is both a democracy and a republic; the USA is also a democracy and a republic; but Great Britain is a democracy and a kingdom. Australia is a democracy but not a republic, as it recognizes the British Crown at the helm of affairs. [[A comment on the former Soviet Union omitted here.]] A republic is where the head of state is elected by [[the]] people directly or indirectly.<!-- /block --></p>
