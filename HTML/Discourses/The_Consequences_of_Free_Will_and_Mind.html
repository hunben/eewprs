<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The fundamental difference between man and an animal is that whatever an animal does, it does according to the rules of Parama Purus&#x301;a, according to its inborn instincts. Whatever a man does, he does according to his will and mental force. An animal lacks a developed mind, and a man has a developed mind. So if a man does not utilize his developed mind, he will be worse than an animal. Because of the individual body, there are psychic differences, caused by various reactive momenta. A man may do something good; he may do something bad also, or he may eventually have recourse to negative pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is pa&#x301;pa? That which should not be done, if done, is called &ldquo;pa&#x301;pa&rdquo;. That which should be done, if not done, is called &ldquo;pratyava&#x301;ya.&rdquo; The collective name of pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya is &ldquo;pa&#x301;taka.&rdquo; The sins committed by a pa&#x301;takii are not of very serious nature. The redemption of a pa&#x301;takii is possible if one, forgetting whatever has been done, takes to the path of spirituality. The second form of a pa&#x301;takii is atipa&#x301;takii. This is one who has done permanent physical or mental damage to a particular person. Then the third type is maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii. The sins committed by a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii are of recurring nature. The best course for an atipa&#x301;takii is to sacrifice his individual pleasure and involve himself in the welfare of humanity. But of course the maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii has to sacrifice his life for the welfare of mankind. In addition to that, he will have to do something which will be of permanent benefit for human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
