<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is, &ldquo;The Noumenal Cause and the Personal God&rdquo;. When One creates many that One is called the noumenal cause. And when &ldquo;many&rdquo; is created from One, that &ldquo;many&rdquo; is called the phenomenal effect. We may say, &ldquo;Falsehood is the noumenal cause of all social crimes&rdquo;. Here social crimes are the phenomenal effects, and falsehood is the noumenal cause. Whatever we see in this universe, there is an apparent noumenal cause. We see so many milk products: milk is the noumenal cause, milk is the apparent noumenal cause. That is, it is not the supreme noumenal entity. And above all so called apparent noumenal causes, there is the supreme noumenal entity, and that supreme noumenal entity is the Parama Purus&#x301;a. That Parama Purus&#x301;a is not something theoretical or abstract; that Parama Purus&#x301;a is your bigger &ldquo;I&rdquo;, is your greater &ldquo;I&rdquo;, your Supreme Father, your nearest and dearest entity. Here, the subject is that noumenal cause. Is that noumenal cause simply a philosophical figure or a figure of science? Or is it nothing but a profound hypothesis? Here the subject is: &ldquo;The Noumenal Cause and the Personal God&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As I told you yesterday, human approaches are of four kinds. There are four clear aspects of human expressions, of human manifestations. And these manifestations are not only extro-internal, but intro-external also. That is, the process may be from crude towards subtle, or from subtle towards crude also. When a person moves toward that noumenal cause, the movement is extro-internal. And when that noumenal cause comes in closer contact with His progeny, with His sons and daughters, the movement is intro-external.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->One may say, for Him there is nothing external, everything is internal. For the jiivas, for the created beings, there are both intro-external and extro-internal movements. Yes, for Him there is nothing external, but here the word &ldquo;external&rdquo; has been used in the sense that the movement is external from the nucleus &ndash; not beyond the periphery of His mind, but beyond the periphery of His centre of action. Similarly the intro-external movement of human beings is from their cognitive point, towards their ectoplasmic manifestation. And these manifestations take place within the periphery of that ectoplasmic body; nothing is without, everything within. But that extro-internal movement starts from the hub of the ectoplasmic structure and moves towards the Cosmic noumenal entity, towards the Cosmic hub. I said last night that the movement is psycho-spiritual. And during this psycho-spiritual movement, human beings are moving towards the Supreme Nucleus. If they know, or if they are under the impression that this Supreme Entity is a philosophical figure, or a figure of science, a figure just like a stool or other inanimate object, then their physical structure may move toward Him, towards the noumenal entity &ndash; their minds may also move, but their sentiment will not be stirred.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And just to accelerate the speed, rather for the very existence of speed, a sentimental support, a sentimental propulsion is an indispensable necessity. Now, this sentimental support must be based on rationality. Sentimentality based on rationality is the strongest force in the universe. And sentimentality without rationality takes the form of, or rather the distortion of, dogma. Now what does rationality say? Each and every particle of this universe, from a big mammoth to a small blade of grass is of His creation and of the Macropsychic conation. Hence the relationship is that of Father and children, Father and His loving children &ndash; the Supreme progenitor and His progeny. There cannot be more than one noumenal cause. The Supreme noumenal entity is a singular one. So the conception of so many gods, so many goddesses, so many ghosts are all based on defective ideas. The Supreme Father, noumenal entity, is a singular entity. And that noumenal entity is the loving Father. One&#146;s relationship with the loving Father is one of love and affection, is a domestic relationship. There is nothing formal, no sort of formality in it. It is purely domestic, a family relationship. So the noumenal cause is not just a theoretical entity; it is your Father, your nearest and dearest one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And one should not be afraid of God, one should not be God-fearing &ndash; one must be God-loving. One must not be afraid of hell and one must not have any charm or fascination for the so-called heaven. One must know that one has come from that Supreme progenitor and the culminating point of all sorts of movements is that Supreme Father. Everything cometh from Him, and everything goeth back to Him. The relationship is one of love and affection, and not of any fear complex. One must not say, &ldquo;Oh God, I am a sinner.&rdquo; You need not say like this &ndash; it is superfluous to say like this. Because whatever you did is known to Him. Then what is the necessity of saying, &ldquo;Oh God, I am a sinner?&rdquo; He knows everything; you need not remind Him that you are a sinner.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->And you know, if you always think, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner&rdquo;, then actually you will become a sinner, if you are not already a sinner &ndash; because what a person thinks, he or she will become like that. If you always think, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner&rdquo;, then actually you will become a sinner. So what are you to think? What are you to ideate upon? That is: &ldquo;Oh Father, I am your loving child. I was a bit misguided, now please help me. I want to sit on your lap, I want to remain with you, I want to be an ideal boy, an ideal girl of yours, just help me. I am very weak and you are the strongest personality&rdquo;, you should say like this. Why should you say, &ldquo;I am a culprit, I am a sinner, I am a bad person?&rdquo; And in the social sphere, in the civic sphere, in any other sphere of society, you may be a bad person, but for your Father you are not at all bad. He will always try to save you and rectify you. He has got immense grace for you. So you should not destroy or distort your career by saying, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am bad.&rdquo; Then naturally your Father will be angry. He will say, &ldquo;Oh naughty chap, I know you are a sinner. What&#146;s the necessity of saying that?&rdquo; So you should remember that the noumenal cause although it is the Supreme entity in the entire universe, has a very close relationship with you. That supreme noumenal entity is your loving Father; He is not the judge of a court. He is your loving Father, the relationship is purely domestic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now, when one is ensconced in the supreme stance, in the Supreme idea, one will be successful in each and every arena of human life. Whatever you will do like rendering social service &ndash; will be fruitful, and you will get immense pleasure in it. But if there is no love for the Supreme entity, then what will happen? Your work will be fruitless, and you will suffer from different kinds of psychic disease, including frustration. If you do your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for ten or twenty-four hours in a day, but there is no love for the Supreme entity, you are simply misusing the time, abusing the time. So the first and foremost thing is that you should always remember that you are not an ordinary person, you have not come from an ordinary family, you have come from the noblest and the highest family of the universe because your Father is the most respectable person in the entire universe. So you must not suffer from any sort of defeatist complex, any sort of fear complex or any sort of hopelessness or helplessness, because your Father is always with you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->You know, the Supreme noumenal entity maintains the closest relationship with all other apparent noumenal entities, the so-called noumenal entities, and those so-called noumenal entities maintain a link with each and every expression of this universe. This indirect link of the noumenal entity is called Prota Yoga in sam&#x301;skrta. That is, whatever you are doing is indirectly known to Him through your direct noumenal entity. And not only that, He keeps a direct relationship with you also. &ldquo;Today we will decorate the hall in a very nice way, as is done in the case of DMC. And when Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; will see those things, He will say, &lsquo;Let there be DMC.&rsquo;&rdquo; See, these things have a direct reflection, not on your apparent noumenal entity, but directly on the Supreme hub, directly on the Supreme noumenal entity. And He will say, &ldquo;Let me satisfy those little boys and girls by declaring a subject of discourse.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The link, you see, is an indirect link with each and every entity, through so many noumenal entities, and also a direct link with each and every individual, from a mammoth to a blade of grass. So a mammoth cannot move without His grace, and a blade of grass also cannot move without His approval. And this shows that He maintains a link with each and every entity. Nobody is unimportant, nobody is insignificant. Each and every existence is valuable. And the life of an old widow of, say, 100 years, is also not meaningless. Her existence also bears certain significance. If an ordinary ant dies a premature death, the equilibrium of the entire universe will be lost. Nobody is unimportant, so you must not develop the psychology of helplessness or hopelessness or defeatist complex or fear complex, because the Supreme Father, the Supreme noumenal entity is always with you. And that link with the individual is known as Ota-yoga. In the case of the collectivity it is Prota-Yoga; in the case of the individual it is Ota-Yoga. You are never alone. And your goal is that noumenal entity, that Parama Purus&#x301;a and no number two or number three or number four, no gods or goddesses; only the singular entity, the God of all gods.<!-- /block --></p>
