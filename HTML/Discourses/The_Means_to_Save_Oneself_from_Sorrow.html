<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->From the beginning every created being is situated in bliss. The very moment a newborn infant opens his eyes upon the world, he feels a type of bliss. The earth&#146;s light and air infuses a wondrous feeling of bliss in his mind. Not only a human child, every newborn being feels this certain type of bliss from the start.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> has created this world in order to impart bliss to Himself, and He has not thrown those whom He has created (this world of living beings is born out of His vast body) into trouble, because they are also born out of this bliss. But human beings themselves create certain diseases in their minds, and, seized by these diseases, they undergo suffering. Actually, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a </I>is playing with his created world, and at the end of the play, when the living beings become tired, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> takes them into his lap, that is, the living beings reach their goal. <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> takes them into his lap, He withdraws them &ndash; this is liberation. He plays for the sake of bliss, and the meaning of giving a place on his lap is the liberation of the living being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There is no intricate philosophy behind this. It is the simple and straightforward answer to a simple and straightforward question. If a human being can always remember this then he or she will never be overcome by sorrow. This is the secret <I>ga&#x301;yattrii</I> [famous Vedic hymn or prayer] that delivers one from sorrow.<!-- /block --></p>
