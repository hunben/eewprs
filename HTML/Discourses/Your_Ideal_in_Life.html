<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[As Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> took His seat in the room in the Jamalpur Ashram, He said:] In the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata period we find two persons coming quite close to Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; Arjuna and Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;. Both were greatly devoted to him. Now tell me, which of the two is the greater devotee of Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, and whom would you choose as the ideal of your life?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->[One by one, persons present there expressed their views. Some said that Arjuna was more devoted to Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a than was Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;, for he did all that the Lord asked him to do. Arjuna was the ideal of their life for he was a great karma yogii (yogi of selfless action) and the much-troubled world of today needed a karma yogii. A similar number were for Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;. Even being such a poor man and knowing that his childhood playmate Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a could shower riches on him, he never ever asked for even a little material help. Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; was a greater devotee than was Arjuna. Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; was the ideal of their life. When all had expressed themselves, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; said:] Devotion means unconditional self-surrender. The measure of devotion is the amount of this self-surrender. One who has more of it, is a greater devotee than one who has less of it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; paused and then said:] Arjuna and Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; were great devotees. But while comparing their devotion by this yardstick, we have got to say that Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; was a greater devotee than was Arjuna. You know the story in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata &ndash; Arjuna refused to fight when Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a asked him to do so. This shows that Arjuna did not have full faith in and complete surrender to Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Had there been complete surrender, Arjuna would have done as directed by Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. On the other hand, we notice a complete surrender by Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;. He never desired anything from Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, his sakha&#x301; [friend], who could have given him anything and everything. Howsoever he was, he remained content. Even when his wife forced him to go to Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to request Him to remove his poverty, he went to him but didn&#146;t ask for a thing. Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; was a greater devotee than was Arjuna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; again paused and then continued (in reference to the second of the original questions):] Now whom should you take to be your ideal? Neither of the two &ndash; neither Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; nor Arjuna. You do know that neither of the two is perfect &ndash; so how to take anything imperfect as the ideal of life? Your ideal has to be perfect &ndash; so your ideal is to be the Lord and the Lord alone. No one else should be your ideal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And you should not pray to the Lord, &ldquo;Make me this, make me that; make me Arjuna or make me Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;.&rdquo; No, such should never be your prayer, for suppose the Lord wants you to become even greater than what you are praying to become? In such a case, you are creating a hindrance to your own welfare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What you must do is simply surrender to the Lord and leave everything else to Him and Him alone. Your ideal should be the Lord, and your effort should be towards a complete self-surrender. You should ask the Lord to make you what He wants. You should ask the Lord to take that work from You which He desires.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And if he finds that you have the potentialities to do His work, but you are lacking in self-surrender and you have not forgone your ego, then in such a case He will first create circumstances in which your ego will be forced to yield and surrender. After this only will the Lord choose you to be the medium for His work. You do know, similar was the case with Arjuna. Arjuna had the potentiality, but he also had some ego left in him. Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a first made him surrender by showing His vira&#x301;t&#x301;a ru&#x301;pa [Cosmic form], and then alone was Arjuna chosen to be the medium.<!-- /block --></p>
