<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix at&#x301;ac (at&#x301;an) to krp we get the word karpat&#x301;a. The meaning of the Vedic root verb krp is &ldquo;to possess the ability to do some action&rdquo; or &ldquo;to be capable of doing something&rdquo;. The word krpa&#x301; has come from this root verb krp. Many people think that the root verbs krp and day (from which we get the word daya&#x301; [compassion]) have the same meaning. Many mix up karun&#x301;a&#x301; with daya&#x301;/krpa&#x301;. No, these three are not the same. Although the word karun&#x301;a&#x301; has been used since ancient times, we find it used most frequently in Buddhist literature and philosophy. The actual meaning and significance of the word karun&#x301;a&#x301; is &ldquo;being overcome with affection for others after seeing their ignorance or reluctance in the spiritual sphere, and giving them help, either mentally or physically, or showing them compassion&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sona&#x301;e bhariti karun&#x301;a&#x301; na&#x301;vii<br>Ru&#x301;pa&#x301; thoi na&#x301;hika t&#x301;ha&#x301;vii<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The couplet is ambiguous. Its literal meaning is that a boat named karun&#x301;a&#x301; has been filled with gold so there is no room there to keep any silver. The inner meaning is that the formless Supreme Entity (in Buddhist thought, naera&#x301;tmadevii) has filled the boat of my existence, so there is no room for the different inferences, such as form, etc. One is floating onward, from the world of forms to the world of the formless, and the binding sam&#x301;skaras [reactive momenta] from the cycle of birth and death will not be able to bind them.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So you see, the word karun&#x301;a&#x301; is an odd kind of self-contained word. The word daya&#x301;, which comes from the root verb day, means &ldquo;to melt when seeing someone&#146;s pain and to remove that pain &ndash; to be conscious of it&rdquo;, in English, &ldquo;kindness&rdquo;, &ldquo;grace&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word krpa&#x301;, which comes from the root verb krp, means &ldquo;to be capable of doing something for someone&rdquo;. Weak people want krpa&#x301; from strong people because the strong have that capacity; untalented people want psychic krpa&#x301; from talented people because talented people have that capacity. Both the words krpa and karpa come from the root verb krp &ndash; both words mean &ldquo;hardy, capable.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

It is kapar&#x301;a in the languages descended from Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta, kapar&#x301;a in the languages descended from the Western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii branch of Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, and ka&#x301;pr&#x301;a in the languages descended from Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii. The etymological meaning of the word karpat&#x301;a is &ldquo;that which gives shelter or which covers&rdquo;; its colloquial meanings are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->1) Cloth or garment.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->3) The third meaning of the word karpat&#x301;a is &ldquo;a worn-out, torn piece of cloth&rdquo;, what we call nya&#x301;kr&#x301;a&#x301; or ka&#x301;ni or t&#x301;ya&#x301;na&#x301; [rag] in spoken Bengali. In Bihar we say num&#x301;ga&#x301;, and in north India, cithr&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[4) The fourth meaning of the word karpat&#x301;a is nya&#x301;ta&#x301; [mop-rag]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->5) Another meaning of the word karpat&#x301;a is &ldquo;a rag which is used for wiping something without water&rdquo;, what is called a &ldquo;duster&rdquo; in English. The word karpat&#x301;a can be used for the dry rag that is used to wipe a blackboard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, you should not confuse the two words nya&#x301;ta&#x301; and neta&#x301;. In the word nya&#x301;ta&#x301; the attachment of the y is a must. I have seen some people write the word neta&#x301; without the y to mean nya&#x301;ta&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The root verb krp is of Vedic origin. The word karpat&#x301;a is also Vedic. After coming to Europe, especially in English, the word karpat&#x301;a has taken the form of the word &ldquo;carpet&rdquo;. The carpet which is decorated with various kinds of handiwork is called ga&#x301;lica&#x301; (in spoken Bengali ga&#x301;lce). The word ga&#x301;lica&#x301; is of Persian origin.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix in to the word karpat&#x301;a we get the word karpat&#x301;in. Its etymological meaning is &ldquo;one whose profession is associated with karpat&#x301;a&rdquo;. Colloquially karpat&#x301;in refers to:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->1) Mendicant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->2) A person clad in tattered clothes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->3) A Brahman who solicits donations, such as an Agrada&#x301;ni, a Brahman counsellor who takes donations for funeral services, those who take eclipse-donations for solar or lunar eclipses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->4) Those Can&#x301;d&#x301;als, or persons of inferior professions who take the clothes or bedding of the deceased as donations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Karpara<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix arac/aran&#x301; to krp we get the word karpara. The etymological meaning of the word karpara is &ldquo;hardy&rdquo;; its colloquial meanings are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->1) Human skull [narakapa&#x301;lra] or cranium. The nerve centre of the body&#8230; the brain is situated inside the skull. The brain needs a strong container, thus the skull or cranium must be hardy, that is, strong. Bear in mind, that in this case that kapa&#x301;lra [skull] means &ldquo;skull of the deceased&rdquo; in Sanskrit, not &ldquo;forehead&rdquo;. Of course kapa&#x301;lra-likhana means &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; in both Bengali and Sanskrit. In Bhojpuri the word kapa&#x301;lra (pronounced kapa&#x301;r) means &ldquo;head&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->2) The second meaning of the word karpara  is &ldquo;that bony framework situated in the skull which serves as the receptacle of the brain&rdquo; &ndash; what is called &ldquo;cranium&rdquo; in English.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->3) Ca&#x301;t&#x301;u [iron pan] (what some people also call ta&#x301;va&#x301;). The word is adopted from Sanskrit &ndash; you are all familiar with the ca&#x301;t&#x301;u on which chapatis are cooked. There is a certain kind of ca&#x301;t&#x301;u which has a long handle in front which is the colour of iron. One grabs this handle with a rolled cloth or towel in the hand in order to put it on the stove. This handle is called a karpara. The two rings that one grabs on either side of the kar&#x301;a&#x301; or kar&#x301;a&#x301;i [a wok-like iron pan] (kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha &rarr; kad&#x301;a&#x301;ha &rarr; kar&#x301;a&#x301;a &rarr; kar&#x301;a&#x301;i &rarr; kar&#x301;a&#x301;) used in cooking in order to place it on the stove, are also called karpara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->4) You are surely familiar with the yajin&#x32D;a-d&#x301;umura [a large variety of fig]. Another name for it in Sanskrit is ud&#x301;umbara, and yet another name is karpara. Previously, the Aryans used to consider the wood of the yajin&#x32D;a-d&#x301;umur to be quite hardy, thus during sacrifices (yajin&#x32D;a) they would use it as sacrificial wood. Since it was used as sacrificial wood, its name became yajin&#x32D;a-d&#x301;umur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->5) Another meaning of the word karpara is what we commonly call bhoja&#x301;li, a slightly curved weapon that is used both as a dagger and as a sword.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Karbu&#x301;ra<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Karbu + urac/uran&#x301; = karbu&#x301;ra. The etymological meaning of this word, karbu&#x301;ra, is &ldquo;mixed-colour&rdquo;, &ldquo;varied nature&rdquo;, &ldquo;selfish&rdquo;, and so on. Colloquially it means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->1) Any bright, yellow-coloured object, such as golden tinsel, golden garments, or any bright yellow thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->2) The second meaning of the word karbu&#x301;ra is &ldquo;pure gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;unalloyed gold&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->3) The third meaning of the word karbu&#x301;ra is &ldquo;the all-season cucumber&rdquo; (Shashaka variety).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->4) The fourth meaning of the word karbu&#x301;ra is &ldquo;the spotted cucumber&rdquo; (ks&#x301;iirika&#x301; variety). The cucumber is generally divided into two groups: the first, which is somewhat small in size, predominantly green in colour, and which grows chiefly in the rainy season; and the second, which is grown with a scaffold &ndash; this rainy season cucumber is called shashakphalam. This shashaka phala is a favourite food of the shashaka (in English, &ldquo;hare&rdquo;). For this reason its name became shashaka phala. However, one shouldn&#146;t think by this that rabbits don&#146;t also love to eat cucumbers. Cucumbers which are not grown in the rainy season, but which are grown on scaffolds rather than being allowed to creep along the ground are also called shashaka phala. If this shashaka variety of cucumber is left to creep along the ground then it easily falls prey to insect attacks and its fruit is destroyed. The field cucumber is called ks&#x301;iirika&#x301;. The ks&#x301;iirika&#x301; variety of cucumber is also eaten raw as fruit by people as well as being used as a cooking vegetable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->5) Something whose surface is spotted &ndash; spotted clothes, spotted leaves on a tree, and so forth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->6) If it is spelled karbu&#x301;rii in feminine form then it means Chinnamasta&#x301; [a truncated form of the goddess Durga&#x301;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->7) One meaning of the word karbu&#x301;ra is daetya [demon].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->8) Another meaning of the word karbu&#x301;ra is the red&#x301;i plant [castor oil plant] (eran&#x301;d&#x301;ah &rarr; eran&#x301;d&#x301;a &rarr; eran&#x301;d&#x301;i &rarr; er&#x301;i &rarr; rer&#x301;i). According to the Pra&#x301;krta rule where ra takes the place of a and a takes the place of ra, er&#x301;i becomes rer&#x301;i. This word rer&#x301;i is used in Bengali and also in the languages of Bihar &ndash; in Hindi, however, it is a&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;i. There are two main varieties of rer&#x301;i. &ndash; cultivated rer&#x301;i and wild rer&#x301;i. The leaves of the cultivated rer&#x301;i are deep green and its seeds (castor seed) yield a very quality oil. Its chaff also makes a good fertilizer for mustard fields. Wild rer&#x301;i is usually known as bheren&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; in Bengal. The word bheren&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; has come from the word bhaeran&#x301;d&#x301;a. The leaves of this plant are somewhat reddish and its fruit is poor in quality. The non-mulberry silk that we get from the cocoons of the silk-worms that grow in the leaves of the rer&#x301;i plant is called en&#x301;d&#x301;i silk. At one time Assam was famous for this en&#x301;d&#x301;i silk; it still is. If some efforts are made, rer&#x301;i can be cultivated nicely in those parts of Bengal, north Bihar and Uttar Pradesh where there is alluvial soil, and en&#x301;d&#x301;i silk can be produced.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->9) Another meaning of the word karbu&#x301;ra is &ldquo;gnat&rdquo;. In this case its feminine form will be karbu&#x301;ra&#x301;, not karbu&#x301;rii. Karbu&#x301;rii means &ldquo;Chinnamasta&#x301;&rdquo;. Both karbu&#x301;ra and karbu&#x301;rii, however, are spelled with vargiya ba.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix man/manin to kr we get the word karman&#x301;a which refers to five kinds of actions:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Each of the above-mentioned actions is classified as pratyayamu&#x301;laka actions. Their reaction or redress is direct. There is no reaction or redress for sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra-based actions. &ldquo;Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra-based actions&rdquo; refers to those actions which occur as a reaction to previous actions, or pra&#x301;rabdha.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->By adding arin&#x301; to karma we get karmari. It means &ldquo;that which, when in the hand, facilitates work&rdquo; or &ldquo;that with whose help hand-work is done&rdquo;; colloquially karmari means &ldquo;bamboo branch&rdquo;, or kainchi. A bamboo branchlet, that is, an offshoot of a kainchi or karmari is called karmarika&#x301; (ba&#x301;kha&#x301;ri).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Kalr + ac = kalra.

The etymological meaning of the word kalevara is &ldquo;that which arises out of semen&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;living body&rdquo;. Thus it is said about the human body: Shukra&#x301;dyah bhasma&#x301;ntakah, that is, it begins in semen and ends in ashes &ndash; in the end the body is cremated and turned into ash.<!-- /block --></p>

A wife may not be<br>physically strong but in a vocal battle she can free her husband<br>from danger by defeating the enemy, thus a wife is called<br>kalratra. When the word kalratra is used to mean &ldquo;wife&rdquo; it is<br>used in masculine gender (kalratrah, like the conjugation of the<br>word nara), or, rather than feminine gender (kalratra&#x301; like the<br>conjugation of the word lata&#x301;), it is neuter, that is, the word<br>is kalatram (like the conjugation of the word phalra).

The Behula of legend took the dead body of the imaginary Lakhindar on her lap, climbed on a raft and floated down this Ga&#x301;ungur&#x301;a towards heaven. This Behula River has turned into the Deviidaha of today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="149"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=149 type=paragraph -->I walked slowly and came to the edge of the Deviidaha. The Deviidaha that we are talking about was partially destroyed in the Damodar flood of 1913. It was swallowed anew by the Damodar during the time of the Second World War. The time that I am talking about was shortly before the Second World War.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="150"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=150 type=paragraph -->The Deviidaha was created during the time when Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka was the king of Rarh. The Deviidaha was not simply a large pond. Like the Damodar, Banka, Khar&#x301;i, Vadai and other rivers, the vast waters of the Deviidaha as well as the Ga&#x301;ungur&#x301;a used to keep Burdwan District green with grain. Sugar cane was first cultivated in Rarh on both banks of the Deviidaha while cotton was cultivated on its west bank. Historically, it can be seen that this Burdwan District was the pioneer in sugar cane and cotton cultivation, the leading producer. The sugar cane there was sweeter than any place else. Unfortunately the farmers in Burdwan today are not so eager to cultivate sugar cane because sugar cane ties up the land for nearly the entire year, while if other crops would be grown on that same land then three harvests could be taken home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="151"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=151 type=paragraph -->For this very same reason, the cultivation of both the ma&#x301;ghii and caetii types of pigeon-peas is fast diminishing in Burdwan. They are scarcely to be seen nowadays. Even though the Bala&#x301;gar&#x301; area of neighbouring Hooghly District was at one time considered the best for pigeon-pea cultivation, it bears mentioning that there also this cultivation has diminished greatly. Nowadays Purulia and Nadia Districts are preserving the standard of pigeon-pea production in Bengal. If some of the land in Purulia was not used for pigeon-peas then it would remain barren for most of the year, thus there is no recourse but to grow pigeon-peas there. And in Nadia the greater part of the soil is donya&#x301;sh [mixed sandy and clayey soil]. Since there is very little clayey soil many crops cannot be grown there. Still, in the Chakdaha, Haringhata and Kalyani areas of Nadia the cultivation of both sugar cane and pigeon-peas (kandula: kandulam&#x301; baladam&#x301; jineyam&#x301; cos&#x301;n&#x301;am&#x301; tu hitaka&#x301;rakam&#x301;) is diminishing and kitchen vegetables are being grown in their place. Today Nadia District has turned into the world&#146;s best district for growing vegetables. Of course, the traditional areas for growing potatoes have been Hooghly, Burdwan, Nalanda and Farukhbad Districts. The seeds that we import while sitting in Calcutta, such as the recently brought biliti tomato seeds from America, the difficult-to-get red radish seeds from Japan, the extremely long kuli eggplant seeds from China &ndash; some perhaps come from abroad but the better part of them are brought from Nadia District&#146;s Nagar-ukhr&#x301;a&#x301;, bought at bulk rate and stuffed into jute sacks.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="152"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=152 type=paragraph -->The variety of cotton plant which was known as deva-ka&#x301;pa&#x301;s in Burdwan has the longest fibres and is suitable for making the finest thread. The climate of Burdwan is somewhat drier than that of the rest of Bengal, thus those areas which are wetter than Burdwan used to buy cotton thread from Burdwan for weaving fine cloth. Cotton doesn&#146;t grow well in wetter climates; the cotton is subject to insect attack. However these wetter climates are more suitable for weaving fine cloth. Thus Burdwan was not as famous for the weaving of cloth as it was for the production of cotton. This is not Burdwan&#146;s fault; its weather is to blame. This situation continued unchecked up until the time of Akbar.<!-- /block --></p>

In some people&#146;s opinion the wolf can take into its stomach quite a bit more than the weight of its own body. Just as the ant can carry a load that is much heavier than its own body, the wolf can eat more. The wolf has very little capacity for carrying loads. Due to his excessive gluttony, the second Pandava brother, Bhima, used to be called Vrkodara (one whose stomach is like a wolf&#146;s).

The last capital of Mughal Bengal, Monghyr, was one such fort-city. Beyond the moat there were the ramparts. Within the ramparts was the city. At that time most of the cities had a moat or a ditch around them, whether or not they had any fortress walls. That used to be the boundary limits of the city, or, in certain cases, the revenue village. The other side of this moat or boundary limit was the jurisdiction of a different police officer. Thus, in many cases, social miscreants used to flee to the other side of the moat or ditch in order to escape from the hands of the police. Even today, in those places where there is no surrounding moat or ditch, we say &ldquo;he has crossed over the ditch&rdquo; when someone passes a little out of reach.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="210"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=210 type=paragraph -->Often social miscreants or people with infectious diseases used to be kept outside these city walls. The keys to the gate used to remain with the constable or with some senior person of the city. This wall-encircled city used to be called karvat&#x301;a. The people of north India used to say ha&#x301;velii &ndash; in certain places ha&#x301;oli in the spoken language. There was a city in Monghyr District by the name of Ha&#x301;velii-Khar&#x301;gpur. In Europe, the one with whom the key to such a ha&#x301;velii gate was kept was called the &ldquo;city father&rdquo; or &ldquo;sheriff&rdquo;. Our Calcutta is not a walled city but here also there is a sheriff in order to maintain the aristocratic tradition. Most likely he also has a key for show.

This metropolis may or may not be the capital of the country. During British rule in India, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras used to be considered metropolises or metropolitan towns, and in English the expression &ldquo;presidency town&rdquo; used to be used for &ldquo;metropolitan town&rdquo;. In the same way, the concerning provinces went by the name of Bengal Presidency, Bombay Presidency, and Madras Presidency. Some people use the word &ldquo;metropolis&rdquo; in an offhand way for the capital of a country, even though it isn&#146;t the metropolitan city of that country.<!-- /block --></p>

In this case also, the word karvat&#x301;a can be used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="213"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=213 type=paragraph -->6) The principal official headquarters of a district or county is called karvat&#x301;a. For example, the karvat&#x301;a of Birbhum District was Shiurii (Shivapurii), then Maldaha District&#146;s Engrejbazar, Rajshahi District&#146;s Rampur (Boyalia), Murshidabad&#146;s Baharampur, 24 Paraganas&#146; Alipur (its old name was Alinagar), Bakharganj District&#146;s Barishal, West Dinajpur District&#146;s Balurghat, the then British Tripura&#146;s Comilla, and Hooghly District&#146;s Chunchro.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="214"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=214 type=paragraph -->The modern Bengali synonym for the Sanskrit word bhukti is zila&#x301; (zilla). The word is of Farsi origin. Its proper English equivalent is &ldquo;county&rdquo;. In England a zila&#x301; is called a &ldquo;county&rdquo;; in India, a zila&#x301; is called a &ldquo;district&rdquo; in English. Most likely it was called &ldquo;county&rdquo; since in ancient England each county used to remain under the control of a particular count.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="218"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=218 type=paragraph -->2) The second meaning of the word karvara is &ldquo;proud animal&rdquo; or &ldquo;large tiger&rdquo;. Another name for what we call &ldquo;royal Bengal tiger&rdquo; in English kundo ba&#x301;gh in Bengali is karvara. It is the largest member of the cat family. Among its various traits are its keen intelligence and its powerful sense of smell.  It is able to ascertain which animals lie in which direction by checking the wind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="219"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=219 type=paragraph -->Although they are much stronger than people, they are much less intelligent and they know this. So if they catch a human scent on the wind they don&#146;t like to tread that path. However, if they happen on a person unexpectedly they will attack them out of a sense of self-preservation. There are a small number of karvara tigers who, despite belonging to the same family, develop a taste for human flesh by eating dead bodies in burial grounds or in the forest. Some can no longer struggle with other animals in their old age, and kill and eat human beings because humans can not run from them or match them in physical strength. It is very easy for them to kill humans, so those karvara tigers who become maneaters in this way, and remain so for a long time, undergo some physical changes. Their snout becomes comparatively long and their stomach becomes thinner. If people are aware which Bengal tigers are maneaters and which are not, they can take more precautionary measures.<!-- /block --></p>
