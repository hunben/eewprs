<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In this world, in this entire universe, the wind is blowing in our favour. It is the most opportune time to do some thing for the present and future humanity. At this critical juncture one moment of time has the value of 100 years. Utilize the present position &ndash; utilize the situation. Do your duty with more zeal. Let your speed be accelerated. It deserves more acceleration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Intellect and physicality &ndash; these two entities are inseparable. One cannot remain without the existence of the other. Crude matter, like water, has no intellect. It is guided by the Cosmic Entity. Unit living beings &ndash; animated beings &ndash; have got a unit psychic counterpart. In the case of under developed matter, it has no independent unit psychic counterpart, but it is guided by the Cosmic Cognitive Faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->You cannot live without Parama Purus&#x301;a and Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot live without you. Bhagava&#x301;n cannot live without bhakta and bhakta cannot live without Bhagava&#x301;n. Bhakta has given attribution to Bhagava&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Communism is dying &ndash; dying very fast. Unless and until the space left by communism is filled up, a vacuum will remain. If it is left unfilled, another demonic theory will occupy that space. This is not desirable. You should not sit idle. Be speedy, be more speedy. Communism died because it was irrational, inhuman and unpsychological.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->You must strengthen the base of spirituality. Charvaka came to strengthen the base of spirituality in the post-Vedic age. Communism came to strengthen the base of spirituality which was lost in the last 300 years. There was no God-centred philosophy. Most philosophies were dogma-centred or self-centred. Some philoso phies were based on geo-sentiment, socio-sentiment or sanguinary sentiment. These sentiments have to go in a very short time. Other sentiments and philosophies will also have to quit. Be speedy &ndash; speed is the order of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Was there social equality in the Vedic period? No, because there were many clans and tribes. Was there social equality in the post-Vedic period? No, because the caste system was in vogue. In the age of the Mahabharata, just before Buddhism, the caste system existed but it had no rigidity. Nevertheless, Vidura could not ascend the throne because his mother was a Vaeshya. Dhritarastra was the legal king but since he was blind Pandu became the de facto king. Karna also was not permitted to ascend the throne because he was born before marriage, but what wrong did he do?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->During the Buddhist age, there was equality in spiritual rites but inequality in the social order. After the Ks&#x301;atriyas and the Vaeshyas were initiated by Buddha, they still retained their caste identities. There was even fighting between the Ks&#x301;atriyas and the Vaeshyas after the death of Buddha for the ashes of Buddha&#146;s body. The king of Magadh said that since he was a Ks&#x301;atriya he must have the ashes because the ashes must be inherited by the Ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the post-Buddhist age &ndash; in the Puranic age &ndash; the caste system was very strong, and it is still going on today. We are the first to fight this system. The merits and demerits of human beings are the same, so where is the justification for the caste system? Those who imposed the caste system were wicked, crooked demons.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->When the speed of matter is greater than either the speed of the psychic or spiritual faculties, then there is the rule of demons, as in the case of communism. When the speed of the psychic faculty is greater than the speed of the spiritual faculty, intellect has no legs to stand on. For example, in the Puranic era, although the was some intellectual development, there was much dogma, so when the Muslims attacked India, the Hindus could not effectively resist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The world moves fast, the universe moves very fast, and the psychic counterpart is also moving fast. Recently the speed of this movement has been greatly accelerated. You should realize this, and you must accelerate the speed of the duty allotted to you. You should maintain a proper balance with the revised speed. Everywhere sanity and rationality will rule human psychology. Humanity will rule the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
