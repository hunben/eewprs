<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Mind, unit mind, is a creation of matter, and matter is a creation of Cosmic Mind. When the Cosmic Entity within Its mind creates this pillow within It as an external material entity, we think it is actually a pillow, but for the [Macrocosm] it is His mental creation. You can create something in your mind; in your mind you can create an elephant; for you that elephant is a mental entity. But if in your mind you create a mahout for that elephant, then for your mental mahout, your mental elephant is not something mental. It is something concrete, something physical. So the elephants we see in this world are for Him mental entities, but for us, external physical entities. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->So this is His process of conation. Now, from this quinquelemental world come the microcosms, and after their creation, these microcosms are to live within the Macrocosm, within the mind of the Supreme Self. They cannot function, they cannot remain, without the mind of the Macrocosm, so they will have to remain within it, and they will have to move within it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It has been said in the Vedas,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe brhante;<br>Tasmin ham&#x301;so bra&#x301;hmyate Brahmacakre.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[All unit entities, all unit structures, revolve around the Nucleus Consciousness in the Cosmic Cycle of creation.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This microcosm, or these microcosms, are moving within the scope of the Macrocosm and around the nucleus of this Macrocosm. The mind of this Macrocosm is so vast, but there is a controlling point within His mind, and that point is the hub of His mind, is the nave of His mind, is the nucleus of His mind. This Cosmological nucleus, the nucleus of this Cosmological order, is called Purus&#x301;ottama in Sanskrit, and these created microcosms are moving around this Purus&#x301;ottama with their own peculiar radii. Each and every microcosm has its own radius. And that is why no two microcosms are the same. The microcosm of Mr. X and the microcosm of Mr. Y are not the same, because both of them are moving around this Cosmological Hub, but they have got their own radius. And because of the difference in their radii, they are different.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now you know, wherever there is any existence, there is a particular system in it. Everybody, every entity, will have to obey a particular system, and this system is its property, is its dharma, is its wont. And we can feel or understand a particular entity according to its dharma, or property, according to its peculiar radius. Why does water have its drenching property? Because of its peculiar radius. Why does fire have its burning property? Because of its peculiar radius.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now, there is system everywhere, in each and every entity. And if by artificial process, if by scientific process, we can change the radius, we can change the curvature, then a particular element will be converted into another element. By such artificial process we can change gold into mercury, we can transform platinum into radium; everything is possible by changing the radius and by changing the wavelength. And wherever there is any such system, that is, an entity moving around a nucleus, you know two forces are functioning there &ndash; one is centripetal and the other is centrifugal. Even in the smallest atomic system, around that nucleus electrons are moving. And when the electrons are moving, certainly these two forces are functioning there, the centripetal force and the centrifugal force: the centre-seeking force &ndash; the concentric force &ndash; and the eccentric force. And you know in our ethereal system also, this earth is the nucleus, and the moon is moving around this earth. There also these two forces are functioning. In a bigger system, in our solar system, the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving around the sun. There also these two forces are functioning; and each and every planet has its own radius.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, the biggest system is our Cosmological system, the Cosmological order. The campus of this Cosmological order is the expressed universe, or Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, and the nucleus of this Cosmological order is Purus&#x301;ottama. So each and every microcosm is moving around this Purus&#x301;ottama with its own radius.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now here also, in the case of the Cosmological Hub and microcosms moving around this Cosmological Hub, these two forces are functioning, kendra&#x301;tiga&#x301; and kendra&#x301;nuga&#x301;, eccentric and concentric. In the case of this Cosmological order, the centripetal force is called vidya&#x301; shakti, and the other force is called avidya&#x301; shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->What is vidya&#x301; and what is avidya&#x301;? There is a fight between sentient and static; and when as a result of this fight between sentient and static, the resultant goes in favour of the sentient, we say it is the resultant sentient principle, we say it is vidya&#x301; shakti. And when as a result of this fight the resultant goes in favour of the static principle, we say it is avidya&#x301; shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now you know, these two shaktis, that is vidya&#x301; shakti and avidya&#x301; shakti, have their own effect on the human mind, on the microcosm, and when a microcosm is influenced by avidya&#x301; shakti, it always tries to go away from the Hub, and tries to keep itself covert so that the Cosmological Hub may not be able to see it. Purus&#x301;ottama is seeing everything, witnessing everything; but when a person is propelled by the force of avidya&#x301;, that microcosm tries to go away from the Hub, that is, increase its radius, and tries to keep itself covert, concealed, hidden from the Cosmological Hub. It thinks, &ldquo;When I am doing this thing, perhaps the Cosmological Hub, Purus&#x301;ottama, is not seeing me, is not able to see me.&rdquo; This sort of idea is guided by this sort of thinking. Now, the first idea, that is, to fly away, to move away, from the Hub, is called viks&#x301;epa shakti. And to try to hide oneself from that Supreme &ldquo;I&rdquo; [perhaps meaning also &ldquo;Supreme Eye&rdquo;] is called a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. Avaran&#x301;a means &ldquo;to cover&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And similarly, when the human mind is influenced by vidya&#x301; shakti, what happens? All of a sudden it feels that &ldquo;I should do something. I have a human structure. I am a human being. I should do something. I should act like a human being. I should try to goad myself to the realm of divinity, it is my dharma. I should follow dharma, I should strictly adhere to the code of dharma.&rdquo; This idea is a gift of vidya&#x301; shakti, and this particular expression of vidya&#x301; shakti is called sam&#x301;vit shakti. Conscience, when it is roused all of a sudden, is called sam&#x301;vit. &ldquo;I should do something, I should do something.&rdquo; As soon as it comes in contact with sam&#x301;vit shakti, in the next moment you feel, &ldquo;I should do something practical. Theory won&#146;t help me; I should do something concrete, I should do something practical.&rdquo; And when this desire to do something practical is created in the mind, this created force is called hla&#x301;dinii shakti or Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti. With the help of this Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti one can move towards that Cosmological Nave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The Cosmological Nave is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, because He attracts everything. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;the supreme charmer&rdquo;, &ldquo;the supreme attracter&rdquo;, who attracts everybody towards Him with the help of His &ndash; what? His supreme flute. That supreme flute is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. He creates universal acoustic waves, and those waves bring people towards Him; that is why He is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. And microcosms come in contact with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a with the help of that particular expression of sentient vidya&#x301; shakti which is known as Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti. And when with the help of Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti the microcosm comes in contact with the nave Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Purus&#x301;ottama, then we say it is the union of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. (Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is not a male being of Vrindavan, and Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; is not a lady. You should understand it properly.) Now, this Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti is the cogitative faculty, the subject matter of today&#146;s discourse; it is the cogitative faculty, and it is the divine force, and it is the devotional principle, it is devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now, one may say, &ldquo;I understand everything, and I feel that devotion is something heavenly, is a heavenly entity &ndash; but how can I get it?&rdquo; Now, human expressions, human entities (and not only human entities, all entities) are moving from imperfection towards perfection. This never-ending endeavour to move from imperfection towards perfection, from limitation towards the Unlimited Entity, this supreme mysticity, is life. It is a never-ending process, a never-ending march. And that is why it has been said, a life is a constant effort to restore an unstable equilibrium.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now in this march of life &ndash; and particularly in human life &ndash; there are three kinds of expression; and those three expressions, or those three factors, are jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, karma and bhakti. Bhakti is the supreme one. And how to acquire bhakti, how to get bhakti? The simple formula is, karma minus jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is equal to bhakti. Suppose there is a Mr. X. Mr. X has no jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, he is illiterate; but he has rendered two hundred degrees of service, selfless service, to society. So in his stock of karma there is two hundred; and jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is zero, nil; two hundred minus zero is equal to two hundred &ndash; he acquires two hundred degrees of bhakti. And suppose that Mr. P.K. Nair is a learned man, MA in ten subjects; and he has five hundred degrees of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. In order for him to acquire two hundred degrees of bhakti, he will have to acquire &ndash; five hundred plus two hundred &ndash; seven hundred degrees of karma. He will have to render so much selfless karma, selfless service, to the society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->An illiterate fellow acquires two hundred degrees of bhakti by rendering two hundred degrees of karma. But that learned man has to render seven hundred degrees of karma in order to acquire two hundred degrees of bhakti. So in his case, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is nothing but a liability. A liability! And that is why you will sometimes see people who are illiterate, [completely] illiterate, but who have developed bhakti easily.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So the formula is, karma minus jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is equal to bhakti. You must remember it. Now, this bhakti is Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti, this bhakti is the cogitative faculty. In the Vedas it has been said, Na&#x301;yama&#x301;tma&#x301; pravacanena labhyah &ndash; &ldquo;You cannot get that Supreme Entity by tall talk.&rdquo; Na medhaya&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;Not by your intellect.&rdquo; Na bahuna&#x301; shrutena &ndash; &ldquo;Nor by reading or going through so many books or lectures.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->[The Supreme Entity is attainable only if that Entity, by Its grace, reveals Itself to the aspiring soul.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Your progress in the realm of spirituality, in the realm of intuitionality, depends on His divine grace &ndash; just say His special divine grace. The Vedas say that it depends on divine grace, Guru krpa&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->What is krpa&#x301;? You know, Ramakrishna Paramahansa was not a learned man in the mundane sense. Once upon a time a very learned man said, &ldquo;Oh, Ramakrishna, people say everything depends on His krpa&#x301;.&rdquo; (What is the local pronunciation? Krpa&#x301;? Krpa&#x301;? Krpa&#x301;? [pronounced in three ways]) &ldquo;So, what is the meaning of krpa&#x301;?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Ramakrishna said, &ldquo;You know, I am an illiterate fellow, but according to my view, krpa&#x301; is made of two syllables, kr and pa&#x301;. Kr means Karo, karo, karo &ndash; &lsquo;Do, do, do &ndash; Do your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, do your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, do your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.&rsquo; And pa&#x301; means Pa&#x301;o &ndash; &lsquo;Get&rsquo;. &lsquo;Get it, get it, get it, get it.&rsquo; That is, &lsquo;Get it by doing sa&#x301;dhana&rsquo; &ndash; Kr-pa&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->And I say, that divine bliss, that divine krpa&#x301;, that divine compassion, is always being showered upon you, on each and every living being, on each and every animate and inanimate object &ndash; but you do not feel it, you are not being drenched by that divine water, you are not being drenched by that divine shower, because you are holding the umbrella of vanity upon your head. If you want to be drenched by that divine shower of krpa&#x301;, you have to remove the umbrella of vanity from your head; just remove it and be drenched. And what is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is just the action of removing this umbrella from upon my head.<!-- /block --></p>
