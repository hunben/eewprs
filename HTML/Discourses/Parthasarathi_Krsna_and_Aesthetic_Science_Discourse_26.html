<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You all know the meaning of nandana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. It implies getting joy and also giving joy to others. We should analyse the psychology operating behind aesthetic science, because when we see that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was totally engaged in a ceaseless fight against crime and injustice, we have to wonder, what scope was there in Him for aesthetic science? To understand, we must look into the psychology behind the cult of aesthetics. The human mind is progressively unfolding according to its inherent propensities. When it finds something that produces anuku&#x301;lavedaniiyam [congenial mental feelings], it is called sukha [happiness], and when pratiku&#x301;lavedaniiyam [uncongenial mental feelings], it is called duhkha [sorrow]. The human mind moves in a particular flow according to its inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. If it finds congenial vibrations in all directions, vibrations with greater wavelengths than its own, then its own mental vibrations of lesser wavelength become straightened, attaining greater wavelengths. This is anuku&#x301;lavedaniiyam, and the vedana&#x301; (in Bengali vedana&#x301; means &ldquo;pain&rdquo;, but in Sanskrit it means anubhu&#x301;ti [feeling]) that arises in an environment of longer waves is termed sukha; where the vedana&#x301; is uncongenial, it is known as klesha [affliction] or duhkha. The wavelengths of uncongenial vibrations are shorter than those of the congenial vibrations. Aesthetic science implies that psychic waves coming in contact with vibrations of greater frequency attain a greater wavelength, and we may say, Anuku&#x301;lavedaniiyam&#x301; sukham [&ldquo;A congenial mental feeling is called happiness&rdquo;]. If the reverse occurs, we say, Pratiku&#x301;lavedaniiyam&#x301; duhkham [&ldquo;An uncongenial mental feeling is called sorrow&rdquo;]. In aesthetic science there is no scope for sorrow; and when the vibrations of happiness become straightened, it leads to a&#x301;nandam; happiness is transformed into bliss. When this undulating movement is directed towards a&#x301;nandam and the waves get straightened, it falls within the scope and jurisdiction of aesthetic science. When the waves become totally free from curvature, when they become fully and finally straightened, this falls within the scope of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [supra-aesthetic science]. One attains the state of a&#x301;nandam, the highest state of human existence. What was the role of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi? He fought and fought relentlessly against wrongdoing and injustice, so that jiivas might enjoy happiness. Criminals and wicked persons, by their evil acts, were adding to the sorrows and miseries of the people, adding to their pratiku&#x301;lavedaniiyam. Thus it is clear that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, through His noble deeds, increased the anuku&#x301;lavedaniiyam of the jiivas. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi annihilated the wicked and sinful persons and thus rid society of antisocial elements. When, consequently, jiivas came in touch with vibrations of greater wavelength, they obviously found it easier to move towards a&#x301;nandam. They were inspired to move in their natural flow of life. Just as Vrajagopa&#x301;la attracted microcosms towards a&#x301;nandam through the medium of sound, touch, taste, smell and form, through His graceful dances and the sweet melodies of His flute, likewise, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi attracted them towards the beauty and joy of collective life by giving them a foretaste of what it would be like. Judged from the aesthetic standpoint, what Vrajagopa&#x301;la was able to do in one way, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi performed in a different way. In fact, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi should be considered the propounder of aesthetic science, for the essential theme of this aesthetic science found its consummation in the life and action of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Vrajagopa&#x301;la and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi both fall within the scope of aesthetic science. Vrajagopa&#x301;la represents all that is soft and sweet, tender and delicate in the universe. He is the living embodiment of an infinite softness, a divine sweetness. Vrajagopa&#x301;la&#146;s sweetness manifests itself in a very tender and delicate manner. Vrajagopa&#x301;la readily appeals to the human mind and sensibilities, whereas Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi represents the entire sentimentality of the universe through the expression of His Cosmic energy or ojas [psychic lustre]. What Vrajagopa&#x301;la has accomplished through His characteristic softness, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi has done through the radiation of His Cosmic energy. A vast quantity of Cosmic energy descended from the Cosmic hub and was diffused throughout all particles of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It radiated in all directions, promoting the all-round well-being of humanity. This, in short, is my Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Vrajagopa&#x301;la and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi have equal importance in this aesthetic science. The advent of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was no ordinary physical phenomenon. This advent was a descent from the vibhu shakti [Macrocosmic energy] of the Supreme Entity. The Cosmic energy of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi descended from that point which is the supreme source of all Cosmic vibrations. It inundated the entire universe and continues to do so today. Thus:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Dyotate kriid&#x301;ate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divi;<br>Tasma&#x301;t deva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[The vibrational manifestations emanating from the Supreme Nucleus are known as devata&#x301;s, and these devata&#x301;s address that Supreme Nucleus as Deva. He with His powers vibrates the entire universe, makes the entire universe dance; and He by dint of His occult and supra-occult powers brings everything back onto His lap.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s sweetness is the sweetness of unlimited energy, the sweetness of the lofty Himalayas, the sweetness of thundering clouds. His sweetness spreads throughout collective life. Vrajagopa&#x301;la belongs to individuals as much as to the collective body. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi likewise belongs as much to individuals as to the collective body, but the basic difference is that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi paid more attention to the collective interest. Parama Purus&#x301;a remains associated with His creation through ota yoga and prota yoga. He is connected with each individual separately through His ota yoga, and with all collectively through His prota yoga. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is more inclined towards ota yoga than prota yoga, while Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is more inclined towards prota yoga than ota yoga. For Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, &ldquo;If I can promote the welfare of the collective body, then the individual interest will also be served, for individuals are included in the collective body.&rdquo; For example, if I supply an entire country with food, then there remains no need to supply each individual separately, because they are all included in the total population of the country. Due to this sweetness coming from Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, jiivas derive collective joy through aesthetic science more from Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, whereas they derive individual joy through aesthetic science more from Vrajagopa&#x301;la.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Six Spokes of the Social Cycle<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It would be good to mention one point here: that a comprehensive heroic advent of Parama Purus&#x301;a in the form of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma took place in Lord Shiva. But the six factors which guide society, which make it vibrate in bliss and dance in bliss when its different entities realize the fullness of existence in every fibre of their existence, are the s&#x301;ad&#x301;ara&#x301;h sama&#x301;ja cakra [six spokes of the social cycle]. [The six are: spiritual practice, spiritual ideology, social outlook, socio-economic theory, scripture and preceptor.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In Lord Shiva all six factors were brightly conspicuous. That was surely the case with Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a also. That is why they were considered Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, they were considered Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti. But of these factors, which do we find most clearly manifest in Shiva? Shiva gave a systematic sha&#x301;stra [scripture], and thereby thrust humanity one step forward on the path to aesthetic science. Where there is a well-codified and systematic scripture, the people are able to derive joy at every step by adhering to its precepts. For instance, suppose I move my hands at random or move my legs and head without any rhyme or reason. Clearly, this cannot be called dance. At best we can call it folk dance, but never classical dance, for in classical dance there are specific rules, special mudra&#x301;s [gestures], and certain rhythms. Hence there is an ineluctable need for sha&#x301;stra. One can derive a&#x301;nandam only when one strictly adheres to those prescribed rules. Simple random movement of the arms and legs is not dance. Likewise, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and bhajana [devotional songs] also presuppose certain systematic injunctions. Otherwise, they may prove harmful. Society needs such scripture in every sphere of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Sha&#x301;sana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah sha&#x301;strah parikiirtitah [&ldquo;That which liberates through discipline is called sha&#x301;stra, scripture&rdquo;]. &ldquo;Do this. Don&#146;t do that. This is good. That is bad&rdquo; &ndash; that which teaches these dos and don&#146;ts is known as sha&#x301;stra. Etymologically, the word sha&#x301;stra is derived from the root verb sha&#x301;s plus trae plus d&#x301;a. What we notice most prominently in Shiva is that He introduced the kind of scripture that provided the impetus to move people along the path of aesthetic science, and thus did enormous good to humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->But this was not all. He also taught the cult of aesthetics. &ldquo;Cult&rdquo; means the practical processes. For example, He first explained to Maharshi Bharata the theoretical aspects of dance, and then proceeded to teach the practical aspects. He taught him how to dance systematically. For example, one should dance dhin in this way, dhae in that way and ta&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in still another way. That is, He taught both the theoretical and practical sides. If the theoretical side advanced the cause of aesthetic science one hundred per cent, the knowledge of the practical aspects advanced the cause five hundred per cent. He taught both.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Along with this, He fulfilled one more condition of the s&#x301;ad&#x301;ara&#x301;h sama&#x301;ja cakra &ndash; &ldquo;preceptor&rdquo;. As the original preceptor, He took on the entire responsibility of teaching the different branches of science. He said, &ldquo;Well, I will teach these sciences. They may praise Me or blame Me as they like, it will in no way affect Me.&rdquo; He moved ahead in His own characteristic style in order to strengthen the six essential factors, and thereby advance the cause of the aesthetic science both directly and indirectly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, in His time, created a great social consciousness. He told the people: &ldquo;You are social beings. One cannot live in isolation. When you feel thirsty, you can&#146;t manufacture a spade, dig a well, and draw water yourself. One person will make a spade, another will add the wooden handle, and another will dig the well &ndash; this is how we work collectively. This is the way for human beings to live. In all spheres of human existence, in the aesthetic sphere as well, humanity should live collectively. You should live in unison. You should vibrate together to the same music. You should move in a common psychic flow. You should fight collectively against your common enemies. Unitedly you should face all problems, mundane and supra-mundane. In a word, you must reflect the spirit of harmonious collective living in conformity with the spirit of the Vedic mantra Sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&#x301; sam&#x301;vadadhvam.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In order to achieve these ends, what did Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi do? Those who stand against the natural movement of human life, those who impede the natural growth of human beings, should be uncompromisingly annihilated. Their annihilation is good both for themselves and for society. After their annihilation they will get new scope to live and develop in a different environment; and the rest of society, released from their clutches, will breathe a sigh of relief. The greatest contribution of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was the arousal of social consciousness, and this social consciousness, instead of restricting aesthetic science to a few individuals, facilitated its dissemination among the people at large. Not only did He play His music alone, He inspired others to play along with Him. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was able to fulfil His mission by playing His flute. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s stringing of the bow added a new chapter in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s struggle against evil and injustice. This new dimension not only sweetened aesthetic science, it expanded its scope also. There is joy indeed in launching a struggle against injustice, and that joy is part and parcel of aesthetic science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->We notice that whenever people stand before a towering personality they become overwhelmed, awestruck. But the greatness of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is beyond all measure. His greatness is full of sweetness from beginning to end. Furthermore, that sweetness was born out of soft sentimentality. That I will bring relief to all &ndash; this very thought is something very noble, very sweet. For this very reason He brought social consciousness to people at large. Without arousing social consciousness, it is next to impossible to bring about social welfare. It may not be possible to bring about social welfare through constructive programmes and through the struggle against injustice alone; social consciousness is indispensable for the permanent existence of aesthetic science. When people contemplate the great Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, their shorter thought-waves, which depend upon crude objects such as name, fame, money, etc., attain a longer wavelength, become straightened, due to the process of Cosmic ideation. This vast Entity is infinite and integral, and the insignificant unit entities remain in bondage due to their obsession with meaningless thoughts of mundane objects such as name, fame, wealth, etc. Those things are mere ripples in the ocean of the Cosmic Entity. When those insignificant entities come in contact with the Great, they no longer remain insignificant, but become great themselves. This very urge to attain the Great frees the mind from the bondage of relativity. No matter what stratum of life you find yourself in, if you love the Great, if you try to move towards That, your insignificance will expand into greatness. If, on the other hand, you adopt the reverse approach; if, that is, you say, &ldquo;I am so insignificant. Let me first remove my smallness, then I will proceed towards the Great,&rdquo; this is a huge psychological blunder. In the correct approach, one does not think at all whether one is big or small. One only thinks, &ldquo;I must love that great Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; The moment you think this way, the narrowness of your mind will vanish and yield to greatness. This is the proper psychological approach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->There are people who come to me and say, &ldquo;I am a great sinner, I am a hopeless sinner.&rdquo; I feel unhappy and gently rebuke them. I tell them &ldquo;Look here, if you continue to think that you are a sinner, that very thought will make you a confirmed sinner.&rdquo; I cannot support this. It is defective. Rather you should go to the temple and say &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, I love You. I want to move towards You. I want to be one with You.&rdquo; If someone thinks that he or she is a sinner, then that person&#146;s mind is diverted from Parama Purus&#x301;a towards His own ego. So it follows that if one thinks of the great Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, one becomes great like Him, for Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati &ndash; &ldquo;One who thinks of Parama Purus&#x301;a becomes Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; In this process of mental expansion due to constant ideation on Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, the psychic waves attain a greater wavelength, that is, one is following the path of aesthetic science. He or she begins to love every expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He or she says:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Minati caran&#x301;a pare bhakti mila&#x301;o bandhu,<br>Niti niti nava anura&#x301;ge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, grant me devotion &ndash; that devotion which will enable me to love you every moment in newer and still newer ways. For you are endless and your expressions are also endless. If I learn how to love You, I will be able to love You in endless ways. My life will become effervescent with the sweet rhythms of the infinite. My life will attain its highest fulfilment.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->This very urge on the part of jiivas to become one with the Cosmos is what is called mysticism. Mysticism is a never-ending endeavour to find a link between the finite and the Infinite. Human endeavour is limitless, endless, so it follows that when people think of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi and His infinite, endless qualities, they become lost. He is the most precious treasure of aesthetic science. The moment one thinks of His excellence, the moment one thinks of the sweetness of His divine existence, one becomes totally lost.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Toma&#x301;r ru&#x301;pe mugdha a&#x301;mi, mugdha toma&#x301;r gun&#x301;e<br>Pa&#x301;rgha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;te base a&#x301;chi toma&#x301;r na&#x301;m shun&#x301;e.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->[I am awestruck at Your wondrous beauty. I am awestruck before Your matchless qualities. I am waiting for You on the shore of life, waiting to be ferried across.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->At that moment the devotee likes to hear His name alone, to think of Him alone. It shows that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Himself has developed the science of aesthetics. What can we say of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi in the light of aesthetic science, for He is its creator. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is the final destination of all human beings. All are advancing towards Him, and, while advancing towards Him, they establish some sort of relationship with Him. That relationship is internal. It is purely personal. One may love Him as a mother loves her son, a wife her husband, a servant his master or as friends love one another. This relationship exists with both Vrajagopa&#x301;la and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, but since Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is such an overpowering personality, usually people establish one of three types of relationship with Him: that of a wife, a servant or a friend. I have already told you that Arjuna was a friend of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; sakhya bha&#x301;va. The interesting thing, though, is that this friendly relationship cannot endure till the end. Either it is converted into da&#x301;sya bha&#x301;va [the feeling of being a servant], or madhura bha&#x301;va [the feeling of being a lover]. That very outlook that is instrumental in determining a particular type of relationship with Parama Purus&#x301;a, depending upon one&#146;s inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, is called mysticism. As I have already explained, mysticism is a never-ending endeavour to find a link between finite and Infinite. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi made it crystal-clear:<!-- /block --></p>
