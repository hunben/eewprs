<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><I>Kola</I> also refers to the <I>a&#x301;r&#x301;aba&#x301;n&#x32D;shii</I> [a kind of flute placed on the lower lip and played with a bow]. There are various types of flutes; they are also fabricated out of different materials. Different types of flutes were also used in ancient Bengal but the most common was the <I>a&#x301;r&#x301;aba&#x301;n&#x32D;shii</I> . The word <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;shii</I> comes from <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;sha (bam&#x301;sha)</I> and <I></I>its synonyms are <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;sharii, muralii</I>, etc. However <I>kola</I> is not a common synonym for <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;shii</I>, it is only used for the <I>a&#x301;r&#x301;aba&#x301;n&#x32D;shii</I>. In ancient times people used to be exposed to danger in their life whenever they were moving about outside their homes; they used to live constantly in the midst of danger. So they used to commonly carry with them a convenient-sized bamboo that they could use to defend themselves against threats. Later they realized that a solid <I></I>bamboo served better to defend themselves against their enemies; so for self-protection or for battle, they started using more solid (<I>niiret)</I> bamboo instead of a hollow bamboo. Eventually this solid bamboo became the cudgel (<I>nadrana&#x301;d</I> or <I>na&#x301;dna&#x301;</I> or <I>la&#x301;t&#x301;hi</I> or <I>daun&#x32D;g</I>). While using the hollow bamboos, they observed that when wind would pass through the opening, it would produce different kinds of sounds. So from these hollow bamboos, they fashioned the primary musical instruments. From <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;sha</I> [bamboo] comes <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;shii</I> [flute]. The different sounds created when the flow of air is divided and obstructed came to be called flute sounds. This bamboo flute was the first musical instrument created by nature. In the beginning, the same bamboo would be used as weapon as well as flute.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Afterwards, by regulating the passage of air through the bamboo in musical rhythm and time, the musical scale was brought forth. Advanced instruments were created out of bamboo. When people started deriving this collection of notes from bamboo, they gave the name <I>kola</I> to that collection of flute sounds. When human beings heard these flute sounds in external nature and started to investigate the <I>Surasa&#x301;ptaka</I> (just like internal flute sounds) in their inner nature, they felt that those internal sounds were flute sounds being played by their inner deity, the beginningless and endless Unknown Consciousness, goal of all pilgrimages, the hidden, the dearest, entity. This was Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s flute, the divine flautist of <I>Gokul</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
