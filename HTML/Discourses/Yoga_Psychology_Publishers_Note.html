<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the Publisher&#146;s Note to the first edition, it was noted that psychology, for the author, is a developing science which is considered to be a part of philosophy. Traditionally philosophy has included the branches of ontology, metaphysics, ethics and epistemology, but Shrii Shrii Anandamurtijii has expanded the scope of philosophy to include psychology and spiritual cult (practices). In fact, this is one of the features which makes Ananda Marga spiritual philosophy unique.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Regarding the scope of philosophy and psychology, in &ldquo;Our Philosophical Treatise&rdquo; (Tattva Kaomudii Part 2, 1969), the author writes:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In Western philosophy there is no mention of spiritual cult, because Western philosophers had no opportunity to learn such a cult. The main reason is that, in the theology prevalent in the West, there is no concrete spiritual cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->According to general belief, psychology is a part of general science, and should therefore not be included as a part of philosophy. Thus psychology has been accepted as a branch of science in the West. But in Ananda Marga, psychology has been included as a part of philosophy. Moreover, according to Ananda Marga, the scope of psychology is wider than what is usually accepted by psychologists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Yoga psychology, though a part of philosophy, is also a science, but is not restricted to the materialistic paradigm which characterizes Western philosophy and psychology. It is the science by which spiritual aspirants can acquire knowledge and mastery of themselves in their quest for Self-realization. Knowledge of yoga psychology is essential for spiritual practices; without this knowledge, aspirants will not achieve success in their spiritual endeavours.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The discourses published in this book include only some of the important discourses given by the author on yoga psychology. Other important discourses on the subject have been published in works such as Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Parts 1-8; A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 1-31; A Guide to Human Conduct; Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha Parts 1-24; Idea and Ideology; and Ananda Marga: Elementary Philosophy. Those interested in yoga psychology should also consult these books.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate here &ndash; in addition to the original language of each speech, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if other than in this book, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the cases of some of the discourses published here, no written record was found of the language in which the discourse was given; but if the language could be clearly inferred from the location and other circumstances of the discourse, we have cited that language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The abbreviation &ldquo;DMC&rdquo; sometimes appears at the end of a discourse. Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra was a special spiritual gathering addressed by the author as the preceptor, or guru, of Ananda Marga. The abbreviation &ldquo;RU&rdquo; at the end of a discourse indicates that the discourse constituted a Presidential speech to Renaissance Universal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
