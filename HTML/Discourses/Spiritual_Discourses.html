<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Life is a movement from imperfection to perfection.  When inanimate objects become animate there is progress.  There is further progress when animate beings become multicellular metazoic organisms, more and more complicated structures.  The human being is the highest being, the being most perfect in structure.  The human being is thus a perfected animal.  But this is the beginning of progress for humanity.  Humans still have to achieve further physical, intellectual and spiritual perfection. Movement towards perfection &ndash; God &ndash; is a human&#146;s true nature (dharma).  Movement towards imperfection is against one&#146;s true nature (adharma).  The former is life, the latter is death. Human movement towards animality is therefore not life, it is death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->No movement is free from friction or obstacles.  Even when you walk, the force of gravity obstructs you.  Movement towards perfection is obstructed by all the forces of imperfection, of evil.  The sinful, the crude, the narrow, obstruct all movement for the expansion of the human mind.  But perfection being a God-ward movement, do not be afraid &ndash; move on.  Obstacles will go down the drain, where they belong.  You will progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The mission of human life is to move towards perfection, towards God.  This is one&#146;s duty.  In this struggle the forces of evil are bound to be defeated.  This has been the case all along, and history will repeat itself.  You have no right to rest until you have fulfilled your mission of being perfect, of being divine, of establishing yourself in perfection.  Rest is sin as it puts a stop to this movement.  Do not rest until you have reached your goal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->From the inanimate to the animate goes the process of evolution. Consider a piece of stone for instance.  It has neither the power of action nor the sensation of mind.  What is the reason?  It is because hitherto there has been no manifestation of mind in the stone at all.  Consider the trees and plants that are more animate than the stone.  There is activity in them.  They grow, draw the vital juice from the earth, maintain their species by creating seeds in their own bodies, and enjoy and suffer pleasure and pain when taken care of or hurt.  We see in them the manifestation of consciousness, for mind has awakened in them. Thus progressing on the path of mental development, we see in humanity its greatest manifestation.  Just as evolution takes place from the subtle to the crude, similarly the unit entity reverts step by step from the crude to the subtle, towards the same Absolute Consciousness from whence it came.  It is just like the waves of the sea, rippling back from whence they have come.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The darkness of evolutionary night began to fade centuries ago when the first ape-like creature deserted his tree-branch kingdom and shambled out into the light of the plain.  He was guided by something he could not understand: something un-apelike and impossible for his comrades.  Somehow, somewhere in his seething body chemistry, something had changed.  In his brain lay the seed of humanity; in his strangely bright eyes, the dark shadow of a hidden dream.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Time passed slowly.  The new creatures developed and multiplied. The wonderful changes in their bodies and minds continued; their brains, nerves and glandular systems grew in complexity and specialization.  New behaviour patterns evolved and after some time, emotions and feelings unknown and denied to all previous forms of life found their means of expression.  The Dawn of Man was reached at that auspicious hour.  The waves of thought generated by that first human expression vibrate even to this day in the unconscious mind of every human being.  Everyone of us carries within him the hidden memory of that first sunrise, and even beyond it into the darkness of antiquity.  We are, by means of this primordial memory, which is part of our human heritage, intimately connected to all forms of life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Humanity, standing as it does at the top of the evolutionary ladder, may sometimes feel proud and in a weak moment commit an act of meanness.  Yet one should always remain vigilant against this.  The evolutionary forces have not stopped.  The theatre of action has shifted to the psychic level.  Evolution is now expressing its power in the daily struggle of men and women everywhere to attain dignity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->THE SUPREME CONSCIOUSNESS<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->You know, there is nothing disorderly in this Universe. Everything moves according to certain rules.  In this solar system of ours, the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving around the sun.  In this ethereal system, the earth is the nucleus, and the moon is moving around it.  Similarly, in the atomic system also there is a nucleus and electrons move around the nucleus.  In our cosmological order the Supreme Consciousness is the nucleus and so many animate and inanimate objects are moving around Him, knowingly or unknowingly.  Human beings move knowingly and other animals, other less developed living beings, and also inanimate objects &ndash; even some human beings &ndash; move unknowingly, unconsciously.  The radius of those who move unknowingly remains unchanged, or even, due to their mean propensities, their radius may increase.  But spiritual aspirants always try to lessen the length of their radius.  They come closer and closer to the Supreme, and when they come to the nearest proximity, they become one with the Nucleus, and that is the stage of Salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now, so many entities, so many individuals are moving around Him; they have so many physical structures &ndash; long, short, white, black, learned, illiterate &ndash; but the common goal is the Nucleus, the Supreme Consciousness.  There should be no shyness, no hatred, no complex in human beings because that Nucleus is the bigger &ldquo;I&rdquo; of everybody &ndash; that Nucleus is the Supreme Progenitor of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->(Baba in Fiesch, 35)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In this universe there is nothing beyond the Supreme Consciousness.  You always remain within His circle.  Imagine that a cow is tied to a peg with a rope.  The rope may be short or long, but the cow has to move around the peg.  Similarly, human beings are moving around the Cosmic Nucleus.  They go round without knowing that they are tied to a peg, without knowing Who is at the centre.  They think that they are everything, and that they know so much.  They think they are not ordinary creatures; this creates pride in them.  Then, while moving, suddenly a question comes in their minds.  They ask where they are going, from where is the inspiration to move coming?  When this realization, this question arises in their minds, then they know that they are moving around a peg, and that they have to go towards the centre, towards the Supreme Nucleus.  The day this realization comes they become spiritual aspirants and the radius starts decreasing.  When the radius becomes nil, then they merge into the Supreme Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Human beings will have to go on moving as long as they have the feeling that they and the Entity which has created them, the Supreme Consciousness at the Nucleus, are two different entities. When they realize suddenly on reaching close to the peg that they and the Entity which has created them are not different, the distance between the two will disappear and both will become one &ndash; they will merge in the nectar of Cosmic Consciousness. This is the ultimate aim of all beings, of plants, of anything which has life.  Therefore, the person who comes onto the path of spiritual practice early is wise &ndash; and also fortunate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->(&ldquo;Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; Bha&#x301;ratii&rdquo; June 1980, 32)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Now, the Supreme Consciousness is the Supreme Witnessing Entity. Whatever your individual consciousness is seeing or feeling - everything &ndash; is being witnessed by the Supreme Entity.  Suppose you are imagining a rhinoceros in your mind, and that rhinoceros is moving within your mind &ndash; whatever that rhinoceros is doing you are seeing; whatever that rhinoceros is thinking you are hearing.  Whatever the rhinoceros does, then and there it is being witnessed by you.  No activities, no thought waves of that rhinoceros are a secret for you &ndash; you know everything.  So whatever is being done in the universe is nothing but a mental creation of the Supreme Consciousness; everything is within His mind.  He is the Macrocosm, and everything is microcosm.  Each and every person is moving within His mind.  Everything is within Him, nothing is without.  So whatever is being done, He sees, He knows, He feels.  This universe is nothing but a mental projection of that Supreme Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Hence, because everything is His mental creation, so everything, everybody is His child.  He is not the ruler, He is not the administrator, He is not the boss.  He is the creator.  He is the generator, He is the operator, He is the destroyer.  When He withdraws His thought waves within Himself then nothing will remain.  You came from Him, you are moving within His mind, and finally you will become one with Him.  That is why I said, He being the generator, is represented by &ldquo;G&rdquo;; He being the operator is represented by &ldquo;O&rdquo;, and He being the destructor is represented by &ldquo;D&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;G-O-D.&rdquo;  He is the GOD.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->(Baba in Fiesch, 54)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->God is the controller of that vital force which keeps the organisms alive.  He is our friend Who saves us from the jaws of calamities by His affectionate and tender touch.  He exists everywhere.  He is present about us sometimes as sound expression, sometimes as thought or emotion, and then again sometimes as individual entities.  There is not a place in the universe where His Entity is not manifest.  What we apparently take to be a void is also full of His Entity.  He is even where the human intellect cannot reach, and where the imagination bounds back, thwarted and baffled.  In the planetary world, it is His glory that shines as the sun.  The backbone of the nervous system, the praising of the dead ancestors, the truth of the sages, the controller, the friend, the sun &ndash; are all these separate entities?  No, all is He, all is He, all is He.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->(Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha II, 25)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->There is one moon, but its reflections, falling in countless puddles of water, appear as countless moons.  No new moon is born.  The same moon is being reflected in many receptacles. Similarly, the one and the same Supreme Consciousness is being manifested as limitless individual entities, in countless mental receptacles, in countless minds.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Is He moving?  No, no, He is not.  He lies motionless like the stump of a tree.  Is He far away?  No, no, He is not. He is very close.  He is the Life of my life.  He is within you, within me. He is within and without all and at all places.  When a spiritual aspirant gets adequately acquainted with His Blissful Entity, we say that he is established in the Supreme Consciousness. At that stage both inside and outside attain unity.  Mind then remains aloof from the attraction of trifles, and real acquaintance is made with the Supreme Being.  While the body remains in the mortal world, the soul is merged in the Supreme Soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->(Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha II, 10)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Any energy is invisible.  We see the operation and action of electrical energy through lights, fans, etc.  Similarly, no one has ever seen the sun &ndash; only its action.  It looks round, but from a short distance it is simply something burning.  So electricity and the sun are to be felt only.  The same is the case with the mind.  No one can show his mind, nor can one see one&#146;s own mind.  One can only feel.  Similarly, the Supreme Consciousness is only to be felt and realized.  When the whole mind is filled with the feeling of the Supreme Consciousness you can hardly bear it &ndash; nor can you express the bliss. You feel it - you can only enjoy it!<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The concept of God and Satan is defective.  If we accept the existence of Satan it means that there are two Gods, one God positive, and one God negative, i.e. Satan.  And that challenges the authority of the Supreme Consciousness &ndash; that cannot be.  So there is no Satan.  Everywhere there is the rule of the Supreme Consciousness; nowhere is the rule of Satan.  Satan is the centrifugal force that drives an aspirant, a human being, away from the Supreme Nucleus.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Consciousness is the shelter of all entities, the only Entity who requires no shelter for maintaing His existence. This town of Patna is sheltered within the state of Bihar.  Bihar is within India.  India is within Asia.  Asia is within this planet.  This planet is within this solar system.  This solar system is within Him.  So nobody shelters Him.  He does not depend on any shelter.  His existence does not depend on the compassion of any second entity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Consciousness is there in you as the oil is in the oilseed.  Crush the seed through spiritual practice (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;) and you attain Him; separate the mind from Consciousness and you will see that the resplendence of the Supreme Consciousness illuminates your whole inner being.  He is there like butter in curd; churn it and He will appear from within.  Churn your mind through spiritual practice and God will appear like butter from curd.  He is like a subterranean river in you.  Remove the sands of mind and you will find the clear, cool waters within.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->(Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha IV, 126)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Consciousness has concealed Himself within your mind. He is hidden behind the curtain of your &ldquo;I-ness&rdquo;.  You need not go to the Himalayan mountains to find out the thing that is concealed in your own &ldquo;I&rdquo;.  Does one need a mirror to see the bangle on one&#146;s hand?  The Supreme, therefore, is within you. There is need only of removing the veil of ego.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->We have to wipe out this ego, this &ldquo;I-hood&rdquo;.  All burdens, all confusion, all considerations of respect or disrespect are connected with this &ldquo;I&rdquo;.  When someone does not agree with you, you file a suit in the court.  Why do you take such trouble? Only to vindicate your ego.  All troubles and frustrations are solely due to the unit ego.  The fact is that even after surrendering everything to God, the arch enemy &ldquo;I&rdquo; remains.  You will say, &ldquo;I have surrendered everything to God.&rdquo;  &ndash; I, I, I!  My friend, surrender this &ldquo;I&rdquo; also to God and then alone your surrender will be complete.  All the trouble is due to this &ldquo;I&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Now, when does a person feel that he or she should love the Supreme?  When one frees oneself from egoistic sentiments.  But one will say, &ldquo;They say God is gracious, but I am an unfortunate fellow.  I am not realizing His grace.&rdquo;  There are many persons who talk like this.  But you know, my sons, you know, my daughters, there is no partiality in Him.  His heavenly shower of Grace is for all.  He is for each and every creature, but one feels His Grace while another does not.  What is the reason: There is a heavenly shower of grace.  But suppose you are holding an umbrella over your head.  Will you be drenched by the shower? Oh, no.  He who wants to enjoy this shower of grace must remove the umbrella of ego from his head, and he will be drenched by the divine shower.  So a spiritual aspirant, a Yogi, must give up all his egoistic sentiments.  And in the next moment he will be in the proximity of the Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->In simple terms, what we have to do is to return home from where we came.  We have all come from the Supreme Entity, the Nucleus of the universe.  We have to return to the same destination.  The child has played throughout the day away in the fields, and now that evening has come, he returns home.  He thinks that his father must have returned home:  &ldquo;Let me return home and sit near him.&rdquo;  When one is tired of this world and worldliness, one yearns to go back to spirituality &ndash; one&#146;s home.  And what is our permanent abode, our home?  The Supreme Consciousness. Spiritual practice (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;), therefore, is the process of returning home.  It is a simple task.  It requires no scholarship, no knowledge, no intellectual faculty, no long and tedious lecturing.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->When a knower of truth merges in the Supreme Being, his petty sense of existence loses itself, and attaining unity with the Supreme Entity, he becomes Supreme himself.  Spiritual practice is the means for expansion of the soul, not for its annihilation; so absorption in the Supreme (samadhi) does not mean suicide but self-transcendence.  One who has known the Supreme Consciousness becomes Supreme himself, for the individual entity takes on the very form of his object of ideation.  One who has the Supreme as his object of ideation, becomes the Supreme himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->If a salt doll goes to fathom the sea, it will certainly melt and become the sea itself.  Similarly, if the knower of the Supreme Consciousness goes to fathom the Supreme, he merges in the sea of Consciousness and becomes Supreme himself.  Be constantly absorbed in the thought of the Supreme Consciousness and you too will become Supreme.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->The union of a spiritual aspirant with the Supreme Consciousness has been expressed with an excellent example.  A river, giving up its name and identity, completely merges in the sea and thereafter cannot maintain its own existence except as the sea. Similarly, a spiritual aspirant, after merging himself in the Supreme Consciousness, can no longer think of himself except as the Supreme.  Seeing the Ganges River, we can tell that is the water of the Ganges.  We can tell the water of the Yamuna River, or the water of the Sarasvati River; but once they merge in the sea, we cannot separate them, nor can we distinguish the one from the other.  Nevertheless they are all there.  They all have lost their respective name-entities in the entity of the sea.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->For each and every human being there are two &ldquo;I&#146;s&rdquo;.  The name of a person, say, is Solomon.  Then the name of his little &ldquo;I&rdquo; is Solomon and the name of his big &ldquo;I&rdquo; is that Supreme Entity.  The name of the little &ldquo;I&rdquo; is Mr. Joseph, but the name of his big &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the Supreme Consciousness.  The big &ldquo;I&rdquo; for all created beings is the same, but the little &ldquo;I&rdquo; varies &ndash; so many bodies having so many names.  The big &ldquo;I&rdquo; is one and indivisible: for the entire universe there is one big &ldquo;I&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->What is Yoga?  It is to become one with that Supreme Entity. When you become one with the Supreme you are getting everything, you are losing nothing.  You are losing only your little name, the name of your little &ldquo;I&rdquo;, and nothing else, and in return you are getting the Supreme &ldquo;I&rdquo;.  This is Yoga in the spiritual sphere.  Some people think that Yoga means a particular exercise. No, no, no. Yoga does not mean exercise; Yoga means unification.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->In order to realize the Supreme Perfection, a human being will have to give up his or her &ldquo;I-ness&rdquo;; that is to say, s/he will have to merge his or her petty &ldquo;I-feeling&rdquo; in the Great &ldquo;I-feeling&rdquo;.  What is this petty &ldquo;I&rdquo;?  It is like a pot full of water in a pond.  Now if the water of the pot is to be unified with that of the pond &ndash; actually, both the waters are intrinsically one &ndash; the pot intervening between the two waters has to be removed.  After the removal of the pot, there will remain no distinction between the water of the pot and water of the pond &ndash; both become one.  The cause of this apparent distinction between God and the unit being is this pot &ndash; the individual mind.  The long and short of the whole thing is that He is infinite.  If you want to realize His characteristic Self, you have to earn limitlessness yourself.<!-- /block --></p>

This is the stage of non-attributional consciousness.  It is the Supreme Stage of Yogic practice, it is the Supreme Stance for a Yogi.  But for this, one requires divine help; and I know further that one is getting divine help.  And I know still further, that for infinite time and infinite space, one will be getting this divine help.

<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->Spiritual practice is the conversion of the small object into that infinite object.  Now, you think that &ldquo;This small body, this unit consciousness, is mine.&rdquo;  But when you think &ldquo;That vast universal body is mine,&rdquo; then you are the Supreme.  When this individual body and mind is yours, you know all the secrets of this individual physical body and mind.  And when this vast cosmos is your object, you&#146;ll know everything of this cosmos, you&#146;ll know everything of this infinite space.  So your spiritual practice is the practice of conversion &ndash; conversion of small into big.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->This process of conversion makes a person universal.  One&#146;s very existence goes beyond the scope of time, place and person.  At that time, one becomes omnipotent and also omniscient.  One knows everything without going through any book.  When an individual wants to acquire any knowledge, one will have to go through practical experiences, books, etc.  For the individual, there are so many worries and anxieties, so much optimism and pessimism, so many clashes and cohesions; but in the case of the Supreme there is no complex, no optimism, no pessimism; there is no question of clashes or cohesions, because in the case of the Cosmic, everything is internal &ndash; nothing is external.  Everything is within and nothing is without.  The entire universe is in the range of His mind, so there remains no second entity, no second individual.  Thus the question of any clash doesn&#146;t arise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->If one wants to attain peace, what is one to do?  One is to convert one&#146;s small objectivity into the infinite objectivity. There is no other alternative.  Simply teaching the gospels of peace won&#146;t give you any peace.  You have to convert yourself from small into big.  Spiritual practice is the practice of increasing one&#146;s own psychic radius.  When it becomes bigger and bigger, the range of mind is bigger.  And when in this way the radius becomes infinite, the aspirant becomes one with the Supreme.  This becoming one with the Supreme, the Supreme Union, is called Salvation or emancipation &ndash; liberation of permanent nature.  Each and every spiritual aspirant should know this and attain liberation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->There is a common desire in each and every human mind, and that desire differentiates a human from an animal, a human from a plant.  What is that difference?  It wants to expand.  Secondly, it wants to become one with the Cosmic Entity.  Thirdly, it wants to do something noble; and fourthly, it wants peace, supreme peace, undisturbed peace.  These are the four special qualifications of human beings.  So Yoga is the path of progress, the path of development for each and every human being.  In individual life we should practice yoga, and in collective life we should encourage others to practice yoga.  It is the panacea of all human ailments, in the physical realm, in the psychic realm and also in the spiritual realm.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->What is Tantra?  The process of transforming animality or latent divinity into the Supreme Divinity is known as Tantra.  The spiritual practice which liberates the aspirant from dullness or animality and expands one&#146;s self is Tantrik practice (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;). So, there cannot be any spiritual practice without Tantra. Spiritual practice means a practice for expansion, and this expansion is nothing but a liberation from the bondage of all sorts of dullness.  Irrespective of caste, creed or religion, one who aspires for spiritual expansion, or does something concrete, is a Tantrika.  Tantra in itself is neither a religion nor an &ldquo;ism&rdquo;.  It is the fundamental spiritual science.<!-- /block --></p>

You are to follow those practical demonstrators; that means you are to follow the Yogis.

<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->There are some people who have the correct desire but do not have correct direction.  They know that the Supreme Consciousness is the goal, but they don&#146;t have real direction.  It is said that spiritual practice should not be performed by studying from books.  For it, a preceptor is essential.  If a person starts doing spiritual practice by reading a book or hearing from another, that too is dangeous because in that case a clear conception about the goal is not formed.  Hence one does not know where one is going.  The boat is sailing but the sailor does not know where the boat is going.  In the long run the sailor will become exhausted and have some accident.<!-- /block --></p>

One who rejects the waves of this ocean, can never be successful. However big an ego one has, one day that ego will be shattered, as big rocks are churned to dust.  If one wants to move on the path of the Supreme, one will have to dive into the ocean of the Supreme Consciousness.  During this movement one will enjoy the sweet beauty of the Divine Play.  Those who move towards the Supreme, their vital energy and their mind will flow in the same rhythm as the Cosmic Wave.

The nature of human beings is to think of the so-called &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; memories of the past; one thinks more of the past and less of the future.  But spiritual aspirants think of the Lord Who is their goal.  When they start thinking of the endpoint of life, the very goal of life, the Supreme Consciousness, then the past with all its glory becomes pale.  The ordinary person is one who thinks of the past and also of the future.  Higher than that is the one who thinks only of the future.  But the perfect person is the one who thinks neither of the past nor of the future.  S/he thinks only of the Supreme Consciousness &ndash; the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>

It is possible that they may get some supernatural power, yet they cannot attain the Supreme Consciousness in that way.  While sitting in meditation, if they think that the occult forces should come to them, they are simply whiling away their valuable time for nothing.  A devoted spiritual aspirant never aspires for these things.  Even if the Supreme should come to someone and say, &ldquo;My child, take these celestial forces,&rdquo; that person replies, &ldquo;Supreme Lord, keep these forces with Yourself.  I don&#146;t need them.  I want You, and You alone.  I am restless for You and not for Your forces.&rdquo;  A mother tries to coax and cajole her crying son and offers him some toys to divert his attention.  The child stops crying and forgets his mother for the time being.  But if he persists in his effort to cling to the breast of his mother and continues crying, &ldquo;No, Mummy, I want to be on your lap.  I will not take those toys,&rdquo; finally the mother finds no other way than picking up the child and holding him to her breast.  A devoted spiritual aspirant is like this latter child.  S/he will say, &ldquo;My most lovely Father, this world that I see all around is a plethora of toys.  They are ephemeral and will not remain for ever.  Tell me, my Lord, are You giving these to me for all the time to come?&rdquo; And then the Lord will be answerless, for He never gives these things for ever.

The sum total of all creations is the Cosmic Order (Brahma&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a).  This includes the sun as well as the small ant which crawls on the earth.  Whether it is a dead star or a living star, whether it is a nebula or a milky way or a galaxy &ndash; all belong to one universal family.  The Milky Way is vast from one end to the other; an ant is a very small creature, but the role of both of them in maintaining the balance of the universe is equal.  If one ant meets a premature death, it will disturb the balance of the entire cosmos.  Therefore, nothing here is unimportant, not even an ant.  Suppose, an ant is sitting on the edge of a rock and it moves even one inch from east to west, and this disturbs the balance of the rock, it may cause a big earthquake &ndash; because after all, the ant is also His original creation.<!-- /block --></p>

We see their bodies only in the form of fossils.  Every age had its own flora and fauna and it disappeared with them.  Every tree and every creature of every age and stratum is His creation.  None is unimportant.  What is happening in the universe is the gradual death of one created being and the gradual emergence of another. Therefore, whatever will come, it will only be God coming in that form.  No one is insignificant, no one is small, no one is low. Suppose there is a drunkard, a fallen man.  You have no right to hate him.  You talk with him, persuade him &ndash; if necessary scold him for his regression.  All these efforts are alright, but you have no right to hate him.  Hating is not a courageous quality or a creditable tendency.  When every being is His own creation, how can you hate anyone?  How is it possible that you meditate upon one form of the Lord and abuse another?<!-- /block --></p>

There is no special importance to a mammoth because it has a big body.  The amount of care that He devotes to an ant is the same which He devotes to the entire cosmos &ndash; not less, not more.  The entire universe, consisting of all the realms, is so complex and vast, yet it does not require any more headache to God than a white ant.  Behind every created being there is a flow of energy from God&#8230; So a mammoth cannot move without His Grace, and a blade of grass also cannot move without His approval.  Nobody is unimportant, nobody is insignificant.  Each and every existence is valuable.  So you must not develop the psychology of helplessness or hopelessness, defeatist complex or fear complex, because the Supreme Father is always with you.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="158"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=158 type=paragraph -->Devotion means longing for the Supreme.  Now the question arises, is devotion natural or unnatural for living beings?  All the conscious or crude things we see in the manifested universe bear attraction for one another, and as a consequence, the continuity of the thought-projection of the Cosmic Mind is maintained.  It is on account of the mutual attraction of myriads of heavenly bodies oscillating in the infinite space that balance is maintained in the firmament.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="159"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=159 type=paragraph -->In this attraction, there is effort for self-preservation.  The bee flies around and around flowers in quest of honey, just for the sake of preserving its existence.  It can be seen that every entity runs toward that abode which is more lasting and secure and which can provide it greater and longer safety.  People run after money for the only reason that they believe they can maintain their lives under the shelter of money; that is to say, money alone can save them.  But they do not know that money can provide them neither permanent stability nor a securely-founded shelter.  Even during the span of their lives, money will come and go several times.  At times its glamour will dazzle their eyes, and sometimes it will make them cry, hunger-stricken.  Not to speak of money alone, all finite objects have this characteristic.  What is not infinite cannot permanently remain the object of your enjoyment.  It cannot be your permanent resort, since the existence of all these finite objects is dependent on others, bounded by the limits of time, place and person.  If the terrific speed with which the extroverted person runs after finite objects is introverted towards the Supreme Being of his or her life, s/he can attain the Supreme Consciousness, can achieve the Supreme State.<!-- /block --></p>

But if wise people take every object of the world as the expression of the one and single Cosmic Consciousness, then on seeing the changes in the name and form of any particular object, they will not be affected by pain or pleasure.

Then their minds will be converted into Cosmic Mind, and whatever actions they perform will be correct actions.  Therefore, those who are wise will try to merge their minds into the Supreme Mind.  That alone will be the symbol of their wisdom.  When one is not sufficiently advanced one feels to perform actions with one&#146;s own intellect; but when one is much advanced one begins thinking that one&#146;s intellect is not sufficient for the performance of any action.  This is the law of the world: that those who possess sufficient intellect say that they have none, but those who have none boast that they have a great deal.

<a name="262"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=262 type=paragraph -->1) Lack of discrimination: When people are blinded by the desire for wordly objects and lose their discrimination, they forget the infinite and start busying themselves with the limited world.

This greediness, this narrowness, this confusion of taking pain for pleasure, is nothing but the play of ignorance.  For example, a dog takes a bone and chews on it.

If the eyes of a dead man look at an elephant, still he will not see, because the action of seeing has not been witnessed by the Soul.

<a name="270"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=270 type=paragraph -->Struggle and war are not synonymous.  While war springs from hatred, struggle is a part and parcel of life.  War blackens everything; it darkens the future.  Let life be bright both individually and collectively.  Let us fight these divisive tendencies which want to make our life dark.  Light is beautiful because it is luminous.  When there was no creation, there was only one colour &ndash; black.  Lack of life is black.  After creation we see this beautiful play of colours.  Why shall we be lost in darkness?  All human beings want light.  One individual human is more luminous and more throbbing than that universal darkness. So human beings should always be optimistic.  The cimmerian darkness cannot retard your progress, cannot cover the light of the human heart.  The spirit of your heart must move on and on against obstacles.  Kick away your obstacles like pebbles from your feet &ndash; you are stronger than your obstacles.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="289"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=289 type=paragraph -->The meaning of spiritual practice is to look upon every human being, every object of this universe as one integral entity.  To jeopardize the unity of the human race by creating factions is not the purpose of spirituality (dharma).  Those who encourage vested interests survive on the mental weakness of humanity and its dissensions, and that is why they become afraid at the wide spread of the ideals of spirituality and oppose it by all immoral means, such as abuse, wrong propaganda and falsehood.  Humanity must not be cowed down by this; it has to march ahead.  It is to be borne in mind that hindrances are numerous in the path of righteousness and to continue the fight against them is spiritual practice.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="299"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=299 type=paragraph -->Prayer is also a mockery of the Ultimate Being or God.  Prayer is a solemn petition addressed to the Supreme Being for certain benefits.  On rational thinking, does not one&#146;s attempt to rouse the wish of God to fulfil one&#146;s needs appear to be a reminder to God to give one something which God had deprived one of?  This, in fact, casts aspersion on Him and His law and His sense of distribution of His gifts and blessings.  It is an insinuation, asking Him to reverse His law, to stop the process of reaction to one&#146;s action, which must have kept one deprived of what one now wants.  God&#146;s law is unchangeable and praying to Him to change it, is a waste of one&#146;s time.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="301"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=301 type=paragraph -->Devotion to God falls in a different category altogether.  It is contemplation of the omnipresent Cosmic Consciousness, and helps the devotee in the attainment of liberation from bondage and merger with the Ultimate Reality.  The purpose of devotion is to condition the mind to think that it is subtle and not crude, that it is a reflection of the Cosmic Consciousness.  Those who have read psychoanalysis and understand the efficacy of auto-suggestion will appreciate the inner motivation and efficacy of contemplation.  The true devotees do not flatter the Supreme Being; they do not ask for any favours.  The devotees&#146; tendency is merely to remind their minds of the ultimate goal so that their whole body, mind and soul strive for emancipation from the degrading influences which surround them.<!-- /block --></p>

God granted the prayer and he was killed at sunset!  Do not be foolish like this.

You must not think that you are a sinner, that you are a degraded person.  If you think that you are a sinner, it means you are meditating on sin.  And when sin becomes the object of your meditation, actually you will become a sinner, because a person becomes just like one&#146;s object of ideation, object of meditation.  If you always meditate on sin, &ldquo;I am a sinner&#8230; I am a sinner&#8230;&rdquo; actually you will become a sinner.

Suppose He hates you &ndash; if He says, &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; then you will challenge Him, &ldquo;O Supreme Consciousness, You are everywhere and You order me to get out - where will I go?  Everything is within You, and when You say get out, where am I to go?  So either You change Your name or withdraw Your order&rdquo;.

Dogma is an idea with a rigid boundary line, which won&#146;t allow you to go beyond the periphery of that boundary line.  Thus dogma goes against the fundamental spirit of the human mind.

Now, although there has been intellectual progress, there is a crisis of civilization.  Why?  Because human existence has been endangered by dogmas.  Humans want unbarred psychic progress, intellectual progress, without obstacles.  But certain dogmas are trying to devour them.  Communism is one such dogma.
