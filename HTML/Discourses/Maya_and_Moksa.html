<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject of discourse is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Moks&#x301;a. While speaking of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a stresses the role of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; as being subordinate to Him, of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; being subservient to Ishvara. Only those who surrender themselves to His protection and guidance can overcome its bounds. Just as northbound travellers have to keep the pole star before their eyes, the passenger on the path of liberation from Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; will have to keep the Lord as his or her goal. No other physical or mental compass is potent enough to guide one&#146;s progress on this path, the path of Dharma. That is why it is said that there is only one Dharma &ndash; the way towards the Absolute.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;? When Parama Purus&#x301;a (Cognitive Principle) desires to create something, the Shakti (force) required is known as Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. As such, one of the important characteristics of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is its plasticity. It is equally clear that since Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is the force behind creation, if the Cognitive Principle had not desired to create anything, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; would have had no manifestation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is it that made Him create and thus make the manifestation of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; possible? The traditionally upheld cause and effect theory cannot answer this question, for the theory works and holds good only in the expressed world (i.e., the universe after it has been created). Thus once the seed and the tree are there as a part of the expressed world, the cause and effect theory recognizes the seed as the cause and the tree as the effect. But why was the seed or the tree originally created is a problem beyond its scope. Thus the cause and effect theory does not go beyond the expressed world. Now action which is beyond cause and effect is Liila&#x301;. To differentiate further, action which is governed by the cause and effect theory is known as Krd&#x301;a. All His creation is Liila&#x301;. Hence the manifestation of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; in the expressed world too is His Liila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Jiivas<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; influences the Jiiva in a number of ways. In His creation of the world, it is not the Citi Shakti that works. Instead, when ordered by Him, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is the force which works. Here it is known as Visn&#x301;u ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When human beings experience His attraction from Antahkarana the feeling that something is to be done is generated in them. This is also done by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and here it is known as Yogama&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Apart from these forms, Maya&#x301; works in the Jiiva in two other forms &ndash; as Vishva ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and as An&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301;. The fundamental stuff or matter used in His creation is Himself. In this process of creation, the Cognitive Principle crudifies Himself into this expressed world with the use of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301;. But the essential element, the fundamental stuff is He. However, the Jiiva does not have the capacity to see Him in this creation. A person sees a pot as a pot, a forest as a forest and so on. This is the work of Vishvama&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The sum of manifested Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; in the universe is known as Ma&#x301;ha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Now, it is observed that individuals can create the same things in their minds which are expressed outside and are seen in this expressed world. They can create a whole world in their minds, according to their fancy, and can enjoy pain or pleasure from it. Such vicarious living is found especially in persons of advanced age. This is the work of An&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->It must never be overlooked however that despite its various forms, it is His Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and that He is the Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;dhis&#x301;ha. Therefore, if the individual starts a fight against Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, he or she cannot succeed. This is amply confirmed by the fact that you cannot effectively indulge in the suppression or repression of a certain Bha&#x301;va for long, ultimately it overpowers you, because the more you try to suppress it the greater becomes the force with which it rebounds. If crude ideas come into your mind, you are not crude or bad &ndash; it is natural for them to come. But mental or psychic suppression or repression of these is not profitable for Sa&#x301;dhakas. Instead the correct and psychological approach to Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is to channelize it in the direction of the Absolute. For in this expressed world, you cannot overpower Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; because she has a much greater power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The central problem of reconciling the earthly duties of human beings with their progress towards the absolute thus crops up. The answer lies in the fact that this world is a relative truth. Human beings should not become slaves to it but should use it properly. However, as mind is engaged in it while using it, one may tend to crudify both in the mind and hence, in the body. This would hamper movement towards the Absolute which is the subtlest entity. The way out is to bring in the ideation of the Absolute. In other words, you should realize that while living in the expressed crude world, you do not work for the worldly things but for Him and with Him, because He is the essential element, the fundamental stuff out of which this world has been created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and the Absolute<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->On the other hand, those who run away from this material world to escape Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; only deceive themselves. For with the help of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, they will be led to Him, as Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has a close relation with the Absolute. What is this relation?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has three gun&#x301;as &ndash; operative principles through which it works &ndash; viz., Sattvagun&#x301;a (sentient principle), Rajogun&#x301;a (mutative principle) and Tamogun&#x301;a (static principle). They work and lie in an ascending order on the road to the Absolute. The sentient principle (Sattvagun&#x301;a) has the capacity to take the sa&#x301;dhaka very near Him (Nira&#x301;ka&#x301;ra Brahma) by making the mind more and more subtle. But there still lies a gap between this point and Nira&#x301;ka&#x301;ra Brahma. This gap is known as Bha&#x301;va or Bha&#x301;vasa&#x301;gar. This gap can only be negotiated with the help of devotion. Thus we see that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, channelized properly (in its sentient operating principle) can take the Sa&#x301;dhaka to a point very near Ishvara, from which point the domain of devotion begins. An interesting illustration is afforded by the following story. Three thieves, Mr. Sattvagun&#x301;a, Mr. Rajogun&#x301;a and Mr. Tamagun&#x301;a once waylaid a man with some money in a dark forest. Though all agreed to pocket the money, Mr. Tamogun&#x301;a also desired to murder the man. The other two, however, would not agree to this. Mr. Rajogun&#x301;a declared that the man be left alone to fend for himself in the dark. Mr. Sattvagun&#x301;a was more charitable. He led the unfortunate man all the way to the outskirts of the city. But after a point on the road he bade farewell and would not go into the lighted street for fear of being caught by the police. Therefore we arrive at the paradox that Mukti (i.e. freedom from the bondage of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;) can be achieved not by a fight against Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, but rather through its help.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Different kinds of Sa&#x301;dhakas inhabit this world. Some ardently desire Mukti, while others do not. The latter base their choice on the reasoning that by becoming one with Iishvara, the Sa&#x301;dhaka loses the pleasure of being next to Him and harbouring Him as one&#146;s sole bha&#x301;va in work, service and sacrifice. Little do they know that this very ideation of the Cosmic world leads them to Mukti, for their minds have Him as their object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The best and highest Sa&#x301;dhaka and Bhakta, however, surrenders the decision on this question to Ishvara. The ideation that he or she embraces is: &ldquo;I am at your disposal. It is up to you to plan what you like for me&rdquo;. Theirs is the wisdom to foresee that complete surrender alone, which is the essence of the highest Bhakti, will enable them to sail the Bha&#x301;vasagar unto His feet.<!-- /block --></p>
