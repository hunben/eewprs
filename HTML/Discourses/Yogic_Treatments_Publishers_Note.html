<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->We are happy to publish the Fourth Edition of <i>Yogic Treatments and Natural Remedies</i> in the interest of our esteemed readers. In this edition the book has been thoroughly compared with the original Bengali book and a good number of mistakes have been rectified. Some lines which were missing in previous editions have been added. Also some additional footnotes have been included which will certainly help the readers. Certain scientific names of the herbs have been corrected in this edition. Most importantly, colour and black-and-white pictures of different herbal plants have been provided for the first time in this book in order to help the readers to recognize the plants properly. In all, we expect that this book will now be more useful to our esteemed readers.<!-- /block --></p>
