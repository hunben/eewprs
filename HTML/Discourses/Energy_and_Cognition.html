<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Fundamentally, energy is &ldquo;one&rdquo;, but it has got several expressions. The so-called energies are interchangeable. Electrical energy may be converted into magnetic energy, magnetic energy into sound and sound into light. In common (laokika) Sam&#x301;skrta the term for light is &ldquo;agni&rdquo; and in older Sam&#x301;skrta the term is &ldquo;indra&rdquo;. In this universe Parama Purus&#x301;a started His creation and the creation stemmed out of the acoustic root &ldquo;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Energy was also created. Here energy does not mean the Operative Principle. The Operative Principle is a binding faculty only and the style of functioning of the binding faculty is called &ldquo;svabha&#x301;va&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;nature&rdquo; in English. Some people who do not have sufficient knowledge &ndash; deep knowledge of science &ndash; may say that it is all natural. But the fact is that nature is simply the style of the Operative Principle, not an independent entity. When the Operative Principle works according to a particular style, that is, as per nature, the stamina that each and every phase gets is from energy. The acoustic root of energy is &ldquo;ra&rdquo;. This shows that energy is also a sort of creation &ndash; it is also created by the Cosmic Cognitive Faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, that day I told you that whatever there is in the universe is supported by three fundamental sounds. Every thing comes from the Cosmic bliss, that is, the composure of bliss. In this composure, the balance amongst the sentient, the mutative and the static principle is maintained. When that balance gets upset the flow comes out from one of the vertices of the triangle of the forces. So certainly that force which comes out from one of the vertices is coming out from the sentient principle; that is coming out from the phase of the composure of bliss. So everything starts with the sound &ldquo;sa&rdquo; and after starting its journey from the vertex, it has to move forward and for moving forward it requires energy. It must be supported by energy. So first coming out from the sentient principle &ldquo;sa&rdquo; and it moves ahead with energy that is, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; the acoustic root of energy. And as soon as it starts movement, it acquires certain wonts, certain characteristics. The acoustic root for wonts for characteristics is &ldquo;va&rdquo;. So &ldquo;sa-ra-va&rdquo; or &ldquo;sarva&rdquo;. Everything in this universe is known as &ldquo;sarva&rdquo;. Therefore everything in this universe is known as sarva in Sam&#x301;skrta. &ldquo;Sarva ucyate&rdquo;. Because of the presence of sarva in every entity, every entity is also known as sarva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->From this sarva, the Hindi term &ldquo;sab&rdquo; and the Maithili term &ldquo;sabh&rdquo; have come but the root is &ldquo;sarva&rdquo;. Everything in this universe must have the support of &ldquo;agni&rdquo;, that is, energy or &ldquo;ra&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Agniryathaeko bhubanam&#x301; pravis&#x301;t&#x301;o<br>Ru&#x301;pam&#x301; ru&#x301;pam&#x301; pratiru&#x301;po babhu&#x301;va<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhu&rdquo; means &ldquo;bhuvana&rdquo;. And bhuvana means an expression which comes out with the help of those quinquelemental factors. That &ldquo;bhu&rdquo; is the recognized name of the universe in Sam&#x301;skrit. Bhu&#x301;, bhu&#x301;mi, dharitrii, sarvam&#x301;saha&#x301;, prithivii, medinii, mahii, vasumatii, and prthivii. These are the recognized names of earth in Sam&#x301;skrta. The energy remains and maintains the structural solidarity of each and every entity of this universe by taking the form of its container according to the structural solidarity of the different entities. The same energy is operating through this ceiling fan or through the bulb or other expression but do we ever see or feel it? No body can ever see any energy and no body can directly feel the presence of any energy but every body feels the presence of energy through its operation. Because of this function of the fan, we come to know that there is energy behind it. We get the light from the bulb but we never see the energy. Energy is never seen or perceived but its effects are seen, perceived or felt.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->We see the effect of energy functioning through different media but energy itself remains unseen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Ekastatha&#x301; sarvabhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ntara&#x301;tma&#x301;<br>Ru&#x301;pam&#x301; ru&#x301;pam&#x301; pratiru&#x301;po bahishca.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Similarly the same Cognitive Principle &ndash; that cognition, is also just like energy. There is vital energy in your body, that is why you can speak, you can move or you can think. When there shall be no expressions from your corporal structure, others will say that the man is dead and gone. Similarly the same Cognitive Faculty functioning through different entities of this universe works as the subjective counterpart of their existences. And because of this subjective expression of the Cognitive Faculty, people can perceive and conceive its existence. The existence of God is conceived but can not be perceived and can not be expressed. We see only its expressions. Similarly, we see and feel the expressions of the Cognitive Faculty. A&#x301;tma&#x301; is not seen or perceived or conceived personally or collectively.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This Cognitive Faculty is present not only in each and every figure but without a container also. It is not only all-pervading but it is also all-covering. That is why it is also all-covering. That is why it is known as Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u.<!-- /block --></p>
