<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s discourse will be in Hindi. Now I am giving a short outline in English. The short discourse will be on the omniscience of the Causal Matrix or &ldquo;Citi-Shakti&rdquo;. You know, this omniscience is one of the occult qualities, occult roots. What is occult? Occult power or occult root means that power which a spiritual aspirant acquires by strictly adhering to the principles of cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now let us see why there is omniscience in the Supreme Entity and what are its advantages and disadvantages. The noumenal cause of the creation is not two but one. In philosophy it is called &ldquo;Citi-Shakti&rdquo;. The practical qualities operate or function so long as the Citi-Shakti directs them. &ldquo;A&#x301;brahmastamba&rdquo;. &ldquo;Brahma&#x301;&rdquo; means &ldquo;Creator&rdquo; and &ldquo;stambha&rdquo; means &ldquo;a blade of grass&rdquo;. In other words, whatever there is in this universe will work and function so long as there is Citi Shakti. If Citi Shakti is not there, no work will be done. The reason is that the creative power which is expressed in the form of nature is basically a blind power. Unless Citi Shakti guides it, nothing can happen. Take electric power, for instance. This is a blind power. So long as people&#146;s Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; (Citi Shakti) does not work behind it, nothing can happen. Thus, what we call energy in the crude world is known as kriya&#x301; shakti in Hindi. This energy cannot do anything until it gets the approval of the Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;. In the same way, until the subtler power, the ectoplasmic flow that pervades the supramundane sphere, gets the approval of Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;, no progress is possible. We observe that whatever happens in the supramundane sphere follows a system of laws. And it can function according to this system only when Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; is behind it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Khan&#x301;d&#x301;a vika&#x301;sha&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;A&#x301;brahmastamba&rdquo; moves, remains fixed, and is destroyed in accordance with special rules. These rules operate in both the Sa&#x301;magrika and Vaeyaktika spheres. Things, take place in accordance with these rules, and will continue to take place according to these rules. When the Supreme Power (Vira&#x301;t&#x301; Satta&#x301;) keeps Himself in touch with this universe, it is His prota yoga, and when He lives with the universe in Vaeyaktika form, it is called ota-yoga. From this we get the word &ldquo;ota-prota&rdquo;. Thus, from the starting-point of creation to the culminating point, every step has the support and approval of Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;, which means Citi-Shakti. Thus, whether the power is small or big, and whatever it does, the witnessing association of Citi-Shakti remains with it. Therefore, no-one can do anything without the knowledge of the Supreme Entity. And He also knows who is going to do what. That is why it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a evedam&#x301; sarvam&#x301; yadbhu&#x301;tam&#x301; yacca bhavyam;<br>Uta&#x301;mrtatvasyesha&#x301;no yadannena&#x301;tirohati.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->For living beings, omniscience (evedam&#x301;) is certainly a recognized occult power. That is right. But for the Supreme Entity it is not a recognized occult power; He does not get it as a result of cult. So, what is His omniscience? &ldquo;Tatra niratishayam&#x301; sarvajin&#x32D;a biijam&#x301;.&rdquo; The reply is that it is His nature. To know everything is His nature. That is why He is omniscient. Who is this Purus&#x301;a evedam sarvam&#x301;? He knows everything. What is the meaning of &ldquo;sarvam&#x301;&rdquo;? You know, where the kriya&#x301; is complete, whatever power it may have or whatever it may be, whether crude, worldly or psychic, whether actional or emotional it has an acoustic root. In sam&#x301;skrta it is called biija mantra. You move and the movement causes a sound. You eat and your eating makes a sound. The sound of the movement is the acoustic root. The sound of eating is an acoustic root. Thus an acoustic root is all-pervasive or omnipresent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The principles of Prakrti are known by the names of sattva gun&#x301;a, raja guna and tamo gun&#x301;a. The sattva gun&#x301;a has also originated from Parama Purus&#x301;a. It is said that Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are two. But where Brahma is considered as one power, or one sattva&#x301;, there it (Prakrti) comes within &ldquo;sa&rdquo;. The biija mantra of sattva gun&#x301;a is &ldquo;sa&rdquo;. Thus everything in this world originated from sattva gun&#x301;a. At the beginning of everything is dental sa. And everything is moved or influenced by energy (kriya&#x301; shakti), whose biija mantra is &ldquo;ra&rdquo;. Every object or thing has special qualifications or characteristics. And this is dharma. Every object has its dharma. The dharma of agni (fire) is to burn. The biija mantra of dharma is &ldquo;va&rdquo;. Therefore, &ldquo;sa&rdquo; means &ldquo;origination from sattva gun&#x301;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; means &ldquo;moved by energy&rdquo;, and &ldquo;va&rdquo; means &ldquo;dharma&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sa&rdquo;, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; and &ldquo;va&rdquo; are in every entity. Therefore, &ldquo;Sarva&#x301;t sarva ucyate&rdquo;. Every object or entity is moved by these biija mantras. Therefore &ldquo;sarva&rdquo; means &ldquo;every object&rdquo;, &ldquo;all objects&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a, who is in every object and is in fact, the Causal Matrix, knows all things. By the application of ota and prota yoga He is with everything. If Parama Purus&#x301;a had not existed the world would not have existed. He also has another name, &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;that from which the existence is known&rdquo;, &ldquo;without whose existence we will not exist&rdquo;. He is called &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rdquo; &ldquo;Krs&rdquo; + &ldquo;n&#x301;a&rdquo; = Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; means &ldquo;the power on whom our existence is relative&rdquo;. Therefore, &ldquo;Purus&#x301;a evedam&#x301; sarvam&#x301; yadbhu&#x301;tam yacca bhavyam&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhu&#x301;tam&rdquo; means &ldquo;that which is past&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bhavyam&rdquo; means &ldquo;that which is going to take place&rdquo;. You will notice that the sloka does not mention the present. The reason is that there is nothing like present in the universe. I am speaking and you are listening. This is correct. What I am speaking is future for you. And what you are hearing &ndash; the sound &ndash; is past for me. But when people make some adjustment between past and future, to that extent future is known as present. Present is not a permanent entity, it is a tide. It means that whatever has happened, or is going to happen, is all known to Parama Purus&#x301;a. He knows every entity. No entity is hidden from Him. He knows everything about both sa&#x301;dhus and asa&#x301;dhus. He knows what good and bad deeds one has done.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a evedam&#x301; sarvam&#x301; yadbhu&#x301;tam&#x301; yacca bhavyam;<br>Uta&#x301;mrtatvasyesha&#x301;no yadannena&#x301;tirohati.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->We should not forget that He is master of both heaven and hell. If there is a place like hell, Parama Purus&#x301;a is there because He is omnipresent. If He does not live in hell, He is not an omnipresent entity. If a sinner (pa&#x301;pii) goes to hell Parama Purus&#x301;a is also there. Therefore the so-called sinner should not be afraid of anything and should not worry. When he or she goes to hell, Parama Purus&#x301;a will also be there with him or her.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The second meaning of Parama Purus&#x301;a; that, He is the father of only sa&#x301;dhus, is not correct. He is the Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; of sa&#x301;dhus and also of wicked pa&#x301;piis. A pa&#x301;pii should not think that Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; is not with him or her. He is the one who lives with every entity, who knows everything. He has to live with every entity. He cannot hate anyone. If He hates how can He live with every entity?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Therefore you have to keep in mind that Parama Purus&#x301;a is omniscient, and that is why there is both a disadvantage and an advantage. The disadvantage is that you cannot, under any circumstances, do things in secrecy. He will know everything and therefore, you will have to be careful when you do anything. He will see everything and then punish you if you have done anything wrong. The advantage is that, under no circumstances are you alone. Do not fear any power because Parama Purus&#x301;a is with you. You are not weak. This is the biggest advantage. Thus, because of the omniscience of Parama Purus&#x301;a, there are both advantages and disadvantages. There is a little disadvantage but greater are the advantages. Victory to you.<!-- /block --></p>
