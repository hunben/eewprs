<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->To communicate ideas through gesture and posture is called &ldquo;<I>mudra&#x301;</I>&rdquo;. In the East, we find that dance is dominated by <I>mudra&#x301;</I>, and in the West, we find that it is dominated by rhythm. Indian folk dance and classical dance are also <I>mudra&#x301;</I>-dominant. <I>Mudra&#x301;</I> is more subtle than rhythm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is <I>sam&#x301;giita</I> or music? Singing, the playing of instruments and dancing are together called &ldquo;<I>sam&#x301;giita</I>&rdquo;. Where there is only singing and the playing of instruments but no dance, it is called &ldquo;<I>giita</I>&rdquo;. In the time of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata, what Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said was called &ldquo;Giita&#x301;&rdquo; because He only told it, He did not dance. If Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had explained the nature of Dharma while dancing, then it would not have been called &ldquo;Giita&#x301;&rdquo;, it would have been called &ldquo;<I>Sam&#x301;giita</I>&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There are six primary <I>ra&#x301;gas</I> and thirty six primary <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;iis</I>. Today we find two types of dance in India. First, there is Aryavarta Nrtya or North Indian style. Secondly, there is Da&#x301;ks&#x301;ina&#x301;tya Nrtya or Carnatic or the South Indian style. Both styles were given by Lord Shiva, but credit for bringing them to the public goes to Maharshi Bharata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the Vedas there is rhythm, because most of the Vedas come from outside India. The propagators of the Veda could not go against rhythm. They had to accept rhythm but not grammar. For this reason, there are many grammatical mistakes in the Vedas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In Tantra, <I>mudra&#x301;</I> is dominant. Rhythm is guided by <I>mudra&#x301;</I>. In a few places, the Vedas also use <I>mudra&#x301;</I>. For example, in <I>shra&#x301;ddha</I> (last rites) there is <I>pin&#x301;d&#x301;ada&#x301;n mudra&#x301;</I> which is also called &ldquo;<I>aun&#x32D;kush mudra&#x301;</I>&rdquo;. In <I>pitr yajin&#x32D;a</I>, there are also <I>mudra&#x301;s</I>, which are called <I>namah mudra&#x301;</I>, <I>abhaya mudra&#x301;</I>, <I>varada mudra&#x301;</I>, etc., are found in the Vedas. The portion of the Vedas which was made in India [like the <i>Atharvaveda</i>] is responsible for these <I>mudra&#x301;s</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Instrumental music is also based on <I>mudra&#x301;</I>. In western countries, only instruments such as the violin are based on <I>mudra&#x301;</I>. Man&#x301;ipurii dance, folk dance, <I>Cho</I> dance and <I>Ra&#x301;mva&#x301;sha</I> dance, all have a predominance of <I>mudra&#x301;</I>. <I>Ra&#x301;mva&#x301;sha</I> dance has less <I>mudra&#x301;</I> because it is a war dance. <I>Cho</I> dance<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->, which is performed after battle during times of rest in the military camp, has more <I>mudra&#x301;</I> in it. The dancer only dances, and does not sing. Another person sings and narrates in song what is taking place. In the <I>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava nrtya</I> of Lord Shiva, there is more rhythm, and in Parvatii&#146;s <I>lalita</I> dance there is the dominance of <I>mudra&#x301;</I>, sweet and refined. Both these dances make a person tired quickly in India because India is a hot country.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the word &ldquo;<I>ta&#x301;l</I>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<I>ta&#x301;</I>&rdquo; is derived from <I>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I> and &ldquo;<I>la</I>&rdquo; from <I>lalita</I>, so it has become <I>ta&#x301;l</I>. <I>Ta&#x301;l</I> is the adjustment of both, that is why it has become more popular.<!-- /block --></p>
