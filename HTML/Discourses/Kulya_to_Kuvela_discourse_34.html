<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><I>Kul + yat = kulya</I>. The meaning of the root verb <I>kul</I> is <I></I>&ldquo;to amass&rdquo;, &ldquo;to collect&rdquo;. The etymological meaning of the word <I>kulya</I> is &ldquo;that which has been collected&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which has taken shape after being amassed&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The colloquial meanings of <I>kulya</I> are: <ol> <li>One who has been born into a family which everyone regards with respect, which society recognizes as a good family. Here there is no connection being made with high family status <I></I>(<I>kuliina</I>) or inferior family status (<I>shrotriya</I> or <I>maolika</I>). A good family is one that displays virtue, nobility and humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><li>The second meaning of the word <I>kulya</I> is &ldquo;that person whose parents are legally married&rdquo;. Such a person will be called <I>kulya</I> irrespective of whether or not they are born into a good family in the opinion of the people. Karna of the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> had countless virtues. However his parents were not married in accordance with the accepted rules of society; he was the illegitimate son of Kunti. Because society considered him non-<I>kulya</I>, he had to suffer much humiliation. Human society should be such that no person feels humiliated for any reason whatsoever other than for crimes that they themselves have committed. Karna was not guilty of any crime by being born. Then why should he be humiliated? It was the duty of the society to free Karna from the humiliation of illegitimacy by solemnizing the legal marriage of his mother Kunti with his anonymous father Surya (there is nothing in the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> about the genealogy of this Surya)<I></I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><li>The third meaning of the word <I>kulya</I> is to elevate the society to a higher and higher level, physically, mentally and spiritually, by selecting proper brides and bridegrooms. Nowadays different kinds of birds, animals, trees, creepers, fruits, flowers and crops are being transformed into higher breeds. Different kinds of hybrid or high-yielding crops are being produced. The milk supply is being increased by developing a better breed of cow. The result of the creation of more developed species is called <I>kulya</I>. High-yielding rice can easily be called <I>kulya</I> rice. A milk cow that produces a greater quantity of milk can be called a <I>kulya</I> cow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li>These preceding usages of the word <I>kulya</I> apply not only to masculine and neuter gender but also on occasion to feminine gender as well. The meaning of the word <I>kulya</I> when used exclusively in masculine gender (<I>kulya</I> is declined like the word <I>nara</I>) is &ldquo;well-wisher&rdquo;. You certainly consider someone or another to be your well-wisher. You share with them your pain and suffering and problems when you are in trouble or danger. You feel sure that after listening to you your well-wisher will do whatever is necessary for your good. That person is a <I>kulya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><li>Whether there is any person who is <I>kulya</I> in the worldly sense or not, the Supreme Father is the well-wisher of everyone. So one meaning of <I>kulya</I> is <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><li>When in trouble or in danger, if a person wants to take the help of the law then he or she has to consult a lawyer, and in such cases he or she has to move according to the lawyer&#146;s advice. So a proper word for &ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; is also <I>kulya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><li>If we use the word <I>kulya</I> in feminine gender, that is, if we say <I>kulya&#x301;</I> (declined like the word <I>lata&#x301;</I>), then one of its meanings is the tributary of a large river that ultimately rejoins that river. If a small river joins a large river then we call that small river a &ldquo;tributary&rdquo;, and if a small river emerges from a large river then we call the small river a &ldquo;branch&rdquo; of the main river. If a river is the branch of a large river, and a little later turns into a tributary of that same river, then it is called <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. For instance, the River Ba&#x301;da&#x301;i emerges from the Damodara and later rejoins the Damodara, so its name is Ba&#x301;da&#x301;i Kulya&#x301;<I></I>. The Ka&#x301;na&#x301; River and the Ka&#x301;na&#x301; Damodara come out of the Damodara and then rejoin it, so they are also <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. The River Kalindii, after emerging from the Mahananda, rejoins the Mahananda, so the Kalindii also is <I>kulya&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><li>You have noticed how sometimes the waters of the rainy season create potholes even in highways. It becomes difficult to negotiate those roads for quite some time after the rainy season. This pothole on the highway, created by the rain, is also called <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. Feel free to use the word <I>kulya&#x301;</I> in this sense.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><li>You know that the ways and means of navigable canals are different than those of irrigation canals. Navigable canals generally connect one flowing body of water with another flowing body of water. So a navigable canal must not only have sufficient depth, it must also have some current. Otherwise different kinds of aquatic plants, weeds and algae will adversely affect the main flow. This navigable canal is also called <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. Bear in mind that while the word <I>kha&#x301;la</I> (canal) appears to be of either native Bengali or foreign origin, actually this is not the case. <I>Kha&#x301;la</I> is a Sanskrit derivative. In Persian, Urdu and Hindustani <I>kha&#x301;la</I> means &ldquo;hide&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><li>An irrigation canal is not meant for navigation and it does not always have water. When necessary, water is released through sluice gates. Small irrigation canals are in most cases blind canals, that is, their onward flow halts after some forward progress. This irrigation canal is also called <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. To distinguish clearly navigable canals from irrigation canals, they can be called <I>nao-kulya&#x301;</I> and <I>seca-kulya&#x301;</I> respectively<I></I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><p>You know that there is a place and a railway station near Krishnanagar in Nadia District by the name Ba&#x301;dkulya&#x301;. The word is derived from <I>baddhakulya&#x301;</I>, that is, <I></I>once there was a <I>kulya&#x301;</I> there but later, when its mouth became choked, it became a blocked canal (<I>baddhakulya&#x301;</I>). <I>Ba&#x301;dhkulya&#x301;</I> is a corruption of <I>baddhakulya&#x301;. Dha</I> is an aspirate, so using its non-aspirate, the word Ba&#x301;dkulya&#x301; <I></I>can function as a Sanskrit derivative, but it cannot be spelled with <I>lla&#x301;</I> [it will be <I>lya&#x301;</I> as in Ba&#x301;dkulya].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><li>When the bed of a river or any other body of water is higher than the adjoining land, then the water of that river or body of water can flow out at any time with great force and flood the adjoining area. In such a situation, the bed of this body of water has to be dug with a dredger or something else, that is, it has to be made deeper by removing the sand and silt, or else a high embankment has to be built on its bank so that the water can never flood the adjoining land. The embankment that is built to check the flow of high rising water is called a &ldquo;dyke&rdquo; in English and certain other European languages. We may call it a <I>stara-ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dh</I> in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><p>In certain places the bed of the Damodara has already become higher than the basin of Burdwan district, and in certain places it is becoming higher. In this situation, if there is a large outflow of water from the Damodara at some point, then undoubtedly the districts of Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah will be flooded. In this situation an effective measure would be to remove sand and silt from the bed of the Damodara with a dredger and thereby make the river basin much deeper than the adjacent land. If this is not done in order to avoid the expense, then a high embankment must be raised alongside the Damodara. This is not only to save the left bank of the Damodara but also for the safety of the right bank. Otherwise floods may occur at any time in those parts of the districts of Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah which are situated on the right bank of the Damodara, especially in the subdivision of Arambagha. This special type of dam on the bank of the Damodara is also a dyke.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><p>In Holland, it is difficult to save the country from ocean flooding by deepening the ocean, so there is no choice but to construct high dykes. Having seen those dykes personally, I have often thought that this type of dyke is also necessary in certain areas of the subdivisions of Contai and Diamond Harbour in Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><p>We can also have windmills here as they do in Holland since the ocean wave-driven wind in these coastal areas is stronger than ordinary wind. It is also possible to arrange for production of cheap electricity from those windmills, as it is from the ocean flood tide. At one time these windmills played a very important role in the industrial development of Holland. If constructed they will serve the same purpose in the districts of Midnapur and 24 Paraganas as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><p>The bed of our river Ajaya has gradually become higher owing to the deposit of silt. The proportion of sand in the soil has greatly increased in certain areas in the Ajaya River basin in southern Birbhum. However, it is still possible to cultivate sandy soil crops such as winter bulbous crops and sugar cane. If there is any further delay then that opportunity may cease to exist. In that case arable land would have to be cut out by using machinery to remove the surface sand. Although that situation has not yet arisen in the southern portion of the Ajaya River in Burdwan District, its bed is higher than its own tributary, the Kunur. As a result, instead of the water of the Kunur entering the Ajaya (this entry is natural), sometimes the water of the Ajaya enters the Kunur. This is not a desirable state of affairs. This problem cannot be solved only with dykes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><p>In addition to what we understand by <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dh</I> or embankment, the word is also used in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali in the sense of a large reservoir. The terrain in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, especially western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, is uneven. Rainfall is also scarce, although the land is very good for the cultivation of pre-winter rice. But other crops do not grow well. However those areas where the land is a little yellowish are all suitable for the cultivation of mustard. Be that as it may, the scarcity of water is a permanent problem in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. For this reason, in ancient times the kings of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h used to provide for the excavation of large reservoirs. These reservoirs were not only deep, they were also capable of holding the water of the rainy season because they were surrounded by high banks. If there was a scarcity of water during the sowing of paddy or when the grain emerged, then the banks of the reservoir would be broken to irrigate the land and thus save the paddy. These large reservoirs are called <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dhs</I> in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali because they are dug primarily to store water for irrigation. Among these water reservoirs in Bengal are Dar&#x301;a&#x301;ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dha of Dumka, Ra&#x301;jba&#x301;n&#x32D;dha of Burdwan, Samudraba&#x301;n&#x32D;dha, Bhagaldighi and Ra&#x301;n&#x301;iba&#x301;n&#x32D;dha of Bankura, Sarashun&#x32D;ka&#x301; of Midnapur and Sa&#x301;hebba&#x301;n&#x32D;dh of Purulia. These <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dhs</I> should be called reservoirs in English, not embankments. Samudraba&#x301;n&#x32D;dha in Bankura District is perhaps the largest such reservoir in the world. A small river called the Amodara, a tributary of the Damodara, also emerges from this reservoir.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><p>In a river development project, the embankment that is constructed at the end of the hill-stage of a river submerges a vast area and a large quantity of water is dammed at that place. This system of storing water by blocking the mouth of a river is also called <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dh</I>, in English <I></I>&ldquo;dam&rdquo;. Apart from the dam, in the downstream part of the river, where the plain stage starts at the end of the hill stage, the embankment which is constructed at that spot by blocking the mouth of the river without flooding the adjoining land is called a &ldquo;barrage&rdquo;. This may be called <I>jalabandha</I> or <I>kabandha</I> in Bengali. So you understand that a <I>jalabandha</I> or <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dh</I> or dam is constructed at the upstream portion of a river and a barrage at the beginning of the plain stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><p>Generally every river has three stages: the hill stage, plain stage and delta stage. Certain rivers of the world become extremely salty when they reach the delta stage. In that case an embankment or a dyke must be built in order to save the adjoining paddy lands from the damaging effects of the salt water. Such dykes or embankments need to be erected along certain rivers of south 24 Parganas. In former times the Rasulpur River and the downstream portion of the Suvarn&#x301;arekha&#x301; in Midnapur had this problem. It should be investigated to see whether or not that problem still exists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><li>Long, naturally occurring ditches are called <I>kandara</I> in Sanskrit. The word <I>kandara</I> generally has two meanings. One is &ldquo;deep hole&rdquo; and the other is &ldquo;interior&rdquo;. <I>Kandara</I> is called <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;dara</I> or <I>ka&#x301;ndara</I> in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali. Generally, in seasons other than the rainy season they remain dry or contain little water. They fill up with the monsoon rains and the runoff from the rivers during the monsoon. Some young and small fish are found there. These <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;daras</I> mostly have only one mouth like blind canals. <I>Ka&#x301;n&#x32D;daras</I> are mostly found in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h region, especially in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h where the terrain has rolling hills. These ditches are natural creations. A proper name for <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;dara</I> is <I>kulya&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph --><li>People excavate the ground in a straight line when laying the foundation of a building. If the ground is hard, less digging is necessary. But when the ground is soft, it has to be dug a little more. So the foundation of the building is laid by placing bricks or stones in holes dug in a straight line fashion. As long as bricks and stones are not placed in these holes they are called trenches. People of different countries dig trenches to defend themselves from air attacks during a war. <I>Kulya&#x301;</I> is also a proper word for &ldquo;trench&rdquo;. <I></I><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><li>The word <I>kulya&#x301;</I> is closely linked to medicines as well; so before elaborating on this, it is necessary to say a word or two about the relationship between human beings and medicine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><p>Not only humans but many other creatures as well are more or less familiar with medicines. However, since ancient times many non-human creatures have considered fasting or deliberate abstinence from food as their natural medicine. You will notice that dogs and certain other animals abstain from eating if they feel a little ill. You also often do not feel like eating when you feel somewhat physically out of sorts. Some contemporary physicians advise their patients, and even pressure them, to eat even when they do not have any appetite. This, however, goes against the laws of nature. It is natural for a sick creature to feel an aversion for food, unless they suffer from the disease of overeating. By not eating, certain organs of the body enjoy a temporary rest. As a result, after the fast the organs are rejuvenated and reenergized and a feeling of wellbeing returns to the physical body. So not only in the case of prehistoric humans, in the case of the prehistoric animals as well, the ancient, pure and chief medicine was fasting or voluntary abstention from food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph --><p>There is a basic distinction between voluntary abstention from food and <I>upava&#x301;sa</I>. Voluntary abstention from food (<I>sveccha&#x301;-anashana</I>) means to not take food willingly in order to keeping the body healthy (<I>an + ashana = anashana</I>). <I>Ashana</I> means &ldquo;eating&rdquo;, so <I>anashana</I> means &ldquo;not eating&rdquo;. This abstention from food certainly helps to heal disease. However, imposed abstention from food does not have the same effect because forced abstention creates a suppressed agony in the mind which upsets the mental balance and at the same time also upsets the physical balance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><p><I>Upava&#x301;sa</I> is undoubtedly a kind of voluntary abstention. However, at the same time there is to some extent a withdrawal of physical activity and a gradual directing of ones mental propensities towards closer proximity with <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. <I>Upa</I> means &ldquo;near&rdquo; and <I>va&#x301;sa</I> means &ldquo;to stay&rdquo;. Thus the etymological meaning of the word <I>upava&#x301;sa</I> is &ldquo;to remain near the Lord&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph --><p>So as I was saying, <I>upava&#x301;sa</I> not only has the benefits of voluntary abstention from food. In addition, this practice is especially helpful for maintaining mental balance, that is, <I>upava&#x301;sa</I> is a medicine for both physical as well as mental maladies. There is no doubt whatsoever that a person&#146;s mental strength is reinforced if he or she observes fast in a systematic fashion. This is a truth that has stood the test of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph --><b><p>Sunlight and air</b>: There are many healing elements in sunlight. The rays or pencils of rays of different colours in sunlight are medicines for different kinds of diseases &ndash; preventive and antidotal. Sunlight has different benefits during different hours of the day. Sun-warmed water also has different kinds of benefits. Thus sunlight has been regarded since ancient times as medicines for different bodily ailments. It is also said in the Vedas: <I>su&#x301;ryah yatha&#x301; sarvalokasya caks&#x301;uh</I> [as the sun is the eye of the entire universe]. The medicine, that is, sunlight should be taken in through the dorsal spine, not through the chest or the abdomen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph --><p>The pure air (O<SUB>3</SUB>) of a secluded place is also an excellent medicine for the physical body. This medicine in the form of air should be taken through the back of the head and the upper part of the forehead. The earth from a riverside area near a forest in which there is a small amount of sand and a large amount of soil is also an excellent medicine for the physical body. This medicine should be taken bare-bodied on a bed of earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph --><b>Water</b>: Odorless, tepid water, especially if it is sun-warmed, is an excellent medicine for the physical body. It has great healing qualities. Since ancient times, knowingly or unknowingly, human beings and different animals have also accepted water as one of their medicines. It is also said in the Vedas: <I>a&#x301;pashca vishvabhes&#x301;ajii</I> [and water is a universal medicine].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><p>However the quest for medicines on the part of human beings and animals has not been limited to fasting, sunlight, water, air and earth. Initially the medicines that human beings discovered were different trees and plants and the external use of their bark and roots. The human beings of those times used to chew them and smear or rub the diseased part with them. These ointments were the first medicines discovered by human beings. When these ointments did not work externally, it became necessary to ingest them. Humans used to take them as medicine by chewing or swallowing them. This was the second step in the use of medicines in human history.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph --><p>There were many such medicines that were only available in particular seasons, not all year round. People used to gather them in the specific season and dry them so as to preserve them. In certain places they would preserve them in the form of tablets with the help of water; in other places they would just dry them normally. This preservation of medicine in the form of tablets or pills belonged to a later stage in the use of medicines in human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph --><p>Where medicines were not effective as external ointments, it became necessary to rub them on the skin or on the nerves where they could be absorbed through the pores. People discovered these rubbing medicines somewhat later. These massage or rubbing ointments were the discovery of a later stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph --><p>Where there was any poisonous effect of the rubbing ointment, there was no recourse but to use it externally. However, people learned to use them without any poisonous effect in the form of liquid medicines by dissolving them in water or other liquid solvents.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph --><p>There are certain ointments which, if ingested in small doses, have no poisonous effect, but which may have a poisonous effect if taken in large doses. Human beings learned to use them by licking them so that they could act effectively through the nerve fibres. They used to swallow those medicines after licking them with the tongue for a long time. Because the quantity is very small there is no harmful effect; rather one gets the full benefit. Such medicines are called <I>avaleha</I> [licking] in Ayurveda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph --><p>People even discovered some medicines that develop certain special beneficial qualities when mixed with other specific substances. In other words, the same medicine when mixed with substance &ldquo;a&rdquo; became a medicine for headaches, when mixed with substance &ldquo;b&rdquo; became a medicine for diarrhea, and when mixed with substance &ldquo;c&rdquo; became a medicine for respiratory ailments. In this case, people gave the name <I>anupa&#x301;na</I> [ingredient] to the substances &ldquo;a,&rdquo; &ldquo;b&rdquo; and &ldquo;c&rdquo;. That is, by discovering that the medicinal qualities varied according to the different <I>anupa&#x301;nas</I>, people began to use them as medicines.<!-- /block --></p>

In cases where the alcoholic properties of the medicines were necessary, but where the medicine would have a contrary effect if the negative effects of the alcohol were not removed, they altered their qualities rather than keep them in the form of <I>a&#x301;sava</I>.

The medicinal qualities undergo changes during the different periods of the day, so one should use medicines with that factor in mind; at least it is better if it is done so. Those medicinal herbs and plants or those medicines whose qualities are affected according to the difference in lunar day or planetary position are called <I>kulya&#x301;</I>.

Medicines used to be prepared from the livers, pancreases, etc., of different animals in the allopathic system of treatment. In recent times they have been used for insulin. Cod liver oil and shark oil are frequently used. They are used not only as oral medicines but also in injections. Medicines such as naja, cina, and apis in homeopathy are completely of animal origin. Killing an animal in order to save the life of a human being may not be a very good practice, but it can be done when there is no alternative. This is a universally accepted principle. But when medicines are prepared by killing animals, it should be done as far as possible from those animals which are the born enemies of human beings. Those who are not the born enemies of human beings but are their natural friends should not be killed.<!-- /block --></p>

People realized the value of this principle during the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> age from the poison treatment of the poisoned Bhiima. There were considerable advances in Ayurveda in poison research, especially with snake, scorpion, spider and hornet poisons. Within Ayurveda, members of the royal family of Cochin in the state of Kerala were pioneers in this. At one time there was a good deal of individual research into poison treatments. My maternal grandfather, the late Dr. U. M. Basu (allopath) conducted research into the medicinal use of scorpion poison, but he died before his research findings could be properly documented. The science of allopathy does not seem to have made much progress in these treatments, but there are endless opportunities for making progress in this respect.<!-- /block --></p>

They did not want to allow anything into their bodies through injection, so this science remained unappreciated. Nowadays it is possible to save the patient&#146;s life with injections in the case of diseases that are difficult to cure or treat, or in the case of life-threatening disease.

They turned to the other side only to smell the fragrance of the night jasmine and the fragrance of the night jasmine also drove away their pleasant slumber. They lay down on their backs and the soothing fragrance of the <I>bakula</I> flowers [<I>Mimusops elengi</I>] floated by. Sleep fled away with outspread wings to the distant sky. The fishwives were in a terrible quandary. Who could sleep in this feast of fragrance!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph --><p>The fishwives discussed among themselves. &ldquo;What a fine fix we are in. Come, let us talk to the gatekeeper again.

<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph --><p>The fishwives met the gatekeeper near the gate and made an appeal to him. &ldquo;Mr. gatekeeper, when you have been so kind to us already, why don&#146;t you allow us to bring our fish baskets inside?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;If you want to take them inside, then do so,&rdquo; the gatekeeper told them. &ldquo;But how does it look, taking a fish basket inside a flower garden!

<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph --><p>The fishwives happily brought their baskets into the garden. They lay down in the midst of the roses with their baskets under their heads, and the smell of the baskets counteracted the fragrance of the roses. The fishwives enjoyed a comfortable sleep for the whole night with their <I>a&#x301;n&#x32D;sh-cubr&#x301;i</I>s under their heads. The moral of the story is that it is difficult for a person to give up the prejudices they cherish. A person&#146;s dogma is the same type of thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of <I>kuven&#x301;ii</I> is &ldquo;fish spawn pot&rdquo;.
