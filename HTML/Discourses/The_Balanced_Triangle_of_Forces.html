<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the balanced triangle of forces, in the pre-creation stage, when the unmanifested primordial Cognition has not yet come under the influence of the unmanifested primordial forces, that is, when the principles are purely in the subjective case and in the opposite direction there is nothing objective, that Cognitive Faculty in the unmanifested balanced triangle is called Gun&#x301;amaya. Parashiva is a philosophical equivalent term. When the three forces in a state of manifestation give rise to an objective case in the opposite direction, that antithesis in the form of the objective case is called Aparashiva. Parashiva is Gun&#x301;amaya, but Aparashiva, although Gun&#x301;amaya in the practical sphere, is actually not Gun&#x301;amaya in the theoretical sphere, because the alternation between manifestation and non-manifestation of the forces goes on constantly, simultaneously with the emanation, externalization, reflection and refraction from the points of Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga and Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Siddha&#x301;nta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra and Kula&#x301;ca&#x301;ra of Shaeva Tantra [Shiva Tantra, Shaivite Tantra] are recognized by both the Hindu and Buddhist schools of Tantra. The Buddhist Vajraya&#x301;na, Mantraya&#x301;na, Tantraya&#x301;na and Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na sub-schools of Tantra recognize all of these a&#x301;ca&#x301;ras and follow them in actual practice. The purest part of Shaeva Tantra, which is beyond both Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra and Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and was formerly to be learned in s&#x301;a&#x301;mra&#x301;jya diiksa&#x301; [a kind of Tantric initiation] from a kaola guru [Tantric guru], is now included in Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;dhira&#x301;ja Yoga. Some of the subtler processes of Ananda Marga sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; bear a close relation to Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;dhira&#x301;ja. Mahars&#x301;i As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vakra, while staying at Vakreshvar tiirtha [place of pilgrimage], introduced Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;dhira&#x301;ja and gave the first initiation in that school to the young Prince Alarka. In Hindu Tantra, Buddhist Tantra, and Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;dhira&#x301;ja Yoga, this concept of Parashiva in the unmanifested balanced triangle of forces has been recognized implicitly or explicitly. Naera&#x301;tma Devii of Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na and Shu&#x301;nya&#x301;tma Devii of Kaun&#x32D;ka&#x301;la-ma&#x301;linii Tantra are simply alternative names of Parashiva.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In later years the school of Shaeva Tantra altogether lost its high-grade spiritual cult, and there remained only the more inconsequential of Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra Tantric practices such as dancing with a dead body and performing a type of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; with a skeleton. In a later period, lasting about 150 years, when the school of Terapantha&#x301; Jainism was to be found throughout all of northern India, Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra-oriented Shaeva Tantra had become practically extinct from all of India, particularly from Bengal. The school of Aghorpantha&#x301;, which is still to be found covertly practised in Bengal, is also a distorted form of Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;rii Shaeva Tantra. The original features of Shaeva Tantra, in the absence of a competent Tantric master and deserving Tantric disciples, have today become confused. Now it is like a labyrinth. Saora Tantra, Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra, and Shaeva Tantra do not have adequate scriptural literature, as Sha&#x301;kta Tantra and Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra have;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Saora Tantra and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra have almost no literature of their own. Once I ran across a few manuscripts of Shaeva Tantra written on palm leaves in red ink. The owners of the manuscripts could neither read them nor understand their meanings if they heard them, nor were they willing to transfer ownership of them to anyone else. But this much can be said, that their basic theme is Parashiva-oriented. It can also be said (through pure philosophical analysis and analysis of the cult which they prescribe) that their basic theme is the Parashiva Gun&#x301;amaya of Shaeva Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
