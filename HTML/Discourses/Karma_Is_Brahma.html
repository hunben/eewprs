<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Work is Brahma, and hence, do more and more and still more work. Brahma consists of everything. Work is a microscopic fraction of Brahma. Hence how can work be called Brahma? Whatever human beings do or think, and with whatever method, they move towards Brahma, they impose the ideation of Brahma on them. One who is a &ldquo;Karmayogii&rdquo; ascribes Brahmahood to Karma. For the sake of attainment of the Supreme entity one can advance either through the path of knowledge or through the path of Karma. In the same way one can also proceed through the path of Bhakti (devotion).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is knowledge? It is the understanding, with sharpened intellect, of what is permanent and what is temporary. Besides this, one has to analyse that out of the permanent which one is true and which one is false. It is like the mixture of gold ore with many kinds of stones. First of all the ore has to be smelted and separated and whatever remains is not pure gold. That again, is melted and pure gold is obtained. Thus after removing impurities repeatedly, we get pure gold. Likewise in worldly affairs the human beings, eliminate the unsubstantial and adopt the substantial. And out of the substantial they keep only the cream and reject the dross. Just like that, by constant intellectual analysis, human beings arrive at the Supreme truththis alone is Brahma to the seeker of knowledge. This alone is the path of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The followers of &ldquo;Karmayoga&rdquo; perform only those deeds which lead them to spirituality. While following the path of Karma it is experienced that there is some distortion in life and that is rejected and a correct path is again adopted. Again while moving it is found that there is still some impurity, which is again rejected, and a still purer path is adopted. The march continues till the Supreme One is attained. The path of devotion is -<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[Taking all with Thee, Thou hast hidden thyself in the midst of all and Thou art mine.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Everything is the expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Bearing this in mind the devotees serve all with integrated outlook and move ahead on the path of devotion. The path of the devotees is straightforward, it is blissful right from the beginning. The path of knowledge is a little troublesome and so is the path of action. The workers say &ldquo;Karma Brahmeti Karma Bahu Kurbiita&rdquo;. Remember the worker works ceaselessly. While moving on the path, if you happen to discover that some actions, which are not pure by nature and do not bring joy to you, you should outright reject them. Likewise, one has to move ahead step by step. Hence you should go ahead with work as much as you can. And thus in the process of work, you will understand which work is noble, which one is ignoble or repulsive. Hence this saying &ndash; &ldquo;Karma Brahmeti Karma Bahu Kurviita.&rdquo; This utterance is highly justified. The path of knowledge is something else. I shall discuss it in detail on some other day.<!-- /block --></p>
