<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know that the science of aesthetics is a special characteristic expression of all microcosms in the entire universe, not only of humans but of all living creatures. This inner spirit of aesthetic science leads all the microcosms to seek a congenial environment for their psychic expression, for all unit minds are searching a totally congenial environment for their development. This development leads to a state of psychic balance, attained as the results of all one&#146;s actions and reactions. While seeking to attain this state of psychic balance, human beings invented the science of aesthetics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Everything in this universe of ours is moving, and this entire universe also is moving around the Macrocosmic Nucleus. This movement is from imperfection to perfection, and this element of dynamism is the essence of aesthetics. While trying to analyse the nature of this dynamism, one is bound to conclude that aesthetics is surely a science, for it moves according to fixed and self-created rules. But the realization of aesthetic feeling is not a science, rather it is a high-grade art. I said just now that this aesthetic science is not only a characteristic of the human mind, but of all living creatures as well. When we say that human beings have attained peace in life, what are the dimensions of this peace? When we say that we are all seeking a peaceful environment, what does it mean? Is it some kind of physical relaxation? No, certainly not. If so, then that relaxation would be physico-psychic, but the subtle feeling of joy in aesthetic science is psycho-physical. Now the question is, is this joy only psycho-physical? No, it is not: it is both psycho-physical and psycho-spiritual. When the mind seeks a subtle feeling of joy without expecting the fruits of its action, this is certainly psycho-physical, but when this experience of joy moves in a well-defined way towards a goal then it is certainly psycho-spiritual.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Whether it is psycho-physical or psycho-spiritual, clash is inevitable, and this clash occurs amongst the static, mutative and sentient principles. This clash goes on and on. Due to this clash, when the movement is towards the sentient force, that is, when the mutative force overpowers the static force and the sentient force overpowers the mutative force, in that case the psychic movement is called psycho-spiritual. This type of movement gives birth to true art and science; whereas that knowledge which creates numerous obstacles and problems for the human society is not at all wisdom, but merely the expression of mean propensities of mind. When nothing great is created, then cheap sentiments emerge for low-grade art, literature, architecture, sculpture, etc.; and when the sentient principle is overpowered by the mutative principle, and the mutative principle by the static principle, the cumulative effect is complete chaos. That is why I said that this clash goes on and on, and it occurs not only within the human mind but also within all the unit and collective minds of the entire universe. The duty of all the educated and talented people of the society is to arrive at a firm conclusion as to what they should do, how they will lead the society along a righteous path, and how ultimately they will establish society in the subtle realm of Satyam, shivam and sundaram (Truth, Consciousness and Beauty). This clash amongst the three binding principles will continue eternally; it can never be checked, because it is endless by its very nature. But although it cannot be stopped altogether, it can be channelled along a particular direction so that the mutative force cannot defeat the sentient force, and the static force cannot defeat the mutative force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, within the realm of these three binding principles, society will have to find the path for true progress through proper planning and proper struggle. Without this, the future of humanity is dark. But you should bear in mind that pessimism or the complex of hopelessness is not the essence of this universe; optimism is the goal of the universal humanity. So in no circumstances should cynicism or nihilism be encouraged; rather when the righteous and virtuous people of this world sit together and decide what should and should not be done, they will certainly find the proper path. The internal clash amongst the three binding principles should never be discouraged; on the contrary, it should be directed along the proper path. We can only suggest this much. So the movement of these countless heterogeneous microcosms, through ceaseless clash, towards the Supreme Sentiency should be kept unobstructed. Wherever there is aesthetics, there is bound to be heterogeneity, and the ultimate goal of this clash is to be established in the realm of the Supreme Homogeneity, the state of Absolute Bliss &ndash; in the midst of heterogeneity. But that state of Supreme Bliss does not come within the scope of aesthetics; it comes within the scope of supra-aesthetics, that is, in the world of the absolute above the domain of relativity. And in that Supreme Macrocosmic Stance, there are none of the three bondages, no heterogeneity, only Supreme Homogeneity. So all the honest and right-thinking people of the world will have to decide what should be done, and how to establish that Supreme Homogeneity.<!-- /block --></p>
