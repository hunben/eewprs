<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->We belong to the world &ndash; the world is our homeland. To state it more clearly, the entire universe is our homeland. In one corner of this universe there is a small planet called earth, and in one corner of this earth there is a community called the Bengalees. While advancing from the distant past, this community has reached the end of a dark period; a new year&#146;s dawn is about to break in its history. The Bengalees will have to move forward still further, and in this path of their movement, there is no pause, no rest &ndash; no punctuation mark with comma, colon or semi-colon. They must move ever forward. Indeed, they are moving and they will continue to move. For movement is the very essence of life, the living proof of its vital existence. Those who stop in the middle of their movement have lost the very characteristic or dharma of life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Human beings must move forward, ignoring the frowns of staticity. Only those who move ahead vigorously are capable of making history. The Bengali community is not a mere handful of persons: they total 160 million people. So they have enough vitality to move forward, ignoring the frowns of death. In this path of historical movement, what is the law of motion? Motion is never linear, rather it is always systaltic, it is always pulsative. Each New Year&#146;s Day is the starting point of a pulsation in history. So during the stage of pause and speed at the New Year, people look back and discover that they have moved forward leaving many things behind; and they also look ahead and see many things in front of them &ndash; they realize that they will have to do many things in the future. Accordingly they make many plans and programmes to utilize the coming year in a fruitful way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This New Year&#146;s day is the day of recollection of our past resolutions, when we remember our past plans and goals. By reviewing our past mistakes, we find the rectificatory measures which will help us gain enough strength to move ahead with new zeal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Many of you perhaps do not know that the modern Bengali community is over 3000 years old. If we accept that the Rg Veda was composed between ten to fifteen thousand years ago, and the Yajur Veda from five to ten thousand years ago, then the Atharva Veda is certainly 3000 years old. In the Jain scriptures which Mahaviira Jain propounded 2500 years ago, there is a direct reference to the Atharva Veda, which proves that the Atharva Veda is older than the Jain scriptures. That is why I say that the Bengali community is more than 3000 years old, for there were various references to Bengal in the Atharva Veda. Much later, when the demi-Magadhii language was being transformed into old Bengali, words like Vaun&#x32D;ga, Bengali, etc. were in vogue. Many people think that the word Ba&#x301;m&#x301;la has come from the Turkish word Banjal or the Persian word Banjal, but they are mistaken. In Chinese the word Banjal has been in use for the last 5000 years, for in Chinese the land of Bengal was called Banjal. So both the land of Bengal and its community of people are very ancient. When the demi-Magadhi language was being transformed into old Bengali, in the Buddhist poetry of the period, there are references to the words Bam&#x301;la and Bengali. For instance, Ba&#x301;m&#x301;la nila ja&#x301;ya&#x301; (&ldquo;They married in Bengal&rdquo;), or bhuesu-ku a&#x301;ji tu Ba&#x301;un&#x32D;a&#x301;lii bhaeli aiya gharan&#x301;ii can&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;lii lelahi (&ldquo;Bhusuku, you became a Bengalee today, and the mistress of your house has become an untouchable.&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The word Bengal is mentioned here. Had the word Bengali been from Turkish or Persian, then it would not have been more than 700 or 800 years old. So it clear that the Bengali people have been marching towards a glittering future from an ancient past for over 3000 years. This is not a community living in a state which has only recently been demarcated; its political structure has undergone numerous transformations. Because it is so ancient, it has achieved progress in various stages. Just as it has assimilated many things from others, so it has also given many things to others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Consequently the Bengalees have their own dress and the women have their own distinctive style of wearing sariis. They have their own almanac, literature, script, and style of intonation, and they also have their own social system of inheritance. As far as I know no other community in the world has so many unique specialities. In Europe or elsewhere, a particular community is called a nation in modern terminology; however, if we would go deeper into the Latin root meaning of the word &ldquo;nation&rdquo;, we would be more cautious in using the term. But the Bengali community is more than a nation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In every phase of its history the Bengali community has made enormous progress. A community which is constantly progressing should have a special system to record its chronological history, and also a system for reckoning time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Ancient Bengal (the then Paondravardhana) had as its capital Sim&#x301;hapur for 750 years. Sim&#x301;hapur is presently a very small town in the district of Hooghly. Sim&#x301;habahu was one of the kings of that period. His son Vijay Sim&#x301;ha conquered Ceylon and changed its name to Sim&#x301;hala. As Vijay Sim&#x301;ha died without children, he brought his nephew Pa&#x301;nd&#x301;u Vasudeva from Sim&#x301;hapur and made him the king of Sim&#x301;hal and Kerala. The descendants of Pa&#x301;nd&#x301;u Vasudeva are known as the Nayars of Kerala; they migrated from Bengal 2514 years ago and settled in Kerala. At any social function of Bengal, any auspicious social ceremony, Bengali women produce a special sound which is called &ldquo;huludhvani&rdquo;. This system is also found amongst the Nayyar community of Kerala even today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Another prince of Sim&#x301;hapur was Sahasneva&#x301;hu who conquered Thailand and named the country Siam. Another king of Sim&#x301;hapur was Shaliba&#x301;hana, who opposed the then prevalent calendar system of India. In those days the calendar system was based upon the lunar month; that is, twenty-nine days made up a month and 354 days comprised a year. According to this system there was no link between the crops and the seasons, and in some years the Bengali month of A&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;r&#x301;ha (the month of the monsoon) began before the rainy season, and in other years it began after the rains were over. This system caused much inconvenience to both the farmers and the government during the collection of taxes. Consequently, Shaliba&#x301;hana rejected the lunar calendar system and 1387 years ago introduced a simple new system of calendar which is followed even today in Orissa, Assam, Bangladesh, and by the revenue collectors of North India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->During the reign of King Akbar, the hijrii year was changed from the lunar system to the solar system, and it was renamed the faslii year. The faslii year begins from the month of A&#x301;shvin (the time of harvesting the autumn rice). According to the previous calendrical system of Bengal, the year began at the time of harvesting the late autumn rice. So from the reign of King Shaliba&#x301;hana, the Bengali year started from Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;. (The astrological name of the month was Ma&#x301;rga Sha&#x301;rs&#x301;a but as it was the first month of the year it was called Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;. Until the days of Akbar, Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301; was the first month of the Bengali year. Later, to maintain adjustment with the calendar of the rest of India, the first month of the year was changed from Agraha&#x301;yana to Vaesha&#x301;ka. The full moon takes place in the month of Agraha&#x301;yana with the appearance of the Mrgas&#x301;hira star. In the rhymes of old Bengal, for example,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->This poem is called ba&#x301;rama&#x301;sya&#x301;, the depiction of the twelve months of the Bengali year. This shows that the Agraha&#x301;yana was the first month of the year. In those days married Bengali girls did not set out for their paternal homes in the month of Ka&#x301;rttika:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->This shows that the Ka&#x301;rttika was the last month and Agraha&#x301;na was the first month of the year. But according to the Indian system of reckoning and the newly introduced system of Sam&#x301;vat, when the full moon takes place with the appearance of the Visha&#x301;kha&#x301; star, the month is called lunar Vaesha&#x301;ka. In lunar Vaesha&#x301;ka as long as the sun remains within the scope of Me&#146;s zodiac sign (Aries), the period is known as solar Vaesha&#x301;ka. The Bengali month of Vaesha&#x301;ka is the solar Vaesha&#x301;ka. Yesterday the sun was in Pisces zodiac sign, but today it is in Aries. That is why today is the first day of the Bengali New Year. This was first introduced by King Sha&#x301;liba&#x301;hana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->According to some, the Bengali word sal or year is derived from the Persian word sal. That may be true, but in the case of Bengal, the system of the Bengali year was introduced by King Sha&#x301;liba&#x301;hana. King Sha&#x301;liba&#x301;hana was assisted by the famous astrologer Jayanta Pa&#x301;nigra&#x301;hii of the then Danda Bhukti, who introduced the new system of reckoning the Bengali year. In the Pathan and Mughal periods, Danda Bhukti, now known as Midnapur, was called Hizli Parganas. In those days Burdwan bhukti, Somata&#x301;t bhukti, Pa&#x301;on&#x301;d&#x301;ravardhana bhukti and Ka&#x301;mtapur bhukti (which included some districts like the present Jalpaiguri, Goalpara, Koochvihar and Ram&#x301;pur), were all under the sovereignty of the king, and so they all accepted the Bengali system, as did Assam and Orissa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The Bengali community is making progress in various spheres of life. And with this progress, the lunar and solar dates and years are inseparably associated. None of these matters can be removed from social life, nothing can be discarded. It is rather like the crown of the bridegroom during a wedding &ndash; if the crown is removed, the bridegroom is no longer a groom.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Again the Bengali New Year has come. So the Bengali community, who were very vibrant in the past, are still alive today; and I hope they will live dynamically in the future also. The same Bengali community will have to renew their resolution to make the new year more successful, to make their existence more vigorous. This is a day of rejoicing, and amidst this rejoicing the Bengalees will have to determine ways of improving their individual and collective life, and developing their resources for their future Progress. Na&#x301;nyah pantha&#x301; vidyate ayana&#x301;ya. &ldquo;There is no other way for a living community besides this.&rdquo; This is not the time for laziness; rather it is the time for intense activity. Let every moment of your valuable time be used properly. With these words I conclude my discourse.<!-- /block --></p>
