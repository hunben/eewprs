<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Yesterday I said something regarding the Hara-Pa&#x301;rvatii sam&#x301;va&#x301;da [dialogues of Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii], and I think it was quite clear, I think it was crystal-clear, for all of you.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Do you know what the meaning of &ldquo;Hara&rdquo; [a name of Shiva] is? Spiritual knowledge, aesthetic knowledge, psychic knowledge and so many other kinds of knowledge &ndash; such as the knowledge of sam&#x301;giita [music], of art, of architecture, and of medicine &ndash; everything comes from that Hara. What is the meaning of &ldquo;Hara&rdquo;? Ha is the acoustic root of the ethereal [factor] and ra is the acoustic root of energy. The vibrational flow of energy on the entire ethereal level is &ldquo;Hara&rdquo;, that is, in the expressed universe the most vibrating, the most dancing, entity is Hara. Hence Hara is also known as Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;j or Nat&#x301;esha [Lord of Dance].<!-- /block --></p>

So Pa&#x301;rvatii asked Shiva, &ldquo;O Lord, what are the secrets of success?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[There are seven requirements for success in any mission. The first is firm determination: &ldquo;I must succeed.&rdquo; The second is reverence. The third is guru pu&#x301;ja&#x301;, or constant remembrance of one&#146;s spiritual master.

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Dvitiiyam&#x301; shraddhaya&#x301; yuktam&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;the second requisite factor is that the aspirant must have shraddha&#x301;.&rdquo; What is shraddha&#x301;? There is, in fact, no corresponding term in English; that term is peculiar to the Sanskrit language. Shrat means the entity, the Desideratum, that has been accepted by the aspirant as the supreme truth. The Desideratum that has no alternative is called shrat. Here shrat means the supreme truth, the absolute truth, the Desideratum that has no alternative. Shrat + dha = shraddha&#x301;. Shrat Satyam&#x301; tasmin dhiiyate iti shraddha&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;Whenever one accepts this Desideratum as the only truth and only goal of life, as the only resort, [that mentality of being goaded] by an ideological flow is shraddha&#x301;.&rdquo; You cannot find any proper word for it in English. Dvitiiyam&#x301; shraddhaya&#x301; yuktam&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So the spiritual aspirant, an aspirant in any sphere of life, must develop shraddha&#x301;. (So the first requisite factor is the firm determination, &ldquo;I must be successful&rdquo;; and the second is that one must have shraddha&#x301;.) Without shraddha&#x301; nothing can be done. Shraddha&#x301;va&#x301;n labhate jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam [&ldquo;One with shraddha&#x301; attains self-knowledge&rdquo;]. Without shraddha&#x301; one cannot acquire anything either in the sphere of karma or in the sphere of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Bhakti<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> itself is another name for shraddha&#x301;. So dvitiiyam&#x301; shraddhaya&#x301; yuktam&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;the second requisite factor is shraddha&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Trtiiyam&#x301; gurupu&#x301;janam &ndash; &ldquo;the third thing is gurupu&#x301;janam.&rdquo; What is gurupu&#x301;janam? Withdrawing all your psychic propensities from the different external and internal pabula of the mind and then guiding those withdrawn propensities collectively unto the object of adoration, is called pu&#x301;janam in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->And what is guru? Gu means &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; and ru means [&ldquo;dispeller&rdquo;]. Now, all human beings, until they are on the path of spirituality, are surrounded by cimmerian darkness. They cannot see anything properly. And this stage of life is called the shu&#x301;dra stage; they are shu&#x301;dras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Janmana&#x301; ja&#x301;yate shu&#x301;drah sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra&#x301;t dvija ucyate;<br>Vedapa&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;t bhavet viprah Brahma ja&#x301;na&#x301;ti bra&#x301;hman&#x301;ah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->[By birth, everybody is a shu&#x301;dra, i.e., with an animal-like mentality. Going through a [[renewal]], the person becomes a dvija, i.e., expresses the desire to become human. By studying scriptures, a person next becomes a vipra, an intellectual. And finally, when the person realizes Brahma (through psycho-spiritual initiation), he or she becomes a bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->By birth, everybody is a shu&#x301;dra, because they cannot see anything properly. Shu&#x301;dra means &ldquo;[one] living in darkness&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra&#x301;t dvija ucyate [&ldquo;going through a renewal according to one&#146;s mental reactive momenta, one becomes a dvija&rdquo;]. And when the sense is created in their minds that they are not ordinary living beings, but are glorious human beings, who have a mission to perform, then that propulsion is called sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra. One becomes a dvija because life takes a new turn. Dvija means &ldquo;second birth&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Then when one acquires spiritual knowledge, one becomes an intellectual and is known as a vipra. And when the vipra, by dint of his or her Tantric sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, attains Brahma-hood, he or she is called a bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a. Brahma ja&#x301;na&#x301;ti Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;ah [&ldquo;when a person realizes Brahma, he or she becomes a bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Now when the darkness of the mind is dispelled, one can see and one can know what is what and which is which, but the dispelling entity cannot be a mundane one, because the secrets of Parama Purus&#x301;a are known to Parama Purus&#x301;a alone and to nobody else. So then who is the guru? In Ananda Su&#x301;tram<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> it is said, Brahmaeva gururekah na&#x301;parah [&ldquo;Only Brahma is the guru, no one else&rdquo;]. His secrets are known to Him alone, and so He is the guru, He is the jagatguru [guru of the universe], He is the supreme guru. No second entity can be the guru, can play the role of guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Now, He wants His entire creation &ndash; all His children &ndash; to know Him. And as they come to know Him, they will become one with Him, they will attain salvation. This is His play, this is His liila&#x301;. He creates the crude world, then He creates so many animate entities, and finally He wants those animate entities to try to know Him, try to learn Him. This is what is known as sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. So His children should do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and should finally again be one with Him. This is His Brahma Cakra [Cosmic Cycle], this is His Liila&#x301; Cakra. He is playing with His own children, a play of pain and pleasure. His is the liila&#x301; of pain and pleasure. So spiritual aspirants must not be afraid of pain, and must not lose their balance when in pleasure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->So He is the guru. Now what happens? He creates spirituality, and He creates the code of anusha&#x301;sanam [discipline], and everybody will have to move according to that code. But due to constant reflection and [re]fraction (you know that each and every movement, even the movement of spirituality in the realm of the psychic and physical world, undergoes certain changes due to constant reflection and refraction), a time comes when those movements lose their speed, their acceleration, and get retarded. And under such circumstances that jagatguru is forced to [come] in a quinquelemental structure and forced to take the shape of prapain&#x32D;cadeha [quinquelemental structure]. And in our philosophy we call Him Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti, the Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma [Liberating Brahma]. He comes, and again and again He plays the role of guru in the realm of physicality, and this has been happening again and again since time immemorial. We got Lord Shiva and we got Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. So The Supreme Entity, Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, is the only guru. There cannot be a second guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Gurupu&#x301;janam &ndash; that is, the pu&#x301;janam of the guru. What is the meaning of pu&#x301;janam? Just now I explained that one should move towards the spiritual desideratum without any hesitation, without any fear, without being goaded by any other of our propensities. That is the human way, that is the way of shreya [the path of supreme well-being]. Hence Lord Shiva says, &ldquo;The third requisite factor is gurupu&#x301;janam.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Caturtho samata&#x301;bha&#x301;vo [&ldquo;The fourth is equanimity of mind&rdquo;]. But you know, due to certain defects in our socio-economico-politico-cultural life, certain people suffer from inferiority complexes and certain people suffer from superiority complexes. If a poor man suffers from an inferiority complex before a rich man, he will use the term huzur a thousand times in a sentence. And before a poor man, a rich man will suffer from a superiority complex. He will not address the poor man with the word a&#x301;p, he will use the word tum,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> as if the poor man has no sense of prestige. Is it not a fact? A spiritual aspirant must not suffer from any of these complexes. One should not have any inferiority complex or any superiority complex. And not only that, one should not suffer from any fear complex or complex of hopelessness or helplessness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->A person must not suffer from an inferiority complex, because that person and his or her friends and siblings are all the progeny of the same Progenitor. They come from the same origin [as all]; they are of the same Father. So why should a person suffer from any inferiority complex? Again, you should not suffer from a superiority complex, because all are your brothers and sisters. All are the glorious children of that Supreme Father. No, you must not develop any superiority complex.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Pain&#x32D;camendriyanigrahah [&ldquo;the fifth is control of the senses&rdquo;]. There are two entities within you; two belligerent entities are within you. One is Ravana. Ravana means the evil force, the evil giant, within your mind, that functions in all the ten directions. It is not something external; it is the evil force working within your mind. [And the second entity is Rama, symbolizing the good force.] Let there be a fight between these two entities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->You should establish your restraint over all the sensory and motor organs, including the eleventh organ, the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hain&#x32D;ca pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ro [&ldquo;the sixth is a balanced diet&rdquo;]. What is pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ra? Pra &ndash; ma&#x301; + [kta + a&#x301;ha&#x301;ra] = pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ra. That is, the food that helps you in your spiritual and mental development and which is also good for your physical body is called pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ra. It must be sa&#x301;ttvika food, because sa&#x301;ttvika food will help you in your spiritual development and in your mental development. And it must be balanced food, because balanced food will help you in your physical progress and physical development, and in maintaining a good physical body. S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hain&#x32D;ca pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ro.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->After listing these six factors, Lord Shiva said, &ldquo;O Pa&#x301;rvatii, there is no seventh factor. These are the six requisite factors which each and every spiritual aspirant should always remember.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
