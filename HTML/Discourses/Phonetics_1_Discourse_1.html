<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->All the languages of the world are bound together on a single thread &ndash; su&#x301;tre man&#x301;igan&#x301;a&#x301; iva. No language is beyond this law. Those languages which used to carry the remnants of natural melodies have also finally had to obey this law. Even before the existence of written script the science of language was based on phonetics. Despite the lack of script, alphabetical order did exist. For example, during the Rgvedic era the letters ka, kha, ga, gha existed but people did not know how to write them. The people of that time were not familiar with the letters of the alphabet &ndash; they knew their pronunciation but they could not write them. At that time metrics were fixed according to alphabetical order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Written script did not exist at the beginning of the Vedic era. Written script came into existence between five and six thousand years ago with the Saendhavii script. Although written script did not exist in the Vedic era, metre did. There are seven metres in the Vedas: Us&#x301;n&#x301;ik, Ga&#x301;yatrii, Anus&#x301;t&#x301;up, Tris&#x301;t&#x301;up, Brhatii, Jagatii and Paunkti. There were special rules for the pronunciation of Us&#x301;n&#x301;ik metre.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The Vedic language is the oldest language that we are familiar with. This language was influential in central Asia and certain parts of India for a period that extended from fifteen thousand years ago to about seven and a half thousand years ago. Its alphabetical order follows the rules of Rgvedic pronunciation. There are three accepted systems of pronunciation in Sanskrit &ndash; Sam&#x301;vrta, Vivrta and Tiryyak. Both Sanskrit and Vedic have three measures of pronunciation &ndash; short, long and extended.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit there are four accepted systems of pronunciation &ndash; Ka&#x301;shika&#x301;, Daks&#x301;in&#x301;ii, Maha&#x301;ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rii and Gaor&#x301;iiya [those of Benares, southern India, Maharashtra and Bengal]. The Rgvedic style of pronunciation is different from the Yajurvedic style of pronunciation. In Sam&#x301;vrta the pronunciation of the alphabet is similar to Bengali pronunciation. In Vivrta it is somewhat similar to that of the western areas of Uttar Pradesh. Tiryyak occupies a place somewhere between the English &ldquo;au&rdquo; and the English &ldquo;o&rdquo;. For example, we write man but we pronounce it somewhere in-between &ldquo;maun&rdquo; and &ldquo;mone&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Rgvedic style has a total of fifty letters &ndash; sixteen vowels and thirty-four consonants. The sixteen vowels are: a, a&#x301;, i, ii, u, u&#x301;, r, rr, lr, lrr, e, ae, o, ao, am&#x301;, and ah. The thirty-four consonants are: ka, kha, ga, gha, un&#x32D;a, ca, cha, ja, jha, in&#x32D;a, t&#x301;a, t&#x301;ha, d&#x301;a, d&#x301;ha, n&#x301;a, ta, tha, da, dha, na, pa, pha, ba, bha, ma, ya, ra, la, va, sha, s&#x301;a, sa, ha, and ks&#x301;a. D&#x301;a and d&#x301;ha are pronounced in two different ways. The letter d&#x301;a is pronounced d&#x301;a at the beginning of a word, for example, d&#x301;ambaru. However it is pronounced r&#x301;a (rha) in the middle or at the end of a word, as in a&#x301;r&#x301;ambara. Similarly, d&#x301;ha is pronounced d&#x301;ha at the beginning of a word, for example, d&#x301;hakka&#x301;, and r&#x301;ha (rhha) in the middle or at the end of a word, as in a&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;r&#x301;ha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There is a fixed rule for the pronunciation of ya &ndash; pada&#x301;nte padamadhyasthe &ldquo;ya&rdquo;-ka&#x301;ra &ldquo;ia&rdquo; ucyate. If ya occurs at the beginning of a word then it is pronounced like a light &ldquo;ja&rdquo; as in yoga, yadu, yamuna&#x301;, but if it comes in the middle or at the end of a word then it is pronounced &ldquo;ia&rdquo;, as in viyoga or samaya. Some pandits in northern India mistakenly pronounce the word yoga &ldquo;iog&rdquo;. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar Mahashay placed a dot beneath the letters d&#x301;a, d&#x301;ha and ya in his grade school primer, Varn&#x301;a Paricaya, whenever they occurred in the middle or end of a word so that children would not make this sort of mistake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->A language normally lasts about one thousand years and a script about two thousand years before undergoing metamorphosis. Script, however, is not sound. It is alphabetical order. The Bengali script came into existence approximately fifteen hundred years ago and it will survive for some time longer. Due to the invention of printing, the life of the script will be extended somewhat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->An old form of Bengali script has been discovered in Singbhum District&#146;s Jayda village on the banks of the Suvarnarekha River. A deed of gift written in the script of that time has been found in the Shushuniya<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Hills in Bankura District&#146;s Chatna Thana.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  These are the two oldest extant examples of Bengali script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The Pra&#x301;krta language came into existence approximately thirty-five hundred years ago and when it did Sanskrit or Vedic pronunciation changed. To put it in another way, the name of those altered verbal root forms, word forms, pronouns and vocabulary was Pra&#x301;krta, which spread orally among the common people. Pra&#x301;krta came into existence shortly before the advent of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Many people believe that Sanskrit is an artificial language. However, the prevalence of so many Sanskrit words in the speech of uneducated people proves that it is not. For example, kandara is a Sanskrit word. In the colloquial language of Rarh there is a word ka&#x301;ndar, that is, a small, deep tributary. If Sanskrit were an artificial language then how could there be so many Sanskrit words in use among uneducated people. The people of Rarh have Sanskrit in their blood. It is their native language. If Bengali is the language of our veins and arteries then Sanskrit is the language of our bone marrow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The use of r, rr, lr, and lrr is not as widespread in the Yajurveda as it is in the Rgveda. They are also pronounced completely differently. In the Rgveda these letters are pronounced r, rr, lr, and lrr while in the Yajurveda they are pronounced ri, rri, lri, and lrri. In the Atharvaveda they are pronounced ru, rru, lru, and lrru. Modern Bengali has retained the use of r. Adding i to ra can serve the same function as r, but because these two letters can give rise to inversions in the case of certain conjuncts the letter r is used. For example, deva + rs&#x301;i = devars&#x301;i. If it is written deva + ris&#x301;i then the conjunct cannot be formed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Modern Indian languages do not follow any specific Vedic rules. Bengali only has the sha pronunciation &ndash; s&#x301;a and sa are not pronounced differently &ndash; while some other languages only have the sa pronunciation. For example, shuye par&#x301;a in Bengali is so ja&#x301;o in Hindi. The rules for Sanskrit-derived words in Bengali follow those for Sanskrit-borrowed words. For this reason, the letters s&#x301;a and sa are used for spelling purposes but no Bengali teacher ever makes a distinction among the pronunciation of sha, s&#x301;a and sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Ka + s&#x301;a = ks&#x301;a (khia). The word shis&#x301;ya [pupil] was shikhya in Pra&#x301;krta, hence the modern Panjabi word shikha In Assamese the letter s&#x301;a becomes kha &ndash; nis&#x301;edh becomes nikhedh. However, sa&#x301;has becomes ha&#x301;hakh, that is, sa is pronounced like ha at the beginning of a word and elsewhere like kha. Assamese partially follows the Yajurvedic style.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In regards to pronunciation, the pandits used to follow different rules according to the specific Veda. [[For example, the Bengali jin&#x32D;a&#x301;n is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;n in the Rgveda, gin&#x32D;a&#x301;na in the Yajurveda and din&#x32D;a&#x301;n in the Yajurveda.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In the Rgveda the candrabindu is neither a letter nor is it pronounced. In the Yajurveda it is pronounced but there is no letter for it &ndash; the anusva&#x301;ra used to serve in its place, for example, ta&#x301;m&#x301;stathaeva. The candrabindu is pronounced in six of the twelve Bengali dialects &ndash; central Rarhi, Ka&#x301;nthi, Calcutta, Nadia, Shershahbadii and Rangpuri &ndash; and to a small extent in Varendrii.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  According to the Bengali system of verbal roots and suffixes, the word shushuniya&#x301; means &ldquo;one whose nature is to remain lying&rdquo;, for example, the shushuni creeper, that is, &ldquo;that creeper which makes one sleepy when it is eaten&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)   A tha&#x301;na&#x301; is a police station and by extension the subdivision demarcated by the area controlled or administrated by that police station. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  [[As is more clear in the original Bengali script, n&#x32D; in &ldquo;the Bengali jin&#x32D;a&#x301;n&rdquo; is part of the consonant in&#x32D;a, whereas n&#x32D; in &ldquo;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;n in the Rgveda, gin&#x32D;a&#x301;na . . . and din&#x32D;a&#x301;n&rdquo; is a candrabindu (illustrated in the Roman Sam&#x301;skrta table by an&#x32D;). Thus in the last three of the words under discussion, n&#x32D; indicates only that the &ldquo;i&rdquo; in each word should be nasalized. &ndash;Trans.]]</p>
