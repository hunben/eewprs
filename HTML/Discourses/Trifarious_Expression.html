<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know, all expressions in this universe are divided into three strata &ndash; physical, psychic and spiritual &ndash; and not a single stratum among them is unimportant or negligible. For the integrated development of this world, we want all three of these strata to be properly developed, and their speed to be accelerated. Not a single stratum is unimportant &ndash; neither the physical stratum, nor the psychic stratum, nor the spiritual stratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->For physical development you are to work, you are to create certain physical factors guided by psychic faculties. Regarding development in the psychic world &ndash; since the psychic stratum is the controlling faculty of the physical world, automatically there will be certain processes which develop the physical world also. And the spiritual world is the apex form of the psychic world. So for psychic development there must be spiritual development, there must be spiritual progress. For the integrated development of the world, not only the human world or the animal world or the plant world, but for the development of the entire animate and inanimate universe, there must be progress in these three arenas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The psychic world, partly directly and partly indirectly, controls the physical world, and the spiritual world, partly directly and partly indirectly, controls the psychic world. As the psychic world is the apex form of the physical world (mind is the subtilized form of matter), we cannot afford to neglect or ignore the development of the psychic world. And as the spiritual world is similarly the apex form of the psychic world, for psychic development, for development in different spheres of intellectuality, we cannot neglect the spiritual world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This has been our failing: that we neglected the spiritual faculties of human life, we neglected the cardinal spiritual points of life. If we are interested today in the welfare of this beautiful universe, we should try more and more to accelerate the speed of spiritual progress. If the acceleration of spiritual progress becomes tremendous, then not only in the human world, but also in the physical, psychic and spiritual spheres of the entire world &ndash; and not only of the entire animate world, but of both the animate and inanimate worlds &ndash; there will be tremendous progress. And this is what we want. Now we are anxiously waiting for that crimson dawn on the eastern horizon.<!-- /block --></p>
