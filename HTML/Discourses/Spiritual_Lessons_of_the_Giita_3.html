<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The men of the mind&#146;s party, and the men of the Pandava party, have assembled to fight a battle. Who are the men of the mind&#146;s party? And what mind do we mean? We mean the blind mind, the mind without judgement, without conscience. On the other side are the men of Pandu&#146;s party. The mind is drawing human beings towards crudeness, staticity. The hundred agents of the mind assist the mind in doing this &ndash; they are the hundred sons of Dhritarastra. And in the opposite camp, as I have already mentioned, moving ahead with the aspiration of attaining self-knowledge, are the men of Pandu&#146;s party: pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;u means &ldquo;endeavouring to attain self-knowledge&rdquo;. Avidya&#x301; is the force that pulls people down; on that side are the hundred sons of Dhritarastra, the blind one. On the other side is the Vidya&#x301; force that arouses the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii shakti, the sleeping jiiva shakti [microcosmic force] in humans, and pushes it upwards to the seat of Parama Purus&#x301;a in the sahasra&#x301;ra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ndash; the abode of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Supreme Controller of all. Thus two ideas have met and synthesized within this human body, this dharmaks&#x301;etra, this kuruks&#x301;etra &ndash; this dharmaks&#x301;etra of the body and kuruks&#x301;etra of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is the sleeping microcosmic force, which I have called the fundamental negativity; and the original source, Parama Purus&#x301;a, out of which this microcosmic force springs is the fundamental positivity. Hence when this force wants to ascend, it has to move upwards along the path from the crude to the subtle. In just the same fashion, Avidya&#x301;, which moves along the path of the hundred agents of the mind &ndash; Dhritarastra&#146;s hundred sons &ndash; draws people from the subtle to the crude, and ultimately tries to reduce people to staticity, crudeness. Thus the two forces are born enemies; born enemies means those who cannot exist together. For instance, humans and tigers, or snakes and mongooses, are born enemies. Hence the aspiration to ascend, the thinking that I will go up, will be united with Parama Purus&#x301;a and become completely lost in Him, forgetting my personal identity &ndash; this ambition to rise high can never be reconciled or balanced with the inclination to become crude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Ja&#x301;nha&#x301; ka&#x301;ma ta&#x301;nha&#x301; nahiin Ra&#x301;ma, ja&#x301;nha&#x301; Ra&#x301;ma ta&#x301;nha&#x301; nahiin ka&#x301;ma;<br>Dono ekatra nahiin miile ravi-rajanii ek t&#x301;hama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[When there is attachment to the mundane, Parama Purus&#x301;a is not there; where there is Parama Purus&#x301;a there cannot be attachment &ndash; these two things cannot go together, just as the sun and the night cannot go together in the same sky.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Never can we have the sun and the night at the same time. At the sight of the sun approaching, the face of the night becomes pale, and we know that it is dawn. Similarly, when the night descends, the sun disappears. The two cannot exist together. Dono ekatra nahiin miile [&ldquo;these two things cannot go together&rdquo;] &ndash; in the same way, the psychic inclination based on Vidya&#x301; and the ideal of the highest good can never coexist with the psychic inclination based on Avidya&#x301; and crudeness and directed towards sense-pleasures. This is because of the basic difference between matter and consciousness. Persons whose vision is not clear enough to grasp the real perspective of things, speak of peaceful coexistence simply to win cheap applause. They are living in a fool&#146;s hell. I won&#146;t say a &ldquo;fool&#146;s paradise&rdquo;, even though that is the familiar expression. They are living in a fool&#146;s hell, because no such coexistence is possible. Darkness cannot coexist with the moon. Is talking about the impossible not a bid for cheap popularity? It is a form of hypocrisy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, this fundamental negativity, the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, the sleeping microcosmic force, must move from crude to subtle, from matter to consciousness. In the process of movement from crude to subtle, it will have to seek out first the solid factor, then the liquid factor, then the luminous factor, then the aerial factor, then the ethereal factor. After these comes the mind, which itself has several stages. Passing gradually through all these stages, it finally reaches the a&#x301;tman and Parama&#x301;tman [unit soul and Supreme Soul]. When the mind merges in Parama&#x301;tman, we call that state nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi [indeterminate absorption]. When, however, the mind reaches Parama&#x301;tman, but instead of merging in it merges in the Mind of Parama&#x301;tman, we call that state savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi [determinate absorption]. Now, while rising upwards, the first step is the solid factor, where it rests. When, just after diiks&#x301;a&#x301; [initiation], the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii begins to move, it rises to the ks&#x301;ititattva. [We can then say] Devena saha; where deva means one&#146;s abode, the a&#x301;di ks&#x301;ititattva [primordial solid factor]. So [changing the order of the words] the name &ldquo;Saha&#x301;deva&rdquo; [youngest of the Pandava brothers] means the solid factor. The kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii continues to move upwards. What is above the solid factor? Apatattva. In which cakra? The sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na. What does apa mean? Liquid, ku&#x301;lam&#x301; na&#x301;sti yasya &ndash; &ldquo;that which has no ku&#x301;la [limit]&rdquo;. The universe exists within the vast liquid factor. That which has no limit is &ldquo;Naku&#x301;la&rdquo; [the liquid factor and name of the next-youngest Pandava brother]. What is above the naku&#x301;la? Tejastattva. Tejastattva means &ldquo;universal energy&rdquo;. The kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii rise there. &ldquo;Arjuna&rdquo; [the middle Pandava brother] means &ldquo;energy, power&rdquo;. What is above this? The va&#x301;yaviitattva [aerial factor], the ana&#x301;hata cakra,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> also called pavana. What was Bhima [the next-oldest of the Pandava brothers]? Pavananandana [the child of pavana]. The pavanatattva, the va&#x301;yutattva. The kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii rises still higher. Where does it go? To the a&#x301;ka&#x301;shatattva, the ethereal factor. This represents a state midway between matter and consciousness, between mind and body, between abstract and matter. It is the [lowest] point in the abstract-matter scale, and the [highest] point in the matter-abstract scale. A little higher is the region of the mind, and a little lower the region of va&#x301;yutattva, which comes under the category of matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When a person performs an action, crude or subtle, and moves towards crudeness or subtlety, where is that clash focused? In the ethereal factor. A little above is the realm of the mind, and a little below, the realm of matter. The battle is most pronounced in the ethereal factor because it occupies the middle point between mind above, and matter below.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->That person alone can go upwards who keeps this point undisturbed; otherwise the person cannot go upwards. If there is the slightest disturbance the person may fall down. Hence yudhi + sthira (yudhi means &ldquo;in war&rdquo;). One who keeps oneself sthira [unaffected, unassailed] at the time of battle, who keeps one&#146;s balance in battle, who is perfectly poised for upward motion during spiritual practice, and never loses one&#146;s balance at the peak of the fighting, is yudhi + sthira = &ldquo;Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hira&rdquo; [the eldest Pandava brother].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->These are [Pandu&#146;s] five sons. Understood as the five fundamental factors, they are the five &ldquo;sons&rdquo; of pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;u where pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;u means &ldquo;spiritual path&rdquo; &ndash; that is, they are [stages in attaining] pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; &ndash; Aham&#x301; Brahma&#x301;smiiti buddhih, [&ldquo;The realization &lsquo;I am Brahma&rsquo;&rdquo;]. &ldquo;I am the a&#x301;tma&#x301;, I am Parama Purus&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; to be established in this supreme realization. Through these five factors there advance on one side the Vidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhakas, those of Pandu&#146;s party, the men of the five Pandavas; while on the other side, in Dhritarastra&#146;s party, are the hundred sons of blind Dhritarastra &ndash; Duryodhana, etc. This war has been going on since beginningless time. When in this struggle Pandu&#146;s party is victorious, that should be understood as an indication that the sa&#x301;dhaka has been able to reach the ultimate goal of his or her individual self; and the one who has not yet attained that ideal, has still to fight the battle; and the Kaoravas are the winners many times every day, bringing victory to Dhritarastra. How did this supreme spiritual battle, corresponding to an individual&#146;s life itself, which has gone on since eternity, is still going on, and will go on in human beings, progress through its various stages? The blind mind is asking Sanjaya, wisdom, the viveka [conscience], this question.
