<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know, life is a constant fight, a fight between the evil force and the divine force, vidya&#x301; shakti and avidya&#x301; shakti. These two belligerent forces are active in the human mind. A sa&#x301;dhaka will encourage the divine force, and a non-sa&#x301;dhaka will encourage the evil force. This fight is called deva&#x301;sura sam&#x301;gra&#x301;ma. The deva party is the divine force, and the asura party is the evil force. This deva&#x301;sura sam&#x301;gra&#x301;ma has been going on since time immemorial; and that&#146;s why spiritual practice, spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, is called sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;samara. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is  samara. Samara means &ldquo;war&rdquo;, &ldquo;fight&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->We get this very picture in the Giita&#x301;. In the Giita&#x301;, in the first shloka, what does it say? Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra uva&#x301;ca [&ldquo;Dhritarastra said&rdquo;]:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[&ldquo;O Sanjaya, now that my children and the children of Pandu have gathered on the battlefield of Dharmaks&#x301;etra, of Kuruks&#x301;etra, eager to fight, what is taking place?&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Dhritarastra said.&rdquo; Who is Dhritarastra? Dhrta means [&ldquo;controlling&rdquo;, &ldquo;controlling entity&rdquo;], and ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra means &ldquo;structure&rdquo;, &ldquo;framework&rdquo;. And who does [control] your physical structure? Your mind. Because of the mind, because of the existence of the mind, the structural solidarity of a body is maintained. If the mind leaves the body, the body will decompose, dissociate; its structural solidarity will be lost. So who is Dhritarastra? He who controls the ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra, he who controls the physical body: that is, the mind. Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra uva&#x301;ca means &ldquo;The mind says&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;The question arose in the mind, in the human mind.&rdquo; Now do you know? Dhritarastra said: &ldquo;Sanjaya,&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Dharmaks&#x301;etre Kuruks&#x301;etre samaveta&#x301; yuyutsavah;<br>Ma&#x301;maka&#x301;h Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava&#x301;shcaeva kimakurvata Sain&#x32D;jaya?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Dhritarastra asked Sanjaya, &ldquo;These two belligerent forces, my party and the Pandu party, have assembled on Dharmaks&#x301;etra and Kuruks&#x301;etra to fight against each other. And after assembling there, what did they do, Sanjaya? Tell me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now, why does Dhritarastra ask Sanjaya? Because Dhritarastra cannot see. The mind cannot see; the mind is a blind force. Dhritarastra was blind. You know, Dhritarastra was blind, because the mind is blind, the mind is a blind force, the mind cannot see without the help of the conscience. The mind cannot see without the help of the viveka. The manah cannot see without the help of the viveka. The mana, the blind mind, asks the viveka (the viveka is sain&#x32D;jaya: sam + ji + al) the result of the fight between [good] and evil. Sain&#x32D;jaya means the power of discrimination. The power of discrimination between good and bad is called viveka &ndash; and this is sain&#x32D;jaya. The blind mind asks sain&#x32D;jaya &ndash; the mind asks the viveka &ndash; &ldquo;My party&rdquo; (that is, the party of the blind mind) &ldquo;and the Pandu party &ndash; after assembling on Dharmaks&#x301;etra, Kuruks&#x301;etra, what did they do?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, who are the members of &ldquo;my party&rdquo;, that is, Dhritarastra&#146;s party? That is, who are the supporters of Dhritarastra? Who are the supporters of the blind mind? Now you know, there are ten indriyas in the human body, caks&#x301;uh, karn&#x301;a, na&#x301;sika&#x301;, jihva&#x301;, tvak, va&#x301;k, pa&#x301;n&#x301;i, pa&#x301;da, pa&#x301;yu, and upastha. These are the ten indriyas of the human body, the ten [organs] of the human body. Five are sensory organs, and five are motor organs. Caks&#x301;uh, karn&#x301;a, na&#x301;sika&#x301;, jihva&#x301;, tvak [eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin] &ndash; these five organs are sensory organs. And va&#x301;k, pa&#x301;n&#x301;i, pa&#x301;da, pa&#x301;yu, upastha [vocal cord, hands/arms, feet/legs, anus, genitary organ] &ndash; these five organs are motor organs. There are ten organs. And each and every organ can function in ten directions. So the agents of the mind can function in ten times ten, a hundred directions. So Dhritarastra had one hundred agents, one hundred sons. These one hundred sons were the party of Dhritarastra. They are the supporters of materialism, they are the evil force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava&#x301;shcaeva. They are fighting against whom? Against the Pandavas. What is the meaning of pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava? In Sanskrit [pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, from the] root verb pan&#x301;d&#x301;, means &ldquo;spiritual knowledge, sentient knowledge&rdquo;. Pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita means &ldquo;he who has acquired spiritual knowledge, he who has acquired sentient knowledge&rdquo;. Pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;I am Brahma.&rdquo; This firm determination, this stance of &ldquo;I &ndash; Brahma,&rdquo; this firm determination, is called pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;. And he who has acquired pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; is called pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita &ndash; and he who wants to acquire this knowledge is called pan&#x301;d&#x301;u &ndash; and pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava means &ldquo;pertaining to pan&#x301;d&#x301;u&rdquo;. The stages that you will have to go through in your spiritual practice are pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava. In your spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, you are required to exalt your kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, the &ldquo;coiled serpentine&rdquo;, from the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra to the pineal gland. And in this process of exaltation, this &ldquo;coiled serpentine&rdquo;, this kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, will have to pass through five important plexi. These five important plexi are the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra, the sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra, the man&#x301;ipu&#x301;ra cakra, the ana&#x301;hata cakra, and the vishuddha cakra. These are the five plexi controlling physicality, controlling the physical world. The mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra is represented by Sahadeva, the sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra is represented by Nakula, the man&#x301;ipu&#x301;ra cakra is represented by Arjuna, the ana&#x301;hata cakra by Bhima, and the vishuddha cakra by Yudhisthira. And above that is the site of the mind. What mind? The sentient mind. When the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii reaches here [mid-point between the eyebrows], a person attains the qualified stance, savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi. So to attain this stance of savikalpa, the  kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, that is, the jiiva shakti, the sleeping divinity, will have to pass through these five stages. So these five stages are the Pain&#x32D;ca Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava [Five Pandavas].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->So on the one side this kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii passing through five cakras; on the other side, the one hundred agents of Dhritarastra. They are fighting against each other. This fight is the fight of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;samara. And where is this fight taking place? On Dharmaks&#x301;etra, Kuruks&#x301;etra. What is dharmaks&#x301;etra? Your physical body is dharmaks&#x301;etra. Without this physical body you cannot practise dharma. After leaving this physical body, you will not be able to follow dharma, to do dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. So your physical body &ndash; this body &ndash; is dharmaks&#x301;etra. That is, this fight is taking place within this body. And kuruks&#x301;etra? Kuru means, in Sanskrit, &ldquo;do&rdquo; &ndash; it is the imperative mood, second person, singular number, of the root verb kr. Kuru means &ldquo;do&rdquo; &ndash; anujin&#x32D;a&#x301; [imperative]. [And ks&#x301;etra means &ldquo;field&rdquo;.] Kuruks&#x301;etra means the field which is always saying, &ldquo;Kuru, kuru, kuru&#8230; do something, do something, do something, do something!&rdquo; Ks&#x301;etra-kuru &ndash; &ldquo;the ks&#x301;etra of deeds&rdquo;. So kuruks&#x301;etra &ndash; this universe is Kuruks&#x301;etra, this world is Kuruks&#x301;etra. And your body is Dharmaks&#x301;etra. And this war between the Pandavas and the Kaoravas, the one hundred Kaoravas and the five Pandavas, is taking place within this Dharmaks&#x301;etra and within this vast Kuruks&#x301;etra. This fight will never come to an end! In individual life, when the Pandavas win, you will attain salvation, but in collective life, such a salvation will never come, it will go on forever&#8230; In your individual life, you will do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and attain salvation. And with your spiritual force, with your intellectual force, with your physical force, you are to serve society, you are to render selfless service to suffering humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
