<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Propensities and Prama&#x301;&rdquo;. As you know, propensities are of two kinds: introversial<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> propensities or Sam&#x301;vrtti and extroversial propensities or Pravrtti. What is propensity (Vrtti)? In the case of introversial propensities, the mind moves towards any spiritual pabulum, any psycho-spiritual pabulum, or in certain cases, any developed psychic pabulum, and the flow of the mind is through different channels of mind and psycho-spiritual body. But the ultimate goal is always spiritual although it may apparently be psycho-spiritual or psychic. The subtler the pabulum, the greater is the elevation of the propensities, as they move towards subtler realms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the case of extroversial propensities, the movement of mind is towards crude psychic, psycho-physical, or physical pabula. And the mind or psycho-physical body moves through different channels of crude mind or crude psycho-physical body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->So propensities mean not only physical or psychophysical propensities, but also psychic and psycho-spiritual propensities. But one must remember that in the realm of spirituality, there are no propensities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the case of microcosm there are both extroversial and introversial propensities (Pravrtti and Samvrtti), but in the case of Macrocosm, there are only introversial ones, no extroversial propensities. The movement  of the propensities in Pravrtti is always extroversial, and as there is nothing outside Macrocosm, there cannot be any extroversial movement at all &ndash; the movement is always introversial, every movement is within the Macrocosmic arena. So in the case of Parama Purus&#x301;a, there are only introversial propensities. Even this expressed quinquelemental universe is within the periphery of the Macrocosmic structure. That is why those who are not cynical or nihilistic in their attitude towards the world, give the philosophical interpretation of the world as &ldquo;Sam&#x301;vrtti bodhicitta&rdquo; (&ldquo;internally projected psychic creation, just like a flower of fig&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the case of both microcosm and macrocosm, there are many propensities, but they come mainly under fifty groups, and all of these fifty groups have both introversial and extroversial movements. So fifty is multiplied by two: (fifty introversial and fifty extroversial propensities) = one hundred. And since these one hundred propensities move towards the ten directions<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->, so one hundred is multiplied by ten: 100 X 10 = 1000. Thus it is said that the Vrttis or propensities (or emanations, manifestations, or flows of propensities) are one thousand in number, and they are all controlled by the multi-propensive plexus of the human body. And the controlling point of this plexus, when pinnacled, touches Parama Purus&#x301;a. That state is the state of perfect psychic equilibrium and equipoise &ndash; the state of Nivrtti. Nivrtti is the silver line of demarcation between Pravrtti or extroversial propensities, and Samvrtti, or introversial propensities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What is Prama&#x301;? Prama&#x301; is psychic equilibrium &ndash; equilibrium in the arena of psychic faculty, and equipoise in the arena of psychic mass. In the final stage of Prama&#x301;, when there is absolute equilibrium and equipoise in psychic faculty and mass, then the triangle of forces, the triangle of equilibrium, remains undisturbed. (Pra &ndash; ma&#x301; + d&#x301;a + t&#x301;a suffix = Prama&#x301;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now, as I have already said, extroversial propensities move towards crude objects, and introversial propensities move towards the Subtlest Entity. As a result of these extroversial propensities, human beings and other living beings maintain their relationship with the earth. Without the existence of extroversial propensities, no living entity can exist properly on earth, and without the existence of introversial propensities, one loses one&#146;s all mental faculties; the psychic flow cannot move upward towards subtler levels of existence, and so the mind gradually becomes crudified like stone or iron. All sense of humanity, all refinement and finer sensibilities are smashed into smithereens: the whole human existence is razed to its crudest foundations. That is why those philosophers who propagate materialism in fact mislead human beings towards extroversial propensities and goad them towards crude objects. Is such a state desirable? Certainly not. As there is no scope of Nivrtti, there is no equilibrium or equipoise, human beings gradually identify themselves with crude physicality or matter like stone, soil etc. In philosophical terms this is called the state of Prakrtiliina, i.e., one becomes one with nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Thus human beings will have to move forward towards the Supreme Entity in the multipropensive plexus along the path of introversial propensities; their minds must be elevated. But extroversial propensities will always remain in all living creatures. So while moving along this path one will have to maintain adjustment with Pravrtti, the extroversial propensities: they cannot be entirely crushed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Even on the path of introversial propensities there are various obstacles, and those obstacles create uneasiness in the human mind. So human beings will have to move towards the Supreme Entity while simultaneously fighting against these obstacles which are known as Pa&#x301;shas and Ripus, internal and external enemies. As a result of their fight, human beings are established in the supreme stance of Nivrtti; and when they attain that pinnacled point in the highest cakra (Parama Pada) in the multipropensive plexus, they reach the supreme goal in human life. Then human beings no longer remain humans: they become veritable gods in human frame.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->It is possible for one and all to reach this supreme stance; it needs only effort, sincerity, and constant intuitional practice, and also a wee bit of the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. You know that divine grace does not depend on any logic; it depends only on the whims of Parama Purus&#x301;a. If Parama Purus&#x301;a is satisfied with your intuitional practice, with your sincere zeal then He may bless you so that you can easily reach that Supreme Stance. But if He does not bless you, then you may attain the goal in theory, but not in practice. Thus everyone will have to seek His blessing in order to reach the goal. We say that spiritual progress is effected by the application of positive microvita; but in fact even microvitum is nothing but the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Let human beings perform virtuous deeds, practise meditation, serve the suffering humanity, and in return they will attain His grace. Then by His grace they will certainly reach their goal when all the introversial propensities and all the extroversial propensities reach the state of Nivrtti. Not only human beings, but also animals and plants will reach that highest stance with the help of His grace. What is not possible with His grace? Everything is possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Human beings cannot demand that Parama Purus&#x301;a grace them; at the most they can only entreat Him for His blessing. It is said, Brahma Krpa&#x301; Hi Kevalam, Guru Krpa&#x301; Hi Kevalam. &ldquo;The grace of Brahma, and the grace of Guru is all.&rdquo; Mahadkrpayaeva bhagavadkrpa&#x301; lesha&#x301;d va&#x301;: &ldquo;The grace of a great person and a wee bit of the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a is required.&rdquo; Not much, but only a wee bit of Cosmic grace will suffice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->You should always remember that you do not belong to an ordinary family, to an ordinary lineage. Those who are the sons and daughters of Parama Purus&#x301;a certainly cannot belong to an ordinary lineage. You have a personal relationship with Parama Purus&#x301;a, and because of that intimate relation you can say to Him, &ldquo;Oh Parama Purus&#x301;a, you know me very well; so if You think it proper, You may bestow Your grace upon me. But it depends on You.&rdquo; Parama Purus&#x301;a certainly has great love and affection for His children; He will certainly want His sons and daughters to reach their ultimate goal. And whatever bliss human beings may attain by reaching that Supreme Stance, I know that in Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s mind the happiness will be even more. Victory to you all.<!-- /block --></p>
