<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Some years ago people used to affix Shriimatya&#x301; instead of Shriimatii or Devya&#x301; instead of Devii, to the name of a widow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Not only was this usage defective from the grammatical viewpoint, it did not add to the dignity of women. What crime have widows done that they should be forbidden to [[use]] Shriimatii or Devii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> with their names? Grammatically, Shriimatya&#x301; means &ldquo;by shriimatii&rdquo;, Devya&#x301; means &ldquo;by devii&rdquo;. The titles Shriimatii and Devii can be attached to the names of all women irrespective of whether they are married, unmarried or widows. There is no social restriction nor any grammatical opposition. The word kuma&#x301;rii, which is sometimes used to denote an unmarried girl, in imitation of the English word &ldquo;Miss&rdquo;, is not an old convention. This was first introduced in Bengal during the days of the Brahmo Samaj movement.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In olden times, Duhita&#x301; was attached to the maiden names of unmarried Kayastha girls and Ja&#x301;ya&#x301; was added to the surnames of married women. Suppose the name of an unmarried girl is Aniita&#x301;. Let us say that she is from the Basu family. In that case, she would write her name as &ldquo;Aniita&#x301; Basu Duhita&#x301;&rdquo;. Suppose she is later married into a Ghosh, Mitra or Dutta family. After her marriage, she will write her name as &ldquo;Aniita&#x301; Mitra Ja&#x301;ya&#x301;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aniita&#x301; Dutta Ja&#x301;ya&#x301;&rdquo;. It still is not a very certain identification of a married lady because, after marriage, she may be Ghosh Ja&#x301;ya&#x301; in a Ghosh family, but does she not continue to be a daughter of the Basu family? It is a historical fact that once she was a child of the Basu family. Hence after marriage, also, she can say that her name is Aniita&#x301; Basu Duhita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In certain communities Veoya&#x301; is added to the names of widows. This is also objectionable and opposed to the dignity of women, because the word veoya&#x301; is derived from the Sanskrit vidhava&#x301; [meaning &ldquo;widow&rdquo;].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Most important, what is the necessity of using terms that discriminate among those who are married, those who are unmarried and those who are widowed? In the case of men, there are no separate words to indicate who is married, unmarried or widowed &ndash; they are not used. So the custom of separately identifying the unmarried women, married women and widows is an undesirable system created by a male-dominated society. It is a bit ironic that in cases where women are compelled to add Da&#x301;sii [&ldquo;servant&rdquo;, &ldquo;slave&rdquo;] to their names, widows are compelled to use Da&#x301;sya&#x301;. It causes laughter mixed with pain.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
