<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This disease has no name in ancient Sam&#x301;skrta. Because of its many similarities with urethritis (meha), this disease has been called &ldquo;prameha&rdquo; in Bengali. But the English word, &ldquo;gonorrhoea,&rdquo; is more commonly used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Symptoms</b>: Burning sensation while urinating; the head of the penis swelling and becoming blood-red; passing of urine drop by drop or with a white or yellowish coloration; seminal discharge of a white colour at first and yellowish in the later stage of the disease; sores around the head of the penis or inside the urinary passage; the penis swelling and becoming hard, etc.; are the indications of gonorrhoea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><b>Causes</b>: According to medical practitioners, this disease is spread by a bacteria called &ldquo;gonococcus.&rdquo; This disease originates with those males or females who are habitually unrestrained and unclean. And those who come in physical contact with such males and females also contract the disease. This disease is contracted by males from prostitutes, and innocent women may in turn be affected through physical contact with those males.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Generally speaking, before this disease is clearly expressed, patients suffer from tickling or itching sensations inside the urinary tract or inside the vagina. And if the patient scratches or in some way manipulates or rubs the genitals, he or she will feel a hot sensation and at the same time some temporary relief.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><b>Treatment</b>: The same as for syphilis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><b>Diet</b>: All nutritious foods that do not cause constipation can be eaten. Drinking of water and lemon juice in sufficient quantity is recommended, and the fasting rules must be observed carefully. Overeating, using intoxicating items, and eating non-vegetarian food should be carefully avoided. The buds, stems, and leaves of ucche, palta, neem (Azadirachta indica A. juss.) and sajne are very good for this disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><b>Dos and don&#146;ts</b>: Though not fatal, gonorrhoea is more harmful than its simple fatality record, because it gradually poisons the life of the entire society. It is not easy to get complete cure from gonorrhoea. This disease sometimes remains latent for a long time, and a little intemperance will make it surface again. Therefore gonorrhoea patients should observe Naes&#x301;t&#x301;hika Brahmacarya (strict abstinence from sexual intercourse) for a long period of time, to avoid having blind or deformed offspring. Even after achieving a complete cure from the disease, strict continence must be maintained for at least three years.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If pus from this illness somehow gets into the eyes, it may destroy the eyesight. So the hands should be washed with soap if they have been contaminated with the pus. The diseased area should be exposed to the rays of the sun after taking a regular bath. If the pain becomes unbearable, soak the genital organ in alum-water as hot as can be endured. For relief from pain, the penis can also be covered with a pack of yellow clay, leaving the urinary passage open. The clay pack can be intermittently replaced by a fresh one, throwing away the old pack as soon as it has dried up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Gonorrhoea generates an unbearable burning pain in the genital organ &ndash; often with stoppage of urine or passing of urine mixed with blood.
