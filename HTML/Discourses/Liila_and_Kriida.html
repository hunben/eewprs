<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Ati-sna&#x301;yukaos&#x301;ika jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na (extra-cerebral knowledge) and su&#x301;tra&#x301;tma&#x301;gata jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na are two types of knowledge. Their expression is possible only in human life. Human life is, therefore, very, very important. Persons who do not utilize their valuable human life in fullest measure can be called anything, but not wise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Do ati-sna&#x301;yukaos&#x301;ika jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and su&#x301;tra&#x301;tma&#x301;gata jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na come within the periphery of absolute knowledge, or do they come within the scope of relative knowledge?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->We call &ldquo;absolute knowledge&rdquo; that which concerns the One Supreme, who is also called sahaja. (Sahaja means &ldquo;one who is born [of oneself]&rdquo;: saha means &ldquo;together&rdquo; and ja means &ldquo;born&rdquo;. Alternatively, sahaja&#x301;ta.) And that is why ati-sna&#x301;yukaos&#x301;ika jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and su&#x301;tra&#x301;tma&#x301;gata jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na both are relative knowledge &ndash; because they are dependent on the relative factors of time, space, and person and are not concerned with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->For example, in about 1920 there were only the three districts of Dacca, Mymensinghganj and [Bakharganj] in Dacca Division, but because of change in time during the span of fifty years, now, that is, in 1969 AD, places and persons have also changed and there are four districts in Dacca Division. [Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; cited a few other examples also.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Change occurs in a collection of waves of different wavelengths. Change in waves results in the change in their wavelengths, and that causes change in things. When you get vibrated by particular visual waves under particular circumstances, you see one thing. What you saw may be correct or may not be correct. That depends completely on the circumstances in which you saw the thing. The unit mind and the Cosmic Mind both emanate light-waves and also accept them. As when you think of an elephant, you know that the elephant created in your imagination is not true. Similarly, the elephant that is created in the imagination of the Lord is not true for Him but is true for humans. What the Lord creates in His imaginative flow is liila&#x301; for humans, as humans do not know the cause of that creation. And what jiivas create through their own imaginative power is kriida&#x301; for them. Whatever you create is a mere reflection of His liila&#x301; and not the original. You cannot create anything original. Things created by your kriida&#x301; must have resemblance to one or other thing created in His liila&#x301; or a mixture of those things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The Lord creates original things in His liila&#x301;. When the jiiva is in his or her jiivabha&#x301;va (is individuality-conscious), his internal waves are imaginary for him, but external things are true for him, as they are the result of His liila&#x301; or His sam&#x301;kalpa. Humans perceive external things according to their reactive momenta or sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. But while you are experiencing a dream, what you think in the dream [is as true for you as what you see externally while awake]. When through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; your mind gets unified with that of the Lord, this external world becomes imaginary for you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The universe is but the play of vibrations and can be controlled by developing control over these vibrations. When the causal factor is known to you, it is kriida&#x301;, and when the causal factor is not known to you, it is liila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->When you bring under your control this world which is made by the vibrating waves of His liila&#x301;, this world is subject for you. Yours is a subject without any object and that is pralaya<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in unit life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->If Sagun&#x301;a Brahma withdraws Its thought-waves, this world will be destroyed and there will occur pralaya in collective life. But pralaya in the collective life of the universe is impossible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->[Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; demonstrated how by controlling vibrations and by effecting changes in the wavelengths of these vibrations, existent things disappear and non-existent things appear. He also demonstrated the display of internal vision (antardrs&#x301;t&#x301;i, or antarya&#x301;mitva). At last he concluded:] Be one with Him and know everything. If you want to know all, try to know One. If you try to know all, you won&#146;t be able to know anything.<!-- /block --></p>
