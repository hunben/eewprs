<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Human Expressions<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->First, human expressions. Each and every living entity expresses something from its central point. Human expressions are, in that respect, many in the physical stratum: you sing, you laugh, you work, you do so many things. But all these expressions come from a single entity and a single controlling point. There are several sub-stations, but the controlling station is the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I said in Timmern [Germany] that the controlling one is called the noumenal entity and the expressed ones are the phenomenal entities. You are one boy, Liila&#x301;nanda &ndash; Liila&#x301;nanda speaks, he dances, he jumps, he swims, he rolls on the ground &ndash; all those expressions are his phenomenal expressions. But his entity, the controlling entity, the entity from which so many actional waves emanate, is what? In this respect, in the small world of Liila&#x301;nanda, Liila&#x301;nanda is the noumenal entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the sphere of criminology the noumenal entity is falsehood, and all other corrupt practices, all other criminal activities, are phenomenal expressions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the case of falsehood [as the noumenal entity], sin and crime coincide. In all other [cases] there are two different entities.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> That which is not supported by the law of the land is called crime, and that which is not supported by cardinal human principles is sin. But you know, the law of the land is a creation of certain persons of the land, that is, of those who are elected or selected, representative or king. There are so many people who create the law of the land. Their decision may or may not be correct, but the definition of crime varies from country to country, locality to locality. In America, in the USA, the definition of crime varies from state to state, even in the same country.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You know in Japan, to commit suicide is neither a sin nor a crime. In India to commit suicide is a sin under certain circumstances, not always: when one commits suicide for the welfare of a large number of the populace, then it is not treated as sin; when it is a personal issue, it is treated as sin. And so far as crime is concerned in India, it is a crime to try to commit suicide, but it is not a crime to commit suicide. If one is trying to commit suicide, he or she [can be punished] by the government. In Britain [if one tries] to commit suicide, it is a crime, and if one commits suicide, even then it is a crime, and in that case also the person will be punished &ndash; his or her property will be forfeited. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The definition of crime varies from land to land, but the cardinal human values are the same, not only for this planet but everywhere in the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Just now I said that it is falsehood [a noumenal cause] where sin and crime coincide. Now in the case of human expressions, a single entity, a person, is the noumenal cause, and there are so many phenomenal expressions. All those phenomenal expressions depend on the single noumenal entity and on the standard of the noumenal entity. If a person is good, his or her expressions are also good. So what we require is that the standard of each and every human being be raised. If all the bricks of the room are strong, the room will also be strong; so if all the individuals are strong, if at least they are moralists, all humanity will be benefited by it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->(1) Now there are so many human expressions in the physical stratum. We do so many things, and for these human expressions in the physical stratum we have got a physical body. A human body is the most complicated biological structure. There are so many propensities in the human mind, and for expression of many propensities in the psychic stratum there are so many nerve cells, so many centres of activity, so many nuclei in the realm of the mind. And for outer expression and for reception of waves from outer worlds, human bodies have got so many nerve fibres &ndash; a human body is the most complicated biological structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->(2) And humans have been blessed with certain excellent structures. There is a heaven-and-hell difference between an animal body and a human body. The most developed animal bodies &ndash; those of apes of certain groups &ndash; are very developed, but there is a heaven-and-hell difference between their bodies and a human body, and it is [not] very difficult to find the difference between the most developed animal and the most undeveloped human being. So the human body is not only physical but is an excellent medium of higher psychic expressions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->(3) And the third human expression which is lacking in other animals is the spiritual expression. A person who has high taste in the aesthetic sphere may forget eating and drinking, and a person who has developed deep love for the Supreme Being forgets all his psychic pursuits even. If you insult a dog, and the next moment call the dog to take food, it will accept that food from your hands. But if you insult a person and ask that person to take food, even a very delicious food, he or she, in order to maintain prestige, or save himself or herself from humiliation, will not accept. Human beings even commit suicide due to psychic pressure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Animals, low-grade animals, also sometimes commit suicide. Certain aquatic animals commit suicide. But that is not due to psychic pressure, it is due to inborn instinct. Whales of certain groups and mice of certain groups do commit suicide, collective suicide.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now human expressions are trifarious &ndash; physical expression, psychic expression and spiritual expression. The spiritual expression is the highest and subtlest expression of human existence. And here lies the speciality of humans. In the physical stratum each and every human being is a species. Nobody is just like others. Even in a small family, brothers and sisters vary from one another. No two face-cuttings are the same. On the psychic level humans are divided into several kinds of ideologies, and they fight amongst themselves, just for ideology, and ideology remains in some sphere of abstraction, and they quarrel amongst themselves. They quarrel regarding religion, regarding different isms with different views, regarding sports. One person will say, &ldquo;My team will win,&rdquo; while another will say, &ldquo;But my team [can] fight&rdquo; &ndash; in football or any other sport. And there was one very important play in Spain, toros or something like that &ndash; &ldquo;bullfighting&rdquo;. People were very much interested in it, and they [the fans] used to fight amongst themselves, and it is not a physical fight, it is a psychic fight. But in the realm of spirituality there cannot be any fight, because the Supreme Goal is one, a singular entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So spiritualism, rather spirituality, is not only the highest and noblest human speciality, but is the only unifying point, the only unifying platform, for the entire human society. There may be so many human races   Negroid, Austric, Mongoloid, Caucasian. Amongst Mongolians there are so many Malays, Japano- and Sino- [blendings], Tibeto-Indians, so many of those. Amongst Caucasians there are Nordics, Scandinavians; Alpines in middle Europe; Mediterraneans in Italy, south France, Spain and Portugal. But human society is a singular entity &ndash; humans belong to the same society. So here the Supreme Noumenal Entity is the spiritual nave. Now humans of this last portion of the twentieth century should strengthen that nave, should strengthen that Supreme Noumenal Entity, and on the basis of this Supreme Noumenal Entity lies their universal fraternity &ndash; they are children of the same Supreme Father. The Supreme Progenitor is one; His children are many in number. If the children quarrel amongst themselves on petty affairs, this will certainly not satisfy the Supreme Father. He has given humans, that is, the human body, a developed cranium, a developed brain, developed nerve cells and nerve fibres. Humans should utilize them properly. There should be maximum utilization of all your assets, and by utilizing your assets, you, in your individual and collective capacities, will be assets to human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Human Movement<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now, human movement. What is movement? Movement means change of place. This bolster is here; I bring it here. There is change of place. So I have done some work; some action has been done. Insofar as actions and expressions are concerned, that is, human approaches are concerned, they are four in number:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->(1) [Regarding human existence] in the physical stratum, whatever you do in the physical stratum is your physical activity. Whatever you do to maintain your body, to maintain your life, to maintain proper security of individual and collective life, is your physical action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->(2) Then again, you are not merely an animal: simply eating, drinking and sleeping is not everything for a human. A human has a subtler life, a more charming life, a more fascinating life, so your physical existence moves towards your psychic existence, and this movement is your [quest] for higher life, your [quest] for subtler life, that is, your physico-psychic movement, starting from the physical level and moving towards the psychic level. Your physico-psychic activities are architecture, literature, dance, music &ndash; they are all your physico-psychic movement. And this movement is from crude to subtle, starting from the cruder arena and moving towards the subtler arena. That&#146;s why in Ananda Marga I encourage this physico-psychic movement: because it will help you in moving towards the subtler world, in moving towards the supreme spiritual goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->(3) Then the third human [movement] is on the pure psychic level. Your thought-waves, your subtler thoughts, your aesthetic tastes, they are all your psychic movement. For physico-psychic movement, I encourage boys and girls to start work in the RAWA [Renaissance Artists&#146; and Writers&#146; Association] movement. You know, to work in RAWA, high-grade intellect is not necessary. But for pure psychic movement, pure psychic development, higher intellect is necessary. And in that realm also humans are to be encouraged, because it is even subtler than physico-psychic movement &ndash; it is pure psychic movement. And for that I encourage the intellectuals of Ananda Marga to form RU [Renaissance Universal] Clubs. Let there be psychic development, let there be clashes and cohesions in the realm of intellect. This will help a person to move from crude to subtle. This is the third expression of the human actional faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->(4) And the last one is psycho-spiritual movement. In psycho-spiritual movement, the action starts on the intellectual level and ends on the spiritual level. And when this movement, this psycho-spiritual development, crosses the last boundary of the sentient principle, that intellectual movement, that is, that intellectual-spiritual progress, is converted into intuitional progress &ndash; that is, you come within the arena of intuition. For intuition you do not require any brain, any nerve cell or any nerve fibre. Where intuition is developed, you become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a, you become omniscient, that is, all-knowing; you do not even require any physical body. You need not go through so many books; the universe is within you, you are all-knowing. You will know the history of Spain without going through books; you will know the geography of Italy without going through books. That is, when your existence comes in close proximity to the existence of Parama Purus&#x301;a, the two nuclei coincide, you get what you want, and that is called salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
