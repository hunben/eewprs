<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today I would like to say something regarding Macrocosmic excellence and vastness, and microcosmic limitations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Whatever we can think of and whatever we cannot think of in this vast universe, whatever we know and whatever we do not know of this vast creation, are all within the Macrocosmic mind. For Him there is nothing external &ndash; everything is being created, maintained and dissolved within His Cosmic Mind. This internal psychic world of Brahma appears to be an external world to the finite entities. They have no capacity whatsoever to properly understand the true nature of this vast external universe. The jiivas (finite entities) with the help of their indriyas (sense organs) receive the subtle tanma&#x301;tras (inference) from this vast external world. According to those inferences, and on the basis of the transformation of their mind stuff (citta), the finite beings try to understand the world. But the true form of the universe remains embedded in the Cosmic Mind. The form of the world assimilated by the unit mind depends entirely on the power of assimilation of the inferences and the proper functioning of the indriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The unit mind can be compared to a water bubble in the vast ocean of the Cosmic Mind. Although these microcosmic imaginations bear some resemblance to those of the original entity, they are not actually original or fundamental emanations. Rather, they are the inferential and nerve-carried reflections or shadows of the Macrocosmic imagination. What we understand by Miccrocosmic mind is only a transformed state of Macrocosmic Consciousness due to the influence of Prakrti. That&#146;s why Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, although He pervades the infinite time, space and individualities, is manifesting the troughs and crests of His psychic wave in and through the three relative factors. This is the reason why none of His manifestations are absolute truth: neither did they exist in the past, nor will they exist in the future. Even a statement regarding the present is not an undisputed axiom. So when properly analysed this expressed universe is nothing but a collection of temporary entities which are undergoing constant metamorphosis according to the sweet will of Prakrti. It would be more precise to call those temporary entities &ldquo;shadowy objects&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;original objects&rdquo; due to their impermanence and total dependence on the Macropsychic imagination. If the mundane objects are mere shadows created by the Supreme Objective Principle, then for the unit minds, this world, perceived as it is through the inferences, is the shadow of the shadows.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the practical world for the substantiation of one&#146;s shadowy existence other shadows cannot be ignored. Nothing of this world should be ignored, because even though everything is a shadow, it is nevertheless a shadow of Brahma (that is a spatial, temporal, or individual manifestation of His cosmic bearing) and not an inconsequential shadow of the relative world. Hence, to ignore this manifested world is out of the question. While trying to ascertain the proper relationship between the subject and the object, we conclude philosophically that we cannot ignore this manifested world. However, it is a fact that not only is the mind constantly preoccupied with objects which are merely shadows of shadows, but is proud of the apparent control it has over those shadows. If one tries to assess the real worth of the microcosmic existence in this world it comes to nothing more than zero!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Whatever the endeavour of the microcosmic mind it can never go beyond the periphery of the Macrocosmic mind. If the unit mind does try to expand its power of imagination beyond the periphery of the Macrocosmic mind it will reach the state of non-existence. There is nothing beyond or outside the Cosmic Mind. The hopes and aspirations, the pains and sorrows, the active endeavour and the inertness of the unit mind are all within the Macropsychic arena, creating temporary ripples within the vast ocean of the Macrocosmic mind. The sum total of the microcosmic restlessness does nothing more than to create a few ripples on the surface of the vast cosmic ocean. When the unit mind ideates on the Cosmic Mind and converts its finite objects of enjoyment (preya) into cosmic benevolence (shreya), then that finite unit being, who was a mere water bubble up till then, expands beyond its limited form and attains the identity of the ocean. That finite entity which initially thought of self-glorification ultimately forgets itself and becomes totally absorbed in the thought of the Cosmic Entity. It no longer proclaims its own greatness, but heralds the excellence of the Supreme Macrocosmic Entity. The unit beings, due to ignorance, look upon these numerous animate and inanimate entities as finite expressions of that Infinite Entity. Later, in the process of cultivation of knowledge and action, they begin to understand that they are the multifarious expressions of that Infinite Entity. Still later when they reach the pinnacle of devotion they see the Supreme Entity is everything. At that moment all feelings of discrimination evaporate, all concerns about real and unreal, propriety of action and impropriety of action, vanish completely from the mind. There remains only the singular urge to serve the Lord with utmost devotion. When the devotee surrenders his or her entire existential feeling at the altar of the Almighty, there remains no further differences, only an unbroken, sweet blissful ocean in which the Supreme Entity manifests Himself endlessly in His innumerable waves. The sweet relation between the devotee and the Lord provides an unending impetus to the ocean of joy. The Supreme Lord remains absorbed in His divine play with innumerable divine manifestations. What is playful for Him is meaningful for the unit entity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The Divine Entity has an infinite number of heads, an uncountable number of heads.&rdquo; Each entity which expresses intellectuality is one of His heads. No single head can be described as &ldquo;His head&rdquo; because His head is the totality of all heads. Similarly, the Supreme Entity has innumerable eyes which assist Him in seeing every entity of the universe in innumerable ways from innumerable angles of vision. You cannot do anything unknown to Him. Likewise with the help of His innumerable mental feet He moves throughout the entire moving universe. The instrument through which movement is performed is called caran&#x301;a (foot). He is the caran&#x301;a of the limitless objects of this universe. Of course, these countless heads, eyes and feet of His have no physical existence. When you want to see something in your mind you use your mental eyes. Brahma, with His mental eyes, is watching. His mental indriyas continuing the creation, preservation and destruction of this universe. Just as you can use your mental head to cook food and your mental tongue to enjoy its taste, in the same way Brahma is enjoying His creation internally &ndash; there is nothing outside or beyond Him. Most of His mental creations are external to you, but all the created objects, including you, are internal to Him. When you perform an action it is either psycho-physical or psychic, but in the case of the Supreme Entity every action is psychic. This quinquelemental world, however vast it may appear to you, originated from Macrocosmic mind-stuff (citta) surrounded by the static portion of His mind, and that&#146;s why it is circumscribed by limitations. This extremely vast Cosmic citta is not Brahma in His entirety; He is vaster than that. This great universe lies in a remote corner of His endless mind. So the rs&#x301;i says that Brahma exists within and surrounding the entire universe. As the Macrocosmic Ahamtattva (Cosmic doer-I) and Buddhitattva (Cosmic existential I) are not bound by the demarcating lines of the static principle, they are infinite; and His witnessing faculty which is inseparably associated with this infinite Macrocosmic mind is also infinite. But His Knowing Faculty is also not His total entity. The rs&#x301;i has expressed unequivocally that He is established in the Supreme Blissful Stance beyond the domain of the witnessing faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Some confusion arises regarding the meaning of the word dasha&#x301;ungulam&#x301; used in the above shloka &ndash; Some scholars have given a rather peculiar interpretation that Brahma resides at a place ten fingers above His universe. The actual significance of the term is best illustrated in the yogic cult. The non-attributional supreme rank of Parama Purus&#x301;a is located at the pineal plexus (sahasra&#x301;ra cakra), ten fingers above the pituitary plexus (lunar plexus or ajin&#x32D;a cakra, the location of mind as well as kut&#x301;astha caetanya). By trying to describe the location of the Cosmic Consciousness in relation to human physiology, the rs&#x301;i wants to convey that the cosmic excellence does not end in the mind. Of course, the mind is a powerful controlling entity &ndash; being the controller of the five fundamental factors of the human body it is the controller of the five lowest cakras &ndash; yet it is only located in a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra. The seat of Cosmic Consciousness is located ten fingers above the seat of mind at the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra. During sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; when the serpentine power (kundalini) pierces the pituitary plexus one attains savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi. Still higher, at sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii shakti becomes one with Parama Shiva, and one attains the non-attributional stance (kaevalya sama&#x301;dhi).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Suppose you are imagining Bhagalpur railway station within your mental arena. Not only can you see the travellers rushing through the station, you can also see their individual minds. The Macrocosmic mind (Sagun&#x301;a Brahma) knows whatever is happening in the entire universe for His cosmic imagination flows everywhere. He knows and understands every thought-wave, every idea of the innermost recesses of the unit minds in the universe. Apart from being the witness to all events He is also the witness to every microcosmic thought-wave, whether good or bad. He is also aware of every incident of the past, present and future. Time is a relative factor dependent on space and individuality. These relativities of space, time and individuality are created out of His Cosmic Mind, thanks to His grace, and will continue to be created in the future. As He is not limited by the demarcation lines of the time factor He is the witness of all ages. An ordinary person may not be able to detect the hypocrisy of a sinner who pretends to be a decent man, but the Supreme Entity is well aware of that hypocrisy. It is a futile attempt by the hypocrite to throw dust into the eyes of that Infinite Entity, the Witness of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Entity whose thought world is this vast universe is not only the Universal Witness but the Universal Controller too. Even the meanest of the mean, the nastiest of the nasty, and the most infernal insects are not deprived of His grace, are not beyond His controlling touch. Conversely, even the greatest of the great, the overlord of the sea-girt earth, and the most venerable and distinguished people are powerless before Him, behumbled by His awesome personality. The sweet springs of nectar flow at the behest of His towering personality.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Whenever something is imagined the sensory and motor organs become activated by its inferential vibrations. In dynamic thought processes there is mental agitation: when you imagine accepting something, your mental hands start working; when you imagine seeing or hearing something your mental eyes and ears start functioning. Perhaps you know that after deep introspection the subtle mind takes over from the crude mind as the controlling entity of the physical body and indriyas. In sorrowful dreams people burst out crying, in happy dreams they laugh. The reason is the same in both cases: due to the temporary cessation of the functioning of the crude mind, the dreamers &ldquo;see&rdquo; the dreams with their mental eyes and take them to be the reality, and their minds get completely overpowered as a result. Just as in deep introspection or sleep people laugh, cry, sit, stand, sleep, eat and drink, etc. with the help of their mental indriyas, similarly Brahma, the author of this vast cosmic imagination moves everywhere within the universe, His vast Macropsychic arena, with His mental feet. He catches all the objects of this universe with His all-pervasive mental hands. He is the intellect, the intuition and the witnessing faculty of the innumerable created objects and hence we can say that He has His all-pervasive mental heads. Similarly, as the witness of all the macropsychic entities, He has innumerable mental eyes; and to hear their words, spoken or secret, and every loud or soft sound, He has His all-pervasive ears. He exists surrounding all objects with His own identity. You can keep nothing secret or private from Him - He knows more about you than you know about yourself. Behind all His pervasive faculties of knowing, understanding and hearing lies His Macropsychic stance. Hence, no temporal, spatial or personal factor, circumscribed by limiting bondages, can be accepted as Purnabrahma (Brahma in His entirety). The great mystic Ramaprasad has said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->To give a limited form to that unlimited entity is a grave error; to present crude offerings to the Supreme Entity is meaningless. For ideation on Brahma there is no need to spend even a cent. If the worship of Brahma was a very expensive affair then none but a handful of billionaires would have been able to do it. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the birthright of all people just like light, air, and water; the Infinite Entity is the common patrimony of all, not the private property of any particular individual.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In each indriya a particular principle is dominant, sometimes the sentient, sometimes the mutative, sometimes the static. During the Bhagalpur Dharma Maha Cakra I said that a merit or demerit in a particular indriya is determined by its capacity to assimilate inferences. Of all the, inferences, sound and touch are very subtle and so their receptors, the ears and the skin, are dominated by the sentient principle. The smell and taste tanma&#x301;tras are very crude and hence their receptors, the tongue and the nose, are dominated by the static principle. The remaining form tanma&#x301;tra, which is neither crude nor subtle, has the eyes as its receptor and is dominated by the mutative principle. Regarding the motor organs, the vocal cords and the hands are dominated by the sentient principle, the legs by the mutative principle, and the anus and genital organs by the static principle. To perform crude physical actions, or to assimilate the inferences of crude objects the importance of the indriyas is undeniable. As the Supreme Entity doesn&#146;t require to be associated with any external physical object, He does not require any sensory or motor organs. To create or destroy an image within His Macropsychic arena He uses His mental indriyas which have the qualities He requires to guide the whole universe with His mental power. Even though He doesn&#146;t have a single physical indriya, He possesses the qualities of all the indriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->He is the controller of those entities who are endowed with individual feeling or awareness and those which are not. Each land every object of this universe is floating on the crests and troughs of His psychic waves: the original wave emanates from Him only. He is the source as well as the controller of all waves. He provides impetus to all entities of His mental creation and so He is Iisha or Controller. Here a question may arise: Being the source of momentum for the created entities, why do some entities behave like gods, while others act like demons? Can He be accused of partiality? No, that is impossible. When everything is His mental creation, why should He be accused of partiality. Jiiva&#x301;tma or unit consciousness is His reflection and the unit mind is the reflecting plate or mirror. The clearer the mirror, the clearer its reflection of the Original Entity. If the mirror is dirty it will not be able to reflect the brilliance of the Original Entity, but for that He should not be blamed. His waves emanate from Him as usual but due to the defect in the mirror the vibrationtion cannot be properly reflected. So if the unit metal mirror cannot properly receive the impetus from Him, Parama&#x301;tma should not be accused of partiality. He is just like a magnet which attracts all pieces of iron towards it except the rusty ones. Some people respond to His call, some do not. That&#146;s why I say, &ldquo;O sa&#x301;dhakas make your [[minds]] free from impurities. Follow the path of cosmic ideation. You need not conduct any ritualistic worship or observe meaningless vows, or undertake hazardous pilgrimages. Just try sincerely to remove the dirt from your mind. When you feel the attraction of the Supreme Entity in every atom and molecule of your existence, you will realize that He is showering His grace equally on all&rdquo;. Some wrongly think that Parama Purus&#x301;a bestows His grace with partiality; but in reality all are equally dear to Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Some sa&#x301;dhakas experience the Supreme Attracting Entity as effulgence, others as on&#x32D;m&#x301;kara, the primordial cosmic sound. Those determined to receive His momentum feel attracted towards Him, and, advancing along the path of effulgence, finally merge their existential-I feeling in the ocean of His cosmic effulgence. Those who realize Him in the form of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra&#x301;, advance along the path of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra&#x301; and finally become ensconced in Purus&#x301;ottama, the source of on&#x32D;m&#x301;kara, the nucleus of all emanations. The unit entities in which His divine expression are fully manifest are said to have attained the height of fulfilment physically, psychically and spiritually. They realize in the core of their hearts that the entire human life is a &ldquo;sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;&rdquo;. Each and every mundane action of theirs, such as eating, sleeping, dressing and even breathing, are an integral part of that &ldquo;sadhana&#x301;&rdquo;. But those who have not understood the Supreme Entity and His creation in this light will say, &ldquo;Well I don&#146;t steal, and I don&#146;t tell lies, so why should I do Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.&rdquo; They think that moralism alone is the highest goal in this world &ndash; but remember, moralism is not the goal &ndash; it is the starting point. If the Supreme Controller is disowned, the so-called morality of the moralist can be lost at any moment, and does get lost. Such people end up pretending to be moralists externally but internally become immoralists. This is the height of hypocrisy in the society. The different spheres of social life, such as education, industry and trade, commerce and politics are overcrowded with this class of human brutes, because of a lack of dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Those who are compelled to become moralists under social pressure, or those who put on a show of being moralists from the rostrum or pulpit, or in short stories, novels and poetry, are actually misguided fools, however intelligent they may think themselves to be. Inflated with the vanity of pedantry they lose all their common sense and behave like lunatics. And the worst thing about them is that to fulfill their petty narrow interests they hoodwink the innocent, simple, unwary, gullible masses. Internally they wish to become ministers to serve their selfish interests, outwardly they say they want to serve the society in the interest of the common people, Their one intention is to fill their pockets with money, but they publicly pronounce that they want to follow the gospels of Dharma. Oh human beings, beware of these impostors. Try to apply your power of discrimination to know who are your friends and who are your foes. You should never allow yourselves to fall victim to these political and religious traders. Remember that every individual has immense potentialities. Tap those potentialities and advance resolutely along the spiritual path. If you cannot stand erect on the solid ground on the strength of your spiritual power, no one can support you with a prop. You need not employ a paid agent to help you express your innate potentialities. Oh human beings, you alone are the proper judges of your mind. You are quite aware of how much filth lies stinking in the corner of your mind.<!-- /block --></p>

You are unable to perceive the inferences of very subtle objects, such as atoms or molecules, nor can you see something very big. The Cosmic Entity is much subtler than the subtlest objects of the universe because they are the temporal, spatial and individual expression of His Macropsychic conation.

Verbal repetition means to call Parama Purus&#x301;a loudly on the supposition that He is far, far away. In muttering repetition there is a slight movement of the lips causing the incantation to be audible to oneself only. In the third category of incantation it is the mind which utters and listens to the incantation; no one even gets the least hint that you are engaged in iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na (cosmic ideation &ndash; a vital part of the spiritual cult).

The A&#x301;tman or unit consciousness does not lie hidden in humans and animals alone; it also lies within the trees and plants because they too have minds, they too have existential awareness. This fact was known to the ancient sages, and proved scientifically at the turn of the century by the famous scientist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose. The reflection of Purus&#x301;ottama on the unit existential-I feeling is called jiiva&#x301;tma. To attain Him you will have to look within your existential-I feeling.

Any entity only becomes decrepit when it comes in contact with external objects through action. As Brahma is the Singular Entity having no second entity or action external to Him, He is beyond the state of decrepitude. In every action the presence of three factors is indispensable: the doer, the deed, and the instrument of deed. Parama Purus&#x301;a is immutable (Ajara) because the deed and its instrument originate from His, the doer&#146;s psychic body. As time space and individuality do not exist externally to Him, the vibrations in the state of existence or functioning remain unsubstantiated. He is Pura&#x301;tma, the Ancient One, who existed before the beginning of creation and exists even today. He is sarva&#x301;tma, the Soul of all souls, the One reflected on the existential-I feeling of all entities. He is reflected where the existential-I feeling is developed and where it is latent. All objects, even sand, stone, bricks and wood, big or small, animate or inanimate, are blessed with the reflection of Parama Purus&#x301;a.

When the unit mind pursuing the path of intuitional science realizes the greatness of the Macrocosmic Mind it merges itself into the Macrocosmic Stance, ripping apart the bondages of virtue and vice, hope and despair. At that stage no grief, no distortion, can affect or contaminate it. When the microcosm totally surrenders itself to the Macrocosmic excellence the jiiva&#x301;tma also becomes free from microcosmic bondages and its separate individuality gets merged into the Macrocosmic vastness.<!-- /block --></p>
