<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This shloka is from the <I>Yajurveda</I>. The <I>Yajurveda</I> is mainly concerned with rites. The composition of the Vedas began roughly 15,000 years ago. In those ancient times written script was not yet known. Written script was invented much later. During that era the <I>rs&#x301;is</I>, seers of truth, who composed the Vedas taught their pupils the <I>rks</I> [hymns] they made, and by listening to them those pupils committed them to memory. Since written script did not exist in that era, there was no opportunity to write books; so rather than reading books, knowledge and teachings had to be committed to memory while listening to them. In Sanskrit <I>shruti</I> means &ldquo;ear&rdquo;. The word <I>shruti</I> is derived by adding the suffix <I>ktin</I> to the verbal root <I>shru</I>. For this reason, another name for the Vedas is <I>Shruti</I>. <I>Veda</I> means &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; and <I>shruti</I> means &ldquo;that knowledge which is acquired by listening.&rdquo; This was the system in those olden days.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The first script was invented almost five and a half thousand years ago. The name of that ancient script was Saendhavii. It was first invented in Mahenjodaro. Many ancient scripts have still not yet been deciphered. The next two scripts that we know of are the Bra&#x301;hmii and Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii scripts. Bra&#x301;hmii script was written from right to left, like Urdu, while Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii was written from left to right, like modern Indian scripts. However, during the reign of the emperor Ashok, the use of Bra&#x301;hmii script was prevalent in all of north India. Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii was little used by comparison. For this reason Ashok used Bra&#x301;hmii script on his stone inscriptions. In Laoria and other areas one sees the exclusive use of Bra&#x301;hmii script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->After the invention of written script, people began to think about the fact that up until then the Vedas had not been written down. How much can really be committed to memory by listening? In this way, it was discovered that a large portion of the Vedas had disappeared. How much can human beings commit to memory? Sixty percent of the Vedas remained and forty percent was lost and will never be recovered. So everyone realized that the Vedas had to be written down, and while doing so it remained to be seen which portion of the Vedas was the oldest, which portion was from the middle period and which portion was the most recent. In this way, they were classified and collected according to the antiquity of their composition, and divided into the ancient, middle and recent portions. The most ancient portion is called the <I>Rgveda</I>, because each <I>shloka</I> is called a <I>rk</I> in this Veda. The name of the middle-period portion is the <I>Yajurveda</I>, and that of the most recent portion, the <I>Atharvaveda</I>. <I>Atharva</I> was the name of one <I>Rs&#x301;i</I>. Since the inspiration and enthusiasm for the composition of this portion came from him, it was given the name <I>Atharvaveda</I>. In Sanskrit <I>atharva</I> means &ldquo;aged, very old&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The <I>Yajurveda</I> is concerned mostly with rites. The word <I>yajuh</I> means &ldquo;that in which rites are predominant.&rdquo; The pandits accomplished in the <I>Yajurveda</I> were called <I>ardhvayyu</I>, in the <I>Rgveda</I>, <I>rtvika</I>, and in the <I>Atharvaveda</I>, <I>brahman&#x301;</I>. Now each of the three Vedas contain songs. In old Sanskrit songs were called <I>sa&#x301;ma</I>. These song portions were separated from the three Vedas and collected together into a fourth Veda, which was given the name <I>Sa&#x301;mveda</I>. The <I>Sa&#x301;mveda</I> was not originally a Veda; it is only a collection of the songs from the other three Vedas. The pandits well-versed in <I>Sa&#x301;mveda</I> used to be called <I>Udga&#x301;ta&#x301;</I>, and of the four kinds of pandits, those who used to preserve the link amongst the four were called <I>Hota&#x301;</I>. In certain areas of India one can still find people with the surname &ldquo;Hota&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->We were discussing the <I>Atharvaveda</I>. The <I>Atharvaveda</I> is also quite ancient. There is a <I>shloka</I> in this Veda [<I>Yajurveda</I>] <I></I>about <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Apa&#x301;n&#x301;ipa&#x301;do javano grahiita&#x301; pashyatacaks&#x301;u&#x301;h sa shrn&#x301;otyakarn&#x301;ah;<br>Sah vetti vedyam&#x301; na ca tasya&#x301;sti vetta&#x301; tamahuragryam&#x301; purus&#x301;am&#x301; maha&#x301;ntam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><I>Apa&#x301;n&#x301;ipa&#x301;do javano grahiita&#x301;</I>. <I>A</I> denotes negation; <I>pa&#x301;n&#x301;i</I> means &ldquo;palm of the hand,&rdquo; for example, a <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [musical instrument resembling the violin] in the hand or <I>pa&#x301;n&#x301;i</I> is <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;pa&#x301;n&#x301;i</I>. Similarly, one who does not have <I>pa&#x301;n&#x301;i or pa&#x301;da</I>, that is, hands or feet, is <I>apa&#x301;n&#x301;ipa&#x301;da</I>. <I>Javano grahiita&#x301;</I> &ndash; &ldquo;although He wanders about [without feet], He accepts whatever anyone offers [without hands].&rdquo; This seems a little strange to hear. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> has no hands. Still, if someone offers him something out of love then He accepts it. Let us suppose someone in Patna offers something to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Wherever He might be, He accepts it, yet He is <I>apa&#x301;n&#x301;i</I>. Similarly, He is <I>apa&#x301;da</I>, &ldquo;He has no feet&rdquo;, nevertheless He moves easily from one place to another within the blink of an eye. He is <I>acaks&#x301;u</I>, He has no eyes, yet He looks all around Him like a lion and sees everything in the universe. He is <I>akarn&#x301;a</I>, He has no ears, yet He hears whatever is audible in this universe and whatever is inaudible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This creation is limited. It is only the expression of <I>Parama Pursus&#x301;a</I>. At the time of performing any kind of action, a relationship is established between the person and the object. For example, if something is accepted then a relationship is established with that object. If I move down a path then a relationship is established with that path. Let us say a person arrives in Chiriatand from Patna. Here a relationship has been established between the mind and Chiriatand. If, in the next moment, one wants to go mentally from Chiriatand to Patliputra Colony, then one does not require any feet. Similarly, everything in this world is within the mind of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->For human beings there are two worlds, the internal world and the external world. In the internal world, the psychic world, a person gets whatever they want in that very moment, because in that case everything can be done with only the mind, without the need of the motor and sensory organs. In the external world this is not so. There the different organs, such as the eyes, feet, hands, etc., are necessary. But for <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> there is only one world, the internal world. There is no external world. Say, for example, someone thinks that they cannot understand <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> through logic. But my internal self says, &ldquo;he is with me,&rdquo; and that very same moment <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> hears what you say. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> needs no auditory organ in order to hear what anyone is thinking. Similarly, he does not need hands in order to accept something. He does not need eyes in order to see something, because everything is within his mind. Everything is born out of his psychic imagination. Let us say someone, while doing <I>gurupu&#x301;ja&#x301;</I>, says <I>tava dravyam&#x301; jagatguro tubhyameva samarpaye</I> [and offers something mentally]. Here <I>Parama Pursus&#x301;a</I> does not need any worldly hands in order to accept whatever is offered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><I>Sah vetti vedyam&#x301;</I>. He knows everything knowable in this universe, but no one is able to know him. Here the word <I>vedya</I> has been used for &ldquo;knowable&rdquo;. The act of knowing means the subjectivization of external objectivities. Generally we get a rough conception of an external object by seeing it, however this sensory perception is not knowledge. Here <I>vedya</I> means &ldquo;knowable&rdquo;, &ldquo;capable of being known&rdquo;. <I>Vedya</I> is not the same for <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> and the living being, because in the case of the living being, knowing takes place both in the mental world and in the external world, while for <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> there is no external world. For this reason he sees everything with his mental eyes. He knows what is written on any page of any book. So he is the knower of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><I>Na ca tasya&#x301;sti vetta&#x301;</I>. No one is his knower, because <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the subject of all and everything is his object. Normally the subject knows the object but the object cannot know the subject. Thus it is correctly said<I>: na ca tasya&#x301;sti vetta&#x301;</I>. But there is one thing to be pointed out &ndash; when a spiritual aspirant meditates on <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> becomes the sole subject of the spiritual aspirant&#146;s mind. So, it is only through sadhana that the living being can know <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Generally, when a person sits in meditation they make one mistake. They think: &ldquo;I am seeing <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> in front of me.&rdquo; Rather than think this they should think: &ldquo;I am sitting in front of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> doing meditation and <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is seeing this or knowing this, that is, He knows everything of mine, nothing can be hidden from Him.&rdquo; Thus the living being is a finite entity and <I>Parama Pursus&#x301;a</I> is an infinite, endless entity. Through efforts a human being can know one &#133; two &#133; three &#133; four, even many things, but he cannot know the infinite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><I>Tamahuragryam&#x301; purus&#x301;am&#x301; maha&#x301;ntam</I>. That is, this <I>purus&#x301;a</I> is called the <I>maha&#x301;na</I> or greatest <I>pursus&#x301;a</I>, the original <I>purus&#x301;a</I>, the representative <I>purus&#x301;a</I>. The word <I>maha&#x301;na</I> comes from the word <I>mahat</I>. There is a slight difference between the words <I>mahat</I> and <I>brhat</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Often in Sanskrit the words <I>brhat</I> and <I>visha&#x301;la</I> are thought to be identical in meaning, however there is a difference between them. <I>Visha&#x301;la</I> means something which is very large but which can still be measured, for example, the Himalayan mountains. They are several thousand miles long but human beings can still measure them, so this huge mountain range is depicted in the maps of the Earth. But what is <I>brhat</I> is so huge that it cannot be measured. There is only one such entity and that entity is <I>brahma &ndash; brhatva&#x301;d brahma brm&#x301;han&#x301;attva&#x301;d brahma</I> [<I>brahma</I> is that which is great and which makes others great].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><I>Mahat</I> does not signify &ldquo;great&rdquo; from the standpoint of geographical area. It is a matter of the psychic world. <I>Brhat</I> is a matter of the external world, so what is great in the psychic world is called <I>mahat</I>. For example, I will call a person <I>mahat</I> who is short in stature but who has achieved great recognition in the world of knowledge, not <I>brhat</I>. So, here <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is described as <I>maha&#x301;na agryapurus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
