<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The fundamental stuff is the Supreme Cognition. And within the scope of this Supreme Cognition there function three operative principles. [Now, the conation] is a resultant of the never-ending fight of three belligerent principles functioning within the triangle of forces. And you know, regarding these three operative principles, really speaking they are not three principles, they are the same principle, but according to their wavelengths we say that this one, or this particular flow, or this particular vibration, is the sentient principle; and that one is the mutative principle; and the crudest one is the static principle. In the realm of the unmanifest these three forces are fighting with one another, and when they form the triangle, the first triangle of the unmanifest universe, they try to influence the other; and as a result of this mutual fight, these belligerent forces, what do they do? The resultant of that fight comes out from one of the vertices, and we should say that that vertex is the fundamental point of fundamental positivity &ndash; that it is the fundamental positivity &ndash; because from this point starts the creation. And from this point starts His conation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->And this phase of creation, which is commonly known as the extroversial force in philosophy &ndash; there are three portions, three phases &ndash; and the first portion, when it is just coming out from the vertex, is the basic principle. Theoretically it [exists], but practically it cannot be established. In the next phase it moves like a straight line. This first point is called bindu in Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->And then it moves like a straight line. Here something has been created. Spirit is slowly being transmuted, is being metamorphosed, into abstract. Cognition is being transmuted into abstract. A&#x301;tma&#x301; is being transmuted into ma&#x301;nasa. It is called na&#x301;da in Tantra. Bindu, then na&#x301;da. The basic principle and the primordial principle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And after that, as a result of internal clash and cohesion, that na&#x301;da becomes, is converted into, kala&#x301;. Curvatures are created within its body. It is called kala&#x301;. Whatever we see, whatever we feel, whatever we realize, comes within the scope of this kala&#x301;. That is, this universe is a creation of vibrations of different curvatures. It is a mesh of waves of different lengths. And what are these waves? What is this vibrational principle? It is a conative expression of the Supreme Self. (The subject of discourse is &ldquo;macropsychic conation&rdquo;.) So as a result of this macropsychic conation we get this universe. We get this quinquelemental world. We get these microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>
