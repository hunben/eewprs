<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There is a single entity, or personality, in this universe. Apparently you are many, but fundamentally you are one. The one is manifested in the many.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The word khila in Sanskrit means a &ldquo;latch&rdquo;. Akhila therefore means &ldquo;that which cannot be contained or closed&rdquo;, that is, this universe. The creation of this universe &ndash; the substance of this universe is one, though the creation is manifold. Why this creation of one into many? The reply is only with the Creator, the Supreme Lord. Philosophers try to answer this question but fail; how far can a microcosmic brain with its small nerve fibres go? Even if an individual utilizes all his or her mental powers, that individual will not succeed in answering. The devotee&#146;s approach to this question is, however, different. The devotee enters God&#146;s mind, mingles his or her mind with that of the Supreme Being, and knows some of the secrets of God&#146;s mind from within.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The devotees say God is Supreme. They sing His glory and defend all His actions. That is why God says, &ldquo;My devotees are greater than Myself.&rdquo; A common person says, &ldquo;Oh, God, we are tired of your liila&#x301;. What is the need of it? We are all suffering and you call it a play.&rdquo; The devotee, however, defends God with this: &ldquo;My Lord was utterly alone before the creation. A person becomes mad if he or she is alone in a big vacant house. God was restless before the creation. He could neither love, nor feel angry with, anyone. So creation was a compulsion. He has created all these forms by multiplying Himself. When God was alone, He had the power to see, but there were no objects to be seen. Now that He has started the creation, He sees whatever He thinks. If we are His own forms and feel a little restlessness in His creation, we are blessed, for we are saving our Lord from the restlessness of utter loneliness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This is the way a devotee looks at the secret of creation. We are all part of that Supreme Being &ndash; He is playing with Himself in all our forms. This is a divine play. He is playing hide-and-seek with Himself. Search Him in your little &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling and you will find the King of kings there.  In fact, the name of this search is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->If you do not go within, do you want to go out? But where will you go, since He is everywhere in this universe and surrounds this universe? You cannot go outside of Him. He is there within and without &ndash; in your small &ldquo;I&rdquo; as well as in this big universe. He alone is a Single Entity pervading all forms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->By thinking of Him one becomes free from all kinds of bondages such as fear, etc.; and one who is free from bondages is He Himself. Knowing Him is being Him. This is the way of establishing oneself with Him, of becoming the Single Entity &ndash; by transcending the many forms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, becoming one with this Single Entity, is your birthright, which no one can snatch from you. Kick all obstacles from your path of becoming one with Him. Do not feel afraid of anybody. The Lord is with you. He will guide you forward. Victory is yours.<!-- /block --></p>
