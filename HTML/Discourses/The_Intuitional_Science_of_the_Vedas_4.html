<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Matter or object is indispensable for the existence of the mind, for mind thrives on matter. Mind exists only as long as it is concerned with matter. As soon as it becomes objectless it dies. The unit mind accepts the unit objects around it as its objective or livelihood with the help of the organs. The unit entity cannot conceive any integral, infinite object in its mind. Brahma alone is integral, and other objects are but fractions of Him and can be brought within the jurisdiction of the mind. Take the Himalayas Mountain range for instance. The mind finds it difficult indeed to comprehend it straightway; although vast, but it is not limited, also only a part, and so it can be brought within the mental compass easily through the medium of a map. But we cannot draw a map or picture of the integral entity, Brahma. We cannot bind Him to an image from the ten directions. That is why the scriptures say, &ldquo;Na tasya pratima&#x301; asti&rdquo; i.e., He has no image. Mind cannot apprehend this integral Brahma, for every object that is encompassed by the mind is demarcable from the ten sides. To demarcate Brahma would be totally antagonistic to the concept of limitlessness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If holding or apprehending Brahma is beyond the capacity of the mind, how then can man attain Him? When, through spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the mind is gradually transformed from crude to subtle and goes on advancing on the path of withdrawal, it (the unit mind) gradually goes on surrendering itself unawares to it Hiran&#x301;yagarbha or subtle Cosmic mind. And when this self-surrender reaches its apex, the unit mind, i.e., the sense of Ra&#x301;ma, Shya&#x301;ma jadu, Madhu etc. meets its waterloo. What remains then is only the Supreme Mind of that Supreme Purus&#x301;a. This state is called Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi or determinate concentration of the mind. So we see that the first and last word of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice is total surrender of the unit mind to the Supreme Mind. Similarly when the unit mind has been dedicated to the Supreme Consciousness, and as the result of this there remains only an objectless unity, the Lord of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, this state is called Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi i.e., supersensual or total suspension of the mind. The first and last word of this Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; also is total surrender. To the unit mind Brahma is unthinkable,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->He is unimaginable, for He is beyond the sphere of imagination. Not only is he unimaginable He is also unmanifest because He is inapprehensible to the sense organs through sound, touch, form, taste, smell etc. Any object, having the above five qualities like sound, touch etc., no matter how huge it is apprehensible by the sense-organs. He is formless, as we cannot give a form to infinity. But then, is not this perceptible world His form? Yes, it is, but these countless forms of this observable world are but His psychic manifestations. Only unit entities are evolved in the sphere of His mind as the objects of the unit minds, whereas countless and endless, big and small unit entities are being created and recreated in the imagination of Brahma the possessor of the infinite mind.  Apparently they are His &ldquo;form&rdquo; in this observable world. But none of these forms of His psychic flow &ndash; none of these bubbles that are originating, rising and bursting are the ultimate entities. They are all progressing through spatial, temporal and personal changes with a view to merging in that Supreme Bearing, the Nucleus of the Thought-Cycle. That is why none of these mundane manifestations of Brahma can be taken to be permanent and held on to as such. No matter how charming or captivating a form of His may be, one day it must take its leave from us must go away to some unseeable region in response to the beckoning call of time, leaving us behind to rue and wail in profuse tears. So none of His unit forms can give us any perennial peace or real, abiding happiness. That is why a Sa&#x301;dhaka is taken aback at the sight of the infinite, manifest form of form of the infinite of the Infinite Brahma. Shrii Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; said &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->He is the selfsame Shiva. The word, Shiva, means Purus&#x301;a. It is also used in the sense of benevolence. Here &ldquo;Shiva&rdquo; is used in the latter sense, for his psychic manifestations. The evolved objects, are all employed for the good alone and so. He is Shiva, He is benevolent, He is the image of benevolence. Does He punish us to afflict us with pain and suffering? No, there too, His benevolent wishes abide. It is for the rectification of our character, that the benevolent penal dispensation is there. He is perfectly free from the stigma or darkness of Avidya&#x301;, etc. Hence He is perfectly in peace &ndash; in absolute tranquillity. The Avidya&#x301;-like gale creates stormy waves in the sea of the mind, destroying its equipoise and tranquillity. In the sea of Brahma shocks and clashes of Avidya&#x301; (forces of microcosmic distraction) or (distracting forces which act upon the microcosm) do not exist and so there is no wave at all. The more the Avidya&#x301; evolved ego, the greater the agitation of the waves &ndash; the greater the shallowness of its knowledge. One can observe that a Kanya&#x301;kuma&#x301;rii, on one side there are the surging waves of the Shallow Bay of Bengal and the calm serenity of the very deep Arabian Sea on the other, He is deathless and free from distortion mutation. Distortion cannot take place in an object, unless there is the influence of a second object or of an outside agency upon it. If you want to transform milk into curd you will have to mix some thing sour into it.  As nothing exists outside of Him, He precludes the possibility of being distorted by any outer influence or agency.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The word, Brahma means &ldquo;uniquely Great&rdquo;. He is the greatest of all &ndash; Brhattva&#x301;d Brahma, By absorption in His thought, all become Brahma, i.e., He has the power of making one and all Brahma &ndash; Brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->He is the original Cause of everything, for He has been creating the world in His mind by virtue of His imagination. He has neither beginning, nor middle, nor end, for He is indeterminate and infinite. If He had a beginning, it would not be possible to call Him endless and infinite. For one that has neither a starting-point nor a last point there cannot be a middle point. If he possessed those three aspects, there would have been a possibility of something else existing &ndash; a second entity beside Him, and such entities could have either existed before or after His point of origin. In such an event it would have been possible to apprehend Him through the mind and the organs, for in that case He would have been a mere entity made up of the five elements. If we consider an image to be God, then behind the pedestal, under His feet and habare the crown on his head, must some other entities exist. To call such an image beginningless and limitless is rank madness, for we can see both its first and last points and can also apprehend it by our minds, as well as by our organs. This is because it made of the quinquelemental ingredients like earth, stone, metal etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As everything is within His psychic body so He is the real Supreme Controller of everything. He is Consciousness &ndash; Bliss Absolute. All mental feelings are either pleasant or painful. When the mind remains associated with any object for a long time we call that state &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; and when it is repulsed by any absent (while is characteristically inimical) for long, we call such a state sorrow. When the mind is neither concerned with the feeling of happiness nor with that of sorrow, it ceases to exist. In such a state here remains only an objectless soul, when the soul revels in the happiness of the soul.  That is why He is the self-same Consciousness &ndash; the Bliss Absolute &ndash; the ever-blissful Spirit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->I have already said that limitlessness cannot be given particular form, therefore He is formless, and shapeless.

<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The word, aran&#x301;i, means mantra-sanctified wood used for sacrificial fires, by the friction of which people of olden days used to produce fire. The main wood was known as Aran&#x301;i and the striking wood by which the friction was to be accomplished was called Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. A&#x301;ran&#x301;i used to grow in the forest, the place of meditation for the Rs&#x301;is of those days. Metaphorically, one is advised to use one&#146;s soul as the Aran&#x301;i or [[main wood]]. But to light up the Brahmic fire it is necessary to have Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i or the striking flint for friction. Here the Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i is the Pran&#x301;ava or On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. The roots pra plus nu plus al make the word, Pran&#x301;ava. The root, &ldquo;Nu&rdquo; means to worship. That is to say, pran&#x301;ava is one by which worship is carried out in an excellent manner. The on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra-mantra itself is the pran&#x301;ava. It is after coming in contact with this excellent medium of worship that the Cosmic sentiment is roused in the soul. Many of you know that listening to the refrains of the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra-sound man gets lost in sama&#x301;dhi [the trance of absorption] &ndash; gets absorbed in Brahmabha&#x301;va [Cosmotheistic trance].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That I permeate everything, that my ego or I-ness pervades the world&rdquo; &ndash; such a state of sentiment or thought, such a mental bearing is what is called knowledge. &ldquo;Stirring up this vast vista of knowledge by reasoning, I have come to understand that, from the spiritual standpoint, all that exists is Brahma and that I am all and everything.&rdquo; It is by such constant inculcation and practice of this sentiment alone (whose easiest method has been taught to you at the very outset of your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;) that the empyrean fire of Brahma is lit and realized out of the contact between the soul-like Aran&#x301;i [[main wood]] and the Pran&#x301;ava-like Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i [[the striker]]. In other words this churning by reasonings represents the act of friction between the Aran&#x301;i and the Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. [[When]] the fire of Brahma is lit up in the heart, man&#146;s mind is freed from its fetters or pa&#x301;shas which are its chains of bondage.

During the time of determinate concentration the sentiment of &ldquo;I am Brahma&rdquo;, exists in the mind of the Sa&#x301;dhaka. In the Sam&#x301;skrta language the state of &ldquo;I am Brahma&rdquo; is called Pan&#x301;da&#x301;. The one who has Pan&#x301;da&#x301; is called Pan&#x301;dita.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->If Brahma is one and without a second (Ekameva advitiiyam), then why is there the distortion in Him? This question is quite natural and its answer is also very easy. Distortion comes on account of the Prakrti, the Operative Principle, and this distortion takes place within the Body of Brahma, not outside It. Hence on final scrutiny His oneness remains unassailed. The unit beings that have been in possession of the Cosmic Mind in part and that have been progressing within It, are also conscious of their smallness and this very sense of smallness is their individuality &ndash; unit-hood. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice means an effort to break through the barrier of this smallness, and Siddhi or beatitude is the state, wherein the barrier has been broken through. Under the influence of Prakrti there exist three conditions or states between the small conscious unit and the unfathomably great Brahma. These three conditions are wakefulness, dream and sleep. None of these three are permanent, for they are evolved by the influence of Prakrti&#146;s three gun&#x301;as or attributes, viz., Sattva (Sentient, Rajah (Mutative) and Tamah (Static). In all these three conditions macrocosm and microcosm remain apparently separate. But the influence of Prakrti being absent in the fourth condition, which is known as Turiiya (the state of non-duality) or Kaevalya (absolute identity with the divine essence), there remains no distinction between Brahma and the unit. Both are one consummate Whole, Wakefulness, dream and sleep &ndash; these three conditions feature in the game of evolution. It is to these three attributes, viz., Sattva (Sentient), Rajah (Mutative) and Tamah (Static) that Prakrti owes her creation. When the influence of Sattvogun&#x301;a (sentient attribute) is greater on Purus&#x301;a, He is called Ks&#x301;iira&#x301;vdhi or Ks&#x301;iirasamudra&#x301; or the Sea of Milk. The comparative condition in the unit is called the wakeful state. People generally think that Knowingness only exists in the awakened state. It is not correct. Knowingness does also exist during dream and sleep. I shall clarify this point for you later.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The part of Brahma, which is knowable, i.e., which has been objectivated under the influence of Prakrti, is called Ks&#x301;ara or decaying, i.e., when distortion has taken place, and that part of Brahma, does not undergo distortion itself but remains as the knower of the Ks&#x301;ara, whilst apparently involving itself with distortion, is called Aks&#x301;ara or undecaying. This Aks&#x301;ara remains intermingled with Ks&#x301;ara. The part of Brahma, which is neither Ks&#x301;ara nor Aks&#x301;ara and which bodily exists as the nucleus or the central point or sovereign point of the Cosmic System, is the Controller of both the knowable (Ks&#x301;ara) and the knower, (Aks&#x301;ara). He is not directly connected with anybody&#146;s action or its consequences &ndash; Him we call Supreme Soul or the Purus&#x301;ottama.<!-- /block --></p>

So Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is used for Purus&#x301;ottama, since He is the refuge of Prakrti, the Operative Principle or Cosmic Energy. The Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a (Hindu Mythology) says Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is lying in the ocean of milk and Laks&#x301;mii (the Goddess of wealth and prosperity) is massaging His feet. I have already explained to you that Ks&#x301;iirasamudra&#x301; or the ocean of milk means he state of wakefulness of Brahma. Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a means Purus&#x301;ottama. He is lying, for He is the cognitive force. He has nothing to do except to think only &ndash; &ldquo;Pure shete yah sa puru&#x301;sah.&rdquo; Laks&#x301;mii massaging His feet, i.e., the introversive Prakrti is subservient to Purus&#x301;ottama. This great Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is beyond the purview of words and mind. To create His image is tantamount to sheer madness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->When the influence of the Mutative principle affects the Supreme Entity, He is called Garbhodaka or the Fluid of Creation. The corresponding state of the unit is called the state of dream. When the static Principle of Prakrti is manifest in the Supreme Purus&#x301;a, He is called Ka&#x301;rana&#x301;rn&#x301;ava or the sea of Causality. The corresponding state of the unit is called the state of sleep. Out of the Static condition of Brahma comes the first expression of the wakeful creation. That is why this condition is called Ka&#x301;rana&#x301;rn&#x301;ava or Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Samudra&#x301;. Ka&#x301;rana means cause and Arn&#x301;ava means &ldquo;sea&rdquo;, the central point of which is the Purus&#x301;ottama, around whom the waves of the Sea of Creation are rolling and billowing with extreme alacrity &ndash; found the panoramic pageantry of Ks&#x301;ara Aks&#x301;ara is moving fast. Centering round the small egos, amidst the crowd of Ks&#x301;ara and Akas&#x301;ra sits the coolly cognitive Purus&#x301;ottama, the cosmic nucleus.<!-- /block --></p>

In the dream state such a sense of distinction diminishes a little. In the &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; state it is still less. The fevers and frets of the small ego being absent in sleep, a sort of calm tranquil happiness or static passive pleasure is felt. But in the dreamful state where mind&#146;s internal sufferings and enjoyments go on as usual, such a pervasive sense of happiness cannot be felt due to the existence of various kinds of pains and pleasures.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Why are the unit entities more vulnerable to Avidya&#x301; (Force of Microcosmic Distraction) during the wakeful state? Because within their minds there are eight fetters and six passions, which are ever susceptible to the captivating charms and deceitful superficialities of the external world. Every mental action of his is vulnerable to both internal and external influences. Under the influence of the passions and fetters of their minds he races towards objects related to the body like, women, food, drinks etc., thinking them to be the objects of self-gratification. The Sa&#x301;dhakas (spiritual aspirants) have to scrupulously guard themselves against the glamour of these external baits. They have to be self-controlled. But will self-control be possible unless it becomes firmly established within their minds? It is certainly not possible by becoming a hypocritical Sa&#x301;dhu, tramping about with a smear of ashes on the body and a Kaman&#x301;da&#x301;lu (bowl) in hand. Without going in for the external paraphernalia and formalities one has to prepare oneself internally, maintaining the balance between the internal and the external? One has to remain alert so that the external environment will not be detrimental to one&#146;s purity of mind. A high-thinking man may meet his downfall within a short time, if he continually associates himself with bad company. Hence it is necessary to maintain a balance between internal and external expressions. Although bodily pleasures are perceived by the mind in the wakeful state, the objects of such pleasures always come from without, with the result that the privations of the external world will always stand in the way of real happiness, as the external world cannot always supply objects in accordance with the desires and wishes of the mind. Due to this the mind has to run up and down in search of them. It becomes very agitated in the process and peace becomes and impossibility. The influence of the external world is absent during the dreamful state, accordingly the amount of pleasure is due to want of efferent desires in the mind or increased organs (for that matter here the desire is not afferent either). In the state of sleep, as the internal activities of the mind are substantially less, the amount of happiness (Static happiness) is proportionately increased.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->I have already said that the unit can perceive more pleasure or pain during his dreamful state, for in that state there is no possibility of a clash between efferent desires and the external world. Normally, even during the dreamful state the unit keeps themselves aloof from Brahma, for there remain dual sentiments of the perceiver and the perceivable. The difference in the dreamful state as distinguished from the wakeful state is that during this state none of the perceivable objects are taken from the external quinquelemental world. Whatever perceived are all self-conceived. Ordinarily we are acquainted with three aspects of the mind, conscious mind, subconscious mind and unconscious mind, that are generally called Cetana mana, Avacetana mana and Acetana mana, the respective proper terms of which should be Ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a, Manomaya kos&#x301;a and Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a mana. All the three conditions being in the right order during the wakeful state, the imagined objects do not appear to be true during imagination (as is the went of the subtle or sub-conscious mind), for the unit can very well understand that the actions of the sub-conscious mind are all simply imaginary. For influenced it&#146;s by the conscious mind, the perceiver of the perceivable quinquelemental objects with the help of the organs. But during the dreamful state the crude or conscious mind lies quiescent and the relation of the unit being with the external world is disrupted. At that time the imaginary, perceivable objects appear to be real. That is why it is said that during the dreamful state the unit being becomes the perceiver of imaginary pleasure and pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Can a dream ever be true?&rdquo; Such question arises in the minds of many. What the unit entities imagines or do during the wakeful state are recorded in their subconscious minds. In any condition, when concerned with similar sentiments acts or things, the unit being determines the character or shape of the subsequent things, acts or sentiments in the light of the recurrence of his previous acts. In the absence of any comparison with already perceived objects, the unit is unable to recognize subsequent objects. Where there is negligible difficulty in comparing things, then people think within themselves: &ldquo;Yes, this thing appears to be similar to that thing to some extent &ndash; perhaps this may be the changed form of that&rdquo; &ndash; thus they come to recognize an entity. In the language of psychology this is called consciousness of identity. For example, suppose we had once seen a boy of 12 or 13. He had was merely a lad at the time. Now we come to see him after twelve years, as a fully developed youth. A great change has come about in his form and features. Still in most cases we can recognize him with a little difficulty. We come to the conclusion within ourselves that that very boy of 12 may now look like this. We call it pratyabhijin&#x32D;a&#x301; or consciousness of identity. But if the difference between the two forms be very great, Pratyabhijin&#x32D;a&#x301; does not occur. So we can see that the accumulated experiences of the subconscious mind help us a great deal in our daily lives. The non-recurrence of these enlightening vibrations would have created great difficulties in this common world as well as in the world of imagination, had they not expressed themselves according to necessity. In sleep if the flatulent gas moves upwards on account of stomach trouble or if there is some nervous disturbance, the brain and the sub-conscious mind will become agitated. Our previously imagined or felt objects reappear in our subconscious mind in a disjointed form. This we call a dream. Obviously such a dream is of no consequence. Not only that, the story formed therein will not be well-knit as it consists of merely the re-appearance of the objects, stored in the different parts of the brain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->There is yet another type of dream. The Atima&#x301;nas kos&#x301;a (supramental mind) is the store-house of all knowledge. At times a premonition of a coming be great happiness or sorrow, which only the omniscient causal frame can visualize, is created during deep slumber in the subconscious mind of an individual, who is deeply concerned with that particular happiness or sorrow. Such dreams do not take place very often. Nevertheless such a dream does carry the prognosis of a true event.<!-- /block --></p>

The inordinate unconscious mind in spite of its being the receptacle of all knowledge cannot be the knower of any object due to its being surrounded by darkness. Whatever be the reasons behind it, in spite of being objectivated, it is unable to maintain its objectivity (objectivity) and so it remains in a particular stance of satiation &ndash; in a particular state of happiness. In spite of a person&#146;s heart being rent asunder by hundreds of shocks, sorrows and insults he or she forgets everything during sleep and lapse into a condition of ease and comfort.  Such comfort or happiness is static born our of ignorance. Sleep is devoid of all feelings. The person then realizes only after waking up that his wood-like condition of sleep was an objectless state.<!-- /block --></p>

As in sleep and unconsciousness, so also in &ldquo;Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi&rdquo; the vital force remains intact and the physical bearing, like any other crude object, remains directly under the dictates of the Cosmic Mind. But the unserved Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (i.e., the remnants of past reactive momenta) do not let the unit remain in the Cosmic stance for long.

<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->The three states that are created in Purus&#x301;a as a result of His conjunction with Prakrti are called Tripura. In the case of unit entities these Tripuras are the three conditions wakefulness, dream and sleep; and the One that is lying quiescent as the witness is the A&#x301;tman or Purus&#x301;a. This variegated world continues to vibrate in these three states within each individual unit mind. The creation of this vast world of Tripura, which is meant for the enjoyment of the unit entities and which is know as Ks&#x301;iirasamudra&#x301; Garbhodaka (The Fluid of Creation) and Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;rnava, lies in the imagination of the Supreme Purus&#x301;a due to His sentient, mutative and static principles. The base of these three states is what we call the fourth state (Cathurtha-Pura). This fourth state is beyond the ambit of the three attributional principles, it is beyond the scope of time, space and person beyond the scope of the Tripura. This fourth state is called the State of Nirgun&#x301;a (objectlessness), Kaevalya (absolute identity with the Divine Essence) or Turiiya (the state of non-duality). As long as any Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras remain, the unit entities have to wander about the three regions of Tripura &ndash; wakefulness, dream and sleep, undergoing pleasure and pain. But when, as a result of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; they free themselves from their reactive momenta, they merge in the Turiiyapada or the state of non-duality, the Supreme State beyond the precincts of Tripuras.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->The witnessing counterpart of the wakeful state of unit entities, is Vishva (a philosophic word meaning causal unit mind) or Subjectivated Purus&#x301;a. The proper enjoyment of objects through the sense organs is possible only in a wakeful state. So the Purus&#x301;a of this state is called Subjectivated Purus&#x301;a. Similarly in reference to the microcosm, the Purus&#x301;a, of the dream state is called Taejasa or subtle unit mind; and that of the state of sleep is called Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a or spiritually dormant cognition. The Purus&#x301;a subjective of Ksiira&#x301;vdhi, Garbhodaka and Ka&#x301;rn&#x301;arnava is respectively called Vira&#x301;t&#x301;a (causal Cosmic Mind). Hiran&#x301;yagarbha (subtle Cosmic mind) and Iishvara (Crude Cosmic Mind). Hence we find that &ldquo;A&rdquo; is the seed or primary cause of Vishya or Vir&#x301;a&#x301;ta; &ldquo;U,&rdquo; Taejasa and Hiran&#x301;yagarbha; and &ldquo;M,&rdquo; of Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a and Iishvara. In the state of non-duality (Tu&#x301;riiya) there is no distinction between the unit entity and the supreme entity, for the I-feeling is absolutely nil; and so there is no seed or acoustic expression of this state. The seed or acoustic expression is the cause of origination; and so where there is no question of origination or non-origination, creation, preservation or destruction, the question of seed also does not arise. The knower, known and knowledge, the contemplator, contemplated and contemplation &ndash; all become one in the state of Turiiya. Hence that supreme state of final beatitude which is denoted by the Sonic Dot, is called Iishvaragra&#x301;sa &ndash; that state in which even Ishvara or the Lord of the universe is devoured. Here the three purus&#x301;a also merge in the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma or the supreme Non-attributional Entity. Hence it is absolutely correct to call it Iishvaragra&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>

The vital energy or vital air begotten, or the union and disunion of the five fundamental factors active in the microcosmic body, are but the products of His own imagination. At the embryonic stage, human beings derive vital energy from the bodies of their parents and from their mother&#146;s food and drink delivered from the five fundamental factors. Then after birth, they receive vital energy directly from their own food, drink, air, light etc. Hence the source of the life of unit beings lies in Brahma. He is the Life of the life of the microcosms. (The word Pra&#x301;na&#x301; or life, when used in singular number, means functional energy, and when used in plural, means vital energy). The quinquelemental manifestation is the crudest expression of His psychic action and so the microcosms have to draw vital energy from the quinquelemental world. Vital energy is generated in the unit body through the media of five internal and five external Vayus (airs). Of the five internal Vayus, viz., Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, Apa&#x301;na, Sama&#x301;na, Ud&#x301;ana and Vya&#x301;na, the Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, situated between the navel and the throat controls the functions of lungs, heart etc.; the Apa&#x301;na, situated below the navel (i.e., between the navel and the anus) controls the excretion of stool, urine etc.; the Sama&#x301;na&#x301;, situated within the navel, maintains the equilibrium between Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a and Apa&#x301;na; the Uda&#x301;na, situated in the throat, controls the vocal cord (power of speech) and the Vya&#x301;na, permeating the entire body, controls the circulation of the blood, vital secretions etc., and, with the help of the nerve fibres brings the sensory and motor organs into contact with the knowable i.e. the objects to mentally dealt with. The vibration necessary for the faculty of contemplation is also supplied by Vya&#x301;na Va&#x301;yu. The five external airs, viz., Na&#x301;ga, Ku&#x301;rma, Krkara, Devadatta and Dhanain&#x32D;jaya, control expansion and contraction, yawning and hiccup, hunger and thirst, sleep and drowsiness. Hence it is clear that it is with the help of the Va&#x301;yus by created Parama Purus&#x301;a, living beings derive their mind-stuff from the Cosmic Mind. The Indriyas find their expression when the Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a comes into contact with the mind. Ether, air, fire, water and earth are all created and sustained in the Cosmic Mind. That is these five factors, the psychic creation of Brahma, are preserving the existence of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>

In fact, the Entity or that which has neither beginning nor end and is devoid of any form, can hardly be called masculine or feminine. He is the Life of all lives, the Soul of all souls, and that is why He is Param&#x301;a&#x301;tma&#x301; or the Supreme cognition. The finite objects require a shelter, a base. Only the Infinite does not requite a base. All the finite objects of the universe are but the unit-manifestations of this Brahma. They are all sheltered in Him. All of them are the objects of His imagination. Inconceivably vast as His fundamental intellect is His existence-cum-cognitive Entity. It radiates as the Knowing Entity through His mind-begotten, subtler than the subtle, smaller than the small unit objects also. The One that abides in the unit entities as the Knower, also abides thus in the vast cosmos. Actually the faculty of His Knowership does not undergo any change. The change appears only in the receptacles because we see Him differently, because we imagine Him to be a separate Entity, abiding in separate receptacles. A Sa&#x301;dhaka, however, knows that by knowing One&#146;s own self, one can know the Supreme self, for they are essentially one. Shrii Ra&#x301;makrs&#x301;n&#x301;a Paramhamsa once said that if Sa&#x301;dhakas can know themselves, they can also know the Supreme Consciousness.

<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Every unit object is subject to the law of causation, every action is the object of the mind. The cause of the mind, functioning within a unit entity is embedded in the Cosmic Mind. It is not only a creation of the Cosmic Mind, it is its object as well. The Cosmic Mind has no cause, for no other active entity ever existed before the Cosmic Mind came into being. To look for an answer to the question as to why and how the Cosmic Mind came into being, will involve the fallacy of infinite regress, for no one can claim to have witnessed the origin of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. At that time nothing existed which we would call &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and so there was also no existence of the relative factors like Time, Space and Person. To investigate the time of His origin involves the necessity of the existence of a being endowed with a mind at that time. It is because His origin, existence and extinction are beyond the scope of mind, as well as of time, space and person, that He is called eternal. The intuitional science is beyond the realm of causality. Nothing exists outside Brahma and so nothing can be the cause or primal form of Brahma, for the transmuted form of the cause is called action. Milk is the cause of curd, for it is the primal or former state of curd. As nothing is outside Brahma, so nothing can be the cause of any subsequent action. The change in an object takes place out of contraction and expansion and for this contraction and expansion the influence of a second entity upon that particular object is necessary. Thus Brahma is unchangeable &ndash; the only Truth. As long as the mind exists, the law of causation will also exist, thus people say:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Where there is no cause, there is no effect.&rdquo; That which is apparently the transformation of Brahma, takes place entirely within Him. All these immutable objects are created, preserved and destroyed within Him. That is why the Rs&#x301;i (sage) has said, &ldquo;He is you and you are He.&rdquo; The objects, which undergo metamorphosis are all made of the five fundamental factors &ndash; ether, air, fire, water and earth, which must be present in some form or another; and they remain in one or another of the three conditions &ndash; wakefulness, dream and sleep.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->Objects which are made out of the combination of the five factors are called Prapain&#x32D;ca. The differences in the forms of objects occur due to the momenta of the Cosmic thought process, and proceed from the subtle to the crude (Sain&#x32D;cara or the process of Extroversion) and then retrace their path, from the crude back to the subtle (Pratisain&#x32D;cara or the process of Introversion). That is why they are perishable, for any of their forms is dependent on the three factors of time, space and person. Their manifestative, active and inert states are all respectively ensconced in the states of wakefulness, dream and sleep of microcosms. But what is the source of their different kinds of expressions? What are their main ingredients? They all originate from the Supreme self, the Supreme Subjectivity, that limitless centre of energy of the ego. So in spiritual terms all these states of wakefulness, dream and sleep, as well as this quinquelemental world, are all I. Those who have understood the real meaning of this &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness, do not consider anything to be a bondage, nor are they afraid of anything.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->Wakefulness, dream and sleep &ndash; these three conditions are called in the Shloka above the Tridha&#x301;ma or the three abodes. The fourth abode, which is unmentioned is of course, undistorted, unchangeable &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Whatever objects there are in these abodes, appear as enjoyable, enjoyer and enjoyment. The fourth entity, with characteristic opposite to those of the above three, is their witnessing Consciousness, Sada&#x301;shiva. &ldquo;I am that Sada&#x301;shiva.&rdquo; Generally in Tantra, (the Esoteric Science) Ardhana&#x301;riishvara Shiva is addressed as Sada&#x301;shiva. The word Sada&#x301;shiva, is not used here in that sense. Here Shiva means Purus&#x301;a, benevolent or benign. Hence one who is always absorbed in a Shiva-like stance, is Sada&#x301;shiva.<!-- /block --></p>

It is I who am manifest as this observable universe. Wonderful is my functioning, unique is the flow of my thoughts and ideas. None of those wonderful vibrations, none of those indescribable radiances, whereby I am scattering myself endlessly, have any comparison with one another. Each of them is unique in its own individual glory. Each of them, manifesting my grandeur differently, is rushing in various speeds towards formlessness from the world of forms. Oh, how wonderful I am! I am unborn. I cannot find any cause of myself. I am beyond the scope of causality, and that is why no one is more ancient than I. I am the Eternal Cognition. No harmful or malevolent thought can enter into me. I wish only good to all beings.&rdquo; When sa&#x301;dhakas are established in such an awareness they get lost in themselves, realizing the Infinite form within themselves &ndash; their external awareness is lost. This stage we call Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi. In this the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s microcosmic ego merges in the Cosmic Ego completely and totally. The difference between this state and the state of Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi, is that in Nirvikalpa no I-feeling, whether small or great, exists at all; everything is lost in the integral Consciousness. Since external awareness is absent during Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi, the sense of duality does not exist in the sa&#x301;dhaka. For those who are established in introspective trance the objects which are visualized internally appear to be indistinguishable from their own ego. Onlookers cannot comprehend such a state as this. Some ridicule such sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s, some call them crazy or mad. They do not know that to become like them requires the merit of several births, and demands a concentrated yearning to attain the One to the exclusion of all. It is only these &ldquo;lunatics&rdquo; that can lead the collective mind foreword, thus the great poet Rabindranath said,<!-- /block --></p>

Mathematics deals with various sums and problems. Similarly, of all the Vedas or books of knowledge that exist, I am the focus. Whatever, finite objects there are in this observable world, they are nothing but the manifestations of my very own self. And those who are revered as the expounders, of Mantras, the seers and Rs&#x301;is, the authors of the Vedic scriptures are none else but Myself.

At that time they regard their own characteristic Self as the absolute, Supreme Consciousness, devoid of good and bad.
