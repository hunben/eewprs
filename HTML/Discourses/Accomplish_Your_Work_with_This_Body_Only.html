<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When the clothes become old and tattered, they are replaced with newer ones. This is the law. Nobody wants to wear old, tattered, and dirty clothes. Similarly, when the body becomes old and worthless, it is changed for a newer one.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The body grows old due to work, activity. One has to march every fraction of a second in one&#146;s life. Marching ahead alone can establish one in dharma. Those who cannot move, cannot walk, are like corpses; their place is not in society, but in the cremation ground. They are pa&#x301;piis [sinners], antisocial.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is movement in all three spheres of life &ndash; physical, mental and spiritual.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Movement in the physical realm means the construction of the sadvipra society. [Sadvipra: a spiritual revolutionary.] The society is filled with pitchers of pa&#x301;pa today. Break these pitchers to pieces with a stroke of your feet. [This is your destiny.] Pa&#x301;pa will oppose you, but you will have to face the challenge. One who annihilates physical pa&#x301;pa is a sadvipra. This is your dharma in the mundane world. You are human beings, because you are fighting against the immoralists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the psychic realm you have to establish righteousness by removing the germs of crude mentality. Everywhere in the world today the crude intellect dominates. It is your duty to replace it with your righteous intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Once I was travelling by car in Bihar. The driver had to stop the car several times to remove the dogs from the street. When a sa&#x301;dhaka who was sitting beside me asked why the dogs did not heed the horn of the car, I replied that the dogs could not hear, for this was the kingdom of the dogs, the rule of the dogs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This is the condition that prevails throughout the world today. Crude animal intellect is reigning supreme throughout the world. You have to remove it. It is natural that it would not hear your call, it would not like to move from its position. Under these circumstances, you will have to remove the predominance of animal intellect even by the use of force. I do not want [animals] in the form of human beings to remain on this earth even for a second. This is a world of humans, and not of animals. Therefore, do not relax even for a fraction of a second.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the spiritual realm, your task is to establish Cosmic ideation. Marching ahead is life. Those who malinger and shirk the responsibility of moving ahead should be thrown in the cremation ground. If the body becomes old by moving, let it be changed. It is not proper to wear old and dirty clothes. If the body decays in the process of moving ahead, change it for another one, and go on performing good actions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->I want you to work with this body only, and then leave it permanently. This is not impossible for you. Increase the speed of your activities thousands of times or even countless times more than what it is now, and accomplish your work with this body only.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There are three spheres &ndash; physical, mental, and spiritual. They are the trilokas, and one who controls them is &ldquo;Trilokana&#x301;th&rdquo;. It is your dharma to show the right path to society in those three spheres &ndash; it depends on your speed also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Work with the infinite power of Parama&#x301;tman and with infinite speed. Victory is surely yours.<!-- /block --></p>
