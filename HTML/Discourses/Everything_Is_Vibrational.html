<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->All action, existence, quality and thought (mental projection) are vibrational. All are in the mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He creates all. The human mind can only create physical mixtures and chemical compounds, it cannot create originals. So we are to obey only Him, Supreme Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->But the human being is the most evolved form in the universe. The human mind is composed of three layers: conscious, subconscious and unconscious. The conscious mind controls external actions, such as drinking, eating, etc.; and the basic desires. The subconscious controls the functions of thought and memory. The unconscious mind is omniscient, all-knowing. It only needs to be developed by dint of our sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;: but remember this is not individual enterprise alone, it is the grace of Supreme Consciousness. Infinite powers can be developed because the human is the most evolved form in the universe: all of you are blessed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Nothing is secret for Supreme Consciousness. You, my boy, whom I punished a little before &ndash; stand up. [Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; was speaking to a young man. He had chastised that person earlier for some wrong he had done.] He is thinking, &ldquo;I am being punished again, all are sitting and only I am standing.&rdquo; [Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; had an avadhu&#x301;ta come and sit on his lap. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; touched the back of the avadhu&#x301;ta&#146;s neck.] I am touching his basal ganglia, the seat of his all-knowing [un]conscious mind. All of you sit in proper a&#x301;sana [posture]. [Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; said to the avadhu&#x301;ta:] What do you see?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[The avadhu&#x301;ta answered that he saw that young man dressed in shirt and pants. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; replied:] You see different clothes because they are giving off different vibrations. [Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; waved a bamboo staff between the avadhu&#x301;ta and the young man, in this way changing the vibrations being emanated from that young man and perceived by the avadhu&#x301;ta.] Now what do you see?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->[Here Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; was giving that avadhu&#x301;ta the yogic power antarya&#x301;mitva, which means the capacity to enter into things, mental or physical, to know everything about them, and to be able to control them. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; often explained that only Parama Purus&#x301;a, Supreme Consciousness, has this power, and those who realize Him can also know the secret.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->[Now Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; asked another young man, who was very thin, to stand up. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; said to the avadhu&#x301;ta:] Now look at this boy, what do you see?<!-- /block --></p>

He then said to the avadhu&#x301;ta:] I ask again, what do you see now? [to the boy:] Now, my boy, breathe deeply.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->[The boy started to breathe shallowly, the way he was accustomed to breathing because of his disease. He obviously did not believe any change had taken place inside his body. But to his amazement he could breathe deeply! He started breathing more and more deeply and then started to cry in relief and amazement. &ldquo;Oh, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;!&rdquo; he said, crying, &ldquo;before I could not breathe, I could not do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
