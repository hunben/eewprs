<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Kukuda. Kuk + un&#x301; + da&#x301; + d&#x301;a = kukuda. Kukuda means &ldquo;one who picks something up and gives it to another&rdquo;. In its specific sense, the kukuda is the one who gives away the bride in a wedding following the Puranic system. In ancient times, there were different customs of marriage, and they are still prevalent even today. Among the many Shaeva, gandharva, ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii and other marriage systems, one common custom was this: The daughter was dressed in expensive finery and placed on a wooden seat. The father or male guardian of the bride then lifted the seat and handed her over to the bridegroom. This guardian was called the kukuda. And the koka was the one who accepted such an offering, that is, &ldquo;one who accepts a thing&rdquo; so lifted and handed over. This sort of marriage custom is prevalent among the upper castes to this day. This definitely lowers the honour of women. Are they so cheap &ndash; like rice, pulse, salt and oil &ndash; that they can so easily be handed over to others Are women cheap like hens or okra that they can be packed in bales and sold or given away Not only is this custom surely humiliating for women, but the honour of all humankind is trampled upon. The cardinal human principles of humanism and Neohumanism are blatantly violated. I earnestly appeal to all righteous people of the universe to think this matter over and be active towards the abolition of this ugly custom. In my opinion, Manu<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> was not right in supporting this custom.<!-- /block --></p>
