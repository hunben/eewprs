<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject of discourse is &ldquo;Yoga and Tantra&rdquo;. Some people are curious to know what yoga is and what Tantra is, and where they agree and where differ. First let us discuss what yoga is.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The word yoga is derived as the Sanskrit root verb yuin&#x32D;j plus the suffix ghain&#x32D;. Or alternatively, the root verb yuj plus the suffix ghain&#x32D;. If yoga is derived as yuj + ghain&#x32D;, it means &ldquo;addition&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;two plus two equals four.&rdquo; But if yoga is derived as yuin&#x32D;j + ghain&#x32D;, it means &ldquo;unification&rdquo;, such as the unification of sugar and water. When sugar and water are mixed, you will no longer find sugar separate from water. But in the case of &ldquo;two plus two equals four,&rdquo; you will find the first &ldquo;two&rdquo; and the second &ldquo;two&rdquo; separately. Two mangoes plus two mangoes equals four mangoes: here you will still be able to see the four mangoes separately. So in the case of yuj + ghain&#x32D;, yoga means &ldquo;unity&rdquo; or &ldquo;addition&rdquo;, and in the alternative case it means &ldquo;unification&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Besides the two derivations of yoga, there are also various definitions of yoga. Maharshi Patanjali defines yoga as Yogashcittavrttinirodhah &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Yoga means the suspension of all the psychic propensities.&rdquo; In the human mind there are fifty main propensities. If by some special means the propensities are suspended, their expressions are stopped, in that case the mind will cease to function. That state of psychic suspension is here termed yoga. But we have defined yoga above to mean unification, and we can see that the suspension of propensities does not in any way mean that those propensities are being unified. The suspension of the propensities does not necessarily lead to the unification of the unit mind with the Cosmic Mind. This definition does not make clear, unification with whom or what. Hence this definition of yoga is not acceptable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now the second definition is Sarvacinta&#x301;paritya&#x301;go nishcinto yoga ucyate. That is, &ldquo;When the mind is free from any sort of thinking, the mind is completely free of thoughts, that state is called yoga.&rdquo; Now if the mind becomes free from thought, it does not lead to unification. When people are in deep sleep, when they do not even dream, the mind becomes free from thought, and people become unconscious. In that state also the mind stops thinking. But is that yoga? No!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now another definition, as given by Sada&#x301;shiva, is Sam&#x301;yoga yoga ityukto jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;nah. That is, &ldquo;The unification of the unit soul, the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;, with the Universal Soul, that is, Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, is yoga.&rdquo; This seems to be the best, most scientific, definition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now let us see what Tantra is. The Sanskrit root verb tan literally means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. From the root verb tan comes the Sanskrit word tanu, which means &ldquo;a body that is expanding&rdquo;. A child&#146;s body is called tanu in Sanskrit, because it grows and grows until thirty-nine years of age. The human body up to thirty-nine years of age can be called tanu. But thereafter it is called shariira. Shariira means something which wears out, which becomes contracted. So a child&#146;s body is not shariira, and an old man&#146;s body should not be called tanu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word tantra is derived as: tan + trae + d&#x301;a. Tra [trae + d&#x301;a] means &ldquo;that which liberates.&rdquo; So Tantra means the science which shows the path for the emancipation of the human entity through psycho-spiritual expansion. In other words, the spirit of Tantra is ever to continue expanding.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Tantra has another meaning also. In the Indo-Aryan alphabet, there are fifty letters. A is the first letter, and ks&#x301;a is the last letter. Now, the main human propensities are fifty in number, but within one propensity there are several sub-propensities; because the propensities have a certain faculty, and that is, that they can work in ten directions, and can also function both internally and externally. So ultimately we get the total number of propensities as fifty main vrttis times two (internal and external) times ten (working in ten directions), which equals one thousand. So although primarily there are fifty propensities, secondarily there are one thousand propensities. These one thousand propensities are controlled by the pineal gland in the brain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Each of these propensities has its own vibration and its own colour as well. When someone grows angry, there is a certain vibration in the body, and in accordance with this vibration, the body trembles and simultaneously changes its colour. The fair-complexioned man becomes reddish, the black-complexioned man becomes violet. So you see, each and every object in this universe has its own vibration, its own colour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->These vibrations, representing some action or some object, are called acoustic expressions. A person when angry speaks in a certain way, but the same person in a normal state speaks in a different way. The voice of the angry man has undergone a clear change from its normal state to an abnormal one. Likewise, each and every propensity has its own vibration, and each vibration has a certain colour and sound. The sounds of the fifty propensities constitute our language. These alphabet sounds &ndash; a, a&#x301;, ka, kha [the first vowels and the first consonants or the Sanskrit alphabet] &ndash; are our acoustic expressions. Each sound has its own colour, and because of these fifty sounds and fifty colours, we call the alphabet varn&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301; in Sanskrit. Varn&#x301;a, or &ldquo;letter&rdquo; &ndash; there are svaravarn&#x301;a [vowels] and vyain&#x32D;janvarn&#x301;a [consonants] &ndash; literally means &ldquo;colour&rdquo;. There are primarily fifty sounds or colours, but secondarily one thousand sounds or colours. As I said, each and every propensity has a particular colour. The  colour of the sentient principle is white, of the mutative yellow, and of the static black.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->For example, sha is the sound for the mutative principle. Now these representative sounds are called biija mantras in Sanskrit, and &ldquo;acoustic roots&rdquo; in English. Sha is the acoustic root of the mutative principle, sa is the acoustic root of the sentient principle, and s&#x301;a is the acoustic root of the static principle. When someone walks or starts moving, it produces a sound, khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;; so the acoustic expression of movement is khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;. Behind every action or existence there lies a sound vibration. The particular sound vibration supporting a particular entity or action is known as its acoustic root.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In ancient times, some orthodox people avoided wearing leather shoes. They liked to wear wooden sandals. When people wearing wooden sandals would walk, it automatically produced sounds like t&#x301;hak-t&#x301;hak-t&#x301;hak. So the group of people who used to make a t&#x301;hak-t&#x301;hak-t&#x301;hak sound during movement were called T&#x301;hakkara &ndash; T&#x301;hakam-t&#x301;hakam karoti yah sah T&#x301;hakkarah. T&#x301;hakkara evolved into T&#x301;ha&#x301;kur [anglicized as &ldquo;Tagore&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So it is clear now that there is an acoustic root behind each and every action, behind each and every existence. As I said, sha is the acoustic root of the mutative principle. Similarly, ra is the acoustic root of energy (energy meaning all varieties of energy). Sha + ra = shra, meaning &ldquo;where the mutative principle is backed by energy&rdquo;. Now shra plus the feminine suffix ii equals shrii. It means &ldquo;where there is mutative force plus energy&rdquo;. So shrii ultimately means charm. In practical life, every human being longs for charm. This is the reason why since ancient times it has been the custom in India to prefix the word Shrii to a person&#146;s name.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So I hope you are now clear about what an acoustic root is. Similarly there is an acoustic root ta. Ta represents dullness or lethargy. So literally tantra [combining two derivations] means &ldquo;a systematic and scientific process which brings about first expansion, and thereafter liberation from the bondages of dullness and lethargy&rdquo;. This liberation is called tantra in Sanskrit. Tantra means &ldquo;liberation from bondages&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->You know that each and every living being wants liberation from bondages. Out of this inherent longing for freedom from bondages arises dharma. Dharma means expansion. Suppose someone is tied with a rope. If the person&#146;s body expands or swells or becomes bigger and bigger in size, the rope will snap. So Tantra is defined as the process of expansion and of emancipation from crudifying bondages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->So now yoga and tantra have come close to each other in meaning. Yoga means the unification of jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; and Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  And how can this unification take place? It is possible through gradual expansion, that is, by dint of the constant practice of Tantra. This practical cult or spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; exists only in Tantra and nowhere else. Pra&#x301;rthana&#x301;rcana&#x301; ma&#x301;traeva bhramamu&#x301;lam. That is, &ldquo;Prayer and eulogy only mislead one.&rdquo; Only by dint of spiritual cult can one attain success. Thus sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is Tantra and Tantra is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now how can one attain siddhi through the practice of yoga? The jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; will take the ideation of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, and then the former will become one with the latter. How is it possible for the microcosm to become Macrocosm? The Macrocosm, or Parama Purus&#x301;a, has one unique characteristic, and that characteristic is, whoever ideates on Him becomes one with Him. The very nature of the mind is to become as it thinks. If it thinks of money, the mental stuff will one day, in a gradual process of crudification, be converted into money. After one&#146;s physical death, the mind will be converted into money, and may find shelter in the iron safe of a moneylender. Will that be desirable? No, certainly not!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Ya&#x301;drshii bha&#x301;vana&#x301; yasya siddhir bhavati ta&#x301;drshii &ndash; &ldquo;As one thinks, so one becomes.&rdquo; There is a certain insect that eats cockroaches.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> When that insect appears before a cockroach, the cockroach becomes mortally frightened. Due to the fright its nerve fibres cease to function, and when the fright becomes more intense, its nerve cells also cease to function. The severe fright creates a picture of that voracious insect in the cockroach&#146;s mind, and due to that persistent image a transformation of its nerve cells gradually sets in, which then extends to the nerve fibres, and at the end of this process the cockroach will appear to that insect to be a member of its own species. The insect actually thinks that the cockroach is a member of its own tribe, so how can it eat the cockroach? If human beings take the Cosmic ideation, they will also become one with the Cosmic Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Now the question is, how can human beings take the ideation of Parama Purus&#x301;a? Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis will analyse, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is like this or like that.&rdquo; Karmiis will think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is a master of action.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (Now, what relation do bhaktas have to jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na?<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  A devotee will think, &ldquo;I may be a virtuous person, I may be poor, I may be learned or foolish, but, O Lord, I belong only to You.&rdquo;) And a devotee thinks of the Lord just as people think of their nearest and dearest ones. He thinks, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is mine;&rdquo; and in this process of constant ideation, his or her mind gradually expands. From this sort of closeness, a person ultimately becomes one with Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. Such a person of devotion is called a bhakta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Thus we see that jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis are Tantrics, because by acquiring knowledge they expand their minds, and thus become one with the all-expansive Cosmic Mind. Karmiis are also Tantrics, for by dint of actions, they expand their minds and become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Bhaktas are also Tantrics, because they develop so much love and devotion for Parama Purus&#x301;a that, in the process of constant ideation, they become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus there is hardly any difference between Tantra and yoga. [Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, karma, and bhakti are the three main branches of yoga.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->But yes, there is one thing. Human life is very short. If someone wants to cultivate knowledge, he or she may not get sufficient time. Even if someone starts cultivating knowledge at the age of five or six, the time will not be adequate. The scope of knowledge is infinite, whereas life is finite or short. If someone diverts his or her time and energy towards the attainment of objects other than Parama Purus&#x301;a, that person&#146;s time becomes less utilized and more misused.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Mathitva&#x301; caturo veda&#x301;n sarvasha&#x301;stra&#x301;n&#x301; caeva hi;<br>Sa&#x301;rantu yogibhih piitam&#x301; takram&#x301; pivanti pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;After churning all four Vedas, and all the scriptures, the yogis assimilate the quintessence, and the non-essential parts are consumed by the so-called scholars.&rdquo; The four Vedas and all the scriptures are as vast as the ocean. Just as by churning curd [yogurt] we separate the butter from the buttermilk, so by churning the ocean of scripture, the butter comes to the surface and the buttermilk remains at the bottom. Those who are real devotees eat up the butter, and the so-called intellectuals start quarrelling among themselves over the distribution of the buttermilk. And ultimately that also may spoil before they can drink it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->There is a story that once a man of knowledge and a man of devotion went together to a mango orchard. The man of knowledge started verifying whether the mangoes were langra or himsagar or what varieties. Now there are over 1500 varieties of mango in the world. The man began to ponder over which varieties of mango were available in that orchard; and in the process of this constant analysis the sun set and evening fell on the orchard. Then the man started counting the numbers of the leaves, the branches, the twigs, etc. The night became darker. But what did the devotee do meanwhile? He straightway climbed a tree and started eating the mangoes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->As a rule, devotees are more intelligent than jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis. They utilize their time properly, and you know that those who utilize their time properly are more intelligent than those who do not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Now let us analyse how devotees conduct themselves. A devotee is confident from the very beginning that the Lord belongs to him or her, and to him or her alone. When something belongs to someone, there remains no obstacle or impediment between the person and the belonging. Suppose there is a son who says, &ldquo;My father.&rdquo; That son may be a scholar or a big fool, he may be rich or poor, but after all, his father belongs to him, and he can easily come near his own father and serve him. At that time no father will ever say, &ldquo;You are a fool, get out of here.&rdquo; He can never do such a thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->There is a family relation between the Father and the son, and because of this family relation, the intimacy between the two will keep growing, and the internal thoughts will also remain very, very pure. This is why wise people say that the cult of devotion is the greatest. It is the best method to expand one&#146;s mind. And as the fundamental spirit of Tantra is to expand one&#146;s mind, snapping the bondages, devotion is the best Tantra. That is why I repeat again and again that Tantra and yoga are not different from each other, rather they are almost the same thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->A devotee will practise a&#x301;sana, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; and dhya&#x301;na,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and during this practice he will have one thought uppermost in his mind &ndash; that the Entity on whom he is ideating is his nearest relation, and no one is nearer to him than his Lord. Because of this, a devotee&#146;s mind will become highly expanded in a short period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In the life of a person of action, kiirtana may or may not play a significant role, but in the life of a person of devotion, kiirtana is indispensable. To put it more explicitly, a devotee cannot live without kiirtana, just as you cannot remove a fish from water. If you remove a fish from water, it will die an instant death. Likewise, if a devotee is prevented from doing kiirtana, the person will die.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The secret of a devotee&#146;s heart is known to Parama Purus&#x301;a. In Jamalpur I told you that Parama Purus&#x301;a does not reside in Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha [the mythological abode of Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u], nor on the throne, nor in the heart of a yogi. He actually resides in the heart of a devotee. A devotee is always bound to think of Parama Purus&#x301;a at heart, because their mutual relation is one of love and devotion. That is why Parama Purus&#x301;a clearly proclaims, Madbhakta&#x301;h yatra ga&#x301;yanti tatra tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi Na&#x301;rada &ndash; that is, &ldquo;I reside, O Na&#x301;rada, wherever my devotees are singing.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->So Parama Purus&#x301;a says to Na&#x301;rada that He does not reside anywhere except where His ardent devotees are singing kiirtana. Philosophically, Parama Purus&#x301;a is omnipresent, but His nucleus remains at a particular place. That particular place, where the nucleus resides, is not Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha. That particular place is where His ardent devotees are singing His glories in kiirtana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->So you will notice that when people do kiirtana out of deep love, a highly powerful spiritual vibration is created. Those who do kiirtana feel that vibration in their minds, hearts, and everywhere. They become virtually intoxicated with unbounded bliss. That sort of bliss is not attainable by a person of knowledge. It may be that that person of knowledge will one day become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a, but he or she will not be able to attain that bliss; nor is that bliss attainable by a person of action. That bliss is attainable only by a person of devotion. The &ldquo;wholesale right&rdquo; to that boundless bliss lies with that devotee only.<!-- /block --></p>

It is said, Karma Brahmeti karma bahukurviita &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Karma is Brahma; knowing this, try to perform as much karma as you can.&rdquo; Actually, the whole universe is made of karma. Suppose someone is an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301; but does not work. Is he or she still an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;? No. That person is not an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301; any more. That person does not deserve to be called an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. People will not respect the person. One becomes an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301; by virtue of one&#146;s action.
