<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Our Earth is one planet amongst the numerous planets, satellites and celestial bodies in this universe. Due to the movement of these numerous celestial bodies &ndash; movement which undergoes retardation or acceleration &ndash; a multitude of various types of visible and invisible rays are emanated. As a result, macrocosmic rays &ndash; cosmic rays, X-rays, Z-rays, etc. &ndash; travel throughout the vast cosmic void.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->These macrocosmic rays are blended with the microcosmic glamour. They influence the ectoplasmic stuff of the human mind, as well as every vibration of the glands, sub-glands, nerve cells and hormones of the human body. Human beings will have to remain unaffected by undesirable microvita and the negative effects of the macrocosmic rays&#146; microcosmic blendings, X-rays, Z-rays or cosmic rays. So that human beings absorb only their beneficial effects and advance by avoiding their negative effects, they must be aware of and understand their cyclic order. This cyclic order is known as &ldquo;sidereal year&rdquo; (and includes the lunar year as well as the solar year).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->By being alert and careful, human beings will be able to advance smoothly throughout the whole year and throughout the whole of their lives, year after year. This is the reason why I say that the path of life is fraught with danger and endless ups and downs; but the mind can move one-pointedly towards its goal, the supreme desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Human beings must always try and adjust their own microcosm with the Macrocosmic blendings. The microcosms will have to move with accelerating speed towards the Supreme Entity &ndash; towards the non-manifest supreme rays.  In this endeavour, human beings are bound to be successful if they try. If human beings make proper effort, they must succeed, they will have to succeed,  because their ectoplasmic entity and endoplasmic coverage are both influenced by microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->While it is impossible to escape the influence of microvita, human beings can absorb and assimilate their effects. Adjusting themselves with them, human beings will have to move forward. Na&#x301;nya pantha&#x301; vidyate ayana&#x301;ya &ndash; that is, there is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
