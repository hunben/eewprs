<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Ancient Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the mother of gems and jewels, was composed of mountain ranges surrounded by oceans. Those ranges at one time resonated with storms and tempests, rain and thunderbolts. There were no human beings, nor were there any other living beings. Even shrubs and creepers were not to be seen. Except for Parama Purus&#x301;a [Supreme Consciousness], there was no one to witness the exquisite beauty of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The mountains having become pulverized under the process of constant erosion, in between those mountains plains, valleys and plateaus began to come up. The rivers carried that silt and sand onwards. Those eroded mountains became the red soil that we see today. The eastern part of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, and Samatat were formed out of the silt and sand from the mountains, carried by the rivers. And many crores of years later, the rivers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were instrumental in forming even more of this new soil. That new soil is today&#146;s Samatat and Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k. Enticed by the smell of the rain-drenched dry earth (the earth had been created by the rivers), the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h wended their way to the east, towards that new soil, with axes, hoes and ploughs. Hence the soil [ma&#x301;t&#x301;i] is not merely ma&#x301;t&#x301;i for the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; it is ma&#x301;-t&#x301;i, ma&#x301;-go [&ldquo;the mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;O mother&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->At a time when eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was non-existent, Bagri [Samatat] and D&#x301;aba&#x301;k were inconceivable. The present-day mounds in the wavy soil of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are the decaying summits of the old mountains, and the bottoms of the slopes, and the small rivers and the rivulets, are other names for the last remaining parts of the valleys.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Much later the Aryans, moving from the north-west region towards the east and having crossed the plains of the Brahmaputra and the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;, finally reached the borders of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and came to a sudden halt. In the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of that time the crests of the undulating topography [the mounds] were covered with forests, while the troughs [the bottoms of the slopes] were sites of human habitation. It was for this kind of topography that the land was named Birbhumi or Birbhum in the Austric language. The word biir in Austric means &ldquo;forest&rdquo;. Instead of using the Austric name Birbhum, the Aryans gave it a new name, Varjyabhu&#x301;mi, which meant &ldquo;a land in which Aryans should not live&rdquo; &ndash; a land which the Aryans should reject. It is said that the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h at that time were not prepared to welcome the Aryans, and that instead of welcoming them, the inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h set their pet lions and wolves on them. So the question remains, why did the Aryans call the land Varjyabhu&#x301;mi &ndash; because of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s uncongenial geographical environment, or for fear of the wolves?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Whichever it may be, let us come to another topic. The searing summer heat of this tropical region, and the whirlwinds of red dust, spurred the inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h to break the bondages of this limited world and to run in the direction of limitlessness. And at the very sight of the natural landscape of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, tears welled up in their hearts, and their entire beings quivered, for the great unknown entity. This longing in their hearts made the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h mystical. What is mysticism? Mysticism is the never-ending endeavour to find out a link between finite and infinite. So the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are all mystical by birth. When they look up at the boundless sky, their inner self becomes eloquent in this way:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The fervour, and the ardour deep in their minds, for the infinite, stirred them to the point of ba&#x301;tulata&#x301; [madness]. And this ba&#x301;tulata&#x301; gave birth to the Ba&#x301;ul Ma&#x301;rga [Path of Baul], Baul music and the Baul ideology. Baul music is always characterized by a single tune, a single resonated impact. Hence a Baul song is played on one string &ndash; on an ekta&#x301;ra&#x301; [&ldquo;single-stringed&rdquo; instrument].<!-- /block --></p>

Kiirtana drew its impetus from Baul. The development of the rhythmic movement of the human mind in quest of the Supreme Entity is what is called kiirtana. Though kiirtana is prevalent in India and many other countries, the distinguishing feature of the kiirtana of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is that it is chiefly, if not entirely, based on Baul. It more concerns sweet devotional ideation on Parama Purus&#x301;a than descriptions of His hands, feet, eyes, nose and face.<!-- /block --></p>
