<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This disease has been found in India only in recent times. A few centuries ago it entered India from Europe. Many are of the opinion that syphilis first originated in dogs, and through contact with them the human body got infected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the first stage the disease will appear in some part of the body, especially on the genital organs, as chancres. The surface around the chancres is quite hard. Generally there is no secretion of pus or fluid from these chancres. Then chancroid usually appears in the groin. In most cases these chancres and the chancroid dry up or heal within a short time. In this stage many people cannot recognize the disease for sure as syphilis, because not all boils are in fact syphilitic chancres and not all swelling of the groin (swelling of a gland in the groin) is chancroid.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the second stage of the disease, sores of different forms, small or big according to the type of the disease, erupt on the body, and these sores start secreting fluids of different colours and displaying different symptoms. Syphilis which erupts due to disturbance of the va&#x301;yu is called &ldquo;<i>va&#x301;yu</i> syphilis.&rdquo; The sores of this type of syphilis are black in colour and cause piercing pain, throbbing and twinging. When the disease erupts in a body which has already been suffering from vitiation of the pitta, it is called &ldquo;<i>pitta</i> syphilis.&rdquo; Its sores are yellowish in colour, very ugly and dirty in appearance, and usually generate a sharp burning sensation. Similarly, when the kapha has gone bad, the disease is called &ldquo;<i>kapha</i> syphilis.&rdquo; In this disease, the mucus is a white colour, and the sores are bigger in size, produce profuse secretions and cause mainly itching sensations. The disease produced by the blood going bad is known as &ldquo;blood syphilis.&rdquo; Its sores are copperish or reddish in color and give out red secretions. When general disruption of <i>va&#x301;yu, pitta</i> and <i>kapha,</i> all three, occurs, the syphilis is called &ldquo;<i>tridos&#x301;aja</i> syphilis.&rdquo; In this type all the above symptoms are found in greater or lesser degree.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Even though syphilis and chancroid are closely related, and their causes and symptoms are more or less the same, they are two different diseases. It is not a fact that syphilis must cause swelling of the groin; the symptoms of chancroid as an independent disease are the swelling of the groin, the ripening of the swelling, and sores on different parts of the body, especially the sexual organs. The medical name of the syphilis germ is <i>Spirillum pallida</i> [<i>Treponema pallidum</i>], and that of the chancroid germ is <i>Bacillus ducre</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Not keeping the sexual organs clean, excessive copulation, and contact with syphilitic men and women are the causes of this disease. Syphilis is generally widespread among prostitutes due to their promiscuous sexual activities, and from them healthy men get the infection. So it may generally be judged that syphilis has an inseparable relationship with bad character.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This disease can be transmitted to a healthy person through excessive association with syphilitic persons, using their clothing, eating their leftover food, or engaging in sexual relations with them. But the disease is not normally transmitted by mere association and eating together.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Diet<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->With syphilis, non-vegetarian food, onion, garlic, too much spice, all kinds of sweets, and milk products are to be strictly avoided. All types of alkaline foods and foods prepared with ghee are good. At lunch, it is good to take rice with ghee, and in the evening, <i>rut&#x301;i</i>. Vegetable soup and fruits and roots can be eaten in ample quantity. The patient should drink enough water every day. It is good not to take milk till the disease is cured, but one can take milk in increasing quantity as the disease heals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Dos and don&#146;ts<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->A sun-bath should be taken every day at a fixed time in summer and winter, exposing the diseased parts of the body to the sun. The sores should be carefully washed with the juice of neem [<i>Azadirachta indica A. Juss</i>] leaves, or any other disinfectant lotion, on a regular daily basis, after which neem oil should be applied. Among the many processes for washing the sores, one of the best is to apply a finely-ground <i>girima&#x301;ti</i> [red ochre] on the sores and to cover them with a wet cloth. The cloth should be soaked in water frequently. After doing this for an hour or an hour and a half, remove the <i>girima&#x301;ti</i> and the cloth. In this way the sores will have a thorough cleansing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Remember that it is injurious to health to suppress the secretion of fluid, blood or pus of any skin sores by external application of medicines. So in the preliminary stage of the disease, no external ointments should be used. Only after the disease is fully developed should neem oil or any other external medicine be applied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Fasting is also very beneficial in this disease. Syphilis patients must fast on <i>eka&#x301;dashii, pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301;</i> and <i>ama&#x301;vasya&#x301;</i>. A continuous fast for three or four days on lemon-water alone will bring immediate relief.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The patient should never completely fill the stomach at the evening meal, and that too should be finished by 8 or 8:30 p.m. Sleeping during the day, staying awake at night, and mingling with crowds should be avoided. Also, marriage and sexual relations are strictly forbidden for one-and-a-half or two years after the healing of the disease. All types of intoxicants are to be avoided like poison.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Some specific remedies<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->3. Roots of <i>svet karavii </i>[white oleander &ndash; <i>Nerium indicum Mill. var. alba</i>] well-ground to a paste in water, applied on syphilitic sores, will dry them up.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->1. The patient should obtain 5 tolas of curd (yoghurt) and keep it overnight in a stone container.

The patient will then soon feel nauseated and will have frequent bowel movements but should not worry. If the patient takes a bath after four or five hours and drinks a glass of <i>michrii</i>-water, the movements will stop. The patient should take nothing but barley-water that evening, and for a few days afterwards eat only a very light diet. This is an excellent process for destroying the poison of syphilis.<!-- /block --></p>
