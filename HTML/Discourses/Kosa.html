<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Consciousness is the supreme subjectivity and all other, mundane, subjectivities or objectivities are mere blendings of the absolute subjectivity. Therefore, the mind is not an absolute entity either but a transformed state of consciousness. For the performance of its actions the mind depends on the motor or sensory organs as its direct agents. Afferent and efferent nerves, in their turn, act as direct agents of these organs. The nerves, which convey the tanma&#x301;tras from objects to the mind, or activate the object with the force they acquire from the mental structure, and in this way link the mind with the external objectivities, are the indirect agents of the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Whenever the out-going tanma&#x301;tras carrying mental force get reflected, the objects come within our scope of sensation, perception and conception. When they get refracted, the objects partially come within our scope of sensation, etc. When the tanma&#x301;tras are neither reflected nor refracted or when there is little reflection or refraction, the objects do not come within the scope of our feeling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The correctness of perception depends upon a good many factors. The objects transmitting tanma&#x301;tras must be in healthy condition. The gateways of the organs must be healthy, and also the reflecting tanma&#x301;tras should be defectless. The afferent and efferent nerves and the citta should be sufficiently strong and active, and the last but not least factor is that the ego (aham&#x301;tattva) should be ready to receive them. Any defect or slackness of any of the above factors results in incorrect perception and hence in incorrect conception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->For example, in the case of persons suffering from glaucoma, watery fluid is deposited in the optical nerve, which causes a dispersion of light inside. As a result even the white rays transmitted by objects appear to be spectrum-colored.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So far as the efferent nerves are concerned, it is primarily upon the activating capacity of the ego that the process of physical activity depends. One&#146;s personality also depends on the activating (radiating) capacity. The more developed is the radiating power, the more glaring will be one&#146;s personality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Thus it has been examined that the function of the mind is to act through the organs and nerves and thereby either to receive or radiate the tanma&#x301;tras. The portion of mind which deals with indriyas is named ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a. This ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a controls the physical longings of the microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->As regards the Macrocosm the mind is said to be started at that stage where the sense of subjectivity (Mahattattva), the subjectivated &ldquo;I&rdquo; (Aham&#x301;tattva) and the objectivated &ldquo;I&rdquo; (citta) are all present. Hence in the stage of citta we get Mahattattva and Aham&#x301;tattva as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the extroversial sain&#x32D;cara process citta gradually crudifies under the influence of static Prakrti, till the crude solid is created. This process of crudification of citta, having a coordination of Mahattattva and Aham&#x301;tattva, is divided into five stages known as kos&#x301;as. According to their relative density of crudeness developed through the bondage of the static principle, the five kos&#x301;as, starting from the initial stage, are hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a, vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a, atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a, manomaya kos&#x301;a and ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a. The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a is the crudest stage of citta, where it is metamorphosed into the crudest stuff. With the five manifested fundamental physical factors (it is physical for the microcosm but mental for the Macrocosm) the Macrocosmic Mind displays its will. Macrocosmic control over the five fundamental physical factors means the internal display of the Macrocosmic ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a. Nothing is beyond the scope of Cosmic Mind, that is, everything comes within that mental scope; and so the Macrocosmic Entity needs no nervous system or indriyas for controlling these operations and, therefore, the Cosmic Mind at this stage requires no physical structure as the unit mind does.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The manomaya kos&#x301;a is subtler than the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a and it has the capacity of recollection and contemplation (smaran&#x301;a and manana). The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a, being the crudest in structure and in the case of the microcosm dealing with the external pain&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tas, is called the &ldquo;crude mind&rdquo; or sthu&#x301;la manah. The manomaya kos&#x301;a is known as the &ldquo;subtle mind&rdquo; or su&#x301;ks&#x301;ma manah. The remaining three kos&#x301;as, being still more subtle and also being the rudimental stages of sthu&#x301;la and su&#x301;ks&#x301;ma manah, are collectively termed &ldquo;causal&rdquo; or &ldquo;astral&rdquo; mind. The psychological nomenclature of &ldquo;conscious&rdquo;, &ldquo;sub-conscious&rdquo; and &ldquo;unconscious&rdquo; minds for the crude, subtle and causal minds does not appear to be correct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->From the microcosmic angle of vision the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the Macrocosm is expressed through the five rudimental physical factors from which the physical body of the microcosm and other physical objects come into being. The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the Cosmic includes, therefore, the annamaya kos&#x301;a of the unit. Here it may be pointed out that the Macrocosm in its flow of imagination creates actualities for the unit mind, whereas the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the unit cannot create physical actualities by its imagination. As already seen, the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a, having the function of dealing with the bhu&#x301;tas, is said to be the crude mind in the case of the microcosm also. The manomaya, performing the function of recollection and contemplation, is known as the subtle mind of the microcosm also. And as in the case of the Macrocosm, the atima&#x301;nasa, vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya and hiran&#x301;maya are the causal portion of the microcosm. But the division of the microcosm into a causal portion is merely a theoretical proposition. There is no separate existence of the unit causal mind from the Cosmic causal mind. In case the crude and subtle portions of the unit mind suspend their work by the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or otherwise, the causal portion of the unit mind will not be able to maintain its separate identity; only the seed of past action will remain just to differentiate the microcosm from the Macrocosm. By a process of correct sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the sa&#x301;dhaka will feel that there is one causal mind in the universe. There is no causal difference between the microcosm and the Macrocosm. Similarly, by the subtleness of projection, subtle and crude portions of the unit mind can connect themselves with the subtle and crude portions of the Cosmic Mind. The way to achieve this subtleness of projection is the process of yogic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The entire body (here &ldquo;body&rdquo; does not mean any crude physical structure) of the Macrocosm can similarly be divided into three parts &ndash; crude, subtle, and astral or causal. The physical world being within the psychic scope of the Macrocosm, the Macrocosm cannot have any crude or physical body in the sense the microcosm has, yet because of the inclusion of the five bhu&#x301;tas within its mind, the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the Macrocosm is often termed the crude body of Parama&#x301;tman. The remaining portions of the Macrocosmic kos&#x301;as are the subtle body, or the su&#x301;ks&#x301;ma deha, of Parama&#x301;tman. Aham&#x301;tattva and Mahattattva of Parama&#x301;tman are known as Its astral or causal body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The concept of &ldquo;causal body&rdquo; is a philosophic proposition, because philosophy says that the moment Nucleus Purus&#x301;ottama appeared to have been influenced by His immanent sentient principle, the seed of creation got an expression and His bodies and lokas were created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Similarly the annamaya kos&#x301;a of the unit is its crude body (sthu&#x301;la deha). The ka&#x301;mamaya, the manomaya, atima&#x301;nasa, vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya and hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;as constitute the subtle body of the unit. Above the scope of hiran&#x301;maya and till the merger into Purus&#x301;ottama the unit certainly possesses a body but that body cannot be termed causal. It, being the last phase, is known as sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya deha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->By its very nature, if the mind is to possess objectivity it must also have a witnessing entity. The witnessing entity is the summum bonum of the mind. Philosophy has given different names to the witnessing entity according to the differences in the nature of the objective mind. But this does not mean that the same Purus&#x301;ottama is not acting as the witnessing entity at different stages of the mind. It is He who reflects Himself as the witnessing counterpart by functional difference due to the changing mental status. At different stages, different names have been adopted for that singular entity. The Purus&#x301;ottama witnessing the causal Cosmic mind, subtle Cosmic mind and crude Cosmic mind, has been called Vira&#x301;t&#x301;a or Vaeshva&#x301;nara, Hiran&#x301;yagarbha and Iishvara, respectively. Similarly, the Purus&#x301;ottama witnessing the microcosm at the causal, subtle and crude stages is termed Vishva, Taejasa and Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a respectively.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The Cosmic Entity extends in different lokas wherein the different kos&#x301;as and the unit minds dwell. The term loka refers only to the Macrocosm and not to the unit. The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the Cosmic where material structure has taken form is called bhurloka (&ldquo;physical world&rdquo;). The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the Cosmic Entity where material structure has just begun taking form but has not actually acquired it is called bhuvarloka or &ldquo;crude mental world&rdquo;. The levels of manomaya, atima&#x301;nasa, vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya and hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a are known as svarloka or &ldquo;subtle mental world&rdquo;, maharloka or &ldquo;supramental world&rdquo;, janarloka or &ldquo;subliminal world&rdquo; and taparloka, respectively. Above that, since the causal body is conceived to be in existence from a philosophic point of view, it is termed Satyaloka.<!-- /block --></p>
