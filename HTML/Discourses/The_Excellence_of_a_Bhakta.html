<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I think it is my socio-spiritual responsibility, socio-spiritual duty, to say something regarding prapatti. In Sam&#x301;skrta &ldquo;pra&rdquo; - pat + ktin = prapatti. The idea, the spirit of &ldquo;prapatti&rdquo; is that whatever happens in this Universe of ours is nothing but an expression of Cosmic desire or Cosmic will. Neither can there be any volcanic eruption nor can any blade of grass move without his order. Everything is pre-ordered, pre-ordained by the Supreme Entity. Man can do nothing. Living beings cannot do anything without His support; that is, when a human desire and His desire coincide, then only does the human desire become fruitful, otherwise it is a sure failure. When the jiiva&#146;s desire coincides with the desire of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, then it is successful, otherwise not. This is the spirit, this is the central idea of the term &ldquo;prapatti&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Bhaktiva&#x301;da, that is, devotional cult, stands solely on this prapatti. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nava&#x301;da does not support prapatti and bhaktiva&#x301;da solely stands upon it. People may question the practicality of prapattiva&#x301;da or &ldquo;prapatti-ism&rdquo;. A jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii, may say, a learned scholar may say, &ldquo;When everything is being done by Him according to His desire or action or His sam&#x301;kalpa, what is the necessity of human endeavour?&rdquo; The jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii may think that this is a knotty question for a bhakta. The bhakta won&#146;t be able to give a suitable reply. But, you know, although the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis think that they are the most intelligent, they are the intelligentsia, actually bhaktas are more intelligent than jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis; and the greatest fool is the person who thinks that he is a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now, I have already said that a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii cannot even force a blade of grass to move, but the bhakta can, if he maintains a close tie with the Supreme; and there lies the excellence of a bhakta. The fact is that human ability, human capability and human efficiency are almost nil. Nothing really belongs to a human. He gets everything from the Supreme Entity. If he does not take food for three or four days continuously &ndash; or for three, four or five years &ndash; then nothing will be left of him. He will not be able to speak or move. Thus, nothing belongs to humans. A bhakta knows that what belongs to him is His, because he is His. So the first reply of the bhakta is this: &ldquo;One cannot do anything by one&#146;s own endeavour&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->All worldly knowledge and other mundane knowledge and so-called wisdom has little value. Such knowledge is known as &ldquo;pra&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya&rdquo;, that is, va&#x301;kya coming from, coming through, the media of different worldly persons, worldly expressions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In old geography books, you will find that Allahabad was the capital of Uttar Pradesh. In later books you will find that Lucknow is the capital of the same state. And it may be different in the future. So such is the condition of pra&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. It is relative and subject to change. Bhaktas take it with a grain of salt. But intellectuals constantly fights amongst themselves in the basis of their bookish knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->For a bhakta, only a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya has value. What comes from Parama Purus&#x301;a is a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. When the devotee is able to hear, feel, realize and understand the will of Parama Purus&#x301;a through having developed a relationship of love with Him, it is called a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. As devotees, you should follow only a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. You should remember that the Sixteen Points are your a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Your fundamental basis should be prapatti. &ldquo;Everything happens as per His desire and not a single blade of grass can move without His permission&rdquo;. By the Grace of, by the compassion of Parama Purus&#x301;a, you have received the a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya guidelines, and it is your duty to adhere strictly to the teachings and gospel of a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. A jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii has no future.<!-- /block --></p>
