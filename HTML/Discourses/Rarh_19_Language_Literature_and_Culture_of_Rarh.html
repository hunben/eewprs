<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->As ancient Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is our main subject matter, before we begin to discuss the language of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, we should say something about the origin of language. Though the inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are a mixed race of Austric and Negro (and in a few cases Mongolian), there is an abundance of Sanskrit words in the language of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The language is replete with tatsama words [Sanskrit words used in unchanged form in the Bengali language], bhagnatatsama words [Sanskrit words used in changed form in Bengali language], tadbhava words [Bengali words derived from Sanskrit root but used in a corrupted form in the Bengali language] and semi-tadbhava words [Bengali words derived from Sanskrit root but corrupted to the point of their roots being unrecognizable]. About ninety-two percent of the words are directly or indirectly related to the Sanskrit language. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is situated in the extreme east of India. If Sanskrit were a foreign language and if it were thought to have come into India across its north-west border, then how could so many Sanskrit words have entered the colloquial language of the remote outpost Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h? It will not, therefore, be out of place to guess that Sanskrit had almost no relation with the influx of the Aryans, nor is Sanskrit of foreign origin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The language in which the Vedic scriptures were composed was not Sanskrit; hence it is called the Vedic language. There is a heaven-and-hell difference between Sanskrit and Vedic. What many people say, that the Pra&#x301;krta language is a metamorphosed form of this Vedic language, is true to some extent. Some parts of Pra&#x301;krta are purely a popular form of Sanskrit, and other parts are a popular form of a mixture of Sanskrit and Vedic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A language survives for approximately one thousand years on the average. Were Pra&#x301;krta [entirely] a metamorphosed form of the ancient Vedic language, by now it would have veered so greatly from that Vedic that the trail of its lineage would have been lost. Instead of regarding Sanskrit as the changed form of Vedic, we shall have to search for the origin of Pra&#x301;krta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The few foreign words found in ancient Bengali literature did not come to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h either leaping or limping on horseback across the soil of the A&#x301;ryya&#x301;varta. Those words came by river through foreign trade with Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. We received words such as ka&#x301;gaj [paper], vana&#x301;t [velvet], palte [wick], ada&#x301;lat [court of law], ka&#x301;cha&#x301;ri [office], and rajju [rope] in this way. I said earlier that the Mayurakshi, Ajay, Damodar, Dwarakeshwar, Rupnarayan, Kangsavati and Suvarnarekha rivers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were navigable even a few hundred years ago. Ships navigated them, foreign trade went on. The principal exports of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were sha&#x301;l wood, fine rice, silk, tasar [cloth of non-mulberry silk], scented articles, fine cloth (Vishnupuri muslin, dhu&#x301;pcha&#x301;ya&#x301; saris made in Burdwan), sugar, copper, etc. It could be assumed that along with this export trade, the import of a few items would go on in a natural way. So on river-bank sites in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and the regions of Bagri near Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h we find earthenware from Egypt and drinking vessels from China. No wonder if some foreign words came in as well! An ancient port of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h engaged (lipta) mainly in the export of copper (ta&#x301;mra) was called Ta&#x301;mralipta (now Tamluk). In the past, copper was abundantly available in Ta&#x301;ma&#x301;khun of Puncha [Block], in the Manbhum area of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h [Purulia District and adjoining areas]. Following the destruction of the ancient port of Ta&#x301;mralipta, another port was built in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; Saptagram in the district of Hooghly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There are seven metamorphosed forms of Sanskrit, that is, seven Pra&#x301;krta languages. (Pra&#x301;krta means &ldquo;related to the populace&rdquo;.) They are 1) Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta of eastern India, 2) Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta of mid-northern India, 3) Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta of north-western India, 4) Pa&#x301;shcatya [Western] Pra&#x301;krta of extreme northwestern India, 5) Saendhavii Pra&#x301;krta of the Sindhu Delta, 6) Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta of mid-western India and (7) Maha&#x301;ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rii Pra&#x301;krta of south-western India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In connection with Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the subject of Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta needs further elaboration. Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta has two daughters: a) Pu&#x301;rvii [Eastern] Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii and b) Pashcimii [Western] Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii. Pu&#x301;rvii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii in turn has six daughters, and Pashcimii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii four daughters. The six daughters of Pu&#x301;rvii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii are i) Maethilii, ii) Angika, iii) Ba&#x301;m&#x301;la&#x301; [Bengali], iv) Assamese, v) Oriya and vi) Koshali. The four daughters of Pashcimii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii are i) Magahi, ii) Bhojpuri, iii) Nagpuri (Sadani) and (iv) Chattrishgarhi. Of them, though Nagpuri has come from Pashcimii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii, Ba&#x301;m&#x301;la&#x301; and Koshali have had a tremendous influence on it. And though Koshali has come from Pu&#x301;rvii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii, Nagpuri and Chattrishgarhi, which have come from Pashcimii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii, have had a tremendous influence on it. Chattrishgarhi comes from Pashcimii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii, yet it has been greatly influenced by Koshali, from Pu&#x301;rvii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii, and the Va&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;rii language (Vidarbha) of Maharashtra Pra&#x301;krta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Chattrishgarhi is such a remote language of Ma&#x301;gadhii that the languages of Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta did not have any influence on it. Chattrishgarhi does not show change in gender of a verb in consonance with change in gender of the subject in nominative case, which is one of the many characteristics of the Shaorasenii language. But though Maethilii has come from Ma&#x301;gadhii, it does show, in some cases, change in gender of a verb in consonance with change in gender in nominative case (only in the present perfect tense, such as Ra&#x301;m gela&#x301;h [&ldquo;Ram has gone&rdquo;], Siita&#x301; geliih [&ldquo;Sita has gone&rdquo;]). Such changes are more frequent in Bhojpuri. For example, Ra&#x301;m karata&#x301;, Siita&#x301; karatiiya&#x301;). This is so because Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta is geographically close to Bhojpuri.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->[As we can see,] Bengali has a number of sub-dialects. The above list [also] tells us that five dialects or so, some primary and some secondary, are prevalent in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Today every dialect of Bengali has a natural tendency towards literary Bengali. And within a short time, no dialect will be prevalent among the people. So all the folk-rhymes and folk-songs of the different dialects should be collected and preserved without delay. Otherwise, there will be no trace of them within another fifty years.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph --><b>Bengali pronunciation</b>: Every language has some specialities of pronunciation. The dialects of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h as well as the [other dialects of the] Bengali language have a host of specialities in pronunciation. These specialities more or less follow the Yajurvedic system. Unlike &ldquo;a&rdquo; in the English alphabet, which has twenty-one different pronunciations, a [the first letter of all Indo-Aryan alphabets] is pronounced mainly in three ways in India: 1) sam&#x301;vrta [[closed]], 2) vivrta [[open]] and 3) tiryak [[distorted]]. When a is pronounced according to the sam&#x301;vrta system, it sounds like &ldquo;au&rdquo; in the English word &ldquo;authentic&rdquo;. When a is pronounced according to the vivrta system, it sounds somewhat like &ldquo;u&rdquo; in the English word &ldquo;but&rdquo;. And when a is pronounced according to the tiryak system, it sounds somewhat like &ldquo;o&rdquo; in the English word &ldquo;origin&rdquo;. In the Bengali language the sam&#x301;vrta and tiryak pronunciations of a are in use, while the vivrta is not in use.<!-- /block --></p>

In fact, except for the Sher Shahvadiya dialect, in no dialect do we find full pronunciation of maha&#x301;pra&#x301;n&#x301; [letters]. In Chattal and some other dialects, the pronunciation of maha&#x301;pra&#x301;n&#x301; is almost negligible. In the pronunciation of words of the Kolkata dialect, the maha&#x301;pra&#x301;n&#x301; pronunciation is given fully only at the beginning of the words: for example, chele [&ldquo;boy&rdquo;], d&#x301;ha&#x301;ka&#x301; [covered], jha&#x301;la&#x301;no [soldering], tha&#x301;la&#x301; [plate] dha&#x301;ma&#x301; [a basket made of rattan], etc. If such letters are in or at the end of words, they are converted into the respective hiinapra&#x301;n&#x301;: for example, ma&#x301;ch (ma&#x301;c) [fish], ma&#x301;jh (ma&#x301;j) [middle], katha&#x301; (kata&#x301;) [word], sa&#x301;dh (sa&#x301;d) [desire], etc.<!-- /block --></p>

So its pronunciation will be ru&#x301;p-a-va&#x301;n&#x301;ii. Shiva will be Shiv, but Shivara&#x301;m will be Shiv-a-ra&#x301;m, Shivaprasa&#x301;d will be Shiva-a-prasa&#x301;d.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->2) In the case of a conjunct letter, it will be fully pronounced; pronunciation with hasanta [consonantal mark] is not acceptable &ndash; for example, Kanishka (not Kanishk), Devadatta (not Devadat), Vaedya (not Vaed), etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->3) Even if the letter is not a conjunct, its pronunciation will be full, should there be a suffix like kta in krdanta or ta in taddhitartha;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  for example, sammata [&ldquo;agreed&rdquo;] (not sammat), grhiita [&ldquo;accepted&rdquo;] (not grhiit), sthagita [&ldquo;postponed&rdquo;] (not sthagit), a&#x301;locita [&ldquo;discussed&rdquo;] (not a&#x301;locit), diirgha&#x301;yata [&ldquo;prolonged&rdquo;] (not diirgha&#x301;yat), etc. It is a pity that very often incorrect pronunciations such as sthagit, a&#x301;pya&#x301;yit, etc., are heard on radio and television. This creates confusion among students. The lack of knowledge of Bengali phonetics is the cause of this kind of defective pronunciation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->4) Even in the absence of suffixes such as kta and ta, non-[conjuncts] will be fully pronounced if the letter concerned is preceded by anusva&#x301;ra (<span class=Bengali>&#x0982;</span> [am&#x301;]), visarga (<span class=Bengali>&#x0983;</span> [ah]), the sign for <span class=Bengali>&#x0990;</span> [ae] or the sign for <span class=Bengali>&#x0994;</span> [ao], for example, Kam&#x301;sa (not Kam&#x301;s), vam&#x301;sha [&ldquo;lineage, pedigree&rdquo;] (not vam&#x301;sh), sim&#x301;ha [&ldquo;lion&rdquo;] (not sim&#x301;), duhkha [&ldquo;woe&rdquo;] (not dukh), nihsva [&ldquo;penniless&rdquo;] (not nis), Jaena [&ldquo;Jain&rdquo;] (not Jaen), gaon&#x301;a [&ldquo;inconsequential&rdquo;] (not gaon&#x301;), saodha [&ldquo;mansion&rdquo;] (not saodh), etc. Moreover, where as a consequence of metamorphosis vowels are used in place of consonants in Sanskrit, it is desirable to use i and u (respectively) instead of ae and ao even if there is no difference so far as pronunciation is concerned. (I have not mentioned <span class=Bengali>&#x0988;</span> [ii] and <span class=Bengali>&#x098A;</span> [u&#x301;], as they are not pronounced in Bengali.) Dadhi &rarr; dahi &rarr; dai (dai, not dae [though the pronunciation would be the same &ndash; dai indicates that a vowel has replaced a consonant]), badhu&#x301; &rarr; bahu &rarr; bau (bau, not bao), madhu &rarr; mahu &rarr; mau (mau, not mao).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->5) Words which are created with the suffix d&#x301;a will be pronounced fully; for example, jalada [&ldquo;rain-cloud&rdquo;] (not jalad), varada [&ldquo;one who gives a boon&rdquo;] (not varad), Amita&#x301;bha (not Amita&#x301;bh), drutaga [&ldquo;someone or something that goes fast&rdquo;] (not drutag), etc.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  Modern Bangladesh (which is basically coextensive with the eastern part of Samatat and with Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k) consists of six divisions, each containing several districts. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  The non-semi-vowel version of ra is r, and the non-semi-vowel version of va is ba. &ndash;Trans.</p>
