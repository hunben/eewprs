<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There was an intellectual &ndash; an intellectual giant. His name was Sham&#x301;kara&#x301;ca&#x301;rya. Although he was an intellectual he said &ndash; &ldquo;Moks&#x301;a Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;asamagra&#x301;m&#x301; bhaktireva gariiyasi&rdquo;. That is, amongst all the approaches, all the spiritual cults, devotion is the best &ndash; devotion is the highest order. So, a man may or may not be an intellectual; and a man who has not been established in the actional faculty, may attain salvation if only he has got the Bhakti in him &ndash; devotion in him. Truly speaking, knowledge or intellectual pursuit is itself a cult. The actional faculty is also a cult. But Bhakti is not a cult. Bhakti is the goal. Devotion is not a cult &ndash; devotion is the goal. Sham&#x301;kara&#x301;ca&#x301;rya, the great intellectual, said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Tyaja durjana sam&#x301;sargam&#x301; bhaja sa&#x301;dhu sama&#x301;gamam<br>Kuru pun&#x301;yam ahora&#x301;tram&#x301; smaran&#x301;a nitya anityata&#x301;m.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is a devotee to do? &ldquo;Tyaja durjana sam&#x301;sargam&rdquo; &ndash; you should give up the company of Durjanas. Who is a Durjana? I will explain. A man whose company will deteriorate or deprave the standard of others is a Durjana for those persons. Suppose you have fifteen degrees of virtues and another man has vices of twenty degrees. What will be the resultant balance? The resultant balance will be five in favour of vices. You will acquire five degrees of vices. So, that man having twenty degrees of vices is a Durjana for you. Have you understood the meaning of &ldquo;Durjana&rdquo;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->However, if a saint who has got eighty degrees of virtues and comes in contact with that bad man having twenty degrees of vices, what will happen? That bad man, that Durjana will become Sajjana. That bad man will become good. But if _you_ come into contact with that bad man, you will become bad because his degree of vices is more than your degree of virtue. So you should avoid the company of your Durjana. A great man, a saint may not need to avoid the company of that bad man because for him he is not a bad man. But for you he is a bad man. So you should avoid the company of such persons who are Durjanas for you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Thus &ldquo;Durjana&rdquo; is a relative term. The first point &ndash; the first direction of Sham&#x301;kara&#x301;ca&#x301;rya was &ldquo;Tyaja durjana sam&#x301;sargam&rdquo; &ndash; you should avoid the company of persons who are Durjana for you, whose degree of vices is more than the degree of virtues in you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhaja sa&#x301;dhu sama&#x301;gamam&rdquo;. Try to be with the Sa&#x301;dhus. Who is a Sa&#x301;dhu? The man whose company will develop your standard of morality, your standard of virtue and who will exalt you towards spirituality is a Sa&#x301;dhu for you. You should always try to remain with a Sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Kuru pun&#x301;yam ahora&#x301;tram&rdquo;. You should always be engaged in Pun&#x301;ya. What is Pun&#x301;ya? There was a great saint who lived about 3,500 years ago. His name was Vya&#x301;sa. Vya&#x301;sa wrote eighteen scriptures. Vya&#x301;sa said while explaining Pun&#x301;yam:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Ast&#x301;a&#x301;dasha pura&#x301;n&#x301;es&#x301;u Vya&#x301;sasya va&#x301;cana&#x301;dvayam<br>Paropaka&#x301;ra pun&#x301;ya&#x301;ya pa&#x301;pa&#x301;ya parapiid&#x301;a&#x301;nam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In those eighteen scriptures written by Vya&#x301;sa, the central idea was that, whenever you do something good, when you render some selfless service to the society, there must be some reaction. Each and every action has got an equal and opposite reaction, provided those three fundamental relative factors &ndash; time, space and person remain unchanged. This is the rule. If you do something good, naturally there will be a good reaction. Whenever you render any service to a man, and especially a selfless service, in reaction you will get something. You may or may not want it but the reaction will be there and that reaction is called &ldquo;Pun&#x301;ya&rdquo;. And if you do anything bad, anything harmful or deteriorating then that reaction is called &ldquo;Pa&#x301;pa&rdquo; or sin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Kuru pun&#x301;yam ahora&#x301;tram&rdquo;. You should be engaged in Pun&#x301;ya work &ldquo;ahora&#x301;tram&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ahora&#x301;tram&rdquo; means &ldquo;all the twenty-four hours&rdquo;. As per occidental calculations of astronomy as well as of astrology, the day starts from zero hours just after twelve midnight. As per oriental calculations, the day starts at sunrise. From sunrise to sunrise &ndash; twenty-four hours &ndash; is the oriental system of calculation and from zero hour to twenty-four hours, midnight, is the system of occidental calculation. &ldquo;Ahora&#x301;tram&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Aho&rdquo; means &ldquo;daytime&rdquo; &ndash; from sunrise to sunset, and &ldquo;Ra&#x301;tram&rdquo; means &ldquo;night-time&rdquo; &ndash; from sunset to sunrise. So, for all the twenty-four hours you should be engaged in what? Pun&#x301;ya. And what Pun&#x301;ya is I have just now explained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now, one may ask, &ldquo;In the daytime you may do Pun&#x301;ya work but while sleeping how can you do Pun&#x301;ya work?&rdquo; The reply is that for doing Pun&#x301;ya work, you require psycho-spiritual strength. For doing something bad you do not require any moral courage, or any spiritual strength. But for doing good work you must have moral and spiritual strength. That strength you acquire through Dhya&#x301;na and Japa &ndash; that is, meditation and repeating the incantation within your mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now this Japa is adjusted to your breathing, inhalation and exhalation. So if you practice it properly what will happen? Even while sleeping, automatically this Japa Kriya&#x301; will go on in accordance with your respiration &ndash; in accordance with your inhalation and exhalation. So while asleep you can do this thing. This is called &ldquo;Ajapa&#x301;japa&rdquo;. That is, there is no special endeavour from your side &ndash; the japa goes on automatically. Thus during the night you can also do Pun&#x301;ya. &ldquo;Kuru pun&#x301;yam ahora&#x301;tram&rdquo; &ndash; for all the twenty-four hours you can do Pun&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Smaran&#x301;a nitya anityata&#x301;m&rdquo;. You should remember always that you have come here for a short span. You won&#146;t remain in this world for a long period. You may remain here say for ninety or hundred years or say for one hundred and fifty years. Some saints like Traelaun&#x32D;ga Sva&#x301;mii lived here for three hundred and fifty years. He lived in Varanasi in India and died in this twentieth century. But you are to live under certain limitations &ndash; limitations of time, space and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So you should always remember that you have come here for a very short span. It is just like a waiting room of a railway station. You remain there for a short period and when the train comes, you leave the waiting room. This world is just like that waiting room. You are to remain here for a very short span.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->You should always remember this fact &ndash; &ldquo;I have come here for a short span and I won&#146;t remain here for a very long period. My home is elsewhere. I am just like a tourist.&rdquo; You should always remember this fact. And as a universal tourist, you, while leaving for your permanent home, won&#146;t require a passport.<!-- /block --></p>
