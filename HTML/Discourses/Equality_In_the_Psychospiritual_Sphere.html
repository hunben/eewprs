<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Every spiritual realization &ndash; from the higher spiritual realm to the comparatively low psycho-spiritual realm &ndash; comes about through the medium of hormones secreted by the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra and the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra (these hormones are called sudha&#x301; in scriptural language). According to some people, women are not entitled to this sort of higher spiritual realization because of certain physical short-comings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In this regard, I want to clearly state that certainly there are differences between men and women in certain crude vrttis [propensities]. (This is not the proper occasion or time to explain it, but if I find time in the future I will explain about human propensities in detail.) It is true that as there are some differences in the expression of certain vrttis, there will also be differences in the lower glands and sub-glands between men and women The number of glands and sub-glands is also different. Certainly also, there are some subtle differences in the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; and sahasra&#x301;ra cakras, as these centres directly control the lower glands and sub-glands, but we should remember that these differences pertain to only a few crude propensities. (For example, attachment. When a woman looks upon someone as an enemy, she sees him or her as a fierce enemy and if she looks upon someone as a friend, she takes that too to the farthest extreme, and so on.) But in the spiritual, supra-mental and psycho-spiritual spheres, there are no differences between men and women. Rather, women can attain the highest spiritual experiences that men can attain. There is no logic whatsoever to justify depriving women unnecessarily or making their path of progress thorny. There is no logic in the contentions that only males are entitled to liberation or salvation or that women must be reborn as men to attain liberation or salvation. Rather these statements imply an inherent selfish, exploitative psychology, and the personal and collective interests of men. If anyone tries to advance illogical arguments to perpetuate such exploitation, that sort of cunning will not last long.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Both sons and daughters receive the affection of Parama Purus&#x301;a, both are His beloved children. Logic tells us that Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot make distinctions or discriminate between His sons and daughters. It is not reasonable to think that He, being the Supreme Father, will take the boys on His lap and feed them sweets, and deprive the girls of all opportunities.<!-- /block --></p>
