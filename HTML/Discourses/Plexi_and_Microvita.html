<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The world is moving rapidly from physicality to intellectuality. A day is sure to come when this intellectuality will be transformed into spirituality. Just as the intellectual age is fast approaching, the spiritual age will also come in the very near future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There are three types of beings. The first are physical beings, like dogs. If you call a dog an abusive name it remains indifferent. The second are psychic beings, such as human beings. If you insult a man he will get angry, and he may even start weeping or commit suicide. The third are spiritual beings. A time will come when there will also be many spiritual beings on this earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->For spiritual advancement spiritual practices are a must, and in spiritual practices the role of the cakras [plexi] is immense. In fact, the most important aspect of spiritual practice is cakra shodhana and cakra niyantran&#x301;a [the purification and control, respectively, of the cakras].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is a cakra? It is a collection of glands and sub-glands, and the location of these glands and sub-glands differs from animal to animal. In humans the cakras are situated at the intersecting points of the id&#x301;a&#x301;, sus&#x301;umna&#x301; and piun&#x32D;gala&#x301; [psycho-spiritual channels]. In the human mind various thoughts are constantly emerging and dissolving. Behind these psychic phenomena are the underlying vrttis [propensities] which are primarily related to the inborn sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta] of human beings. Propensities are formed according to one&#146;s inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, and the expression and control of these propensities are dependent upon the various cakras. The fifty main propensities of the human mind are expressed internally or externally through the vibrational expression of these cakras. These vibrations cause hormones to be secreted from the glands, and the natural or unnatural expression of the propensities depends on the degree of normal or abnormal secretion of the hormones. When these propensities can be expressed we say that the human mind is alive because the mind exists as long as the propensities are there. When the propensities are destroyed, however, the human mind loses its existence.<!-- /block --></p>

Stars, naks&#x301;attras, planets, satellites, meteors, comets, nebulae and galaxies are all celestial bodies. Naks&#x301;attras are also stars, with distances of many light years from our solar system. Naks&#x301;a means &ldquo;to twinkle&rdquo;; that which helps us with its twinkling potentiality is called naks&#x301;attra. Naks&#x301;attras influence the [[sidereal]] plexus of the human body, rather of all bodies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The original light from stars, the reflected and refracted light from planets, satellites and meteors, and the light from galaxies and nebulae reflect on all the glands and sub-glands of the body, and especially on the ana&#x301;hata cakra. The reflecting plate of the ana&#x301;hata cakra is a bit bigger than the ana&#x301;hata cakra itself. That bigger area containing the ana&#x301;hata cakra is called the [[&ldquo;sidereal plexus&rdquo;]], the [[naks&#x301;attra]] man&#x301;d&#x301;ala.<!-- /block --></p>

Tanma&#x301;tras &ndash; inferences and ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The [[sidereal]] plexus is a bit above the igneous plexus, so positive microvita are more dominant here than negative microvita. The igneous plexus is mutative and the [[sidereal]] plexus is sentient. Then where is the position of the static? It is below the igneous at the terranean and fluidal plexi. Good people, spiritual aspirants [sa&#x301;dhakas], absorb more positive microvita than non-spiritual people, so all their propensities move with positive vitality. In a spiritual sa&#x301;dhaka, all the positive propensities of the ana&#x301;hata cakra are positively strengthened as a result. This is sentient psycho-panoramic maximitis. If one moves towards crudeness, there will be static psycho-panoramic minimitis. When this knowledge is acquired by a large number of people in this world, together they will absorb more positive microvita. By doing so they will benefit themselves individually, and at the same time the whole world will be benefited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->So many stars, planets and celestial bodies are influencing your [[sidereal]] plexus. You cannot remain aloof from such an influence on your [[sidereal]] plexus. Nobody can live in seclusion. The hermits who lived in caves in the Himalayas in the ancient and medieval ages should have lived in society and served society. They failed to do so because they were guided by a sort of befooling dogma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->One should practise spiritual cult to strengthen the positive microvita and lessen the influence of the negative microvita.

The sun&#146;s influence, according to the ancient yogis and Tantrics [those who practise spiritual meditation], is generally via the eighteen light waves which influence the [[solar]] and lunar plexi. That is, the seven colours of the spectrum (VIBGYOR &ndash; violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red), plus ultraviolet and infrared, have an internal and external influence. So, 7 + 2 = 9; 9 + 9 = 18. Out of these eighteen, two light waves do not come directly from the sun but from the moon; sixteen come directly from the sun.

The [[right]] side concerns the external influences or the reflected light from the moon in the upper portion of the body, and its acoustic root is ha. The acoustic root of the moon [that is, the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra] is t&#x301;ha. It is the controlling point of the moon &ndash; the controlling point of ha and ks&#x301;a.

It is beyond the capacity of astrology or astronomy to calculate this effect on the individual. Astrology only deals with the planets of our solar system and their effects on the glands and sub-glands. But this theory relates to all the effects of all the celestial bodies on the human glands and sub-glands &ndash; not only the celestial bodies of this solar system, but of all other existing solar systems, stars, planets, satellites, meteorites, nebulae and galaxies. So this theory is beyond the scope of astrology and astronomy. Astrology and astronomy consider only a bit of the effect of the planets on fate, fortune, etc., but this theory considers the effect not only of the direct rays, but also of the indirect reflected and refracted rays, on the glands and sub-glands. It is quite impossible for astrology and astronomy to calculate all these effects on the glands and sub-glands. Hence, this is a completely new science.<!-- /block --></p>
