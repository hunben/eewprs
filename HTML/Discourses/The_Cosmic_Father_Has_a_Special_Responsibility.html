<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I invented kaos&#x301;ikii on September 6th [1978]. This dance is both an exercise, and a medicine for twenty-two diseases. It is a sort of panacea for almost all female diseases, and for many male diseases in younger boys. It is a medicine for most liver diseases. It assures safe deliveries for women, and also checks the advent of old age. It is a medicine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava &ndash; which was not invented by me, but by Sada&#x301;shiva some seven thousand years ago &ndash; is an all-corporal exercise, an exercise for the entire body, including the brain. (There are intellectual exercises for the brain, but hardly any physical exercise. In fact, ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava is the only physical exercise for the brain.) And among all dances it is the best. But it is not for women.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit, tan&#x301;d&#x301;u means &ldquo;of jumping habit&rdquo;. You see, when rice is prepared from paddy [in the traditional rural way] the paddy and rice jump. Because of this, rice is called tan&#x301;d&#x301;ulam in Sanskrit. Tan&#x301;d&#x301;u plus the suffix sna makes ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava, the dance where jumping is the main thing. Now this dance was invented by Sada&#x301;shiva to maintain the physical and psychic purity of sa&#x301;dhakas. That may help them in their spiritual progress. And Pa&#x301;rvatii, the spouse of Shiva, invented lalita ma&#x301;rmika, which means &ldquo;voice of the inner spirit&rdquo;. The dance used for kiirtana is lalita ma&#x301;rmika. It represents the inner voice of the spiritual aspirant. The main thing in lalita ma&#x301;rmika is the expression through mudra&#x301;. In ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava there is no mudra&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Among the disciples, among the devotees, there was an altercation as to which dance should be accepted. It was decided that both should be equally accepted and equally respected. And as a result of this adjustment between ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava and lalita, Indian music was started &ndash; it is known as &ldquo;Indo-Aryan&rdquo; music. Indian music is divided into two schools, the A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta School and the Da&#x301;ks&#x301;ina&#x301;tya School. The common name for the A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta School is Hindustani Sangeet, and that for the Da&#x301;ks&#x301;ina&#x301;tya School is Karnataka Sangeet. As a result of this adjustment, Indian music was started. It was started by Sada&#x301;shiva, and that is why He is called Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja: Na&#x301;datanuna&#x301;t&#x301;esham&#x301; [&ldquo;The One whose very body is made out of the na&#x301;da &ndash; the primordial sound &ndash; is the Lord of the Dance.&rdquo;]. This adjustment first created the Indian ta&#x301;la. The first letter of ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava is ta, and the first letter of lalita is la &ndash; ta&#x301;la was created in Indian music.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Lalita is to be used during kiirtana. It is the only dance which is universally accepted as the best dance for kiirtana. Ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava is a heroic dance, showing the fight between life and death. The knife represents life, represents your vital stamina, and the skull represents the death that wants to destroy you. You are fighting against death with your weapon, be it a knife or a trishula (trident). And as per the rule, during the day, if one so desires, one may use a live snake in place of the skull; and at night one may use a fire masha&#x301;la [torch] or a d&#x301;amvaru [small drum].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> This is the rule. So ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava represents the eternal fight, the fight for survival, the fight to maintain existence, the fight to establish oneself as a man in this world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now during Maha&#x301;cakra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and several other discourses, there has been a vijaya for devotees. You know, in Sanskrit there are two similar words, jaya and vijaya. Jaya means &ldquo;victory&rdquo;, victory over the inimical force, but victory of temporary nature. When the enemy is defeated, you become a jayii; but in the next phase or in the next moment the enemy may again rise up, become victorious &ndash; you may be defeated. And what is vijaya? Vijaya means &ldquo;victory of a permanent nature when the enemy is completely destroyed&rdquo;. I think during the past few discourses there has been a vijaya for devotees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the course of spiritual achievement, spiritual progress, the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii is alone in the field, as indeed is the karmii. But the devotee<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is always sitting on the lap of the Cosmic Father and is never alone. In the sha&#x301;stras it has been said that the devotees know that the Cosmic Father maintains His relationship with His children always through ota yoga and prota yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->What is ota yoga? The Cosmic Father has a direct relationship with each and every entity of this world, animate or inanimate. Not a single grain of sand nor a single blade of grass is neglected by Him. All are his affectionate children. This is His ota yoga.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Each and every entity, animate or inanimate, has a direct link with Him, and thus nobody can ever be alone in the world. It is His duty to look after His children. So a devotee can never develop the psychology of melancholia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->You know, &ldquo;melancholia&rdquo; means to feel hopeless, helpless &ndash; &ldquo;There is no one to love me.&rdquo; Devotees never feel this type of melancholia, because they know that they are always with their Supreme Father. But jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis suffer from such diseases. You will find psychic diseases, insanity mostly, among jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis, among so-called learned and intellectual people. Bhaktas, however, never suffer from these diseases. They are free from all psychic diseases. And the devotee&#146;s march is a march to serve the Supreme Entity in a better way, not to attain any emancipation or salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The devotees know that whatever their Supreme Father will do for them is best for them. They never ask for anything, mundane, supramundane or psychic, because they know their actual needs, their actual necessities, are better known to their Father. A child of two months does not know what it requires; its mother knows. It is solely dependent upon its mother. Similarly, devotees are solely dependent on the Cosmic Father, and for that reason the Cosmic Father has a special responsibility for the devotees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->I have already said that devotees never develop any psychological ailment or psychological depression, even if they are sinners. You know, while moving along the road, your body or your clothes may come in contact with dust and dirt &ndash; this is what is called &ldquo;sin&rdquo; in society. And if your body or your clothes become filthy due to any sort of dirt or dust, others may laugh at you, others may ridicule you, others may hate you, but your father cannot ridicule you, cannot hate you, cannot laugh at you. What is his duty? Then and there he will come and put you on his lap and clean you. He will wash your clothes and say, &ldquo;Oh, my child, while moving along the road, be a bit careful.&rdquo; This is the relationship of the Cosmic Father with pa&#x301;piis [sinners]. And the devotees know this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->But the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis and karmiis say that each and every action has an equal and opposite reaction, provided that the three fundamental relative factors remain unchanged. Very dangerous, very dangerous! And that is why they suffer from so many psychic diseases; they are afraid of the sins they have committed in the past. But the devotees know, &ldquo;My Father is there; He may punish me, but He will free me from all those bondages, all those fetters.&rdquo; So devotees are always carefree. And as I told you, devotees are cunning people. Not only are they intelligent, they are also cunning. That is why I said that devotees are A-grade intellectuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->You see, the path of dharma is kut&#x301;ila for those jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis and karmiis, but for devotees it is straight. Dharmasya kut&#x301;ila gatih [&ldquo;The path of dharma is kut&#x301;ila, tortuous&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It is kut&#x301;ila for whom? For jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis and karmiis?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;urasya dha&#x301;ra&#x301; nishita&#x301; duratyaya&#x301; durgam&#x301; pathastad kavayo vadanti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->[The edge of a razor is very sharp and difficult to walk on. Similarly, the path to the Absolute is difficult to follow. This is what realized persons say.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Those jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis will say, &ldquo;It is a dangerous path!&rdquo; &ndash; durgam&#x301; pathastad kavayo vadanti. In Vedic Sanskrit, kavi means &ldquo;learned man&rdquo;, &ldquo;scholar&rdquo;, not &ldquo;poet&rdquo;. (In laokika [comparatively recent] Sanskrit, kavi means &ldquo;poet&rdquo;.) Those scholars, those jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis, say it is a durgam path. What does durgam mean? &ldquo;Not easy to move&rdquo;. But what is it for a devotee? Sukhamanantama&#x301;nandam [&ldquo;Spiritual bliss is equal to infinite pleasure&rdquo;]. It is a straight path, it is a movement that ends in union with the Supreme Father. So there is nothing durgam in it; rather it is very easy, it is very natural. So my advice to you all is, feel His existence within your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[The scriptures differ, the social codes differ; each sage has a different opinion. The essence of dharma lies deep in the mind; the path followed by realized persons is the true path.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->So many scriptures say so many things. What is an ordinary person to do? Which scripture is to be followed and which is not to be followed? What is what and which is which? A person may be in a dilemma to decide what to do, and what not to do. Shrutayo vibhinna&#x301;h &ndash; &ldquo;The scriptures vary from one another.&rdquo; Smrtayo vibhinna&#x301;h (smrti means &ldquo;social code&rdquo;) &ndash; &ldquo;social codes also vary from one another.&rdquo; In the past there was Na&#x301;rada Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;, Para&#x301;sara Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;, Manu Smrti; and now all the smrtis have been replaced by the Hindu Code Bill. There are so many social codes. What is an ordinary person to do?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The pandits, the propounders of those social codes, vary from one another. One says, &ldquo;Do this.&rdquo; Another says, &ldquo;No, no, no, do this.&rdquo; Somebody will say that while doing your upa&#x301;sana&#x301; [prayers] you should face east; some will say, &ldquo;No, no, no, face west.&rdquo; What are ordinary persons to do? They are at a loss to know what to do.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There is not a single muni who does not differ from other munis.&rdquo; Muni means &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;. Muni means maniis&#x301;i &ndash; &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;. However, Tantra says, &ldquo;No, no, no, those intellectuals are not munis.&rdquo; According to Tantra, muni means, Na munih dugdhaba&#x301;lakah munih sam&#x301;liina ma&#x301;nasah &ndash; &ldquo;Those so-called intellectuals, so-called scholars, are not actually munis, or actually intellectuals.&rdquo; Munih sam&#x301;liina ma&#x301;nasah &ndash; &ldquo;Those whose minds have become one with the Supreme Entity, whose ma&#x301;nasa has become sam&#x301;liina with Parama Purus&#x301;a, are munis.&rdquo; Naekamunir yasya matam&#x301; na bhinnam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Now what is one to do then? How to solve this knotty problem? Dharmasya tattvam&#x301; nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;ya&#x301;m &ndash; &ldquo;The inner spirit of dharma, the inner secret of dharma, lies coverted within your very &lsquo;I&rsquo; feeling.&rdquo; In each and every person there is this &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. &ldquo;I am&rdquo; &ndash; Aham asmi. This &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, this feeling of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;, is called guha&#x301;. The spirit of dharma, the spirit of Parama Purus&#x301;a, lies hidden within your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. So in order to get Him, in order to discover Him, search within your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, and not hither and thither &ndash; not on this tiirtham [site of pilgrimage] or that tiirtham.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii asks Shiva, &ldquo;What is the best tiirtha?&rdquo; Shiva says, ta&#x301;masa&#x301;h jana&#x301;h &ndash; &ldquo;Those who are guided by the static principle, those who are guided by ta&#x301;masika propensities, move from one place to another in search of tiirtham.&rdquo; In Sanskrit, tiirtham means &ldquo;the point that touches this world, that connects this world with that world&rdquo;. That connecting point, that common point, is called tiirtha. Tiirastham&#x301; ityarthe tiirtham. Tiirastham&#x301; means &ldquo;the point where the water of a river touches the bank&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Such people move from one place to another in search of tiirtham.

<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Maha&#x301;jana means mahat jana. Mahat jana means &ldquo;devotee&rdquo;. So a sa&#x301;dhaka, a spiritual aspirant, is to follow a devotee, not a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii, because the devotee knows the secret of how to satisfy Him. And when one comes in contact with Him, one will know all the secrets of the universe. Because all the secrets of the universe are known only to Parama Purus&#x301;a, and to nobody else, not to any jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis or any [karmiis].<!-- /block --></p>
