<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You should always be vigilant that not a single individual of our collective body is in the least neglected or ignored. Let not a single boy or girl feel within them that no one is concerned about them, let not a single person be allowed to think, &ldquo;No one cares whether I have taken my food or not.&rdquo; You must pay special heed to this. Particularly those of you who are in responsible positions of leadership should remember that you should never think, &ldquo;No one is bothering to enquire whether I have eaten or not.&rdquo; Rather, you should always be concerned with others&#146; necessities, not your own. You should always think more about your duties and responsibilities than your rights. So far as women are concerned, they already have the natural habit of paying attention to others&#146; comforts and necessities; and I expect our girls to pay even more attention to others&#146; needs. It is a fact that women habitually eat less themselves, sacrificing their share of food, to give it to the other members of the family, this is a woman&#146;s nature. It is never the nature of a woman to eat more, thus depriving her guests. So you should always be vigilant in collective life that no one is ignored, that no one is deprived.<!-- /block --></p>
