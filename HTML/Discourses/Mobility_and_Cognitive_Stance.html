<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know, wherever there is any manifestation within or without the scope of the microcosm, there must be mobility. Existence is recognized only by its mobility. Even in the case of inanimate objects, there is mobility. Though their mobility is not effected by individual enterprise, in the Collective Body, that is, in the Cosmic flow of the Macrocosm, there is mobility. On this level of quinquelementality, physical movement is carried out with the help of material projections of the Macrocosmic flow, and internal movement is carried out through individual efforts by the direct stamina of the microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now in our realm of physicality, progress which is brought about with the help of the vital energy, fighting against the inertia of the earth, we call physical progress. But if we are to think of it in terms of a march, for there to be a march there must be some starting point and there must be some culminating point. In this march in the arena of physicalities, we find no starting point and no culminating point. In the physical sphere we try to solve so many knotty problems, but again more knotty problems appear and disturb us. So in the physical sphere, there cannot be any progress. In this realm of physicality, progress is an absurdity. There is movement but there is no progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the psychic sphere, we solve many mental problems, we march ahead with the help of our microcosmic stamina. But so many socio-economic problems are solved, and again so many socio-economic problems are newly created. That is why I have had no alternative but to accept, in the Fifth [Fundamental Principle] of Prout, changes due to change in time, space, and person. Changes should be according to the change in time, space, and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the psychic sphere we are moving, no doubt, but from where to where? What is the goal? What is the plane of psychic salvation? There cannot be any plane or any psychic salvation. There is no psychic salvation. Problems will come, just as problems will be solved. Just as in the realm of physicality, so in the realm of the mind, there cannot be any permanent solution &ndash; movement is the order of the day &ndash; a goal-less movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->But in the sphere of spirituality, the Cognitive Faculty is the goal, and an aspirant moves towards that Cognitive Goal, and while moving, he or she tries to have adjustment with his or her physical and psychic world; and that is why I say that ours is a subjective approach through objective adjustment. Through this objective adjustment, that is, by making proper use and non-use of association [with physical objects], we are to march towards our subjective Desideratum. In the case of spiritual movement, the goal is there, and what is that goal? The suspension of all physical energies into the microcosmic stamina, and suspension of all microcosmic strength into the spiritual stance &ndash; that is the goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Yachhed va&#x301;unmanasi pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;ah<br>Tad yachhed jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tmani;<br>Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati niyachhet<br>Tad yachheccha&#x301;nta a&#x301;tmani.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[Wise persons first merge their indriyas into their citta, then their citta into aham, then aham into mahat, then mahat into jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;, and finally their jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; into Supreme Consciousness.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Yachhed va&#x301;unmanasi pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;ah. Manasi means &ldquo;in[to] the psychic world&rdquo;. Tad yachhed jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tmani &ndash; &ldquo;and there the microcosmic flow &ndash; &rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the case of microcosmic flows, there are two externities &ndash; one externity connects the mind with inferences, and another externity connects the mind with the Cognitive Faculty. Now both these externities, that is, outer externities, should be withdrawn and should coincide with the inner externity, and this is described jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati niyacchet, that is, &ldquo;all mental movements or mobilities should merge into the pure &lsquo;I&rsquo; feeling.&rdquo; Tad yachheccha&#x301;nta a&#x301;tmani &ndash; &ldquo;and the subtlest form of mind is to merge into the Cognitive Faculty and enjoy the cognitive stance.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So I must say that there is movement in the physical sphere but there is no progress in the physical sphere; there is movement in the psychic sphere, but there cannot be any progress in the psychic sphere; but progress and movement both exist in the realm of spirituality &ndash; that is, spiritual progress is the progress, and other kinds of progress [do not represent any real gain].<!-- /block --></p>
