<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Anubhu&#x301;tavis&#x301;aya&#x301;sampramos&#x301;ah smrtih [&ldquo;The re-creation of things already perceived by the mind is called memory&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The objects or incidents that one recollects are called anubhu&#x301;tavis&#x301;aya&#x301; or things already perceived. When the same objects or incidents are recreated in the mind, they are called smrti or memory. For instance, a person may not always recollect what he or she ate the previous day, but if he or she thinks hard, the items that were eaten will flash in the mind. In our daily life, we are constantly recollecting things perceived in the past.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->How does one activate the memory? There are two ways: internal and external. The internal way is to revive the undistorted image of perceived incidents in the nerve cells. Perception in the primary stage is registered in the unit mind through the nerve cells, and the vibrations of those perceptions remain embedded in the nerve cells. The nerve cells in the brain differ according to the different vibrations they carry. Some carry vibrations of knowledge, others the vibrations of action. Microcosms with brains do not have much difficulty in creating ideas at the psychic level carried through inferences because the vibrations in the nerve cells remain undistorted for quite some time. For instance, if someone happens to see a white cow, he or she can easily say after five minutes what the colour of the cow was because the image of the cow imprinted in the nerve cells is still clear and distinct. That is why it is not difficult for the brain to recollect a memory by recreating ideational waves. But if we ask the same person to describe the cow after a few days, he or she will have more difficulty recollecting its colour because by then the impression of the cow in the nerve cells will have become indistinct. At that stage the perceived image is stored in the citta or ectoplasmic mind-stuff and not the brain. Hence the mind will have to labour hard to reformulate the image of the cow from the accumulated sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or the mental reactive momenta of past actions. The ability to do this depends on one&#146;s psychic power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->If the external factors necessary for the revival of memory remain undisturbed for some time, one can more easily recreate events already perceived. For instance, if one happens to go to the spot where the cow was seen, one suddenly remembers that a white cow was tethered there. But, after a lapse of much time, when the external factors necessary for the re-creation of that image change drastically, it becomes difficult for the brain to remember the details of the event. At this stage, to recollect the image, one has to penetrate the citta of the unit mind. Of course, once an incident is recollected, its impression remains understood for some time before it finally disappears.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Thus the brain is nothing more than a worldly machine for mental recollection. Its various parts assist the mind in various ways. But the permanent abode of memory is the citta. So even though an impression has faded from the nerve cells, the mind can recreate the impression by its own power. When the brain assists in the recollection of any event or fact it is called &ldquo;cerebral memory&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The human mind has three stages: crude, subtle and causal. There are also three states in human existence: wakeful, dream and sleep. The crude mind remains active during the wakeful state and the causal mind remains active during sleep. The causal mind is the repository of infinite knowledge. Whatever sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras we recreate in the wakeful and dream states remain stored in the causal mind. When the causal mind sleeps we call it &ldquo;death&rdquo;. Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;amanasi diirghanidra&#x301; maran&#x301;am [&ldquo;Long sleep in the causal mind is death&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->After death the disembodied mind floats in the vast space with its unexpressed sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Later on, with the cooperation of the mutative principle, the disembodied mind finds a suitable physical base. The memory of its past life remains awake for approximately the first five years of its new life. Although the child remains in a new physical environment, mentally it continues to live the joys and sorrows of its previous life. That is why children sometimes laugh and cry in their sleep, and their mothers often think they are talking with God. In colloquial Bengali this is called deola ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;. In actual fact this laughter and crying is nothing but the reappearance of past memories. To re-experience past events one does not need the cooperation of the old brain. The newly-born mind has not yet had time to build a close relationship with the new brain. The revival of experiences of past lives is what we call &ldquo;extra-cerebral memory&rdquo;, and is principally the task of the causal mind. The child&#146;s mind being unacquainted with the outside world and the new-born brain being inexperienced, his or her crude mind does not function much.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The experiences of the crude mind are not reflected in the child&#146;s subtle mind. In the case of a child, since the crude experiences are relatively few, the subtle mind remains tranquil. Thus the waves of the causal mind easily surface in the child&#146;s subtle mind. As a result, the accumulated experiences of the child&#146;s previous life can easily be recollected. As the child&#146;s crude mind is not yet mature enough to work externally, the dream experiences are not expressed in the wakeful state.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This extra-cerebral memory begins to fade after five years. The more one advances in age, the more the new environment leaves its impressions in the child&#146;s mind. The more a child sees new things before its eyes, the more restless it becomes to know each and every object of this world. Hence the child asks a multitude of questions &ndash; it seems there is no end to its inquisitiveness. The more it receives the answers to its questions, the more its mind gets acquainted with the mundane world. The experiences of the crude mind then begin, and get reflected in the dream state. As a result, the vibrations of the causal mind cannot come to the surface any more. Hence, the more the child advances in age, the more it forgets its past life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Sometimes children can remember their past life even after the age of five. In this case the mind of the new body remains free from environmental influences. That is, the waves of the external world are unable to influence the mind. Such people are called ja&#x301;tismara or one who remembers one&#146;s past lives. Normally, the extra-cerebral memory of such people remains active up to the age of twelve. If one still remembers one&#146;s past life after that it becomes difficult to survive, because two minds will try to function in one body &ndash; the mind of this life and that of the previous one. A single body cannot tolerate the clashes of two minds, hence psycho-physical parallelism is lost leading to eventual death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Forgetfulness is a providential decree. Usually human beings forget their past lives. Is this forgetfulness a blessing or a curse? It is a blessing because human beings feel burdened by the weight of one life. It would be impossible for them to carry the burden of many lives together.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The human mind is sentimental &ndash; full of love, affection, camaraderie, etc. People have a deep attraction to this world; they remain preoccupied throughout their lives with fears and anxieties for the safety of their families. So many problems have to be confronted. The problems of one life alone are enough to make people restless. If they had to face the problems of several lives, they would be unable to lead a natural life. The problems of the past lives, compounded by the strife of the present life, would drive them to the brink of insanity. Secondly, it is difficult for people to be detached from love and attachment for one life. So much effort is required to overcome the bondages of attachment and march towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. If the memory of the past lives is revived, the bondage of attachment will tighten its grip, putting a halt to spiritual advancement. One will be caught in the grip of worldly attachment. Thus the decree of merciful providence is, &ldquo;Let human beings be oblivious of their past lives.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It is also true that nothing in this universe is lost or destroyed, so the history of a person&#146;s hopes and frustrations [of this life] remains stored in their subconscious mind [subtle mind]. Due to restlessness of the crude and subtle minds, the causal mind cannot give expression to its omniscience. But all knowledge, one&#146;s entire past history and flashes of one&#146;s previous lives, remain stored in sequential order in the causal mind, just like a colourful panorama, one layer representing one life, followed by a gap, followed by another layer representing another life, and so on. That is why the great poet Rabindranath Tagore said, Bhule tha&#x301;ka&#x301; se to nay bhola&#x301; [&ldquo;To remain in oblivion is not to forget completely&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Human beings, if they so want, may try to relive those experiences in their memories. This endeavour is called sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practice. Sa&#x301;dhakas or spiritual aspirants, by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, suspend their crude mind in the subtle mind, and the subtle mind in the causal mind. They can then clearly visualize that panorama of sequential events in the causal mind. As they have full control over the time factor they can easily transcend the intervening gaps between two lives and establish a link between them. A series of lives slowly and gradually unfold themselves like a moving panorama before their eyes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Should one strive to see one&#146;s past lives? Through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; human beings attain a certain degree of control over the relative factors. After a long journey of hundreds of years one begins to visualize the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of one&#146;s past lives. To visualize other&#146;s sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras is relatively easy for a sa&#x301;dhaka, but to visualize one&#146;s own sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras is very difficult. Behind this also there is the decree of merciful providence. Imagine a person was a sinner in his or her past life, but in this life has got the opportunity to lead a spiritual life, by His Grace. Now, if the person happens to discover his or her past sinful life, he or she will lose all inspiration to continue spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The dominant thought in his or her mind will be, &ldquo;I am a sinner. I have no sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and will be unable to do it.&rdquo; This sort of negative thought will thwart his or her spiritual progress. One&#146;s past life will pull one back. In the words of Rabindranath Tagore:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Adrs&#x301;t&#x301;ere shudhha&#x301;lem emani nis&#x301;t&#x301;ur bale<br>Ke more ta&#x301;niche pashca&#x301;te.<br>Se kahila, &ldquo;Phire dekh,&rdquo;<br>Dekhila&#x301;m a&#x301;mi,<br>Pashca&#x301;te ta&#x301;niche more pashca&#x301;ter a&#x301;mi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->[I asked the Lord of my life, &ldquo;Who is pulling me from behind with such irresistible force?&rdquo; He told me to look back. I did, and found that my own mental reactive momenta were pulling me back.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The pashca&#x301;ter a&#x301;mi [the &ldquo;me&rdquo; behind me] of the poem refers to the extra-cerebral memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Conversely, if a sa&#x301;dhaka happened to be a great spiritualist in his or her past life, then through the powers of his or her extra-cerebral memory he or she will be further inspired to continue the spiritual life. He or she will think, &ldquo;In my previous life I was unable to complete my spiritual practice. Now in this life Parama Purus&#x301;a has given me the opportunity to attain my cherished goal.&rdquo; He or she will intensify his or her spiritual practice and advance rapidly towards Parama Purus&#x301;a with His sweet attraction. He or she will recite: Sammukhe t&#x301;heliche more pashca&#x301;ter a&#x301;mi [&ldquo;My own reactive momenta are pushing me forward&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
