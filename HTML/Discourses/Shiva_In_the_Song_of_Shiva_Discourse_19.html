<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->1. Vajra: A kind of powerful weapon invented and used by Shiva. He used this weapon to protect the honest and virtuous people as well as innocent birds and animals, and to strike at the sinful, violent and arrogant antisocial elements. Shiva was very restrained and self-possessed in all spheres of life; He would use His weapon only on rare occasions. From a perusal of history we learn that He never used this weapon against any virtuous person. Human beings as well as animals in trouble used to approach Shiva for security; Shiva would protect them and admonish their enemies to move along the path of righteousness. By repeated persuasion He tried to rectify their defects. Only against those who refused to correct their ways and, on the contrary, tried to further their own self-interest by opposing Shiva, did He use this weapon. Since it was used to promote the welfare of all living beings, it was rightly called shubhavajra [&ldquo;the thunderbolt of welfare&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Shiva had unbounded love not only for human beings but for animals as well, and so He was respected as Pashupati [the Lord of Animals]. His vajra was also called Pa&#x301;shupata Astra [the Weapon of Pashupati]. By Shiva&#146;s grace, some honest and virtuous people also acquired this weapon and had the opportunity to learn how to use it. One whose vajra was always used with benevolent intent was rightly called shubhavajradhara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->2. In those days the Aryans were fair-complexioned, the non-Aryans dark-complexioned, and the Mongolians yellow-complexioned. But Shiva was white-complexioned. His immense purity of mind was in perfect harmony with His white complexion. Regarding His complexion it has been stated kundendu-hima-shaunkha shubhra &ndash; that is, Shiva is as white as a kunda flower&#8230; as the lovely moon&#8230; as the glittering snow&#8230; as a conch shell. Hence the epithet shubhra kalevara [&ldquo;one with a white-complexioned body&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->3. Since the beginning of yoga practice, yogis have sat on various kinds of materials which are by nature non-conductors of heat and electricity. The yogis of olden times mostly sat on animal skins, and in many cases they also used animal skins as their outer garments. Later, for lack of animal skins, people started using blankets as a&#x301;sanas [meditation seats]. Shiva was fond of using tiger skins both as His seat during meditation and as His outer garments. About 4500 years after Shiva, due to the influence of the Digambara Jain cult, He was depicted as digambara [without clothes] &ndash; which was not at all true. Actually Shiva was never digambara. He was indifferent to His dress, but He never did anything indecent. In the dhya&#x301;na mantra of Shiva, there is no reference to Shiva as digambara, as one whose body is smeared with ashes, as one who is addicted to opium or hashish. These were the latter-day fantasies of some irresponsible people. Thus in the &ldquo;Shivagiiti&rdquo; [&ldquo;Song of Shiva&rdquo;], Shiva has been described as vya&#x301;ghra&#x301;mbara Hara.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->4. Harati pa&#x301;pa&#x301;n ityarthe Hari [&ldquo;One who steals others&#x301;sins is called Hari&rdquo;], and Harati bandanam&#x301; ityarthe Hara [&ldquo;One who cuts asunder the knots of bondages is called Hara&rdquo;]. That great personality who lays out the spiritual path which leads to liberation from all kinds of bondages is called Hara. If He is not Hara, then who deserves such a glorious epithet?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->5. One should proceed toward Parama Purus&#x301;a without the least thought of selfishness, and should not ask Him for anything. In fact, Parama Purus&#x301;a knows the real needs of human beings better than they themselves &ndash; the parents of a child know the child&#146;s need better than the child itself. So an ideal sa&#x301;dhaka is one who never asks Parama Purus&#x301;a for anything &ndash; who asks only for Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. Thus here Parama Purus&#x301;a is beseeched, dehi padam &ndash; &ldquo;give me shelter at Your feet&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->6. In olden days neglected and exploited people, who had fallen prostrate under extreme oppression, used to look upon Shiva as their supreme shelter. Shiva would crush this exploitation with His thunderbolt &ndash; He would strike the arrogance of vain and egotistic people with His trident, and reduce to ashes the mountains of injustice and tyranny. He felt great compassion for those afflicted people and, making them sit beside Him, advised them how to solve their physical, psychic and spiritual problems. Shiva used to live on a hill, and all kinds of people from far and near would flock to Him. He would call them with the call of His vis&#x301;a&#x301;n&#x301;a, His long horn, and that is why the people of those days could not think of Him without His vis&#x301;a&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; so they lovingly nicknamed Him &ldquo;Vis&#x301;a&#x301;n&#x301;anina&#x301;daka&rdquo; [&ldquo;One who Blows the Vis&#x301;a&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;]. Perhaps those persecuted people, whose lustreless faces showed no glow of well-being, who had been reduced to skeletons by their back-breaking labour, who had no soft bed of flowers on which to rest &ndash; those persecuted people, buffeted by hunger and exhausted by injustice &ndash; were not at all beautiful. That is why the arrogant tyrants of those days contemptuously called them &ldquo;ghouls&rdquo; and &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo;. But those so-called ghouls and ghosts were in fact the companions of Shiva. These unbeautiful representatives of the hungry masses of the world of that time were actually the simple and devoted followers of Shiva, His gan&#x301;as who spoiled the yajin&#x32D;a of King Daksha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->7. Kleshakarmavipa&#x301;ka&#x301;shayaerapara&#x301;mrt&#x301;s&#x301;ah Purus&#x301;avishes&#x301;a Iishavarah &ndash; &ldquo;That Purus&#x301;a who remains unassailed by klesha [afflictions], by the bondages of karma, by vipa&#x301;ka [reactions] and a&#x301;shaya [sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras] is called Iishvara.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Shiva wanted His beloved devotees, His gan&#x301;as who took shelter under Him, to attain the highest spiritual realization, and so He Himself used to teach them the different processes of spiritual practice to remove all spiritual and psychic afflictions; and moreover He spared no effort to help His devotees to overcome all mundane and social difficulties.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Whenever Shiva noticed tears in the eyes of His devotees He felt restless. In fact, everyone was aware of the tenderness and flower-like softness of His large heart. Even wicked people used to take full advantage of His large-heartedness. Even though Shiva realized this, He would not change His ways. He never said, &ldquo;I have made a mistake by forgiving those people, by granting them boons.&rdquo; Thus this noble personality, the remover of all the afflictions of the universe, was lovingly called Ashutos&#x301;a, One Who Is Easily Pleased.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->8. Just as a unit entity is quite insignificant next to the vast Cosmic Entity, similarly the intellect of a unit entity is completely insignificant next to the vast intellectual power of the Cosmic Entity. In the brilliant light of the sun, the feeble glow of a firefly is invisible. What to speak of a firefly &ndash; even the moon and stars fade in the presence of the sun! Only in the blinding darkness of night are the moon, the stars and the fireflies important &ndash; only then do they dare to strut and prance. Similarly, as long as living beings remain forgetful of Parama Purus&#x301;a, they pompously display their little intellect. Some people do not realize, others do realize, and still others pretend not to realize, that the Cosmic Mind is the only shelter of all unit minds. Thus all their intellectual abilities, all their swaggering and boasting, are all contained within the vast bosom of the Cosmic Mind. Thus it has been rightly said that Shiva is sarvadhiidha&#x301;raka [&ldquo;the Supreme Entity in whom all intellect is sheltered&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->9. Shiva was the first person in the universe to marry; before Him no one was married in the true sense of the term. No male would take any kind of household responsibility, only perhaps a nominal responsibility such as animals do. But when Shiva is addressed here as &ldquo;A&#x301;dipita&#x301;&rdquo; [&ldquo;First Father&rdquo;], it does not mean that He was the first married person. It means that He was such a great personality that out of His deep paternal love and compassion He provided a safe shelter not only to human beings but also to animals. He gave them food to eat, the touch of warmth in cold, consolation in sorrow, and made them realize the warm feeling of existence. Before Him people were half animal, half human. These people, who had been devoid of any social consciousness and mutual love for each other, built a sweet and loving environment revolving around Shiva; they created a social atmosphere of peace and happiness, a cool and shady bower of peace. For the first time in history, people began to realize that they were human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The loving inspiration of Shiva made those mute people eloquent, and they proclaimed with a sweet smile on their faces, Hararme pita&#x301; Gaorii ma&#x301;ta&#x301; svadeshah bhuvanatrayam [&ldquo;Shiva is my father, Pa&#x301;rvatii is my mother, and the three worlds of earth, heaven and hell are my native land&rdquo;]. They further declared, A&#x301;tmagotram&#x301; parityajya Shivagotram&#x301; pravishatu [&ldquo;Leave your own gotra and enter Shivagotra&rdquo;]. &ldquo;From now on there will be no discrimination among us, no conflict among the clans. Regardless of our colour &ndash; black, white, yellow &ndash; we are all the sons and daughters of Shiva. We all belong to one gotra &ndash; Shivagotra.&rdquo; Thus the prehistoric humans, united by the common bond of the fatherhood of Shiva, strengthened the foundation of their mutual relationships. They realized that because Shiva was their father, their lives were in harmony and rhythm. Thus Shiva was the first father of the human race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->10. The word deva is derived from the Sanskrit root verb  div. The word deva means an entity which is shining in its own spiritual effulgence. In this universe, a benevolent entity which is an embodiment of serenity and beauty is called deva. After feeling the tender touch of Shiva&#146;s large-heartedness, people understood the concept of deva, and they declared Shiva to be a&#x301;dideva [&ldquo;the first deva&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->11. Long ago people learned to perform sacrifices, they realized in theory that God exists, but they did not know how to attain Him &ndash; how to develop God-consciousness, how to make themselves fit instruments for the attainment of the Supreme. Shiva prepared the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for them and taught them how to evolve their minds with the help of mantra. Manana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah mantrah parikiirtitah [&ldquo;A mantra is that collection of sounds which, when meditated upon, leads to liberation&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Shiva also taught the people how to develop themselves spiritually with the help of mantra yoga, ra&#x301;ja yoga and other branches of ra&#x301;ja&#x301;dhira&#x301;j yoga.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Then people accepted unanimously that Shiva was mantra&#x301;dhipati, or mantresha &ndash; &ldquo;the lord of mantra&rdquo;. Shiva equally loved animals and human beings. As He protected the animals, He was addressed as Pashupati. In the spiritual world, He gave shelter to the sa&#x301;dhakas of viirabha&#x301;va [a kind of Tantric ideation]. So, He was respectfully addressed as &ldquo;Viireshvara&rdquo;. And as He was the guardian of those sa&#x301;dhakas of noble character and developed intellect, He was addressed as &ldquo;Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo; [the &ldquo;Lord of Lords&rdquo;]. Deva&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; devah ityarthe Maha&#x301;deva [&ldquo;The Lord of lords is Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->For ages those exalted entities considered as devas have said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;O Maheshvara, it is not possible for the unit mind to understand You. Whenever I have tried to fathom You in any way, I did not succeed, so I do not know what You really are. But whatever You are, I pay my deepest salutation to You.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->12. That mental state which is created in the subtlest, most solitary recesses of the mind, which inspires the practical side of thought, which develops human personality, is called bha&#x301;va:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Shuddhasattvavishes&#x301;a&#x301;d&#x301;va&#x301; premasu&#x301;rya&#x301;m&#x301;shusa&#x301;myabha&#x301;k,<br>Rucibhishcittama&#x301;srn&#x301;ya krdasao bha&#x301;va ucyate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->[That which makes one extremely pure and sentient, which causes the sun of love to shine, Which makes the mind clean-surfaced and soft owing to the spiritual effulgence, is called bha&#x301;va.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Reality, is beyond all speech and thought: He is beyond the reach of the vocal cord. So He is bha&#x301;va&#x301;tiita [&ldquo;beyond bha&#x301;va&rdquo;]. Shiva was also beyond the reach of ordinary intelligence. Although His body was composed of the five fundamental factors, He was beyond them. The more one thinks of His infinite qualities, the more one becomes speechless, the more deeply one becomes absorbed in Him. However He is viewed, He is seen to be the newest of the new &ndash; constantly new. That is why He has been described as bha&#x301;va&#x301;tiita abhinava [&ldquo;beyond bha&#x301;va, ever-new&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->13. In the &ldquo;Shivagiiti&rdquo; as well as the dhya&#x301;na mantra of Shiva, Shiva is described as rajatagirinibha. That is, the physical appearance of Shiva was like a great silver mountain. Not only the external complexion of Shiva was silvery, His mind also was stainless and sparkling white. There was no difference between the inside and outside of the white-complexioned Shiva, the embodiment of na&#x301;da.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Shiva the great intellectual, great yogi, great tapasvii [one who performs penance], the most glorious one, whose inside and outside were in perfect balance, was the shelter and the vehicle for the development of others.<!-- /block --></p>

Each of them according to his or her inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras is moving forward from the distant past to the more distant future. But how many of them are really human beings? How few people can we fully trust &ndash; to whom we can tell all our pains and pleasures, to whom we can divulge all the thoughts of our minds and hearts and feel completely relieved, to whom we can say, &ldquo;O Lord, You know everything. I have nothing to hide from You.&rdquo; No, we do not ordinarily find such people. They are not only rare, they are also as sweet as honey. After coming into contact with such a person even once, one feels forever drawn to Him, one&#146;s heart yearns for Him, one cannot help but be pulled by His irresistible attraction. He is at the same time &ldquo;filled with sweetness and difficult to attain&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
