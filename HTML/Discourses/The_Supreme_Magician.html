<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The creator of the universe is a great magician. He creates by dint of His magical spell and controls the magically created universe. There is nothing in the universe that cannot be or that is not controlled by Him. That is, everybody, each and every entity obeys Him and He establishes His control with the help of His Shakti. &ldquo;Shaktih sa&#x301; shivasya shaktih&rdquo;. Shakti has got no alternative but to do according to His desires, and He with the help of that Shakti controls everything. As He is the Supreme Controller, that is why He is Iishvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->When a magician creates something, the spectators will think, &ldquo;Oh! What magic! What a grand show!&rdquo; But the magician knows the secret. The magician knows that if anybody from amongst the spectators knows or gets the chance to know the inner secret of the magic then he won&#146;t be cheated or bewildered by that magic and till the magical spell is there, they will fell certain charm for the magically created world. Afterwards the charm will go away. Then they will say, &ldquo;No, no, no, I don&#146;t want to see this magic. I want to go to the party of the magician, not to the party of the spectators.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The magician wants people to witness the display. But what will the spectators or the intelligent persons amongst the spectators who want to join the magician&#146;s party, do? They will develop love for the magician and join the party. After joining the party, each and every secret of the magic will be known to them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ya evaeka udbhave sambhave ca&rdquo;. All these magical expressions, magical displays, have their origin in Him. He expressed Himself in the form of so many magical displays. And it is that magician who retains and nourishes the magically created objects; and finally those objects go back to the inner arena of that magician.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ya etadviduramrta&#x301;ste bhavanti&rdquo;. That intelligent spiritual aspirant who comes in close contact with the magician by dint of his extreme love for the magician attains immortality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What is immortality? Everything in this universe is subject to wanings and decayings, but the Supreme Veracity remains unchanged, unmetamorphosed. So, the man, the aspirant, the intelligent aspirant taking shelter in Him, also attains immortality. That is why He is known as &ldquo;Mrtyurmrtyu&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The term mrtyurmrtyu has two meanings. The first one is that those who attain Him, won&#146;t be reborn and their death would be final death. The second is that He is the death of death, that is, the death comes to a pause when death comes near Him; the death is to undergo death before Him. That is why it has been said, &ldquo;Amrta&#x301;ste bhavanti&rdquo;: those who attain Him become immortal.<!-- /block --></p>
