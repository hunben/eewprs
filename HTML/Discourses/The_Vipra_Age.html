<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The intellect of intelligent people can penetrate where the rays of the sun cannot. Such people want to enjoy matter without being subservient to it. In other words, they want to control matter with their mental waves. It is not only ks&#x301;atriyas who do this, but vipras as well. The fundamental difference between ks&#x301;atriya-hood and vipra-hood is that the ego of the ks&#x301;atriyas draws objects of enjoyment to itself through a physical struggle with all opposing forces, while the ego of the vipras or their desire for enjoyment draws matter to itself either by the physical force of others through physical clash, or directly through psychic clash but avoiding physical clash, or through physical or psychic clash or both according to the demands of the situation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The salient feature of vipra life is that they enjoy the glory of victory and avoid the ignominy of defeat, and that in their personal lives they satisfy their desires for enjoyment without taking great risks. Like ks&#x301;atriyas, vipras are constantly engaged in fighting, but their fight takes place on the battleground of the intellect. Thus, vipras are intellectuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->They do not use their intellectual development only to accumulate material wealth; they also surpass all others in their capacity to accumulate subtle psychic wealth. Their intellectual endowment and intuitional longing are especially helpful in awakening agrya&#x301;buddhi [pinnacled intellect]. And although there is no ideological difference between pleasure-seeking vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas in terms of psychic dynamism, those vipras who develop a pinnacled intellect are very different from ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The awakening of the pinnacled intellect, together with the momentum of that intellect, enables it to reach almost the highest stance of subtlety, so its movement is in a straight line. Its momentum has speed and moves in all directions. It contains within itself all the varn&#x301;as [mental colours], which is why vipras are the embodiment of whiteness &ndash; their colour is white. As they express themselves less through their motor organs than do ks&#x301;atriyas, blood-red, the symbol of spiritedness, cannot be their colour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->But how many white vipras are there, who try to develop a pinnacled intellect? Most vipras are busy accumulating objects of enjoyment with the help of the physical strength of others, like parasites. In this chapter, when I use the term vipra, I mean this inferior type of vipra. I will talk later about the superior white vipras, or sadvipras, who try to develop a pinnacled intellect.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Vipra Society<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Vipras make use of the back-breaking labour of the shu&#x301;dras and the powerful personalities of the ks&#x301;atriyas to achieve their objectives. Shu&#x301;dras help build society with their physical labour and ks&#x301;atriyas help with their powerful personalities. Enticing them both, the vipras exact the physical labour of the shu&#x301;dras, and purchase the personal force of the ks&#x301;atriyas. If they see a towering mountain blocking the path of social progress, vipras do not sit back in despair or worship the obstacle as a god (or worship a particular disease as a goddess<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> ) &ndash; in a way worshipping their own helplessness &ndash; like the shu&#x301;dras; neither do they leap fearlessly into the ocean of action like the ks&#x301;atriyas. They use their intellects to plan victory over their enemies; the ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras translate these plans into action at the cost of their lives. The vipras march to the fore over the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; and shu&#x301;dras&#146; dead bodies and proclaim to the world, "Look at what I did. Just see how I won victory." The pages of history are full of examples of the indirect struggles of the vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The characteristic similarities and differences between ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras are clearly evident in every aspect of life. Ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras are identified not by their similarities but by their differences. The most important difference is that ks&#x301;atriyas try to enslave matter directly by fighting with it, whereas vipras, using their intellects, try to enslave the ks&#x301;atriyas (who can then triumph over matter). The path of the ks&#x301;atriyas is straightforward &ndash; there is no scope for duplicity; the path of the vipras is crooked from beginning to end &ndash; there is no scope for simplicity. Whatever simplicity vipras exhibit is merely a veneer to hide their crookedness. A body of people with a vipra mentality is called vipra society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It should be kept in mind that words such as shu&#x301;dra, ks&#x301;atriya and vipra [as used in this book] have no connection with the varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama system of ancient Hindu society. However, it is a fact that those who became vipras by virtue of their intellect declared that the vipras were a hereditary caste in order to perpetuate their own authority in society. They showed the ks&#x301;atriyas, whom they had defeated and who had submitted to them, a little mercy by giving them a social position just under themselves. (Actually this was not done out of mercy but so they could put them to work in the future.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Intellectual Exploitation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Vipras use all their abilities for intellectual exploitation. They try to gain prestige in society and maintain that prestige by composing mythological stories which play on the weaknesses of the human mind; by preaching the divine power of certain gods and goddesses under certain circumstances; by convincing people of the vipras&#146; social superiority; and by injecting the confusion of religion even into spirituality. They spend most of the mental resources of their precious lives scheming to gain prestige and plotting to maintain it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->If one reads the scriptures of any religious community, one will find ample examples of this. Even if one undergoes austerities, practises ritualistic fasting, undertakes pilgrimages, bathes in holy rivers and springs, worships a sacred fire or studies the scriptures, one will not be blessed unless one also offers sacerdotal fees to the vipras. Only the vipras are authorized to recite even ordinary pa&#x301;nca&#x301;lii [long folk poems] about laokik gods and goddesses<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ndash; and needless to say, a vipra would never visit anybody to recite such poems without remuneration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Occasionally even sinful, antisocial elements are led to believe that if they frankly confess their sins to a vipra, the vipra through his special efforts will obtain a dispensation saving them from the consequences of their sins; every intelligent person knows that a vipra will never act as an agent of God without some remuneration. Just see the way sins are condoned!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Even so, vipras have more capacities than ks&#x301;atriyas. A ks&#x301;atriya seeks happiness only through physical enjoyment, but a vipra is capable of some mental enjoyment as well, however little it may be.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Disasters occur when there is a lack of balance between people&#146;s physical and intellectual efforts. If the reins of society are in the hands of people who suffer from such imbalances, society as a whole will suffer the consequences of those disasters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The amount of intellectual labour performed by shu&#x301;dras is negligible compared to their physical labour. Although the intellectual labour of ks&#x301;atriyas is not completely meaningless, it does not have much practical value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Even if a vipra administration does not itself create disasters, it will not be able to prevent them from occurring for long. What happens with the vipras is that [intellect] is given a higher valuation than the application of physical force. Thus under a vipra administration others work to enhance the vipras&#146; prestige and to maintain the vipras&#146; standard of living, while the vipras use their intellect to live an unbalanced life and to suck the vitality of others like parasites.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Where there is more physical clash in life, physical force will increase faster than intellect or the expression of intellect, and likewise, where there is much psychic clash, there will be only the expression of intellect, coupled with a gradual but eventually severe increase in physical indolence. From a psychological point of view, people dominated by intellect in this way gradually become more and more atrophied, so that whatever magnanimity exists at the beginning of the Vipra Age is lost by the end of the age. The end result of this lack of magnanimity is that the vaeshyas become dominant in society. At the beginning of the Vipra Age the vipras provide advice about how to protect society as well as how to exploit it; they also take advice from others about how to protect and exploit it. But by the end of the Vipra Age the vipras only give advice but no longer accept it, and the advice they give concerns only how to exploit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->How the Vipras Evolve<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, those who were defeated by physical force and military strength resorted to intellectual strategems in an effort to win victory. The psychic clash they experienced in their long, drawn-out struggle for victory developed their intellects. The original fathers of the vipras were those who first used their intellects to exploit the strength of the strong.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Ks&#x301;atriyas, shu&#x301;dras and relatively-undeveloped vipras came to be exploited by the fathers of the vipras, whom they recognized as their gotra [clan] leaders (or patriarchs), or recognized as founders of a pravar [lineage]. In some countries this gotra-pravar system still exists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;atriyas who developed vipra intellectual abilities due to psychic clash while under vipra intellectual guidance were responsible for the continuation of vipra dominance. Actually, just as those shu&#x301;dras who had been influenced by ks&#x301;atriyas had perpetuated ks&#x301;atriya society, it was those ks&#x301;atriyas who had been influenced by vipras who perpetuated vipra society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->We see from the past that when, in a natural process, social dominance passed out of the hands of the ks&#x301;atriyas and into those of the vipras, though still within the ks&#x301;atriya succession, the main reason was that at that time most ks&#x301;atriyas were ks&#x301;atriyas in name only, but were actually shu&#x301;dras. Similarly, at the time the vipras fell from authority, though the vipra succession went on, it could be observed that those who were vipras in name only outnumbered the vipras themselves, that is, the genuine intellectuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Why did this occur?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The Social Cycle and the Right of Inheritance<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The rule of the social cycle is that the Shu&#x301;dra Age is followed by the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, the Ks&#x301;atriya Age is followed by the Vipra Age, and the Vipra Age is followed by the Vaeshya Age, which is followed by social revolution. This kind of social rotation is the inexorable law of nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Even during the period of their dominance, ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras both understood (at least) that as nothing in the world stays the same forever, their dominance as well would one day come to an end, and that too due to their unworthiness. For this reason they extolled the right of inheritance and attached greater importance to it than to individual capacity &ndash; so that regardless of his ability, the son of a king would become a king and wear the laurels of ks&#x301;atriya victory, and however foolish or stupid, the heir of a vipra would be respected by society and enjoy the privileges of a vipra. Subsequently the same thing occurred in vaeshya society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->It can be observed that in the Ks&#x301;atriya Age power gradually passes into the hands of non-ks&#x301;atriyas who are ks&#x301;atriyas in name only, and in the Vipra Age power passes into the hands of non-vipras who are vipras in name only, all in the name of hereditary rights. But it is impossible for such unworthy people to maintain their hold on power. Under such circumstances power passes out of the hands of the ks&#x301;atriyas and into the hands of the vipras, and later passes again from the hands of the vipras to the hands of the vaeshyas; and when the dominance of the oppressive vaeshyas becomes intolerable the common people revolt, thus starting a new chapter in the social cycle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Satanic Vipras<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The development of human society that comes in the wake of the lustrous vitality of the ks&#x301;atriyas becomes somewhat subdued among the vipras. That vitality gradually surrenders to intellectuality. The strength and sincerity demonstrated in the practical sphere by the ks&#x301;atriyas in their efforts to conquer matter and consciousness is not matched by the vipras. Vipras certainly do use their intellect to try to acquaint themselves with consciousness, but they do not try to conquer matter through the application of their own physical strength &ndash; that also they try to do using intellect as their capital. Through their intellect they use the strength of the ks&#x301;atriyas to conquer matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->At the slightest sign from the vipras, major wars break out in different countries and states. The vipras themselves do not fight. By whispering of war in the ears of the king, they send ks&#x301;atriya generals into battle. Ks&#x301;atriya soldiers, running the risks for the vipras, wage war on land, on sea and in the air, and the vipras, understanding their physical and mental weaknesses, entice them with food or money, or inspire them with hollow, idealistic-sounding slogans, and land them in a holocaust.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Thus in the Vipra Age ks&#x301;atriyas fight and die while shrewd vipra ministers receive triumphant ovations. This happens in every country where vipras play a dominant role. The names of vipra ministers are blazoned across the pages of history, but history does not record the numbers of soldiers who died on the battlefield or how many of them saw their golden dreams fade into darkness under cannon fire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->When a vipra minister dies, the newspapers write it up elaborately. Condolence meetings are held; condolence messages come in by the thousands; flags are flown at half mast; and marble statues are erected at intersections in public parks. But the press will never acknowledge the ks&#x301;atriyas whose blood enriched the ground for the harvest of victory. And actually, why should they? How can so many names be published in a newspaper anyway!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->All the great warmongers, the great politicians of the world, belong to this vipra gang of satanic intellect. At their command, or due to their fiery lectures or diplomatic intrigues, millions of foolish shu&#x301;dras have lost their lives and thousands of hot-blooded ks&#x301;atriyas have served as instruments in the slaughter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The pages of world history reveal that all the crusades and jihads of the Middle Ages were plotted by these satanic vipras. Caught in their intrigues, the shu&#x301;dras took the beatings; and the ks&#x301;atriyas fought as religious warriors, but never thought deeply about whom they were fighting for.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Was it only in the Middle Ages that this happened? In today&#146;s world also, satanic vipras, the protected agents of the capitalist vaeshyas, have led and are continuing to lead millions of people along the path of death and destruction. Evil vipras are fanning the flames of the vaeshyas&#146; insatiable, demonic hunger. Neither the shu&#x301;dra masses nor the warlike ks&#x301;atriyas are responsible for the problem of the millions of refugees in different countries, for the heart-rending cries of the mothers, wives, sons and daughters of the soldiers who died on the battlefields, for the blazing flames of communal<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> riots, for communalism itself, provincialism, nationalism and casteism. The responsibility lies with a small group of shrewd vipras who, out of petty self-interest, have instigated the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas to commit heinous acts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->The meanness and brutality of such vipras put on a ghoulish graveyard dance, seeming to make a mockery of the vipras&#146; intellect. In the Vipra Age the vipras drew power from this type of brutality, and through a staged display of black magic, vipras bestrode society. In the Vaeshya Age the vipras commit similar sins in order to shine like fancy shoes on the feet of the vaeshyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Have vipras only exploited others? Although they have done more to exploit others than to serve them, and although their service was motivated by the desire to exploit, the list of those services has been considerable. The ks&#x301;atriyas conquered the physical world through fight, whereas the vipras wormed their intellect into the wealth won by the ks&#x301;atriyas. Whereas the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; intellect was only capable of obtaining objects, the vipras&#146; intellect in the Vipra Age was able to devour them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->But even in the vipras&#146; action of devouring, there is one speciality, and that is, although they demarcated everyone&#146;s field of activity, they allowed people the scope to express themselves within that demarcated area. Even though the vipras exploited and enslaved the ks&#x301;atriyas, they did not curb their martial nature or deny them the opportunity to display their heroism. And although they were reluctant to recognize the shu&#x301;dras as human beings, they nevertheless allowed them an opportunity to survive. In the history of human progress and of the effort to establish human superiority over matter, we would be overlooking an important fact if we failed to mention this speciality of the Vipra Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The Idea of Supernatural Phenomena<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->The vipras were successful due to their intelligence. They not only defeated the ks&#x301;atriyas in intellectual battles but also filled them with awe. Whatever primitive human weaknesses the ks&#x301;atriyas were unable to overcome, the vipras would take advantage of to exploit them and the rest of society &ndash; that is, the shu&#x301;dras &ndash; and this goes on even today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Whenever they would intellectually defeat the ordinary people, the vipras would cleverly introduce the idea of supernatural phenomena in order to achieve their objectives. In reply to the question, "Where do people go after they die?" undeveloped people had themselves developed the concept of ghosts as the answer. Any frightful or distressing events of the everyday world that could not be understood were attributed to ghosts. The vipras capitalized on this fear of ghosts by becoming exorcists and tricking the vaeshyas and ks&#x301;atriyas out of their money. Did not the intelligent vipras know that if a ghost is a mental creation, "possession by a ghost" must be just a mental disease? Whether we know the causes of paranormal events or not, they certainly have nothing to do with ghosts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Knowing full well that a person who is possessed by a ghost is suffering from a mental disease and a disease of the nervous system, exorcists generally beat a "possessed" person to reactivate his or her nerves, make him or her inhale the smoke of burnt chillies in order to return him or her to consciousness, or use numerous psychological techniques to cure his or her mental disease, but they never disclose to anybody what they are actually doing. Instead they inarticulately mutter meaningless mantras and even today make people believe that, due to the force of their psychic power or so-called Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practices], pretasiddhi [power to control ghosts] or pisha&#x301;casiddhi [power to control evil spirits], the ghosts and demons will be compelled to flee.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Exorcists tell stories about the various supernatural activities of ghosts or about offering food to manes at Gaya to make a patient concentrate his or her mind. The patient&#146;s concentrated mind may then break the branch of a tree or crack a parapet of the roof, but the vipra exorcists claim that such occurrences are caused by the fleeing ghost and are proof of the power of their mantras. Actually ghosts never kill people, only vipras do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Indeed, vipras earn considerable amounts of money from the public by preaching about the tremendous importance of religiosity and not straying from the path of religiosity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Visions of gods and goddesses or so-called saints is the same type of thing as possession by ghosts. Don&#146;t vipra priests really know that those who receive medical guidance or divine revelations by prostrating themselves before a temple or a saint&#146;s mausoleum for days together without taking food and water, actually experience nothing more than the workings of their own intuition? Had the vipras not known this, they would not have persistently stressed the importance of faith to their followers. Vipras understand that when through faith the crude mind reaches the realm of the subtle mind and the subtle mind reaches the realm of the intuition, it is the intuition, the innate repository of infinite knowledge, that enlightens the intellect. But the person who receives the medical guidance or divine revelation believes that it comes from the deity he or she was worshipping. If one&#146;s faith is not strong enough there will be a lack of concentration and the intellect will not be able to cross the threshold of the aham [ego] and enter the realm of the intuition. Consequently it will not be possible for the person to receive medical guidance or a divine revelation from his or her so-called deity. Vipra priests understand this and tell those with little faith, "You had better go. Your prayers will not be answered." Had the deity actually been watchful the question of the presence or absence of faith would not have arisen; everybody would have received medical guidance or a divine revelation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Intellect controls crude physical force. Therefore ks&#x301;atriyas, who have both intellect and physical strength, make the shu&#x301;dras work according to their will either at the snap of their fingers at bayonet point. And vipras, who are physically weaker but intellectually stronger than the ks&#x301;atriyas, control the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; finger snap and raised bayonet through their sharp intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->The vipras&#146; victory is intellectual victory; it would be meaningless without the support of the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; swords and the shu&#x301;dras&#146; back-breaking labour. In fact, vipras use their nerve cells almost exclusively in their fights; they make very little use of their nerve fibres. The work of the nerve fibres is done by the obedient ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Many major wars have been fought in the history of the world. Millions of unintelligent shu&#x301;dras and thousands of unintelligent but brave ks&#x301;atriyas have lost their lives, but the laurels of victory have always gone to the vipra ministers who have never so much as glanced at a battlefield from a distance. Ask any historical analyst, "Who won victory for Great Britain in the Second World War?" and he or she will immediately reply, "The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr. Churchill."

After some time the eclipse would occur and the world would become dark.

Needless to say, there would in turn be many shu&#x301;dra groups around each ks&#x301;atriya group. Each ks&#x301;atriya group would adopt a gotra [clan] name according to the name of the vipra leader around whom the various groups clustered, and also a pravar [ancestral lineage] name according to the name of a deputy vipra leader.

This redeeming quality of a handful of vipras awakened in the minds of the ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras a special type of love for vipras. Because of this love, even though they were exploited, they did not bother about it. They thought, "What is the harm if the vipras take a part of what I&#146;ve earned through my bravery, strength, intellect or physical labour."<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The ks&#x301;atriyas fought to defend themselves, to protect others and to create a social legacy.

The vipras would continually write new social codes, basing those new codes on different factors such as environment, social needs, human nature, post-war social reactions, and the blood-mixing of different groups. In order to maintain their control, they had based their machinery of exploitation on so-called spiritual scriptures which they declared to be superhuman revelations (supposedly given by God alone and not by human beings) and therefore immutable. Nevertheless they did recognize that it was necessary to change the social system in order to meet the needs of the age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->In this regard it is an incontrovertible fact that the vipras were more broad-minded than the ks&#x301;atriyas. Time and again in their social system the ks&#x301;atriyas had demonstrated a kind of obstinacy characteristic of foolish dictators; whereas the vipras at least did not make this mistake. The reason for this is quite clear. The prestige of the ks&#x301;atriyas derived from their dictatorship, and so by any means they wanted to maintain this system. But the prestige of the vipras was based purely on intellectual supremacy, and so, after ensuring that they had sufficient scope for intellectual exploitation, they considered it expedient to keep pace with the requirements of the age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->If the vipras had admitted that scriptures were written by human beings (such as those written by Manu), they would have lost their scope for exploitation.

This is why the vipras accepted that social codes could be changed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->The vipras were inclined towards intellectual exploitation. Regardless of what they constructed or destroyed, they always made sure that they had sufficient scope to exploit people. The intelligent vipras understood that the path of exploitation was not the path of rationality and therefore they never walked that path, leading the ignorant instead down the path of blind faith. So when they set themselves to formulate social scriptures, they did so with an eye to their own convenience. Instead of supporting their views with rational arguments, they propagated high-sounding religious injunctions. That is why the degree of genuine humanity found in the ks&#x301;atriya social and matrimonial systems did not increase in the social and matrimonial systems of the vipras. The vipras merely covered what genuine humanity was already there with a veneer of religious fanaticism.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->In the Vipra Age, as the dependence of women on men increased, the vipras turned women with vipra intellects into wageless slaves.

<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->In the Vipra Age, particularly in the middle of the Vedic Age, when the intellectuals became all-powerful in society, some women enjoyed the same social rights and dignity as men due to the legacy of the past and were called ja&#x301;ya&#x301;s,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> but most women were treated only as objects of enjoyment.

One or two women who appeared to have been given the opportunity to enjoy those rights did not actually win the rights, but through their great personalities established a kind of right with a type of force. The pandits of those days could not formally oppose this effort to establish their rights, but naturally such endeavours were not viewed favourably.

<a name="83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->The dominance of group-mothers in the Ks&#x301;atriya Age completely disappeared in the Vipra Age. When knowledge first began to bloom in the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, women also would impart knowledge to others. They composed mantras and offered libations to sacrificial fires alongside the men. But in the Vipra Age women lost their prestige. Every attempt was made to totally enslave them. The right to participate in sacrifices was taken away and matriarchs were replaced by patriarchs. Opportunities to read scriptures were either withdrawn or drastically curtailed. Ignorant women had no alternative but to silently accept the supremacy of men.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->The Vipra Age was the age of male opportunists. While men had the opportunity to divorce their wives or to be loose in character, women had to follow a very strict code of conduct.

Yet when men committed the same crimes, they strutted about arrogantly as leaders of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->The Vaeshya Age followed the Vipra Age. But in the Vaeshya Age as well, we see that, as a legacy of the Vipra Age, women who have been abandoned by their husbands have not been respected by society. Even today, in places where society has not yet begun to feel the influence of shu&#x301;dra revolution, society follows the system of the Vipra Age in not open-mindedly accepting divorce.

<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->In the Vipra Age prostitution became a profession for the first time, because women were faced with loss of respect in society, economic difficulties and other worldly problems. It should be kept in mind that the profession of prostitution was not a phenomenon of the Shu&#x301;dra or Ks&#x301;atriya Age. It is possible to find some degree of bad character among both men and women due to the influence of base propensities, but this is not enough to create a large community of prostitutes in society.

<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->In the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, a woman was considered to be the valuable property of a man.

But in the Vipra Age the position of women became like that of cows, sheep and goats, no better than the other essential items of a household. In the Ks&#x301;atriya Age a woman was considered to be a "hero&#146;s reward", and abduction by the strong was considered a virtuous act, but in the Vipra Age this changed a little; in the Vipra Age a woman came to be considered a "pandit&#146;s reward". A woman had no existence in society without a husband.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->In some countries more than one woman might be compelled to be married to one man; devious means were employed to bring this about.

<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->In some countries unmarried girls were forced to marry old men on the verge of death on the curious pretext that it was sinful for a woman to lead an unmarried life.

Just as parents and other elders in the Vipra Age prayed, Puttra&#x301;dicchet para&#x301;jayam ["One should long to be outshone by one&#146;s children"] or Shis&#x301;ya&#x301;dicchet para&#x301;jayam ["One should long to be outshone by one&#146;s students"], their children not only tried to uphold the prestige of their families and of the lineages of their gurus, keeping in view their families&#146; and gurus&#146; traditions, but also, in carefully preserving that prestige, kept an ideal uppermost in their minds and moved towards that ideal. That is why the society of that era kept progressing step by step in the intellectual sphere: the thought of the ideal gave it no respite. Thus Vedic rs&#x301;is [sages] always exhorted people to move forward, saying that the mantra of a living society was Caraeveti, caraeveti ["Move on, move on"].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->Vipra society was far more firmly-knit than ks&#x301;atriya society had been. In ks&#x301;atriya society it had become necessary to select suitable brides and grooms for marriages in order to maintain the continuity of social traditions, but the personal wishes of the brides and grooms themselves were not disregarded. Grooms and families were selected after giving due consideration to the opinions of the brides and grooms themselves. But this was not the practice in the Vipra Age, when maintaining the continuity of social traditions became the primary consideration. Hence in the Vipra Age the scope for independent decisions regarding marriage disappeared, as undue importance began to be paid to the selection either of families or of grooms.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->The vipras&#146; culture was not for the common mass. No doubt it stimulated the nerves of a small handful of people, but it could not move in step with the general mass. Vipra artists wished, through their intellectual brilliance, to conquer the world. Through their poems, dramas, writings and drawings they induced common people to pay homage to the superiority of the intellectuals. But the ignorant people could not understand these big things. The common people thought, "What we cannot understand must be something great," and with this mentality fell obediently at the vipras&#146; feet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=114 type=paragraph -->At times when the intellectual art and literature of the vipras failed to convince the common people of their greatness, the vipras composed countless fanciful pura&#x301;n&#x301;as [mythological tales], stories about gods and goddesses that satisfied their own standards, and colourful mythological tales, all designed to dazzle people&#146;s eyes and confound their intellects. They also warned the masses that if they failed to follow the teachings of these stories, or doubted their veracity, they would most certainly go to the deepest level of hell.<!-- /block --></p>

Similarly, the vipras&#146; expression of their natural characteristics induced them as well to increase their numbers, and for that reason increasing the number of their followers became one criterion of their vipra-hood. Of course in order to succeed in swelling the ranks of their followers, the vipras had to develop a due amount of proficiency; and their efforts to develop it served to build the roof on the edifice of human civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph -->Phallus worship had been invented by the primitive, uncultured ks&#x301;atriyas as a symbol of increasing their population. The cultured vipras now interpreted it in a new way. They contended that the linga was a symbol for Parama Purus&#x301;a [Supreme Consciousness] and the piit&#x301;ha [vulva] a symbol for Prakrti [Supreme Operative Principle]. The interpretation the vipras gave was, Liun&#x32D;gate gamyate yasma&#x301;d talliun&#x32D;gam ["The entity from which everything originates [[and towards which everything is moving]] is called liun&#x32D;ga"] or Yasmin sarva&#x301;n&#x301;i liiyante talliun&#x32D;gam ["The entity in which everything merges is called liun&#x32D;ga"]. When examining the history of phallus worship one should not only consider the mentality of the ks&#x301;atriyas, but also give due consideration to the mentality of the vipras. However, the vipra interpretation has no relation to reality. Phallus worship belonged to primitive ks&#x301;atriya society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->And not only phallus worship; most of the gods and goddesses described in the mythologies of different countries were representations of actual ks&#x301;atriya leaders.

<a name="118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->The undeveloped ks&#x301;atriyas would worship all those leaders, or "gods", by offering them their (the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146;) favourite foods in order to propitiate them. After those leaders&#146; deaths, all such food would be burnt in a fire, thereby going to waste, for the supposed satisfaction of their souls in heaven. Even in the Vipra Age good-quality food and drink was destroyed by offering it to an imaginary god in a sacrificial fire. Moreover, the vipras received a commission for doing this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->Later, after the vipras had fully established their dominance in society, they began to receive more than a mere commission. A sizeable part of the offerings intended for the sacrificial fires was not burnt, but found its way into their storerooms. That is, the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas had become totally subservient to the vipras. Taking advantage of their tyrannical power and superior intellect, the vipras used every means to consolidate their system of exploitation. Regardless of whether a ceremony was concerned with religious practices, charitable activities, the first step in a child&#146;s pursuit of knowledge, harvesting crops, marriage, a baby&#146;s first solid food, commemoration of the dead, or anything else, a share in the [anticipated] benefits had to be offered to the vipras, otherwise the ceremony would not conclude in karmasiddhi [attainment].

<a name="120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->The vipra priests also adopted the different gods and goddesses that had been born out of the fear complex of the masses in the Shu&#x301;dra and Ks&#x301;atriyas Ages.

They also composed various types of dhya&#x301;na mantra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn11"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn11">11</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> for such gods and goddesses; prescribed according to their own needs the specific materials that should be used for different kinds of worship of those deities; and, conveying strange commands from the deities at odd times, took to fleecing people out of donations, daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; [sacerdotal fees], sidha&#x301; [uncooked food given in exchange for a priest&#146;s services] and various types of materials to be used for worship.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->Another interesting thing about this is that in referring to the gods and goddesses created out of their fear complex, the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas used colloquial language, while the vipras, in order to establish their supremacy and prove their intelligence, erudition and close relationship with God, used ancient languages. They always tried to make the masses believe that they, the masses, did not have the right of access to God, but had to go through the vipras. In other words, the vipras had a monopoly as agents in such matters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->The vipras have invented and are still inventing new ways of exploiting different communities of people in different parts of the world. In some places they have lured people with the prospect of eternal heaven, injecting into them at the same time the fear of eternal hell. By claiming the doctrine of some particular vipra leader to be the word of God, they have blocked the natural expression of the human intellect and made people intellectually bankrupt. With the intention of permanently securing for themselves an exalted position in the eyes of the ordinary people, some vipra leaders have declared themselves to be the incarnation or the appointed prophet of God. Through their own so-called scriptures, they have indirectly let the common people know that no one can achieve the same proximity to God as they &ndash; so that an inferiority complex will remain forever in the minds of the masses, and due to this inferiority complex the masses will always follow their teachings, either out of fear or out of devotion. That is why even intellectual people have fallen into their trap and have been compelled to say, Vishva&#x301;se mila&#x301;y vastu, tarke vahu du&#x301;r ["The goal is achieved not by reason but by faith"] or Majhab men a&#x301;kl ka&#x301; dakhl nahii haen ["There is no room for reason in religion"].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph -->If God is considered to be the perfect ideal, it will have to be accepted that God is always just. Even though God loves everyone, He punishes sinners. But it can be said that when He punishes sinners, His aim is not to give them pain but to rectify their behaviour. In my opinion this concept of God is the highest concept. If God is considered to be the Universal Father, He should not have any racial, national or communal feeling, or any other type of limited feeling. If this is true, how can the vipras contract that the soul of a certain dead person will reach heaven?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->I have heard that in some communities vipras claim to have the key to heaven.

It is said that if others sing spiritual songs and kiirtana in the donor&#146;s name, the donor will receive the benefit and go to heaven. What a wonderful philosophy for condoning sin!<!-- /block --></p>

Even if it does momentarily get separated, it again becomes united, because intellectuality which does not adhere to an ideology cannot maintain its brilliance for long; it gets lost in the darkness of selfishness. So just as in the pages of ancient history we find countless examples of how the ks&#x301;atriyas, devoted to their ideology, died fighting to establish their prestige, we find similar examples of how the vipras, devoted to their ideology, fought to establish their doctrines, and either won, or died from the mental shock upon losing.<!-- /block --></p>

Those people are also to be regarded as vipras who have the desire to resist, protest or retaliate against the forcible imposition of certain doctrines on any person or group. These doctrines include not only religious doctrines, but also social, economic or political doctrines which may not strike at the powerful personality of any particular individual (i.e., may not affect ks&#x301;atriyas).<!-- /block --></p>

The names of generals and courageous soldiers have been recorded in the annals of history, and minstrels have composed epic songs in their honour, but the shu&#x301;dras who have shed their blood in the rank and file have remained unknown. The impact that ks&#x301;atriyas create through their heroism and powerful personalities have never gone unknown or unsung as regards the people of their era, because their impact was on that era itself; but shu&#x301;dras remain unknown, because although their contributions are recorded on the pages of time, they do not make an impact on people&#146;s minds. That is why no space is allocated by the newspapers to publish the news of their deaths and why a permanent grave with a tombstone for each of them is considered unnecessary.

<a name="135"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph -->The reason for this is very simple. Human beings have an innate attraction towards the old. Therefore, when the intellect of some vipra reveals or explains something new, the remainder of the population, whether vipras, ks&#x301;atriyas or shu&#x301;dras, cannot easily accept it. They cannot keep time with the new rhythm and prefer to stick to the old one. Thus vipras who develop something new face conflicts, acrimonious attacks and unwarranted criticism. But when the theories propounded by such vipras or their new inventions have been around for some time (it may be two or three months or two or three centuries), other open-minded, rational vipras wholeheartedly accept them and praise them, and are careful to see them become established.<!-- /block --></p>

For example, today mullahs and members of the clergy, and a group of gurus and priests of Hindu society, are incapable of seeing reason.

This is called Yajet yas&#x301;t&#x301;avyamiti ["One should worship an entity simply because it ought to be worshipped"]. That is, regular worship, telling the beads, or prayer ought to be done so many times a day, at such-and-such time &ndash; and therefore we do it &ndash; this mentality is very much in evidence in a vipra.

Even though the control of the government appears to remain or remains on paper in the hands of the ks&#x301;atriyas, in reality those ks&#x301;atriyas are completely controlled by their intellectual vipra ministers. In the Vipra Age the ks&#x301;atriya kings do not want to bring trouble upon themselves by going against the counsels of their vipra ministers or of the priests of the royal family. In fact even if they want to, in most instances they are unable to; or even if they are able to, their actions, being an instance of counter-evolution or counter-revolution, are very short-lived. The kings of many countries in the Middle Ages acted in this way, or tried to do so, but none of them were successful, because they were living in the Vipra Age.<!-- /block --></p>

Secondly, the ks&#x301;atriyas and the shu&#x301;dras not only revered the intelligent, erudite vipras whom they followed, they also viewed the vipras&#146; descendants with respect and gave them places of honour. Irrespective of their abilities, the children of the vipras began to receive almost the same respect as their fathers.

The kings were puppets in the hands of their ministers, standing up and sitting down when they pulled the strings. The vipras did not want a democracy or republic exactly as we understand the terms.

<a name="177"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=177 type=paragraph -->The vipras would try to take military assistance from the less-intelligent ks&#x301;atriyas in order to continue their march of exploitation unhindered. In the early part of the Vipra Age they created conflicts between one state and another and between one king and another centring around the conflicts between one religion and another. In order to continue their exploitation without hindrance, they tried to confuse people&#146;s judgement by shouting religious slogans and issuing various types of decree, thus inciting one group against another or one state against another in their effort to expand their area of exploitation; and in this they succeeded. The terrible wars and tremendous bloodshed that occurred in the world due to the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; lust for power pale into insignificance before those that occurred in the Middle Ages at the direct or indirect instigation of the vipras, the standard-bearers of religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="178"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=178 type=paragraph -->In any society or governmental system where vipra rule lasted for a long time, different kinds of religion or moral philosophy came into being under their aegis. Initially the vipras had introduced religion for the purpose of exploitation and had tried to mislead people through their grandiloquence. However, the new philosophies that emerged in the course of time as a result of clash among vipras propagating different doctrines, came to be somewhat spiritual in appearance, though the tendency to exploit remained beneath the surface. This form of religion, like the form socialism adopted, was in fact a great hoax. With this approach, intellectual satans, instead of exploiting the faithful directly, expanded their sphere of exploitation behind a psychologically-designed mask of detachment from or indifference to worldly things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="179"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=179 type=paragraph -->Vipras with a simple type of philosophy used to say, "Your father deserves to go to heaven, so make sure that we perform his funeral service," or "The soul of your father needs subtle food.

<a name="180"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=180 type=paragraph -->But later on the cunning vipras, whom I call intellectual satans, tried to turn the minds of the people from practical reality towards an imaginary void by preaching contrived philosophies. The essence of their voluminous treatises and verbose annotations to lengthy aphorisms was: the world is an illusion; therefore renounce the world and do not be attracted to its illusions. Become desireless, detached and self-abnegating by offering all your wealth at the feet of the vipras. Of course such philosophies did not preach that the world was also illusory for the vipras who received the offerings &ndash; clearly because it was through such ploys that they were able to achieve their objectives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="181"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=181 type=paragraph -->In places where, for whatever reason, intellectual clashes among the vipras were not very intense, their philosophy was very simple.

<a name="183"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=183 type=paragraph -->It is noticeable that in the fanatical religious communities that we see in the world today, there is very little intellectual clash among the vipras. However, whenever fanatical religious communities made systems of social rules and regulations &ndash; in other words, whenever they made some effort to build a social structure &ndash; their social systems would be stronger than those of societies which followed a subtle philosophical theory or those of ks&#x301;atriya societies. Where there were intellectual clashes among the vipras, each vipra would have his own supporters, and their different supporters would never think of themselves as belonging to the same group. As a result those vipras were unable to build a strong social structure. Though their philosophies may or may not have had some good in them, the Buddhists and Hindus were unable to build strong societies because of their subtle mentality.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="187"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=187 type=paragraph -->Groups of vipras may fight against each other, but they will quickly unite against an ideology that opposes vipra exploitation.

Thus it is clear that even when vipras belong to different groups, they readily unite to protect their mutual interests.

<a name="195"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=195 type=paragraph -->The ks&#x301;atriyas worshipped nature and regarded it as the collective form of different belligerent forces, and this concept of a collectivity came to be called Brahma.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn16"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn16">16</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  In their minds there was no difference between the collective form of nature and Brahma. They therefore came to regard all the phenomena of nature as expressions of Brahma. The vipras had a vague understanding of another type of expression which was beyond the realm of nature, which they called A&#x301;tma&#x301;, Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, or Nirupa&#x301;dhika Iishvara [the Non-Attributional Controller]. According to the depth of their intellects, vipras had different ideas regarding the extent to which such expressions were beyond the realm of nature. Philosophically this is the reason why theoretical differences exist among Iishvara, Allah, God and Jehovah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="196"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=196 type=paragraph -->Ruh, spirit, soul and a&#x301;tma&#x301; are not exactly the same thing. A ruh can rise up from the grave; a spirit can move around and frighten people; a soul can cone close to God and sit beside Him; while a non-attributional a&#x301;tma&#x301; is not bound by the bondages of time, space or person. This entity beyond the realm of nature was the contribution of the vipras. Their intellectual struggle against the hostile aspects of nature, assisted by the ks&#x301;atriyas, gave them the opportunity to imagine this kind of purus&#x301;a [consciousness] entity beyond the realm of nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="197"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=197 type=paragraph -->The religiosity of the ks&#x301;atriyas developed out of their infatuation with conquest and with acquisition. They thought that if they had faith in God they would be able to acquire a great deal of worldly wealth. They would acquire it through military force and enjoy it through military force. That is why ks&#x301;atriyas worshipped their imaginary gods and goddesses before going into battle or plundering wealth from others &ndash; in many cases sacrificing animals and even human beings to propitiate them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="198"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=198 type=paragraph -->As the vipras lacked courage and valour of that kind, their spirituality was basically a fascination with acquiring occult powers. They thought that spirituality would bring them such power that their blessings would benefit people, who would then out of gratitude give the vipras a fat dividend out of whatever they had gained. They thought that spirituality could also give them the power to curse or do harm to people, who would then out of fear or devotion heap commodities at their feet. The pervasive efforts to create vipra dominance that can be observed in the stories of the Puranas are also born out of this mentality. According to some Puranas, not only human beings but Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a [God] Himself bore the footprints of the vipras on His chest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="199"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=199 type=paragraph -->In the course of time the deceitful mentality of the vipras contributed greatly to the emergence of the vaeshyas as social exploiters.

The most important thing for the vipras was to "Live by making others small" &ndash; to make slaves of others by infusing inferiority complexes into their minds in order to suck dry their vital force and to terrorize them into submission &ndash; in order to establish their power. It is as if through the framework of society the vipras are saying: use deception, force, cunning or any other means at one&#146;s disposal in order to perpetuate one&#146;s exploitation, even if it results in temporary dishonour.<!-- /block --></p>

However, the importance the vipras give to individuality is detrimental to discipline. Although the idea of discipline is inherent in the fundamental principles or ideals of the vipras, their discipline is weakened by the emphasis they place on individual views. So although from a sociological perspective vipra society is superior to ks&#x301;atriya society (vipra society is, however, still not a "society" in the true sense of the term), its structure is looser because it gives greater importance to personal freedom.<!-- /block --></p>

The vipras who formulate social codes contend that even if society takes no action against sinners, they will still suffer the consequences of their sins in hell. Although in vipra society there is no system for eliminating the hunger of the oppressed, vipras say that it is virtuous to feed the hungry. And although in practice they support a system which discriminates against people on the basis of high and low, on paper they accept the idea that human beings are essentially brothers and sisters. So although the vipra social system is not as strong as that of the ks&#x301;atriyas, and although in practice it is generally lacking in magnanimity, on paper it is more magnanimous than that of ks&#x301;atriya society. Ks&#x301;atriyas cannot be said to be social parasites, but it is not incorrect to say that vipras are. Although the vipras understand the defects in their social system, they nevertheless use their grandiloquence to try to maintain it; such is the nature of vipras.<!-- /block --></p>

Of course vipras will not harm themselves for the sake of supporting others, no matter how great the logic in those people&#146;s favour or how great the religious obligation of the vipras to do so. Needless to say, vipras will never support anybody if, in the event of that person being made great or being fully accepted by society, their own chariot of exploitation would be brought to a halt; rather they will ignore all humanitarian considerations and harm such people much more than would the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="214"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=214 type=paragraph -->To ks&#x301;atriyas life is like a game of chess, because they do what they have to do, even if it costs them their lives. The insatiable longing for victory compels them to behave in such a manner. A great, imperialistic leader and a most ordinary labourer equally welcome the call to a life of heroism and personal forcefulness. Ks&#x301;atriyas try to wash away their defeats and their sense of despair in the blood of the battlefield. But vipras behave differently. Vipras regard the winning of intellectual battles and invention of new types of intellectual expression as the highest values in life, and when their minds are completely engrossed in those highest values, they do not even think of exploiting others. At such times they are even prepared to undergo great pain and suffering for the sake of their ideology or beliefs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="215"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=215 type=paragraph -->Other vipras cash in on the names of those magnanimous and ideological vipras, finding in them an opportunity to exploit others. Whatever respect people today may have for vipras is due to those ideological vipras. This is because more than ninety per cent of the intellectual and spiritual progress which humanity has so far achieved has been the legacy of those magnanimous and selfless vipras. Their contributions can never be forgotten in any age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="216"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=216 type=paragraph -->Although the vipras&#146; collective life is not as happy as that of the ks&#x301;atriyas, they enjoy more peace. This is because they do not spend wakeful nights worrying about the possibility of mutual bloodshed. There is greater security in the society of the Vipra Age than in that of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, because despite the extensive factional strife caused by ideological differences, the social structure is comparatively strong.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="217"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=217 type=paragraph -->Vipras are always awake and alert to what is going on around them, but their ability to respond appropriately to a situation is limited, as there is a lack of coordination between their intellects and their actions. When they have someone to work for them they are able to put their feelings and ideas into action, but if they do not have workers or obedient servants or someone to provide funds, most of their ideas come to nothing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="218"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=218 type=paragraph -->People with intellect should not need more intellect, but the vipras do need more. This is because the vipras&#146; intellect is in most cases unproductive intellect. Something needs to be done to create a balance between their brains and their hands and feet; yet giving them advice serves no purpose, [because] they refuse to listen. They sell their intellects for money, but they are unable to find a balance between their intellect and their actions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="219"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=219 type=paragraph -->The vipras ascertain the strength of an enemy and then incite the obedient ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras under their control to do battle, but they themselves stay at a safe distance. During the battle the heads of the brave ks&#x301;atriyas and the cowardly shu&#x301;dras roll in the dust and a river of blood flows on the earth, but the bodies of the vipras do not get even scratched. At the slightest possibility of defeat, they treacherously betray the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas under them and enter into a secret pact with the enemy. Then they pose as peace-lovers and put the stigma of having fomented the war on the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="220"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=220 type=paragraph -->Thus vipra history is a history of adroit traitors. Within that history a high degree of intelligence is to be found, but no greatness. In it there are weakness, cowardice and ingratitude; and although there is cleverness, that cleverness is tarnished by selfishness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="221"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=221 type=paragraph -->The Rise of the Vaeshyas<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="222"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=222 type=paragraph -->Because the vipras have so much confidence in their presence of mind they fail to think about the future; consequently they rarely bother to accumulate wealth. They think that they will always be able to make some arrangement in any situation. But this overconfidence leads to their downfall. When real danger arrives and their presence of mind fails them, they have to sell themselves to anyone with any kind of wealth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="223"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=223 type=paragraph -->The vaeshyas, though endowed with less intelligence, begin to control the vipras with their capital. The subservient vipras then occupy themselves in increasing the wealth of the vaeshyas. Although they lack the capacity to accumulate wealth themselves, the vipras explain to the vaeshyas how to increase their wealth. The vipras show the vaeshyas all the straightforward and dirty ways of killing and cheating others that had escaped the vaeshyas&#146; attention. The vaeshyas evade taxes and indulge in black marketeering, smuggling and adulterating food and medicine, and increase their profits by paying bribes, but it is the vipras, grovelling at the feet of the vaeshyas, who supply the brains and the techniques behind these activities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="224"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=224 type=paragraph -->But in the course of time the vipras lose even their intellectual originality. They become servants of the vaeshyas, agents of capitalism. In the vaeshya-dominated society the vipras become like the shu&#x301;dras and ks&#x301;atriyas: mere beasts of burden who carry bags of sugar without ever tasting its sweetness. The capitalist vaeshyas gradually wrest the right to lead society out of the hands of the vipras, and establish their dominance using the vipras&#146; intellectual force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="225"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=225 type=paragraph -->Almost everywhere in the world the vaeshyas support democracy rather than monarchy, because in a monarchy the administration cannot be as easily influenced. People regard the bravery, tradition, noble birth and ks&#x301;atriya nature of a monarch with respect, or with a mixture of devotion and fear. For this reason they do not like to oppose a monarch unless he or she does something which severely undermines the interests of the people. If the monarch demonstrates even a little concern for the public interest, the lives and properties of the vaeshyas in that kingdom may at any time be endangered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="226"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=226 type=paragraph -->In a party dictatorship or any other type of dictatorship, the dictator has to take into account the interests of the people. Even oppressive dictators cannot afford to ignore the welfare of the state, otherwise they will lose power. But in a democracy there is no danger of this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="227"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=227 type=paragraph -->The unintelligent ks&#x301;atriyas and ignorant shu&#x301;dras are easily duped by the mind-stupefying, life-enchaining propaganda of the vaeshyas, assisted by their vipra servants. Even the vipras, despite their intelligence and despite whatever they may say or think, support the vaeshyas out of fear or due to lack of a proper alternative. Thus in a democratic structure, particularly in a structure where downfallen vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn18"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn18">18</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> are few in number and ignorant shu&#x301;dras form the majority, the vaeshyas can easily win votes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="228"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=228 type=paragraph -->During vaeshya rule the vipras&#146; intellect remains intact; it neither sleeps nor becomes rusty. However, though the vipras have intellect, they do not have the courage to apply it, because crude worldly bondages hold them tightly, like the grip of an octopus. It can therefore be said that the day that the vipras submit to the vaeshyas, the Vipra Age dies, even if the vipras themselves do not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="229"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=229 type=paragraph -->The blood-sucking vaeshyas order the vipras whom they hire to write voluminous books which artfully distort the truth. They try to portray as mean and sub-human those who oppose the vaeshyas and demand the right to live. In order to keep their machinery of exploitation running, the vaeshyas produce deadly weapons with the help of mercenary vipras. On the orders of their vaeshya overlords, vipra scientists willingly or unwillingly take up the task of making weapons in their laboratories that have the potential to destroy human civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="230"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=230 type=paragraph -->Although the vipras understand what is going on, they cannot do anything about it. They look up towards heaven, hoping to see the arrival of better days. They think, "When will the downfallen vipras, ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras unitedly save human civilization from the all-devouring greed of the vaeshyas. When will people realize that it is not the desire of providence for some to exploit others." Due to the utter despair they feel, the subservient vipras gradually become consumed with remorse recalling how they themselves once exploited others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="231"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=231 type=paragraph -->The economic exploitation of the vaeshyas relegates the vipras to the level of intellectual satans, and the money of the vaeshyas controls the brains of those satans. In the Vaeshya Age intellectual progress occurs on many levels: new inventions are brought forth, new types of deadly weapon are invented, and people learn how to produce many types of commodity to increase comfort. Many people believe that these things are creations of the Vipra Age, but actually they are expressions of the Vaeshya Age. The vipras who sell themselves to the vaeshyas for money produce such items at their behest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="232"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=232 type=paragraph -->A deep analysis reveals that many of those whose creative and inventive ability once commanded the respect of innumerable people, become dependent upon the mercy of the vaeshyas for their food and clothing. Poets and [[authors]] write according to the dictates of their vaeshya publishers or in the hope of winning prizes from the vaeshya-controlled governments. Artists wield their brushes according to the demands of the market, or are compelled to produce commercial art, neglecting more subtle art forms in the process. Instead of writing the truth, journalists turn day into night and night into day according to the wishes of profiteering newspaper publishers because they are afraid of losing their jobs. They go against their own consciences and pervert the truth in order to help unworthy people become leaders. They create spectacular lies with their pens.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="233"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=233 type=paragraph -->Of course there is another side to all this. If vipras engage themselves in intellectual development and research, it is difficult for them to meet their material needs. Because the vaeshyas finance them, this problem is solved, and they are able to work free of worry. But naturally the vaeshyas do not  extend their economic support in a disinterested way. Their ulterior motive is to establish themselves in society, and because of this the Vipra Age comes to an end.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="234"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=234 type=paragraph -->Economic Liberation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="235"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=235 type=paragraph -->The subservient vipras employ all their intellectual power to increase the wealth of the vaeshyas in exchange for the basic necessities they need to fill their bellies. Millionaire vaeshyas employ vipras at low wages in order to increase their wealth; with the help of these vipras they build up networks of adulteration, black marketeering and smuggling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="236"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=236 type=paragraph -->After the vaeshyas secure the allegiance of the vipras, they enlist them to help them consolidate the capitalistic social structure and philosophy. The contemporary Bhu&#x301;da&#x301;n movement<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn19"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn19">19</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is an example of this type of philosophy; it is supported by the vaeshyas and propagated by the vipras under their control. As a result of this kind of movement, efforts to fight the exploitation of the vaeshyas decline because people think, "Why fight against rich people when they voluntarily distribute their land and wealth to the poor?" This aversion to fighting will somewhat lengthen the Vaeshya Age; because as the vaeshyas know full well, most of their donations are not genuine, but exist on paper only &ndash; and whenever they make genuine donations, they realize double the amount as profits in some other way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="237"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=237 type=paragraph -->In the Vaeshya Age this type of rotten philosophy gets widely trumpeted in the newspapers. Attempts are also made to mislead students by including such harmful philosophies in textbooks. The agents of the vaeshyas attempt to awaken respect and devotion for vaeshyas in children&#146;s minds by depicting them in textbooks as symbols of peace, love and humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="238"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=238 type=paragraph -->To accomplish this objective a new type of nationalism based on economics is created which is totally different from both the nationalism of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, based on personal force and family glory, and that of the Vipra Age, based on learning. The nationalism of the Vaeshya Age leads to a form of imperialism which is extremely dangerous for the unity of the human race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="239"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=239 type=paragraph -->Although the vipras grovelling at the feet of the vaeshyas wield great authority at various levels of society as the servants of capitalistic imperialism, the vaeshyas never entrust them with the responsibility of leading society or structuring the economy. Only in this way can one easily understand whether a country or state is in the Vaeshya Age. It is not always the case that a state controlled by the vaeshyas is democratic. One indication that is clear is that the vaeshyas always keep the collection and distribution of finance and the corresponding ministerial posts in the hands of orthodox vaeshyas. They never delegate these responsibilities to a learned and experienced vipra economist, because it is their own systems of collection and distribution of finance that provide them the opportunity to establish themselves. Thus in the vaeshya social system, vipra scholars are nothing but paid planners and intellectual servants appointed to materialize those plans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="240"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=240 type=paragraph -->Whenever, after popular acceptance of the vaeshya-created social system, it became apparent that vipras were trying to free themselves from the rule and exploitation of the vaeshyas, the vaeshyas would buy the support of the masses, rub the noses of the rebellious vipras in the dirt, and then replace them with a group of sycophantic vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="241"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=241 type=paragraph -->The vaeshyas have repressed unrest and discontent among agricultural and industrial labourers, as well as political revolution, with the help not only of their vipra hirelings, but of ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras as well. In fact, of all the classes, the vaeshyas have made the most extensive use of the policy of divide and rule. For example, when a group of vipras vociferously demanded an investigation into the mysterious death of Shyamaprasad Mukherjee, another group of vipras immediately diverted their steam by increasing the tram fares in Calcutta and at the same time starting a movement to oppose the increase. Because of this, those typical vaeshyas who were directly or indirectly responsible for Shyamaprasad&#146;s death escaped punishment.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn20"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn20">20</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="242"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=242 type=paragraph -->The discriminatory measures adopted by employers or states ruled by vaeshyas to suppress labour agitations are generally known to every educated person. To disrupt the plans and intellectual movements of one group of vipras, a second group of vipras are appointed as spies or informers. Such spies or informers do not work out of ideological inspiration but in order to fill their stomachs. They are merely  paid servants of the vaeshyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="243"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=243 type=paragraph -->The efforts of intelligent vipras or brave ks&#x301;atriyas to escape from the influence of the vaeshyas can be called the vikra&#x301;nti [counter-evolution] or the prativiplava [counter-revolution] of the vipras or ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="244"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=244 type=paragraph -->Some people consider what happened recently in Hungary as counter-revolution, but actually it was not.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn21"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn21">21</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  It was a vipra revolution against ks&#x301;atriya rule.

<a name="245"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=245 type=paragraph -->In India at present the Vaeshya Age is in full swing. But because there is not sufficient consciousness among the exploited vipras, ks&#x301;atriyas and shu&#x301;dras &ndash; and because the clever vaeshyas of India, having learned from the experiences of other countries and having become cautious, often employ some psychology and exploit people indirectly rather than directly &ndash; the revolution to end the Vaeshya Age has not yet taken place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="246"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=246 type=paragraph -->What to speak of revolution, even the need for revolution has not yet been felt properly among intellectuals. At present they are in a hesitant frame of mind. They are waiting for the auspicious day when the Vaeshya Age will end naturally through kra&#x301;nti [evolution], without any struggle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="247"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=247 type=paragraph -->This mentality is reflected in the support which a group of intellectuals extend to the Sarvodaya movement<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn22"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn22">22</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and Gandhism. They deliberately ignore the fact that the Sarvodaya movement and Gandhism will only increase the period of their suffering.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="248"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=248 type=paragraph -->There is also a group of leaders who have genuine sympathy for the masses and who do not in their hearts support the Sarvodaya movement or Gandhism; they nevertheless believe that the vaeshyas will be removed from power without a struggle through their plans for a welfare state. I am not suggesting that their ideas are totally irrational, because they do have an example before them. Great Britain is moving towards socialism by accepting the ideals of a welfare state. If it is possible there, why shouldn&#146;t it be possible here? It is natural to ask this question, because in the rotation of the social cycle it is not imperative for revolution to occur. A change from one age to another can also occur through evolution. However, although it is theoretically possible to establish a welfare state or genuine economic freedom through evolution, in practice it will not work. It is true that in Great Britain some of the minimum requirements of life are being provided to the people, but how great the difference is between rich and poor! Clearly their social system is capitalistic. The exploited and disgruntled people are given a small amount of sympathy to appease them. They are given a small taste of the dainties and delicacies, but their stomachs are never full.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="249"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=249 type=paragraph -->The masses in India face greater privations than the masses in Britain. Due to a lack of political and economic consciousness and the confusion created by the misleading propaganda of the Sarvodaya movement and Gandhism, the people of India may continue to be complacent for some time more, misguided by the false promises of the agents of capitalism. However, this situation will not continue for long.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="250"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=250 type=paragraph -->Because rich people have the opportunity to purchase votes, it is not easy for leaders who are genuinely concerned about the people to become members of parliament. It is therefore not possible to eradicate the sufferings of the people of India by enacting laws befitting a genuine welfare state.

<a name="252"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=252 type=paragraph -->The predominance of dishonest people over honest is far greater in the Vaeshya Age even than it was in the Vipra Age. The vaeshyas use most of their capital and privileged status to deprive others of the wealth they earn through their hard labour. (Here "labour" certainly includes intellectual labour.) Just as the vipras use their intellects to stupefy and manipulate the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; vitality, the vaeshyas still more ruthlessly turn the vipras, as well as everybody else, into beasts of burden. When the Vaeshya Age begins after the Vipra Age, and the vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas helplessly sell themselves to the vaeshyas, the vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas clearly understand that they are sold. They are like chickens that have just been sold to the hungry chicken-fancier.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="253"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=253 type=paragraph -->Only the shu&#x301;dras fail to realize that they are sold. Although the vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas know what is happening, they nevertheless accept the dominance of the vaeshyas due to selfishness, infighting and a lack of economic knowledge. The vaeshyas are fully aware of the disunity and other weaknesses of the vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas, and they use this knowledge to perpetuate their hold on power; they use their financial power to incite one group against another. The ks&#x301;atriyas, out of obligation to the vaeshyas, lose their lives in needless battles and fracases of different kinds; while the vipras, similarly fed and sheltered by the vaeshyas, keep such factional conflicts permanently alive by creating various types of sentiment such as casteism, communalism, provincialism and nationalism, and by composing the necessary scriptures to accomplish this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="254"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=254 type=paragraph -->It should be clearly understood that the vaeshyas encourage all isms that divide people. Casteism, communalism, provincialism and nationalism are supported mainly by the money of the vaeshyas. They finance such isms to keep people divided so that they cannot unite and protest against their exploitation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="255"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=255 type=paragraph -->The funny thing is that the vaeshyas purchase the vital energy of the ks&#x301;atriyas and the intellectual skills of the vipras with money and use that energy and those skills to perpetuate their hold on power and turn the ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras into long-term slaves. The vaeshyas&#146; financial power carries more weight than the power of speech and intellectual power of the vipras, not to mention the physical power of the ks&#x301;atriyas; therefore the vaeshyas have no trouble buying the vipras&#146; brains and the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; brawn with their money.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="256"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=256 type=paragraph -->Among those who possess knowledge, intellect, great courage or physical strength, there is hardly anyone who has the courage, or sometimes even the intelligence, needed to take the financial risks necessary to earn money. The vaeshyas understand this weakness of the vipras and the ks&#x301;atriyas. They lull their discrimination to sleep by praising the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; valour and the vipras&#146; intellect. Then afterwards they can easily buy them off. In a vaeshya state, poets, scientists, [[authors]] and great heroes are awarded prizes, medals and titles for this very reason. By participating in all this, the vipras and the ks&#x301;atriyas surrender all their endowments at the feet of the vaeshyas for a little money or some name and fame; and at the same time feel they are fortunate. They fail to realize that they are digging their own graves.<!-- /block --></p>
