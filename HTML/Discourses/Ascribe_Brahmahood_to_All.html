<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The life of all other [beings] is for material enjoyment, but human life is for higher pursuits, for something subtle, something higher, something more elevated. There are certain propensities which are common both for human beings and animals, but the old idea of logicians that the human is a rational [animal] is not supported by us. We say the human is not a rational animal. If we say the human is a rational animal, then the human comes within the animal category. Yes, the human is a living being, but the human is not an animal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->We say human life is an ideological flow. The ideological flow is human, it is human life; and where there is no ideological flow it is an animal. But whatever a person is to do &ndash; What is a person to do? A person is to do only spiritual practice, only sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But to maintain the body that person requires food, requires dress, requires medical treatment, requires education, requires so many things; and these so many things are worldly duties. But when engaged in worldly duties naturally one gets detached from one&#146;s spiritual duty. And that&#146;s why madhuvidya&#x301; [the practice of remembering that everything is Brahma] says that whenever one is to do any worldly work, one is to &ndash; what? Ascribe Brahma-hood, ascribe Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a-hood, to that worldly duty. So while doing worldly duties, attending to worldly duties, one is not wasting one&#146;s time, one is doing spiritual practice. Because spirituality has been imposed on, has been ascribed to, that worldly work. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now you know there is a popular mantra &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You should know its meaning. It has closest proximity to this madhuvidya&#x301;, that is, this ascription of Brahma-hood to worldly work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->First thing is, what? Pitrpurus&#x301;ebhyo namah. Pitrpurus&#x301;ebhyo namah. You are in this world, but before you so many human beings came. The Australopithecus was an old animal which was the forefather of modern humans, and was in this world about ten lakhs of years ago. [One million years ago.] Some time in the Pliocene Age. ([Before that were] the Miocene, the Oligocene, the Mesozoic&#8230; This is the Cenozoic Age going on now on this earth, as per archaeology.) Now you know, so many human beings came, and you are descendants of those old human beings who came here and who left this world long ago. You are their descendants. So, Pitrpurus&#x301;ebhyo namah. Pitrpurus&#x301;ebhyo namah. To all our forefathers who came into this world and left this world. So many people, so many millions of people, came during the last ten lakh years. So, Pitrpurus&#x301;ebhyo namah. &ldquo;I do namah to those people,&rdquo; because I am a continuity of those people in the flow of the human race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And rs&#x301;idevebhyonamah. During this long period so many things were invented by so many great people. Great people are known as rs&#x301;is. The person who invented penicillin is a rs&#x301;i; the one who invented the aeroplane is a rs&#x301;i; the motorcar, a rs&#x301;i; television, a rs&#x301;i. So many rs&#x301;is came, and those who invented bullock carts, they were also rs&#x301;is. In that dark age the person who invented the bullock cart was also a rs&#x301;i. So many rs&#x301;is came, and in their age they were glittering personalities. We may or may not recognize them in this second half of the twentieth century, but in their ages they were glittering personalities. So, rs&#x301;idevebhyo namah &ndash; &ldquo;I also do namah to those rs&#x301;is who invented so many things.&rdquo; And the collection of their inventions is modern human civilization.<!-- /block --></p>

Now this process of offering, this action, is what? It is Brahma. That is, I have ascribed Brahma-hood to this action of offering even. Do you follow? Brahma-hood has been ascribed to this verb also. What verb? &ndash; the offering. I am offering something. So, Brahma&#x301;rpan&#x301;am&#x301;. &ldquo;The offering is Brahma,&rdquo; because Brahma-hood has been ascribed to it.
