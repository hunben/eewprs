Notes: <p class="Para_Notes">official source: A Few Problems Solved Part 5</p>
<p class="Para_Notes">this version: is the printed A Few Problems Solved Part 5, 1st edition, version (obvious spelling, punctuation and typographical mistakes only may have been corrected). I.e., this is the most up-to-date version as of the present Electronic Edition.</p>
<p class="Para_Notes">This discourse was probably included in the A Few Problems Solved series, the official source book for RU addresses, because it was dated 31 December 1981. 31 December evening was the usual occasion for RU speeches, and the existence of a known discourse (not yet published in English, but in Bengali) for that morning could well have caused this discourse to be assumed to be the evening discourse. However, as is now known, the RU discourse that evening was &ldquo;Sama-Sama&#x301;ja Tattva&rdquo;, published in The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism. Moreover, the topic of this present discourse is a spiritual topic, which would not be normal for an RU address. Therefore the date for this discourse is presumably wrong, but the editors have no information as to the correct date.</p>

<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati &ndash; &ldquo;One who realizes Brahma becomes Brahma.&rdquo; I said yesterday that in the path of progress, there are three types of bondages: (1) a&#x301;dhibhaotika (2) a&#x301;dhidaevika, and a&#x301;dhya&#x301;tmika. The word adhi means &ldquo;pervasively&rdquo;; that is, any limited material object is called either quinquelemental or physical; but when something is pervasively related to all the quinquelemental factors, there the mere word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; or &ldquo;material&rdquo; will not suffice. We will have to use the term a&#x301;dhibhaotika (&ldquo;all-pervasive physicality&rdquo;). Similarly, when some action or reaction is taking place in the psychic sphere as the requital of some previous action, it is not sufficient to call it daevika (psychic phenomenon): we will have to use the word a&#x301;dhidaevika. Likewise, in the spiritual sphere, when there are some minor obstacles in individual life, we generally call them &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; obstacles; but in a broader, more pervasive sense, they should be called a&#x301;dhya&#x301;tmika. As there are no proper synonyms for a&#x301;dhibhaotika, a&#x301;dhidaevika&#x301; and a&#x301;dhya&#x301;tmika, I am in favour of using the terms &ldquo;metaphysical&rdquo;, &ldquo;metapsychic,&rdquo; and &ldquo;metaspiritual,&rdquo; respectively. I have said that the spatial, temporal and personal obstacles come within the scope of the metaphysical sphere. So when we use the terms metaphysical, metapsychic and metaspiritual, it will not be necessary to additionally use the terms temporal, spatial and personal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now, human beings will have to persist in their untiring efforts to liberate themselves from these triple bondages; this is only natural. Animals also endeavour to do this, but due to their incapacity they cannot succeed. Yet as the result of their efforts, after lives together when these very same animals attain the human frame, they gradually overcome these obstacles due to their acquired momentum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->These three kinds of obstacles can also be described as triple afflictions or trividha klesha. We will have to analyse how much relief human beings can actually attain from these afflictions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now the question is, why is it not possible to conquer this metaphysical universe with the help of a physical body? Why can human beings not establish their supremacy over time, space and person? Humans may be able to expand their physical bodies by means of their efforts. You may have noticed that some animals, under some special circumstances, enlarge their bodies in anger or fear, just as a cat does when it is enraged or frightened. This is possible with the help of vital energy. And when human beings want to establish their supremacy over the metaphysical world with their physical bodies, then the interatomic and inter-molecular spaces of their bodies will increase, and ultimately due to internal clash the physical will no longer remain physical, it will be transformed into psychic: that is, by virtue of their psychic power, they will gain control over the quinquelemental world. And when human beings by means of their unit consciousness (jiiva&#x301;tma) seek to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a, then their unit consciousness will have to expand itself. In that stage the unit consciousness will no longer remain confined to the unit; it will be transformed into Parama&#x301;tma, the Supreme Consciousness. That is why it is said, Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati, &ldquo;One who realizes Brahma becomes Brahma&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->While performing meditation, when spiritual aspirants develop their intrinsic love for Parama Purus&#x301;a, there no longer remains any separate identity in them; they become completely identified with Parama Purus&#x301;a. In an old poem it is said, Ye ye ujuva&#x301;t&#x301;e gela&#x301; ana&#x301;vat&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; bhaila&#x301; sai &ndash; &ldquo;Those who have moved upwards towards Parama Shiva in the multipropensive plexus along the passage of shus&#x301;umna&#x301; have not returned;&rdquo; and they are not expected to return again. That is why I tell you to continue your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; sincerely, and in the process you will one day become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a, you will finally attain eternal bliss. This is the absolute and supreme goal of human life.<!-- /block --></p>
