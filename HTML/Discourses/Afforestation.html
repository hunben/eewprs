<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I hope you all know what soil erosion is. In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, Bengal, soil erosion is called khoya&#x301;i. Due to incessant rainfall water washes soil away from the parent body. Sometimes even one downpour is enough for a thick layer of soil to separate from the parent body. Through this process the fertility of the soil gradually diminishes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In ancient times there was an abundance of woods and dense forests. On the one hand forests would attract clouds and cause heavy rainfall, and on the other hand they would prevent soil erosion by binding the soil to the outstretched roots of the plants. Most trees preserved water near their roots by binding the soil to their various root systems. Trees which have closely bunched root systems have the greatest capacity to preserve water. In winter or summer or in dry seasons when the level of water declines, trees slowly release the water they have accumulated, thereby keeping water flowing in the soil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->These days, due to reckless deforestation in many parts of the world, forest trees are deprived of that source of water. If this wanton destruction of plants and trees is not stopped, then in the near future the rainfall will drastically decrease and the frequency and intensity of floods will increase. Consequently lush, green vegetation will be transformed into arid deserts. This has already happened in the south-eastern portion of Rajasthan.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Today human beings have to be very cautious and restrained in this regard. Under no circumstances can reckless deforestation be permitted to continue. We must not forget even for a moment that the seed of destruction of the human race lies in the wanton destruction of forests. No more deforestation should be allowed. Our aim should be large scale afforestation.<!-- /block --></p>
