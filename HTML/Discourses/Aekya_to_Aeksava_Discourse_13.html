<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Eka + s&#x301;n&#x301;a = aekya. Its etymological meaning is &ldquo;the state of one&rdquo; (ekasya bha&#x301;vah). If five or ten people get together and say: &ldquo;We are one; no external force can destroy our sense of oneness,&rdquo; then one can understand that among them there is aekya. Eka means &ldquo;unit&rdquo; and its abstract noun is &ldquo;unity&rdquo;, in ordinary English &ldquo;oneness&rdquo;. The words ekatva and ekata&#x301; have this etymological meaning of aekya; the first is neuter in gender and the second feminine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If many entities think &ldquo;we are one&rdquo;, then we say aekya. Similarly, if we see that many people are of one opinion [mata] or of equal opinion then we say aekamatya, and for those individuals among whom there is aekamatya we use the adjective aekamata.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The verbal root is&#x301; + sha (sa) + t&#x301;a&#x301; gives us the word iccha&#x301;. By adding the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;ik we get the word aecchika. Where one or more is chosen from among many objects according to one&#146;s will then this is called aecchika (optional). Doing something according to one&#146;s will or one&#146;s fancy is also called aecchika.  The root verb &ldquo;opt&rdquo; means &ldquo;to select something according to one&#146;s liking&rdquo;. According to the rules of linguistic science, if &ldquo;t&rdquo; is pronounced at the end of a root verb and &ldquo;ion&rdquo; is added to it then the proper pronunciation becomes &ldquo;tee-un&rdquo;. For example, since &ldquo;t&rdquo; is at the end of the root verb &ldquo;quest&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;to search&rdquo;, then when &ldquo;ion&rdquo; is added to it the proper pronunciation becomes &ldquo;ques-tee-un&rdquo;. &ldquo;Option&rdquo; is an exception to this. The pronunciation of &ldquo;option&rdquo; will not be &ldquo;op-tee-un&rdquo; but &ldquo;op-shun&rdquo;. Where the freedom is not there to choose between one or more among many, that is, where there is compulsion, aecchika is not used but rather ba&#x301;dhyata&#x301;mu&#x301;lak (compulsory).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Itiha means &ldquo;coming along in a particular way&rdquo;. From itiha comes the noun aetihya [tradition]. In Sanskrit it is pronounced aetiha-i-ya (aetihya). In Bengali the pronunciation of hya becomes like that of jhya. This does not present any practical difficulties because there are virtually no words where ya is joined to jha. If there had been cases of ya being joined to jha then the pronunciation of hya as jhya could have led to spelling problems. Although spelled sahya, lehya, da&#x301;hya and so forth in Bengali, they are pronounced sajhya, lejhya, da&#x301;jhya and so forth.<!-- /block --></p>

The meaning of the root verb has is &ldquo;to laugh&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be expressed in a particular way&rdquo;. In Sanskrit hasati means &ldquo;laughing&rdquo;. It is both spelled and pronounced without a candrabindu.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In Hindi ha&#x301;nsta&#x301; hai means &ldquo;laughing&rdquo;. It is spelled with a candrabindu, or half-na, and pronounced the same way. In Bengali it is spelled ha&#x301;sche but pronounced ha&#x301;nsche, that is, it is spelled without the candrabindu, or half-na, but pronounced with it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The etymological meaning of itiha&#x301;sa is &ldquo;that which has been particularly expressed in this way&rdquo;. I have said before and I will say again that the English synonym for itiha&#x301;sa is not &ldquo;history&rdquo;, nor is the French synonym histoire. The proper Bengali synonyms for the English word &ldquo;history&rdquo; and the French word histoire are itikatha&#x301;, itivrtta, pura&#x301;katha&#x301;, and pura&#x301;vrtta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->All those educative subjects that we find in the succession of past events we call aetiha&#x301;sika. It should be borne in mind that something is aetiha&#x301;sika, or about itiha&#x301;sa, to the extent that it is educative. That which has less educative value will have to be called itikatha&#x301;, not itiha&#x301;sa, that is, a factual chronicle of events we call itikatha&#x301;, whether or not it contains something of instructional value. But when we look towards the past and we are unable to discover a continuity of facts, or to put together a respectable portrait of reality, then we call it pra&#x301;gaetiha&#x301;sik (pra&#x301;k + aetiha&#x301;sik), or prehistorical or prehistoric. It is also worth remembering here that while it is true that we call prehistoric those temporal events for which we are unable, at present, to discover a historical continuity or common thread due to a lack of adequate research, if in the future, as a result of adequate efforts, we discover that continuity or get hold of the missing link, then we will no longer be able to call them &ldquo;prehistoric&rdquo;. They will then pass from prehistory to history.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the word pra&#x301;k is used to mean &ldquo;pre&rdquo; in regard to time, and the word uttara is used to mean &ldquo;post&rdquo;. For example, that which precedes itiha&#x301;sa is pra&#x301;gaetiha&#x301;sika and that which comes after it is itiha&#x301;sottara. In the same way we get pra&#x301;k-baoddha [pre-Buddhist] and Baoddhottara [post-Buddhist].<!-- /block --></p>

It is also worth remembering in this case that words formed with the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;ik have short i such as aetiha&#x301;sik, ka&#x301;lik [pertaining to time], ya&#x301;ntrik [mechanical], and daeshik [pertaining to space]. And in the case of nominally inflected words ending in the suffix iin there will be a long ii, for example, ka&#x301;liin&#x301;a [of a particular time].

<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Itara + s&#x301;n&#x301;eya = aetareya. In Bengali the word aetareya has lost its honourable lineage. Many people think that itara means &ldquo;low; of a inferior level&rdquo;. For this reason the word itara&#x301;mi is used widely as an insulting expression. Actually the word itara is not at all bad. Itara means &ldquo;common people&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->When we say itara we mean &ldquo;masse&rdquo;. In spoken English, of course, we write &ldquo;mass&rdquo; but in literary English, and especially in French, it will not do to write &ldquo;mass&rdquo; because then its pronunciation becomes &ldquo;mah&rdquo;, For example, if we do not add the final &ldquo;e&rdquo; to &ldquo;en masse&rdquo; then its pronunciation becomes &ldquo;ahn-mah&rdquo;. Similarly if we write &ldquo;en clave&rdquo; then its pronunciation will be &ldquo;ahn-clahve&rdquo;, not &ldquo;en clave&rdquo;; if we write &ldquo;en route&rdquo; it will be &ldquo;ahn-route&rdquo;, not &ldquo;en route&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That which is created for the needs of the common people&rdquo;, or &ldquo;that which is told for the common people&rdquo; &ndash; we get the word aetareya from these meanings.

Thus ira&#x301; also means &ldquo;the goddess of knowledge&rdquo;, or Va&#x301;gdevii. Ira&#x301;vatii means &ldquo;river&rdquo;. Ira&#x301;vat means &ldquo;sea&rdquo;.

<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Seas located in torrid zones are more saline in accordance with nature&#146;s law. The very salty water that collects in the depths of the ocean sometimes reaches extreme levels of salinity. As result of plutonic earthquakes in prehistoric times, land rose out of the sea and as the extremely saline water on the surface of that land gradually became calcined, it became trapped between the sand or sandy soil or loamy soil at the surface and the rising hard land from below. With the passage of time that extremely saline water congealed and became transformed into subterranean salt-hills. Since these hills originated from the bottom of the ocean or the sea they used to be called saendhava pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;a [sea-hills] and the salt was called saendhava lavan&#x301;a [sea-salt]. This salt obtained from  deep seawater is thus naturally very rich in calcium and iodine and its colour becomes somewhat red. The salt which is artificially produced by evaporating or distilling sea water is generally called karkaca salt.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Since ancient times this karkaca salt has been produced in the coastal areas of the country. In Bengal it has been made since olden days in Khulna, 24 Parganas, Howrah District&#146;s Shyampur area and Midnapore District&#146;s Tamluk and Contai subdivisions. It has been produced extensively in India in those areas near the port of Tutikerin. At the beginning of the British period, those ships which would sail to Britain laden with raw materials from India used to return filled with salt from that country. Raw materials have less value and take up more space. Thus salt also has less value and takes up more space. For that reason the Indian government at that time was not eager to allow salt to be produced in this country, because if there was no demand for British salt in this country then what hopes would the ships have of returning laden with salt?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In my childhood days I have seen a certain type of mud-coloured salt produced from the local salt water and salty soil in South 24 Parganas. It was called ba&#x301;da&#x301;r salt. Its colour was somewhat muddy, that is, there was a little admixture of sodium chloride produced from earth. It was, however, not exactly the same as what we call karkaca salt. By comparison, this ba&#x301;da&#x301;r salt is much tastier than karkaca salt, even though it does not look as good. And the deep sea-salt [saendhava lavan&#x301;a] is nearly two or three times as tasty as this ba&#x301;da&#x301;r salt. On the western borders of India on both sides of the Aravalli mountain range, especially in the rain-shadow area on the other side, this salt used to be found in abundance. Parts of Rajasthan, Sindh and Gujarat used to remain at the bottom of the sea. Because a particular portion of this region was sargasso sea at that time, there is also a likelihood of finding mineral oil there. I would venture also that some saendhava salt-hills can still be found below ground in the northwest portion of Rajasthan. Saendhava salt makes the bones and bone-marrow strong; according to a&#x301;yurveda it also protects a person against attacks of goitre and throat ulcer. At any rate, the use of saendhava salt or aerin&#x301;a, where available, is preferred. In olden times physicians used to arrange for this. Keep in mind that aerin&#x301;a refers to saendhava salt, not any other kind of salt.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The word irin&#x301;a means &ldquo;wine&rdquo;, &ldquo;honey&rdquo; and &ldquo;salt water&rdquo;. Aereya refers to a specific kind of wine. In ancient times, when people first started to drink wine they drank fermented wine, not distilled wine. Thus, during the first part of the Vedic era the various words for wine, such as mada, a&#x301;sava, aris&#x301;t&#x301;a and so forth referred to fermented wine. In the second half of the Vedic era the Aryans learned how to distill wine. It appears that the inventor of the process of distillation was the guru of the Asuras, Shukracharya. Legend has it that distilled wine was first used during the war between the gods and the Asuras to keep the Asuras maddened with battle. Later the gods also learned the process of distillation from the Asuras and became addicted to drinking wine. Deva&#x301;suraeryuddhaka&#x301;le shukren&#x301;a parinirmitam. Shukracharya first made wine during a war between the gods and the demons. Understanding the evils of wine the wise forbade drinking it except for warriors at the time of battle &ndash; injunctions were set out. But wine is such a deadly thing that a person becomes addicted to drinking it within a few days, so in subsequent times the sages forbade drinking it in all circumstances. Human beings&#146; greatest wealth is their intelligence, their learning. Wine destroys the intellect. It is imperative that people stay away from objects which destroy their greatest wealth &ndash; their intellect and learning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->While it is true that people learned how to distill wine, they had not yet invented a machine (distilling retort) for doing so. Long after the process of distillation was devised, the Buddhist sannya&#x301;si Nagarjuna invented the first distillation flask.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Any starchy substance under certain conditions and in certain environments will ferment and turn into fermented wine. For example, fermented date or palm juice becomes ta&#x301;r&#x301;i. Ta&#x301;r&#x301;i is a fermented wine. Stale rice also ferments under certain conditions and becomes wine; if that is distilled it makes rice-wine [dheno mad] (in drinker&#146;s language dha&#x301;nyeshvarii). Our well-known a&#x301;ma&#x301;ni is also a kind of mildly alcoholic fermented rice-wine. There are various words in Vedic and Sanskrit which were used to refer to rice-wine. There are also many words in Vedic and Sanskrit for wine made from grapes &ndash; a&#x301;sava, aris&#x301;t&#x301;a, sudha&#x301;sa&#x301;ra, sura&#x301;sa&#x301;ra, madhusa&#x301;ra, madya, madira&#x301;, and so forth. Somarasa referred to a type of fermented wine which was mixed with extract of somalata&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->People during the Vedic era were not used to drinking wine during the time of sacrifices, but at the end of the sacrifice, when they used to make revelry and festivities, they would drink a special kind of wine prepared from barley and while making the wine they also used to add extract of somalata&#x301;. This barley-wine mixed with somalata&#x301; extract which was used at the end of sacrifices was called aereya. It is worth remembering here that the accepted Ayurvedic elixir or spirit for reviving the dead is a type of distilled wine. There is a difference of opinion among scholars whether this life-giving elixir or spirit was invented by Shukracharya or afterwards by the mendicant Nagarjuna, but it is clear that the scale tips in Nagarjuna&#146;s direction.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The etymological meaning of the word aeshvarya is &ldquo;concerning Iishvara [Supreme Consciousness]&rdquo;. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;worldly wealth&rdquo;, &ldquo;mundane wealth&rdquo;, &ldquo;super-mundane wealth&rdquo;, and &ldquo;occult power&rdquo;. By &ldquo;occult power&rdquo; we mean those powers which people obtain by dint of practice of a cult. According to most scholars these occult powers are eight in number and their combined name is aeshii siddhi [the eight occult powers]. They are an&#x301;ima&#x301;, laghima&#x301;, mahima&#x301; (garima&#x301;), iishitva, vashitva, pra&#x301;pti, praka&#x301;mya, and antarya&#x301;mitva. Some people do not accept occult powers such as ka&#x301;yavasa&#x301;yitva, moving from one body to another, entering another&#146;s body, telepathy, clairvoyance, hypnotism, mesmerism, etc., as as&#x301;t&#x301;asiddhi; they say that these are included within one or the other of the accepted eight occult powers.<!-- /block --></p>

Reducing one&#146;s sense of existence or mental arena to smallness with the help of the mental force born of spiritual practices, and thereby being able to enter within another entity and know everything about that entity, is called an&#x301;ima&#x301;-siddhi. It is considered the first of the eight occult powers because it is attainable in the first level of occult pursuit. One may attain it in both Vidya&#x301; Tantra and Avidya&#x301; Tantra but if an aspirant who resorts to Avidya&#x301; Tantra remains engaged in using this an&#x301;ima&#x301;-siddhi then his or her mental faculties gradually degenerate and he or she becomes crudified. Aspirants of Vidya&#x301; Tantra do not perform any special practice to attain this power, but if this power develops in a person as a result of natural elevation through spiritual practice, and if that individual possesses mental restraint, then he or she does not use it externally and continues to advance step by step in the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. If any aspirant of Vidya&#x301; Tantra uses this power externally then he or she will also become crudified. Lesser powers such as hypnotism, clairvoyance, mesmerism, telepathy, and so on, all fall within the category of an&#x301;ima&#x301;-siddhi.<!-- /block --></p>

It is possible to rise into the atmosphere and fly about by virtue of a state of lightness, thus this is called laghima&#x301;-siddhi. With this siddhi an individual can direct an entity according to his or her desire from any place at all. Generally this siddhi is not attainable in Avidya&#x301; Tantra. In Vidya&#x301; Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; this power arises spontaneously in some practitioners when they reach a certain stage. If an aspirant uses it in the external world he or she becomes maddened by it and as a result he or she degenerates. An aspirant of Vidya&#x301; Tantra must proceed with great caution at this stage and it is considered inopportune to give any indulgence at all to worries and anxieties.

When the sense of mahima&#x301; awakens in an entity or individual after having had this experience then it can be considered that one is completely established in mahima&#x301;-siddhi. This is also not attainable in Avidya&#x301; Tantra. In Vidya&#x301; Tantra this siddhi arises naturally in certain persons, or may arise. It is not proper for any spiritual aspirant to use this siddhi knowingly because while the world may gain something from its application, the world can also be harmed by its misapplication. If a person is influenced for even a short time by malice or jealousy then he or she can do great harm with this siddhi.

The person who has perfected this siddhi can bring under his or her control any entity or factor. Just as any person driven by crooked intellect can be directed to the proper path by virtue of this ability to bring under one&#146;s control, one can also make another person engage in bad action according to one&#146;s desire. Thus vashitva-siddhi is more deadly, by comparison, than iishitva-siddhi. In ancient times, those who were established in vashitva-siddhi were called vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph --><b>Pra&#x301;pti</b>: Through this siddhi the spiritual aspirant can visualise any factor of the psychic world within himself or herself. Such an individual can know the original substance or the essence of any factor without having to go through books or resorting to some other medium. Omniscience is one branch of this pra&#x301;pti-siddhi. The practice of this pra&#x301;pti-siddhi generally instills a harmony between the crude world and the psychic world; thus, even though the misuse of this pra&#x301;pti-siddhi is considered somewhat harmful, roughly speaking there is no great harm attached to it. Still, in the life of a spiritual aspirant one should also shun this thorny siddhi.<!-- /block --></p>

Just as a person can amass wealth in the physical world by means of this praka&#x301;mya-siddhi, he or she can also do the same in the sphere of intellectuality. He or she becomes skilled in all knowledge as well as all scriptures. Filled with love, he or she can become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a in the spiritual world. This is called madhura bha&#x301;va or madhura sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra. By means of this praka&#x301;mya-siddhi a supreme fulfilment descends in the life of a spiritual aspirant who, forgetting both the physical and psychic worlds, flows his or her mind only towards Parama Purus&#x301;a&#8230; In this lies the supreme success in the life of a human being or any living being. In the absence of mental restraint this siddhi can push a person towards crude enjoyment and crude mental pabula, so here also a spiritual aspirant should proceed with caution.<!-- /block --></p>

The ability to enter another&#146;s body was considered partially praka&#x301;mya-siddhi and partially pra&#x301;pti-siddhi in ancient times.

Although the etymological meaning of vibhu&#x301;ti is &ldquo;supernatural power&rdquo; or &ldquo;supernatural siddhi&rdquo;, its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;ash&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;occult power&rdquo;.

<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Situated between two hills was a plateau sloping more or less from south to north. A little ways beyond the edge of the plateau lay the Ganges. The plateau was covered with sha&#x301;l, kendu and pala&#x301;sh forest, interspersed with shiya&#x301;kul thickets, and for the most part was full of smaller and larger pebbles. In these areas farmers would come during the rainy season and cultivate late-spring pigeon-peas. The pigeon-pea plants take nearly the entire year to grow. The harvesting of the pigeon-pea plants would start after this Phalgun full-moon. In the local language pigeon-pea plants are called lya&#x301;ret&#x301;ha&#x301;. This lya&#x301;ret&#x301;ha&#x301; is used for making houses, thatching roofs, making fences, and of course as cooking fuel. But above all, these late-spring pigeon-pea fields give good shelter to smaller animals from attacks by larger animals. If they are chased by bears, tigers or wolves, the smaller animals hide in these pigeon-pea fields. Once they make it there it becomes impossible to find them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->While I was walking I noticed several hares and small deer coming out from a pigeon-pea field.

My mind was full of joy. Suddenly I heard in the distance the extremely loud barking of a domesticated dog. Normally dogs do not make such a loud noise. Furthermore what would a domesticated dog be doing so deep in the forest! Certainly there are dogs living in the forest but those are wild dogs. Although their barking is somewhat like that of domesticated dogs, it has character all its own. Their sound is somewhat sharper. Besides that, they move in packs and because of this they are very courageous. If a tiger encroaches on their territory they will chase after it as a group and irritate it with their barking. Unable to put up with the disturbance the tiger will lose itself in the deep forest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->The dog is a sharp-snouted member of the canine family and the tiger is a round-snouted member of the feline family. There is an inherent hostility between these two. According to biologists, members of the canine family are sharp-snouted, carnivorous, swift runners, make noise when they run, and have a strong sense of smell (the alsatian is an exception). They also display a good deal of affection towards their young. The largest animal in this group is the maned lion, native to Africa. In addition, there is the medium-sized maned Indian lion,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the maneless Indian lion or gurjar lion, the wolf (vrkavya&#x301;ghra), alsatian,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  the ordinary domesticated Indian dog, the wild Indian dog, the jackal (shrga&#x301;la), the fox (ulka&#x301;mukhii), and so on. In addition there are many kinds of short-haired and long-haired dogs differing from country to country and variety to variety. Some people are of the opinion that while the dog no doubt belongs to the canine family, it is not an original species but rather a cross-breed &ndash; the wolf is its father and the jackal its mother &ndash; this was the ancient conception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->Although dogs live in groups, different members of the canine family do not mix with each other.

<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The tiger, however, is a different class of animal, a feline.

<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->What an awful thing! Who could have done such a cruel deed? The dog showed no sign of any injury, that is, he hadn&#146;t been attacked by any animal. If a tiger had attacked it would have seized him or her by the throat or the neck. That is the way that felines attack, from the tigers of the Sundarban jungle to the domesticated housecat. Even a common cat catches rats and mice in that way. A wolf would have attacked the stomach or the back which is how canines attack, from the lion to the fox. When kakt&#x301;esiya&#x301;s creatures attack, however, they attack from the tail end. Their nature is to attack other animals from behind and swing and shake them about.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->The dog appeared completely uninjured. From looking at him, it appeared as if some unnatural means had been used to arrest his blood circulation and bring him seemingly to the point of death. Almost as if someone was rapidly squeezing the last drop of its life&#146;s essence. After a few minutes navel-breathing began. His dog-life did not have long to go. There was no water nearby. If it had been rainy season then some water could have been found in puddles and holes, but it was now the end of the cold season and water was getting scarce. There was none to be found anywhere.

<a name="81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Khagen was totally absorbed, like a tree immersed in meditation. He didn&#146;t blink at all or move even a finger or a toe so I kept quiet for some time and remained standing there, not disturbing him.

Why should a person have removed me from the earth in this way without any reason? Will you not redress this?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->I looked again at Khagen and saw his fair-complexioned body gradually start turning red. It stayed that way for a short time and then slowly turned jet-black. I watched for some time longer until he gradually turned pale, anaemic. Then I touched his body; it was as cold as ice and harder than iron. A human corpse will turn cold but it never becomes that hard. I was considering what to do or not to do, and then I remembered that in such cases the body should not be cremated for eighteen hours; one must wait. If it didn&#146;t return to a normal state within eighteen hours then one could begin cremating. I thought about returning to town and letting someone know what had happened and then returning, but I realized that it would take at least two hours to go and come and in the meantime some wild animal might come and eat him, thinking him to be dead. Finally I decided to keep watch over the body throughout the night and then return to town in the morning to let people know. There would be little possibility of a wild animal showing up there during daylight hours. I remained standing there, looking now at the unfortunate dog and now at Khagen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->Suddenly I saw a point of light exit from Khagen&#146;s third eye and enter into the third eye of the dog.

<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->A short while later, the dog&#146;s tail again started to move slowly back and forth, and some barks came from his mouth.

Again the dog&#146;s tail moved a few times and again it barked a little. This time it stood up, looked here and there, and then started climbing the hill.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->It approached us and then started circling around Khagen like a machine with someone at the controls, like an ox with blinders tracing fixed circles around the oil-mill. The dog didn&#146;t enter the bhaeravii cakra, but stuck close to its outer edge as it circled around. It was easy to understand what a dreadful state it was in; it had no fear, no thought, perhaps not even a sense of existence. It was a crude flesh-and-bone machine, a mindless, energy-driven body. And in whose hands was the switch for turning on the energy that drove him?

<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->I understood that this was all Khagen&#146;s affair.

Its existence was actually just like that of a puppet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->I couldn&#146;t bear it any longer. Such misuse of the human being&#146;s hidden internal powers would not help to elevate the human race.

<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->I grabbed a fistful of hair and slapped him in the face; his body fell over, just like a large, precariously balanced rock topples at the slightest touch. His body was not a living body; it was like a huge puppet carved out of a piece of hard iron. As Khagen&#146;s body fell from its seat another astonishing thing occurred. A point of light exited from the third eye of the dog and entered into Khagen&#146;s third eye. The dog uttered a cry and collapsed on top of a rock. It was dead once again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->I looked over at Khagen and saw him slowly trying to open his eyes. He looked at me and started to cry.

<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->He started walking by my side but very slowly. I did not scold him any more along the way because he was not in a normal state. He was somewhere halfway between life and death. When I got to the edge of the muddy pond where I had been sitting, I saw that some black figure was standing beside the pigeon-pea field right behind me. His body was not luminous but rather fashioned from a black shadow. Lest Khagen be disturbed or feel worried, I didn&#146;t say anything. I pressed his elbow and gently made him sit down. &ldquo;Take some rest now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;then we&#146;ll go on some more.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->He started crying and said: &ldquo;I have committed such a great sin, yet you still love me so much. I disobeyed you, yet you still don&#146;t hate me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

I kept hold of his left elbow with my right hand and pulled him along in a fashion. Glancing behind, I noticed a point of light following us. Since I was looking at the point of light, Khagen also glanced in that direction. He shivered and said: &ldquo;That dog, again that dog, again that dog is chasing me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="105"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=105 type=paragraph -->A few years later I was once again sitting in that same place at the dead of night bathed in moonlight.

<a name="106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->During the day I asked the local villagers for news about Khagen. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Sometimes we see a half-mad fellow wandering the jungle paths at the edge of the hills.

I have left that path, I have left that path, bark, bark, I have left that path, but that dog won&#146;t leave me alone.

<a name="108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph -->The verbal root mas means &ldquo;to measure&rdquo;. By adding ghain&#x32D; to mas we get ma&#x301;sa whose etymological meaning is &ldquo;a measurement of time&rdquo; or &ldquo;a period of time&rdquo;. Thus ma&#x301;sa in this sense means &ldquo;era&rdquo;, &ldquo;lunar year&rdquo;, &ldquo;lunar month&rdquo;, &ldquo;lunar day&rdquo;, &ldquo;solar year&rdquo;, &ldquo;solar month&rdquo;, &ldquo;fortnight&rdquo;, &ldquo;week&rdquo;, &ldquo;solar day&rdquo; or ahora&#x301;tra (from sunrise to sunrise), prahara (three hours), hour, minute, second, fraction-of-second and so forth &ndash; all of these. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;solar month&rdquo; (30, 31 or 32 days), that is, the amount of time it takes the sun to pass through one sign of the zodiac (the time it takes the sun to pass through the sign of Aries is the solar month of Vaesha&#x301;kha), or &ldquo;lunar month&rdquo; (28, 29 or 30 days), the amount of time it takes the moon to pass through the twelve signs of the zodiac.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph -->Es&#x301;a ma&#x301;sa means &ldquo;this month&rdquo;. The word ma&#x301;sa ends with the suffix ghain&#x32D; and is masculine, thus es&#x301;a, the masculine, first person, singular form of the word etad [this] is used. Es&#x301;a ma&#x301;sa means &ldquo;this month&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->The verbal root ma&#x301; also means &ldquo;to measure&rdquo;. By adding the suffix asun to the root ma&#x301; we get the word ma&#x301;s. Its etymological meaning is also &ldquo;that which is measured&rdquo;. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;the amount of time the moon takes to measure the earth once while passing through the twelve signs of the zodiac&rdquo;, or &ldquo;lunar month&rdquo;. There is no reason not to use the word ma&#x301;s colloquially for &ldquo;solar month&rdquo;. That is, why will we not use ma&#x301;s for the amount of time it takes the earth to revolve around the sun and return. Etymologically, of course, when it takes the earth one day to rotate on its axis then we can also call that ma&#x301;s. Still, practically speaking, it would be incorrect, since by this rotation neither the earth nor the sun can be completely measured. Furthermore the polar regions stand in a different relation to the sun by virtue of their differing course, so a proper picture of the sun cannot be had through them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph -->At any rate, the spelling of the word for the Bengali month [lunar month] and the solar month, ma&#x301;s, is more correct if it is spelled ma&#x301;s. Moreover, in practical cases it can create problems if there is more than one current spelling for the same word. In this regard there is nothing to say if one adds a hasanta at the end of the word ma&#x301;s. So if one says es&#x301;a ma&#x301;s also, it means &ldquo;this month&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the concerning year&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix kvip or d&#x301;rn&#x301; to the verbal root mas we get the word mas. The etymological meaning of the word mas  is &ldquo;any period of time&rdquo; &ndash; from era or year to fraction-of-a-second; the colloquial meaning of mas is &ldquo;year&rdquo;. Es&#x301;a mas means &ldquo;this year&rdquo;. Es&#x301;a mas means &ldquo;this time&rdquo; etymologically and &ldquo;this year&rdquo; colloquially. From es&#x301;a mas we get  the word aes&#x301;amasya which means &ldquo;during this time&rdquo; or &ldquo;in this year&rdquo;. &ldquo;I am not speaking about another year, I am speaking about this year.&rdquo; We can also rephrase this sentence as &ldquo;I am not speaking about another year, I am speaking of aes&#x301;amasya.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not speaking about earlier times, I am speaking about the present time.&rdquo; This sentence can be rephrased as &ldquo;I am not speaking about earlier times, I am speaking of aes&#x301;amasya.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&#146;t know how cold it was here in other months but this month is really cold.&rdquo; Instead of saying this, we can say: &ldquo;I don&#146;t know how cold it was here in other months, but aes&#x301;amasya it is really cold.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->The process for refining molasses and eliminating its smell was first discovered in China. The Indian people learned it from the Chinese several thousand years ago. Since it was learned from China, sugar became known as ciinii. We get the word ciinii by adding the suffix nak to the verbal root ci and then applying prs&#x301;i diirghah; its etymological meaning is &ldquo;that country which collects things with great care or which is produced from a collection of good qualities&rdquo;. We get the word ciinii from the meaning &ldquo;concerning China&rdquo; or &ldquo;produced in China&rdquo;. Both ca and na can take long ii. The old Sanskrit word for sugar was sharkara&#x301;. The words &ldquo;saccrum&rdquo;, &ldquo;sacrites&rdquo;, &ldquo;saccharine&rdquo; (all from Old Latin), &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; (English), sucre (French), sha&#x301;khar (Tamil, Gujarati, Marathi), sakkar (Hindustani), and so forth, have all come from the word sharkara&#x301;. All of them mean aeks&#x301;ava. Aeks&#x301;ava sugar is also called khan&#x301;d&#x301;a in Sanskrit. The word kha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301; in Punjabi, which means &ldquo;sugar&rdquo;, is derived from khan&#x301;d&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->Here one should keep in mind that people learned to make sugar from sugar beets during World War I. In English, aeks&#x301;ava sugar is called &ldquo;cane sugar&rdquo; and sugar extracted from sugar beets is called &ldquo;beet sugar&rdquo;. Needless to say, beet sugar or other beet products cannot be called aeks&#x301;ava.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->The words currently used for sugar cane in India, whether Sanskrit, indigenous or foreign, are: iks&#x301;u (Sanskrit), kusherika&#x301; (Sanskrit), a&#x301;kh (Bengali), kushiya&#x301;r (Maethilii, Bengali, Assamese), kushyer (Bengali), kushur (Bengali), keta&#x301;rii (Nagpuri, Magahi, Angika), keta&#x301;r&#x301;ii (Angika), un&#x32D;kh (Bhojpuri), ikh (Hindi), and ganna&#x301; (Urdu).<!-- /block --></p>

In some places paper is made from sugar-cane husk through a modern process. This kind of paper can also be called aeks&#x301;avapatram in Sanskrit and aeks&#x301;ava ka&#x301;gaj in Bengali. In spoken Bengali we say ekho gur&#x301; [cane molasses]; an eloquent way of saying the same thing in literary Bengali would be aeks&#x301;ava gur&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->Formerly ciinii was mistakenly spelled cini [I recognize]. Cini go cini tumi videshinii. Here the word cini has a double meaning. One meaning is: &ldquo;O foreign lady, I recognize you.&rdquo; Another meaning is: &ldquo;Hey, sugar, you have come from overseas.&rdquo; During the first part of the British era, when insufficient coal sugar was being produced in this country, sugar was imported as required from Batavia in Indonesia. During my childhood, this sugar was known as ba&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;ciinii in the markets in Calcutta. The name ba&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;ciinii came from the name of the capital city Batavia. The Sanskrit name for the city of Batavia is Va&#x301;ta&#x301;viipura. The large-sized lemon that the Dutch brought to this country from Batavia, which has since become practically native, is still called ba&#x301;ta&#x301;vii lemon.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph -->The original home of sugar cane is southeast Asia. Sugar cane likes hot weather and lots of water. Southeast Asia is still the largest producer of sugar cane in the world. Gur&#x301; [molasses] is a very old Vedic word. There tends to be some difference of opinion whether or not the Vedic Aryans cultivated sugar cane or were familiar with sugar cane, but there is no doubt that they were familiar with sugar-cane molasses. It is not known whether they produced this sugar-cane molasses themselves or imported it from southeast Asia. The Vedic Aryans used to use honey for their religious rituals, but it was also the system that molasses could be used in place of honey as required when the supply of honey was insufficient. Madhvabha&#x301;ve gud&#x301;am&#x301; dadya&#x301;t [&ldquo;In the absence of honey, molasses (gud&#x301;a) can be offered to the deity&rdquo;].

Except for one Narail subdivision, practically all of Jessore District was turned into a graveyard. Many rich settlements were abandoned and reverted back to jungle. The Bangaon and Magura subdivisions of that time were affected by both malaria and black fever. In many parts small villages were deserted and the jungle overtook them.
