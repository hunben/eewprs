Even collectively they are not the cause of creation, although the a&#x301;tman, unit consciousness, is the catalytic agent. The unit consciousness is not the cause of creation, because it can be affected by virtue or vice.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This Transcendental Entity, this Creative Principle, cannot be the time factor. Time is not an eternal factor. Because what is time? It is mental reckoning of the motivity of action. This mental reckoning of the motivity of action [means that] where there is no action, there cannot be any time. The earth moves around the sun; that is how we get the solar year, the solar month, the solar day. The moon moves round the earth; that is how we get the lunar month, the lunar year, the lunar [day]. And the solar year or lunar year, the solar day or lunar day, are mental reckonings of their movements. Wherever there is no action, the possibility of measurement does not arise. And where there is action but no personal entity, no personal factor to measure the motivity, there cannot be any time. So the time factor is a relative factor; there cannot be eternal time. Time cannot be the absolute factor; so it cannot be the Causal Matrix, it cannot be the Creative Faculty. So time should not be the object of meditation. Time should not be your supreme desideratum. Time is not the Transcendental Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Next item, svabha&#x301;va. What is svabha&#x301;va? You know, the functional side of this universe, the most important factor, is the Operative Principle. Now, what is the Operative Principle? At a particular time,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the particular style followed by the Operative Principle is called nature. So nature cannot be the Creative Faculty. Some people say &ldquo;[The entire universe] is the creation of nature. It has come from nature.&rdquo; No, no, no. Nature cannot create anything. Nature is the mode of work of the Operative Principle. The style followed by Prakrti, the style followed by the Operative Principle, rather the Creative Principle, is called nature, svabha&#x301;va. So svabha&#x301;va, or nature, cannot be the Creative Faculty. Nothing cometh from nature; nature is the style of working. It is due to the misguiding effects of defective materialistic philosophy that people say that everything has been created by nature. Now, this nature [is the creation] of the Operative Principle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;la, svabha&#x301;va, then niyati. Niyati means &ldquo;fate&rdquo;. Is fate a guiding factor? No, it is not at all a guiding factor. Fate does not control human movement. What is fate? It is the unexpressed resultant momenta of your past actions. You have done something good or bad, so you will have to suffer the consequence, you will have to face the result. And unless and until the reaction in seed form is properly satisfied, you cannot get salvation, you cannot get emancipation. Now, these [reactive momenta], these unquenched reactive momenta, come before you in the form of fate. You committed some bad thing, now you will have to undergo punishment. The reactive momenta take the form of punishment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->And [usually] somewhere on this earth or on any other planet, [there will be] a particular structure or [configuration] of the stars and planets. So-called astrologers say that because you were born when the moon and such-and-such star or planet were within the jurisdiction of such-and-such zodiac [sign,] you took birth in this way. No. Because you committed this type of action, you were born within such-and-such structure or such-and-such zodiac [sign]. It is because of [your] actions that you were born on the earth and should suffer like this; not because of the [influences of] the stars. Do you follow? These actions brought you within the structural limits of such-and-such zodiac [sign] and such-and-such planets. So the stars do not [control] you; your original actions control you. And where [the original action] is not known to you, but the result is known to you, the result is experienced by you, you say it is niyati. It is also called adrs&#x301;t&#x301;a in Sanskrit. Adrs&#x301;t&#x301;a means &ldquo;not-drs&#x301;t&#x301;a, not seen&rdquo;. Where you feel the reaction, where you witness the reaction, but you cannot see the original action, it is called adrs&#x301;t&#x301;a, that is, unseen. You do not know what the original crime was that you committed, but you are [driven by] the reaction. So you say, &ldquo;It is my adrs&#x301;t&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So fate cannot be the controlling factor, cannot be the creative factor, and so fate must not be your object of meditation, your object of adoration, or your object of worship. Human destiny is not controlled by fate. A human&#146;s destiny is his or her own creation.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> You have to fight against bondage; you have to fight against fate and do something original by your personal [effort].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->After ka&#x301;la, svabha&#x301;va, niyati: yadrccha&#x301; [accident]. Some people [of misguided intellectual outlook] say, &ldquo;It is something accidental.&rdquo; Just to conceal their ignorance, they say it is accidental. You know, there is nothing accidental in this universe. For each and every incident there is some cause. We may or may not know the cause, but we must not say it is accidental just in order to conceal our ignorance. Everything is causal. Nothing is non-causal in this universe of causality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Sometimes it so happens that the cause is translated into effect in a very short span of time; the translation period is very short. In that case, the effect is called &ldquo;accidental&rdquo;. [But is it really accidental?] And sometimes you see the result but you do not know the cause; in that case also you say it is an accident.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> You do not know the cause, so you say, &ldquo;It is an accident, it is an accident.&rdquo; No, there is no accident; everything is incident. So yadrccha&#x301; means &ldquo;accident&rdquo;. The accident cannot be the real cause, cannot be the causal factor. An accident cannot be your object of meditation or object of adoration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;lah svabha&#x301;vo niyatiryadrccha&#x301; bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni&#8230; [&ldquo;Time, nature, fate, accident, matter&#8230;&rdquo;] Some people say, &ldquo;You know, the original cause [is] matter &ndash; this quinquelemental universe came from a&#x301;dibhu&#x301;ta, from matter.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Matter is the rudimental cause, matter is everything.&rdquo; If matter is everything, how does the Causal Mind come from matter? The mind is something superior to matter. So matter is not the a&#x301;dibhu&#x301;ta. Human intellect, the human spirit, is far superior to matter, so matter cannot be the rudimental cause. Matter cannot be the Causal Matrix. And by worshipping matter, a person will be converted into matter. A person will be degraded to the status of animal and finally to the status of matter. So matter cannot be your object of ideation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&#8230; bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni yonih purus&#x301;a iti cintya&#x301; [&ldquo;&#8230; matter, the jiiva&#x301;tman (unit consciousness) &ndash; it is debatable&rdquo;]. Now, is the jiiva&#x301;tman the rudimental cause? No. The jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; cannot be the rudimental cause, because there are so many jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;s. For each and every entity there is one jiiva&#x301;tman. And even in matter there are jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;s. Because of their undeveloped mind,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the existence of the a&#x301;tman is not experienced, but the a&#x301;tman is there. A particular jiiva&#x301;tman, a particular entity, cannot be the supreme causal factor of the entire universe. So the yonih purus&#x301;a [unit consciousness] is not the causal factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->You know, whenever any mind, any microcosm, feels any good or bad experience, the concerned jiiva&#x301;tman is affected by that feeling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Suppose there is a football match. There are two parties, and you are the spectators. You are not the players, remember; the results of  the match [will not directly affect you. Yet you will feel affected.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Similarly, whenever pleasure or sorrow is experienced by the mind, the [human] mind, the concerned jiiva&#x301;tman is affected by that particular pleasure or sorrow. Suppose there is a red flower and there is a looking-glass. That looking-glass has no colour, while the flower is [red], but because of its proximity to the red flower, the looking-glass will also become red. Similarly, the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; gets assailed by the pleasures and sorrows of the human mind. That entity that gets assailed by pleasures and sorrows cannot be the Causal Matrix, cannot be the supreme cause; so it cannot be your object of ideation.<!-- /block --></p>

Because in each and every item we find there are certain imperfections. Imperfect entities cannot be the supreme cause of this universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Then is Prakrti the supreme causal factor, is the Operative Principle the supreme causal factor? No, certainly not. When the triangle of principles, the triangle of rudimental principles, gets unbalanced, its equipoise is lost. Then the resultant faculty comes out from one of its vertices. That resultant is the first phase of creation. But that resultant, the basic faculty, cannot do anything concrete without the help of the Cognitive Factor. In the second phase, in the primordial stratum, it requires the presence of the Cognitive Principle still more. And in the final stage of creation, in the case of the vibrational faculties, it requires the presence of the Cognition still more. So the Operative Principle (or, when helped by the Cognitive Principle, more popularly known as the Creative Principle, or Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, in Sanskrit) cannot be the creative force, cannot be the Causal Matrix. Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; cannot do anything without the help of Shiva [Cognitive Principle]. Only with the permission of Shiva can She do something. So Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, or the Operative Principle, is not the Causal Matrix, Shiva is the supreme cause.<!-- /block --></p>

Ks&#x301;aram means &ldquo;waning&rdquo;, &ldquo;undergoing changes&rdquo;, &ldquo;undergoing metamorphosis&rdquo;, &ldquo;transient&rdquo;, &ldquo;transitory&rdquo;. Prakrti is not something transcendental, something intransient; She has to undergo changes.<!-- /block --></p>

In the sha&#x301;stras it has been said that Prakrti is nityanivrtta&#x301;. Every day at each and every moment She is waning, She is dying out, She is being transformed into Purus&#x301;a.

But this Hara is the Attributional Consciousness, Attributional Entity, Attributed Entity. Why Attributed Entity? Because of Its proximity to the Basic Principle, the primordial principle, and also because of Its proximity to the vibrational principle. You know this Basic Principle is called Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti or Maha&#x301;sarasvatii in Sanskrit. And the primordial principle is called Bhaeravii shakti. And the vibrational principle is called Bhava&#x301;nii shakti. When Hara is in contact with the Basic Principle, He is Paramashiva; when He is in contact with the primordial principle, He is Bhaerava; and when He is in contact with the vibrational principle, He is Bhava. So because of His proximity to, because of His close contact with, the creative faculties, He cannot be the supreme factor, although He is the Supreme Causal Entity. He has got something to do with the created universe. That&#146;s why although He is the Causal Entity, He is not the Supreme Beatitude. Because of His proximity to the Operative Principle, He is an attributional entity, not the Non-Attributional Entity.

Because the virtuous and the sinner both are His children, both are His progeny. Because He is the Supreme Progenitor, all are His children. He cannot hate anybody, although He knows everything.

By Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na and anudhya&#x301;na you come in close contact with Him, and this is yojana&#x301;t. For yojana&#x301;t in Sanskrit there are two verbs.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn12"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn12">12</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> One is yuj and the other is yuin&#x32D;j. Yuj means to come in close contact but maintaining one&#146;s individuality. It is [just like] a mixture of sand and sugar. There is close contact between the sand and sugar, but they maintain their individual identities. And then there is yuin&#x32D;j. Yuin&#x32D;j means [not just] to come in contact, but to become one with each other. One is addition and the other is unification. The root verb yuj means &ldquo;to add&rdquo; and the root verb yuin&#x32D;j means &ldquo;to unify&rdquo;. Here, yojana&#x301;t means unification. When a river comes in close contact with the ocean, yojana&#x301;t takes place, and that yojana&#x301;t is of the root verb yuin&#x32D;j, that is, &ldquo;unification&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn13"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn13">13</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Similarly, when a sa&#x301;dhaka comes in contact with Him, that is, yojana&#x301;t becomes established, one becomes one with the Supreme Self.

Neither masculine nor feminine, neuter gender. So here the word &ldquo;He&rdquo; has not been used, the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; has been used. Tat means &ldquo;That&rdquo;, and tva is [a suffix to make] an abstract noun [meaning &ldquo;ness&rdquo;]. So Tattva means &ldquo;Thatness&rdquo;. For example, mahattattva.
