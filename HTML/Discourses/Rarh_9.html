<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The psychology of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h which was based on the original Shaeva Dharma did indeed accept Jainism, but only superficially. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h did not internalize, rather it rejected, Jainism insofar as the latter was not consistent with the fundamental rules of Shaeva Dharma. Though all the idols of the Tiirthaun&#x32D;karas found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are nude, in conformity with the Digambara Jain cult, none of the idols of Jain gods and goddesses found there are nude. The idols of the Jain goddesses Ambika&#x301; and Manasa&#x301; which have been found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are all clothed and adorned with ornaments. All the idols of the Jain gods and goddesses of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h that have been found and that were worshipped as orthodox or non-scriptural gods and goddesses [i.e., worshipped as different types of Hindu gods and goddesses] in a later period are nothing but different expressions of the human mind. And these feelings would become associated with each other, and would become sublimated into maha&#x301;bha&#x301;va [a higher stage of realization] and Paramashiva [Nucleus Consciousness]. It is not possible to find any consistency between these feelings and atheistic Jainism. Of all these Jain gods and goddesses, some have found a place in Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika [Puranic] scriptures, while others have been transformed into non-scriptural deities. Many, however, have not been recognized at all, directly or indirectly. Of many reasons for this, one was the torrential and irresistible advent in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of the Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma propounded by Mahaprabhu Chaitanya.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  At that point, the priests of that era did not find sufficient time to convert the [remaining] Jain deities into Puranic gods and goddesses. Like all other sections of the general populace in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the Jain ascetic preachers, the Jain priests, and afterwards the Utkal Brahmans (as they came to be known) of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, came under the influence of the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->[Extremes of] casteism developed in Bengal at that time. The Utkal Brahmans of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h retained their caste system while embracing Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma. The unnamed deities of Jain Tantra also veered from the Jain path of ahimsa&#x301; to some extent and, coming to be considered merely as different forms of the [Sha&#x301;kta] goddess Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii, began to be propitiated with sacrificial offerings, as an external ritual of Sha&#x301;kta Tantra (which was nothing but a misdirected form of Shaeva Tantra). Ducks, hens, pigs, buffaloes, etc., were offered as sacrifices. By that time, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had drifted a long way from Jainism, and most of the Jain temples in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had been transformed into Jain Shiva temples.<!-- /block --></p>
