They needn&#146;t go to temples, needn&#146;t go to tiirthas [places of pilgrimage], in search of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Pa&#x301;rvatii asked Lord Shiva: &ldquo;O Lord, which one is the best tiirtha?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You know, the meaning of tiirtha is tiirastham&#x301;. Suppose on a river there is a waterline; that waterline, that waterline that touches the shore, that point, is called tiira. And above that, the slope of the river is called bela&#x301; or bela&#x301;bhumi &ndash; &ldquo;shore&rdquo;, &ldquo;bank&rdquo;. But the tiira is not the bank. The tiira is the touching point where the water touches the land. This is the bank and this is the water. [gestures] This point is tiira.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->So tiirastham&#x301; means &ldquo;situated on tiira&rdquo;. If you go a step downward you will be in the water. A step upward, you will be on dry land. That point is called tiira, tiirastham&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Actually, tiirtha means that stance from where if you go a step deeper, a step inner, you will be in the land of bliss, and if you go a step cruder you will be within the realm of crude materiality, the crude world. So tiirastham&#x301;. A man should always try to keep his mind, keep himself, in tiirtha. So as soon as he will sit in meditation, he will be in deep meditation; and as soon as he will start worldly work he will be starting worldly work. His position, his stance, should always be maintained. A man should always be in tiirtha. How can one be always in Varanasi or Rameshvaram [places of pilgrimage]? It is not possible. One will have to look after his hearth and home. So tiirtha is something internal, not external.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->When Pa&#x301;rvatii asked Lord Shiva, &ldquo;O Lord, which one is the best tiirtha?&rdquo; Lord Shiva&#146;s reply was:<!-- /block --></p>

These external tiirthas are actually no tiirtha. The actual tiirtha lies within, not without.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
