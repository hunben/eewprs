<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>17) Question</b>:  What does archaeological history say &ndash; has there been any collective influence of positive or negative microvita on this earth or in the entire cosmos?  And what is your guess regarding Atlantis, Oceanis and Gondwanaland?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Human beings came here one million years ago, but the history of civilization starts from the time of the Rg Veda, fifteen thousand years ago.  From one million years ago to fifteen thousand years ago &ndash; for so many years, nine hundred and eighty-five thousand years, between the Miocene and the Oligocene ages &ndash; was human society in a dormant state?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Humans invented pictorial letters less than seven thousand years ago. A full-fledged civilization, with the four symbols of advancement &ndash; agriculture, the wheel, dress and script &ndash; started seven thousand years ago. Is there any role of microvita, positive or negative? It is another question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->With regard to civilization, there has been little progress during the long span of nine hundred and eighty-five thousand years. All the progress has taken place within the last fifteen thousand years, from the time of the Rg Veda, the oldest unwritten book of the world. (At that time people  could not write).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Do microvita influence the mind first, or matter first, of any human or living structure? Negative microvita can function directly at the physico-psychic plexus, but they cannot reach even directly to the occult plexus.  Only positive microvita can touch the lunar plexus and they may be elevated up to the occult plexus, but negative microvita may be elevated to the lunar plexus by another course. If negative microvita affect the mind, the mind may undergo derangement, but negative microvita cannot affect the mind directly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Positive microvita may be used for intellectual development and for imparting certain occult powers, but not for spiritual power or spiritual development. Suppose a man is deaf and dumb. As the functions of hearing and speech are controlled by nerve cells or nerve fibres, they are activated with the help of nerve cells or nerve fibres.  Nerve cells are controlled with the help of the lunar plexus.  Positive microvita may function directly up to the lunar plexus, but there at the lunar plexus, if positive microvita are to influence the nerve cells, they require some special power. Positive microvita cannot do something supernatural with the help of the nerve cells &ndash; they require some special power of some powerful person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Suppose the Sadguru is saying something, and the deaf or dumb man wants to hear it but cannot. If one concentrates the mind on vara&#x301;bhaya mudra&#x301;, there will be the direct effect of positive microvita on the auricular or other nerve cells and also on the controlling cells, and it may be that all of a sudden he may get back the power of hearing.  One should look towards these two mudra&#x301;s and not to anything else.  Microvita are radiated through these two mudra&#x301;s. This is the inner secret.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This is supernatural, but not illogical.  Certainly it is supernatural because it does not come within the scope of natural phenomena.  Here the inner secret does not lie with microvita, it depends on something else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->During the last Vaesha&#x301;khii Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301; at Ananda Nagar, there were many spiritual aspirants who wanted that the speed of our progress should be accelerated regarding the establishment of Ananda Marga on this planet. Did you mark that after Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (DMC) the speed has accelerated? This is the effect of positive microvita through these two mudra&#x301;s.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->If a deaf man sincerely wants to hear what the Sadguru is saying, the positive microvita radiated through these two mudra&#x301;s are sure to help him &ndash; they will certainly help him. During this DMC, some boys mentally expressed that we should go on fighting. Now see our boys and girls will go on fighting, and fight in the realm of spirituality means victory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The highest point up to which negative microvita can function is the physico-psychic plexus, but with the application of some force they can be raised up to the lunar plexus.  This raising is called &ldquo;risti&rdquo; or &ldquo;rusti&rdquo;.  The lunar plexus is the highest point of positive microvita, but if positive microvita are raised above this point, it is called &ldquo;krpa&#x301;&rdquo;. That is, raising positive microvita from the lunar plexus to the occult plexus is called &ldquo;krpa&#x301;&rdquo;.  And raising them from the lunar plexus to the pinnacled point of human glory is called &ldquo;karun&#x301;a&#x301;&rdquo;.  Without krpa&#x301; there cannot be karun&#x301;a&#x301;, there cannot be any galloping jump. Raising negative microvita above the psycho-physical plexus is &ldquo;rusti&rdquo; or &ldquo;risti&rdquo;.  You should always try to avoid rusti and always try to receive the glamour of krpa&#x301; or karun&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
