Since some people believe that this plant is born from a chemical transformation that transpires when water used for washing rice is left in one place and spoils, its [Sanskrit] name is <I>tan&#x301;d&#x301;uleraka</I> (the etymological meaning is that which originates from water used for washing rice). The Bengali word for <I>tan&#x301;d&#x301;uleraka</I> is <I>nate sha&#x301;ka</I> [<I>Amaranthus tristis</I>].

However <I>kuntha</I> refers only to the thorny variety (<I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;a&#x301;nat&#x301;e</I> ). This variety has some Ayurvedic qualities as well. In the <I>avidyata&#x301;ntrik</I> process of <I>stambhana</I> (to stop the movement of something, for example, <I>mu&#x301;trastambha</I> or stoppage of urine movement, <I>va&#x301;kstambha</I> or stoppage of speech, etc.) this <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;a&#x301; nat&#x301;e</I> [<I>Amarantus spinosus Linn</I>] is used.<!-- /block --></p>

Suddenly, from that very moment, they stop all movement, stop making any noise. Silence reigns in the room. It would be hard for anyone to know that seven hundred rats were lurking. So one colloquial meaning of the word <I>kundu</I> is a rat of any kind, whether a rat or a mouse. In Hindi a rat is called <I>cuha&#x301;</I> and a mouse is called <I>cuhiya&#x301;</I>. In Bihar the big ones are called <I>mus&#x301;</I>, the small ones <I>cut&#x301;ri</I>. For a woodland rat or field mouse the word <I>a&#x301;khu</I> was common in old Sanskrit. In later times the word went almost completely out of use. <I>Mu&#x301;s&#x301;ika</I> or <I>in&#x32D;dura</I> refers to all kinds of rodents. <I>Mus&#x301;a&#x301;</I> was common in old Bengali.

You know that in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h region there is normally very little water in ordinary rivers and streams. These rivers are rain-fed or fed by riverbed springs. In general, such springs generally do not normally descend from the mountains. They originate because here and there the underground water levels are high. They generate more water during the rainy season. The water pressure falls during winter. Sometimes during the summer the springs dry up due to lack of water pressure. There are quite a few of these subterranean springs in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph --><p>Streams fed by rainwater flourish and swell whenever there is sudden rainfall near their source. Such a flash flood is called <I>har&#x301;ka&#x301;</I> in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali. While it is true that flash floods last only a few hours, they inflict heavy losses during that time. Small rivers that used to cause this type of heavy damage were given names according to their nature. Today people call the river Ka&#x301;n&#x32D;sa&#x301;i by the name Kam&#x301;sa&#x301;vatii but in former times people used to call it Ka&#x301;n&#x32D;sa&#x301;i, which means &ldquo;butcher&rdquo;. Since its nature was like that of a butcher it was given the name &ldquo;Ka&#x301;n&#x32D;sa&#x301;i&rdquo;. In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h the river Kopa&#x301;i in Birbhum District and the river Kupa&#x301;i in Purulia District derive their names from the word <I>kupita&#x301;</I> (<I>kupita&#x301; &gt; kupia&#x301; &gt; kupa&#x301;i/kopa&#x301;i</I>). The name &ldquo;A&#x301;lkusi&rdquo; is used in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h for that kind of river in which a flash flood creates sudden havoc.

According to the Puranic story, the mother of Shiva&#146;s son Karttika was Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; or Ja&#x301;hn&#x301;avii. She thrust the infant into the waves and abandoned him to the adjoining sandbank. Finding the infant crying, six stars came down from the sky and began to breastfeed him. The infant started suckling with six mouths. As a result the baby subsequently came to be known as S&#x301;ar&#x301;a&#x301;nana (S&#x301;anmukham in South India or six-mouthed). Since he suckled from the breast of the star Krttika&#x301; with his main mouth, he later came to be known as Ka&#x301;rttika (<I>krittika&#x301;</I> + <I>an&#x301;</I>) or Ka&#x301;rttikeya (<I>krttika&#x301;</I> + <I>s&#x301;in&#x32D;eya</I>). He is known in South India as Muru&#x301;gam or Ba&#x301;lasubrahman&#x301;yam also. None of the stars knew his name, so all of them addressed him as Kuma&#x301;ra. Thus he also came to be known as Kuma&#x301;ra. The word <I>ka&#x301;rttika</I> is derived from the word <I>krttika&#x301;</I>. There are two <I>ta-</I>s in <I>krttika&#x301;</I>. It cannot be spelled with one <I>ta</I>. If it is, then the word becomes <I>krtika&#x301;</I>. So we must spell <I>ka&#x301;rttika</I> with two <I>ta-</I>s as well. Similarly we must spell <I>va&#x301;rttika</I>, <I></I>derived from <I>vrtta</I>, with two <I>ta-</I>s<I></I>, for if we spell it with one <I>ta</I> it becomes <I>vrta</I>, which has a different meaning.<!-- /block --></p>

The colloquial meaning of <I>kumbhiira</I> is &ldquo;man-eating crocodile&rdquo; (<I>Crocodile gangelitis</I>). Among the fish-eating crocodiles, those with long snouts eat in the same way. Hence <I>kumbhiira</I> also means &ldquo;alligator&rdquo;. In North India man-eating crocodiles are called <I>magarmaccha</I>. The word is derived from the word <I>makara</I>. At one time this crocodile was found in large numbers in the Ganges, so in the Puranas the mount of the goddess Gaun&#x32D;ga is a crocodile. Thus one name of the goddess Gaun&#x32D;ga is Makarava&#x301;hinii. In Bihar, especially in the Aun&#x32D;ga region, this type of crocodile is called <I>bon&#x32D;chha&#x301;</I>.

Even now it is occasionally said: <I>lokt&#x301;a&#x301; khub ghar&#x301;el</I> [that person is extremely clever].<!-- /block --></p>
