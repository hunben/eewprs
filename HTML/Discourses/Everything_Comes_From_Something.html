<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Everything cometh from something. Something cannot come from nothing. And the source of anything has an inherent link with its expression. The source may be cruder or subtler, but the inherent link must be there. The human body, the physical body, along with the nerve cells and nerve fibres, although there may be a psychic body and a psychic structure, themselves are something physical. Structures coming from something of quinquelemental origin have the mind, the psychic body, in them; the potentiality of the mind was in the physical structure. So-called quinquelemental entities have in them the potentiality of living minds, and that&#146;s why we can get living minds or microcosms from them. Had there been no mental potentiality in this quinquelemental universe, there would have been no possibility of the human mind. And this physical word, because of its having the possibility of mental expression, certainly had its origin in some entity in which there was immense psychic expression. So the microcosm had its origin in the quinquelemental entity, and the quinquelemental entity had its origin in the Macrocosm. Microcosms, as the name denotes, are many in number. There are innumerable microcosms. But the root, the source, is single. The Macrocosm is a singular Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now is this Macrocosm the Causal Matrix? No, it is not the Causal Matrix either. Because &ldquo;Macrocosm&rdquo; means a kind of movement, and what is movement? Movement means change of place. This bolster is here; I put it here; this is movement. That is, movement means change of place. And the Macrocosm, what is it? A wavy movement. Macrocosmic movement means wave, means vibrations. So for Macrocosmic expression or Macrocosmic movement there must be space. The spatial factor must be there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->And not only that &ndash; because there is movement, there must be some intellectual support behind it. So not only the spatial faculty or the spatial factor, but also the personal faculty is a necessity. And whenever there is action in the realm of physicality there must be the tempos eternal. There must be the time factor. So the Macrocosm that can function within the periphery of time, space and person cannot be the supreme cause, cannot be the Causal Matrix.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now [[this movement]] of the Macrocosm &ndash; because there is motivity and mobility there must be energy. Any form of energy &ndash; [[vital]] energy is also a form of energy. And [[how does]] that energy function?  It functions with the support of a cognitive faculty &ndash; with the support of cognition. Without the support of cognition there cannot be any movement, there cannot be any spatial, temporal or personal factor. [[So]] the Macrocosm cannot function. And the [[Macrocosm&#146;s]] existence is within the arena of these three fundamental relative factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So we see the Causal Matrix or the root cause is that Supreme Cognition. And that Supreme Cognition is called <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. So for each and every expression in this Universe of ours there is <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> as the Causal Matrix, as the supreme cause, as the Noumenal Entity. He is the Supreme Father. And within the scope of human expression of any living entity there are physical atoms, physical cells &ndash; and along with the physical cells, for movement and for actional expressions there must be the support of cognition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So that <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> that Supreme Father, is with each and every entity. No man, no expression, is ever alone in this world. He is always with you. Science says this, philosophy says this. And under no circumstances should a man suffer from a complex of helplessness or hopelessness or fear. You are the dignified children of <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> and He is always with you. You are never alone.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->He is with the Universe, that is, the entire Universe is His object. And not only that, He is with each and every expressed unit entity, with each and every individual also. That is, collectively He is attached to the world, to that expressed world; and singularly He is with you. You are never alone.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This thing has got two aspects. <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> the Supreme Father, is always with you and you are never alone. This has two aspects &ndash; one advantage and one disadvantage. The disadvantage is that He is always with you and therefore you cannot do anything secretly. You cannot do anything behind the curtain. And not only that, you cannot think anything secretly. Whatever you may be thinking, it will automatically be tape-recorded by Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->You cannot think secretly. If you say, &ldquo;You know, my friend, we will do this and that very secretly, and I think <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is over-busy with this Universe, perhaps He&#146;s not hearing what I said,&rdquo; this thing also will be heard. So that is the disadvantage;  nothing can be done secretly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And &ldquo;I won&#146;t take part in <i>kaos&#x301;ikii</i> today. Let me see what the first group does. After that I may also take part tomorrow&rdquo; &ndash; suppose you are thinking like this, it will be also heard by Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->And the main advantage is &ndash; the advantage is a very great advantage, and that is &ndash; you are never alone. And because He is with you, you are the strongest person in the universe. He is with you. You are never alone. It is the greatest advantage. There is a disadvantage, but the advantage is greater than the disadvantage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now the human side. What should you do, what should we do?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In the world, you see, in the first stage the creation moved from subtle to crude, from <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> to this crude world. That is, from subtle to crude. Movement was from subtle to crude. But in the phase of creating living beings, from protozoic cells to metazoic cells and so on and so forth, the movement is from crude to subtle. There came the animals of the human group, that is, proto-apes, those animals of the Pliocene or Miocene or Oligocene Age. From proto-apes there came apes, chimpanzees, gorillas, orang-utans, then primitive man. The movement is from crude to subtle. So the history says, that advancement is from crude to subtle. In the world of animacy movement is from crude to subtle, and it is the duty of each and every individual to encourage this movement from crude to subtle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->And at the base, the mental faculty, the peculiar faculty of the mind, is that it takes the form of its object. The mind takes the form of its object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Recently in Valencia I explained how a man is caught by a ghost. In daytime you may be caught by a ghost. Suppose there is outer-suggestion from some corner that there is a ghost in this house. You may be thinking, &ldquo;Ghost in this house, ghost &ndash; ghost.&rdquo; Automatically there will be an outer psychic projection of a certain portion of the ectoplasmic structure. The ectoplasmic structure will take the form of a ghost and you will see the ghost even in daytime. That ghost was of your creation. You created that ghost and you may be killed by that ghost. The mind takes the form of its object. Sometimes you yourself, that is, your very entity, may be converted into a ghost due to fear. &ldquo;Ghost, ghost, ghost &ndash; I am a ghost, I am a ghost.&rdquo; The man will be like a ghost. Perhaps you have seen it &ndash; the man himself behaves like a ghost, moves his head occasionally and says, &ldquo;I am a ghost.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->So the mind has this potentiality &ndash; it takes the form of its object. If you say, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner,&rdquo; you will be a sinner. Even if you are not a sinner but you always think, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner, I am a sinner,&rdquo; you will be a sinner because that sinning becomes your mental object. So you should never say, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner, I am a sinner.&rdquo; You should say, &ldquo;O Lord, I am your child, I am your son, I am your daughter. I have the birthright to sit on your lap. Please purify me.&rdquo; This is the proper approach. This is the proper approach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;My dress has become dirty. Please get my dress clean and take me on your lap.&rdquo; This should be the proper approach, and not, &ldquo;Oh, I am a sinner, I am a sinner, I am a sinner.&rdquo; Never say this, that I am a sinner. Do not be guided by this sin complex or a complex of hopelessness, or helplessness, or a complex of defeatism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->And in personal life you should move along the path of righteousness, towards the Supreme Goal, towards your Supreme Father. Nobody is unimportant, nobody is insignificant. You all belong to the noble family because your father is the Supreme Father. Nobody is unimportant, nobody is insignificant.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->And you should never think, &ldquo;Oh, because the priest didn&#146;t issue me any ticket for heaven, I won&#146;t be able to go to heaven.&rdquo; No, no, no, don&#146;t [[think like]] that. The priest has no right to issue you a ticket,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and who is going to issue you<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  a ticket to hell? No, no, no, your good actions will bring you closer to <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> and finally you will become one with Him by dint of your sadhana, by dint of your occult practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->And just to concentrate your mind during your occult practice, you must dance and sing <i>kiirtana,</i> because <i>kiirtana</i> is the best purifying agent. It purifies the mind, and its meaning is also very good. Its meaning is, &ldquo;O Father, I am to take your name and your name only.&rdquo; <i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;</i> means &ldquo;the nearest and dearest one&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->So my advice to you all, my direction to you all, my instruction to you all, is that you should move along the path of spirituality fearlessly, and you should remember that as <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> the  Supreme Father, is your Father, you cannot be an insignificant person. You must not suffer from any sort of inferiority complex. You are the glorious child of the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
