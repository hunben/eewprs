<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It has been said, Tyaja durjanasam&#x301;sargam&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;You should keep yourself aloof from the saun&#x32D;ga [or sam&#x301;sarga], society, of durjana. You should keep yourself aloof from durjanasaun&#x32D;ga, the society of durjanas.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What is durjana? Durjana means &ldquo;he who depraves the mind of others&rdquo;. Now here durjana is a relative term. A man, Mr. X, may be treated as durjana for Mr. Y, but may not be treated as durjana for Mr. Z. Suppose in Mr. X the good portion, the merit portion, is ten degrees, and the bad portion, the demerit portion, is twelve degrees. Then the resultant is two degrees in favour of demerit: ten degrees merit and twelve degrees demerit, so the resultant goes in favour of demerit. Two degrees demerit is the resultant. Now another man&#146;s merit portion is fifteen degrees, and demerit portion ten degrees. So the resultant five degrees goes in favour of merit. So he has five degrees of merit, and the first man has two degrees of demerit. So when that five-degree merit man comes in contact with that two-degree demerit man, the resultant will go in favour of that five-degree merit man. So that bad man will be modified, rectified. He will become good on coming in contact with that five-degree merit man. So for that five-degree merit man, that two-degree demerit man is not a durjana, because the latter cannot deprave him. But for a man who has just one degree of merit, that two-degree demerit man may deprave him &ndash; so for him that two-degree demerit man is a durjana. Clear?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So Tyaja durjanasam&#x301;sargam&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;You should keep yourself aloof from durjanas.&rdquo; Then the question arises<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> how these durjanas are to be rectified. If everybody says, &ldquo;I won&#146;t come in contact with durjanas,&rdquo; then how are these durjanas to be rectified? In such a case, you should not contact the person singularly; you along with two or three of your friends should contact him. And those friends should have resultant merit, not resultant demerit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Suppose you have resultant one degree merit, and a friend has resultant two degrees merit; then the total should be three degrees merit: your one degree and his two degrees. So with these three degrees of merit, you will contact that two-degree demerit person. That person will be rectified. So before your combined strength, that man no longer remains a durjana. But when you are singular, then that man is certainly a durjana for you. Clear?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So Tyaja durjanasam&#x301;sargam&#x301; bhaja sa&#x301;dhusama&#x301;gamam [&ldquo;Avoid association with the wicked and associate with the virtuous&rdquo;]. He who accelerates the speed of social progress, accelerates the speed of spiritual progress, of other people, is a sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Bhaja sa&#x301;dhusama&#x301;gamam [&ldquo;associate with the virtuous&rdquo;]. In ancient times, a commercial community [caste] used the title Sa&#x301;dhu. Sa&#x301;dhu &rarr; Sahu &rarr; Sao. Why? The intention was that by using this word sa&#x301;dhu, this word would work as a remembrancer, just to remind them, &ldquo;You will have to become a sa&#x301;dhu [virtuous person] and not a cheat. You are not to cheat the public &ndash; you are not to do black-marketeering or smuggling &ndash; you are a sa&#x301;dhu.&rdquo; So that commercial population used the title Sa&#x301;dhu. The changed form of Sa&#x301;dhu is Sahu or Sao. In north India you will see this title Sa&#x301;dhu, Sahu, Sao. So bhaja sa&#x301;dhusama&#x301;gamam &ndash; &ldquo;you should always keep yourself in the company of sa&#x301;dhu people, good people.

(In Kerala the calendar is according to the Indian solar system. In Uttar Pradesh it is according to the Indian lunar system. In Maharashtra, the Indian lunar system. In Bengal and Kashmir, the Indian solar system.) So as per the Indian solar system, the solar system of Indian astronomy, the period of twenty-four hours from one sun-rise to another sun-rise is called ahora&#x301;tra. From sun-rise to sun-set is called dinama&#x301;na, and from sun-set to sun-rise is called ra&#x301;trima&#x301;na. Dinama&#x301;na plus ra&#x301;trima&#x301;na is ahora&#x301;tra.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->[Out of the eighteen Puranas, two sayings of Vyasa are of the essence: pun&#x301;ya (virtue) means doing good to others, and pa&#x301;pa (sin) means doing harm to others.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When by your action or thought, by your physical activity or by your ectoplasmic activity, you are helping the collective progress of the society, you are accelerating the progress of the society, you are doing something that is pun&#x301;yam. And when you, by your mental or physical action, are retarding the collective progress, you are committing something that is pa&#x301;pa.&rdquo; Do you follow? To go against the collective interest is pa&#x301;pa. To accelerate the speed of collective progress is pun&#x301;yam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So pa&#x301;pa is a general term. But pa&#x301;pa has a special meaning also. What is the special meaning? (Now regarding the difference between pa&#x301;pa and pun&#x301;ya, I think it is quite clear.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Regarding the special meaning of pa&#x301;pa: Pa&#x301;pas are of two kinds. In the social order, there are certain vidhis and certain nis&#x301;edhas &ndash; certain dos and certain don&#146;ts. &ldquo;You should do this, you should do this, you should do this, you should do this&rdquo; &ndash; these are the dos of society. These dos are called vidhi in Sanskrit. And there are certain don&#146;ts &ndash; &ldquo;Don&#146;t steal, don&#146;t do this, don&#146;t do this, don&#146;t do this.&rdquo; These don&#146;ts are called nis&#x301;edha in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->What if you go against the vidhis, for example, &ldquo;feed the poor,&rdquo; &ldquo;serve the ailing humanity&rdquo; (these are all vidhis &ndash; &ldquo;Do this&rdquo; &ndash; that is, positive orders<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->)? For example, if you are to serve ailing persons but you are not serving ailing persons, then you are going against a vidhi. To go against a vidhi is called pratyava&#x301;ya. If you are not serving a man in distress, then you are committing pratyava&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Pratyava&#x301;ya is a particular nature of pa&#x301;pa. And if you do the don&#146;ts &ndash; for example, &ldquo;Do not steal&rdquo; is a don&#146;t, it is a nis&#x301;edha, but you are stealing, you are doing the don&#146;ts &ndash; then you are committing pa&#x301;pa. This is the special meaning of pa&#x301;pa. Clear?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya: two kinds of pa&#x301;pa. The special nature of pa&#x301;pa [is] not to follow the code of nis&#x301;edha, not to adhere to the code of nis&#x301;edha.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->I think this word is also known here &ndash; pa&#x301;taka. And pa&#x301;taka is of three kinds: one is pa&#x301;taka, simple pa&#x301;taka; another is atipa&#x301;taka; and the third one is maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->To commit an ordinary offence is pa&#x301;taka. If one can atone for what one did, that is pa&#x301;taka. Suppose a man steals. Suppose five rupees were stolen. It is pa&#x301;taka, because after that, if you so desire, you can repay that amount and say, &ldquo;Oh, please excuse me.&rdquo; It has been atoned for. Pra&#x301;yashcitta &ndash; &ldquo;atonement&rdquo;. &ldquo;Please excuse me, take your money.&rdquo; This is called pa&#x301;taka, simple pa&#x301;taka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->But suppose you have cut [off] the hand of an innocent person, in that case is there any scope for atonement? &ldquo;Oh, take back your hand&rdquo; &ndash; ? No, no, you cannot atone for what you did. It is an unatonable offence. This unatonable type of offence is called atipa&#x301;taka. Now, pa&#x301;taka is atonable, and as soon as atonement is effected, you are a free man. But in the case of atipa&#x301;taka, the sha&#x301;stras [scriptures] say that he who commits it must sacrifice his life for the entire society, to serve society. He has no right to live in the society. He is to serve society from outside: this is the atonement. This is the prescribed atonement for an atipa&#x301;takii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Then the third one is maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka. This maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka is also atipa&#x301;taka, but the difference is that its effect is of recurring nature. Suppose a corrupt businessman uses papaya seeds [in the black pepper] &ndash; he invents a [new kind] of adulteration &ndash; papaya seeds. Now other businessmen will learn it from him, and the process will go on in recurring nature. So the particular businessman who invented this art is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii. That is, its effect will be of recurring nature. It will go on forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The sha&#x301;stra says that the proper atonement for such a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka is &ndash; what? The first thing is that he has got no right to live in society. He must sacrifice his everything for society and serve society from outside. But that is not enough: that is the atonement for an atipa&#x301;takii. So what should he do? He should invent something new, and that invention should have a recurring nature of effect. Its effect should be of recurring nature. Because his misdeed had its effect of recurring nature, his good deed should also have an effect of recurring nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->So this last one is maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In Bangalore I narrated one story. The story is from the Cha&#x301;ya&#x301; Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a: In the last stage of the fight between Rama and Ravana, when Ravana was being defeated &ndash; Ravana was a bhakta [devotee] of Shiva &ndash; he was requesting Shiva, &ldquo;Oh Lord, save me, I am dying. I am your bhakta, save me, save me.&rdquo; But Shiva was not helping him. Then Pa&#x301;rvatii asked Shiva, &ldquo;Ravana is our bhakta, is our devotee, please help him.&rdquo; Then Shiva said, &ldquo;No, I can&#146;t help him, I want to [help him but I can&#146;t].&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii said, &ldquo;Why? You can do anything, anything and everything, why can&#146;t you help him?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;He is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Then Pa&#x301;rvatii said, &ldquo;No, no, he is an atipa&#x301;taka. He kidnapped Sita. It is an act of atipa&#x301;taka, not maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Shiva said, &ldquo;No, he is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii asked, &ldquo;Oh, why?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Then Shiva said, &ldquo;To kidnap Sita was an act of maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka. But he didn&#146;t kidnap Sita as a thief or as a robber. He went in disguise. He went in the form of a sa&#x301;dhu. That is, he created a very bad precedent, and henceforward no kulabadhu, no lady, will pay credence to what a sannya&#x301;sii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> says. They may think: &lsquo;He may be like Ravana; he may also be a thief &ndash; like Ravana.&rsquo; So he has set a very, very bad example, and it will have a recurring effect on each and every lady of society. So Ravana is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii, his action is of recurring effect. So I can&#146;t help him &ndash; his only atonement is if he leaves society and sacrifices his all for society.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->So pa&#x301;taka, atipa&#x301;taka, maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka &ndash; all these three items come within the scope of pa&#x301;pa; and pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya are two varieties [of pa&#x301;pa in the general sense]. Not to follow vidhi is pratyava&#x301;ya; and not to follow nis&#x301;edha is pa&#x301;pa. This is all I have to say.<!-- /block --></p>
