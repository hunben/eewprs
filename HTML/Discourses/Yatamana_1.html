<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->It is said that the path of human progress is chiefly divided into four stages: yatama&#x301;na, vyatireka, ekendriya and vashiika&#x301;ra (the four stages in the development of a spiritual personality). These stages are applicable to the three strata of human life: the material, psychic and spiritual worlds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yatama&#x301;na&rdquo; is derived from the Sam&#x301;skrta root verb &ldquo;yata&rdquo; + suffix &ldquo;sha&#x301;nac&rdquo; and means &ldquo;one who is endeavouring&rdquo; (the effort is still continuing). In a previous Dharma Maha Cakra (a spiritual congregation) I spoke at length about yatama&#x301;na. Now is yatama&#x301;na only a mental effort, or only a physical effort, or does it emanate from a realm higher than the mind? When people perform actions consciously, those actions must have the sanction of the mind. But even if an action is sanctified by the mind, it does not necessarily mean that it has also been sanctioned by the self. Moreover, if the mind performs an action according to the guidelines of a noble philosophy, even then it does not necessarily mean that the psychic sanction is supported by the Self (A&#x301;tman).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There are many philosophies which tend to crudify the human mind, and make people violent and inconsiderate. They make people believe that they are God&#146;s favourite children, whereas the rest of humanity are cursed. Although these views have philosophical sanction, they do not enjoy the sanction of the A&#x301;tman.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is only one case when Parama Purus&#x301;a sanctions mental thought. What is that? It is when the human mind is dedicated to the welfare of the entire humanity without any discrimination, when the sole intention is to promote universal well-being. When the human mind, motivated by such sentiments, engages itself in action through the body, only that action can be treated as real yatama&#x301;na. Other endeavours should not be defined as such.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Sometimes it also happens that the body acts without the prior approval of the mind: a person frightened by a robber, for example. People do not always act voluntarily, but sometimes out of fear, just like the slaves in olden days. A slave would labour hard at the command of his or her master. Such actions are purely limited to the physical sphere. They are actions no doubt, but they do not enjoy the support of the mind, and naturally do not have the support of A&#x301;tman or Parama Purus&#x301;a. Such deeds do not bring any welfare to the slave, and thus cannot be categorized as yatama&#x301;na. So according to true spirituality, human beings should not be reduced to slavery.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->One may say that slavery has been totally abolished from today&#146;s world. It may be true in theory, but a handful of people who deserve no better name than &ldquo;intellectual satans&rdquo; have been enslaving people by propagating defective philosophies. In a way, these exploited people are no better than slaves for they have lost their intellect. Even when one tries to enlighten them with logical arguments, they refuse to listen. Are they any better than slaves? Intellectually they are certainly slaves, and hence in the material world also they are slaves. Thus, any action on their part will not be included in the category of yatama&#x301;na because it will never lead to well-being. The first stage of human progress yatama&#x301;na is not promoted by their activities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What should be done to bring about progress in the yatama&#x301;na stage? One should learn the proper philosophy from a competent person. In order to judge what is a proper philosophy and what is a pseudo-philosophy, one should see how far the philosophy goes in treating the entire humanity as a singular entity and promoting its unity. Only that philosophy which inculcates universal sentiments is acceptable to human beings, for it alone reflects the spirit of yatama&#x301;na. Other philosophies will spoil the human treasures resulting in humans, even though they are endowed with eyes, feet, hands, etc., degenerating to the level of animality, or even below that. Animals quarrel among themselves or with others to procure food, but these crude people, even though they do not need to procure food for their survival, misuse their authority to destroy or subjugate innocent humans being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The people of today must understand this basic fact and remain vigilant against the detrimental actions of the intellectual satans and blood-sucking exploiters. The people of today must move ahead while fighting against the two enemies &ndash; the bloodsuckers who exploit in the economic sphere, and the intellectual satans who not only exploit human beings but bring them down to the level of animality. I request the present human race to continue their endless fight on these two fronts. They should remember that on both these fronts they are fighting against enemies who, being guided by dogma, have no logic in their method of exploitation. Though they are exploiting people in the socio-economic, socio-intellectual and spiritual spheres, once their conscience is aroused against dogma, their exploitation will automatically cease. The gigantic demons of exploitation will vanish in a flash.<!-- /block --></p>
