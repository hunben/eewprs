<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  Strictly speaking the Alsatian is more closely related to the wolf group than the dog group. Even then, there are four major differences between wolves and Alsatians. Alsatians have a stronger sense of smell. Wolves are much more aggressive than Alsatians and may kill an animal even when they are not hungry. Wolves eat a lot more than Alsatians &ndash; it is said a wolf can eat two and a half times its own body weight in one sitting. After such a feast it normally remains as inert as a corpse for several days. Finally, an Alsatian is more easily tamed than a wolf and is very faithful to its master. <br> Dogs evolved as a result of cross breeding between wolves and jackals. The evolutionary history of the Alsatian has yet to be determined. Wolves are mentioned in all the ancient languages of the world, and in some languages even have a few synonyms, but there is no mention of Alsatians. The Sam&#x301;skrta term for wolf is vrkavya&#x301;ghra. In the Vedic age wolves were killed for their flesh and wolf lungs were quite a delicacy. In both Sam&#x301;skrta and Bengali literature references are made to the voracity of wolves. Bhima, the second Pandava brother, was also called Vikodara because he was always as hungry as a wolf. There are a number of amusing stories about Bhima&#146;s insatiable appetite. <br> You might have read in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata that when the five pandava brothers were in exile they handed over the alms they collected to Kunti, their mother. Kunti divided the food into two: half for Bhima and herself and half for the other four brothers. One day Bhima announced he wanted to fast like his mother and brothers. &ldquo;If my brothers can fast for a day, so can I,&rdquo; Bhima told his mother. Kunti advised him, &ldquo;Don&#146;t try to fast. You&#146;ll find it rather troublesome.&rdquo; &ldquo;But mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;life is lived to overcome troubles. I, the second Pandava, never hesitate to accept a challenge. Please allow me to fast, mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you can try,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&#146;ll keep your breakfast ready for you just in case.&rdquo; <br> Early in the morning of the fasting day Bhima checked the time. &ldquo;Mother, it&#146;s already six o&#146;clock and I haven&#146;t asked for breakfast.&rdquo; Fifteen minutes later he said, &ldquo;It&#146;s 6:15 mother, and I&#146;m still not hungry.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I&#146;ve prepared your breakfast anyway,&rdquo; she informed him. &ldquo;I&#146;ll boil your milk now.&rdquo; At 6:30 Bhima said, &ldquo;I feel a little hungry, mother, but I won&#146;t eat anything. I promise I won&#146;t change my mind.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall I serve breakfast?&rdquo; his mother asked. &ldquo;No thank you. Let me wait a little more.&rdquo; Finally, at 6:45 Bhima looked at his wrist watch and said, &ldquo;I can&#146;t wait any longer, mother. I&#146;m as hungry as a wolf.&rdquo; &ldquo;Just wait a few minutes while I bring your milk to the boil,&rdquo; said his mother. Thereafter, it is said, Bhima ate 300 kilos of puffed rice soaked in warm milk. What a fasting day he had! <br> That particular day when Bhima made a noble attempt to fast is still remembered as Bhaemii eka&#x301;dashii (Bhima&#146;s fasting day) to this day.</p>
