<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This word comes from the word a&#x301;tma&#x301; [soul, or consciousness]. The Sanskrit word a&#x301;tma&#x301; in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, specifically in the case of Occidental Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii, becomes atta&#x301; (atta&#x301; hi atta&#x301;nam&#x301; na&#x301;th). In the case of Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii it becomes atta&#x301;n. From that comes the modern Bengali a&#x301;ntta&#x301;. A&#x301;nt is a shortened form of a&#x301;ntta&#x301;. A&#x301;nte gha&#x301; means &ldquo;a deep offense to the inner self&rdquo;. (Se a&#x301;nte gha&#x301; diye katha&#x301; bale. [&ldquo;His words offend deeply.&rdquo;])<!-- /block --></p>

A&#x301;ntke ot&#x301;ha&#x301; means &ldquo;that condition in which the a&#x301;tma&#x301; is also disturbed&rdquo;, that is, when such an agitation occurs in the mental sphere that it also produces agitation in the self or spirit. A&#x301;taunkita haoya&#x301; and a&#x301;ntke ot&#x301;ha&#x301; are not the same thing. A&#x301;taunkita haoya&#x301; can go on for days or months together while a&#x301;ntke ot&#x301;ha&#x301; is purely temporary.<!-- /block --></p>

Europe&#146;s Latin family of languages contains a large number of words descended from Vedic: Petar, pear, father, etc., have all come from the Vedic word pitr. Pita&#x301; means &ldquo;he who rears&rdquo;, or &ldquo;he who protects&rdquo;. From the word pita&#x301; comes the old Turkish word ita&#x301; &ndash; in medieval Turkish ata&#x301;/a&#x301;ta&#x301;. Kemal Pasha did a lot for the people of Turkey so he was called Kemal Atat&#252;rk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The fruit which we know by the name of a&#x301;ta&#x301; [custard-apple] is not native to this country. The Portuguese brought it from South America about 450 years ago. They called it a&#x301;tta&#x301; or a&#x301;ttis in their Iberian language. They planted custard-apple trees in their Bandel Church garden (it is the oldest church in Bandel). Afterwards it spread to the rest of India in a very short time with the help of birds. Today you find custard-apple trees everywhere in India, in the forests, jungles, and fields, and on the paths and river-banks. The custard-apple tree does not like too much rain; it grows well in same laterite soil that the papaya grows so well in.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The nona&#x301; fruit [a variety of custard-apple] also originated in South America; its real name is anona murika&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;. The Bengali word nona&#x301; has come from the word anona. Neither a&#x301;ta&#x301; nor nona&#x301; has any name in old Sanskrit. In modern Sanskrit a&#x301;ta&#x301; is called sita&#x301;phal<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  and nona&#x301; is called ra&#x301;mphal. In a large part of northern and central India a&#x301;ta&#x301; is called sita&#x301;phal and nona&#x301; is called ra&#x301;mphal. The word a&#x301;ta&#x301; is prevalent throughout eastern India. In Urdu the fruit is called shariifa&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Nona&#x301;, unlike a&#x301;ta&#x301;, prefers black or loamy soil and more rain, and its fruit is not as well liked. Nona&#x301; also has distinct eyes, as a&#x301;ta&#x301; does, but its scent is not as tempting.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The original Farsi word is iitr. Iitr means &ldquo;essence&rdquo;. If this essence has food value then the word ru&#x301;h is used in Farsi, and in the case of a pleasing scent iitr is used. The word a&#x301;tar came into use due to distortion and confusion, but in subsequent times the word gained acceptance through usage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Koh means &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;. The mountain of iitr or sweet scent is known as kohiitr (koh + i + iitr). This kohiitr is the name of a well-known variety of mango from Murshidabad. We mistakenly say kohitur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Iitr was first discovered by Empress Nu&#x301;rja&#x301;ha&#x301;n.

<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I think it is important to mention here that the diamond which is known as kohinu&#x301;r [Koh-i-Noor] was the locket [pendant] on Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s jewelled necklace. After many battles and campaigns it came into the hands of Nadir Shah, and after that, Punjabkesharii Ranjit Singh. After him, Jhindan got it, and finally it came into the hands of the East India Company. They had it cut and polished in Holland and then had it set in the British Royal Crown, although some people are of the opinion that it was not set in the crown but was preserved in a different place. Whatever may be, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s kaostu&#x301;bhaman&#x301;i and the kohinu&#x301;r are one and the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now let us come back to the actual subject. By mixing rose essence with water, Nu&#x301;rja&#x301;ha&#x301;n invented the process of preparing rosewater. It is said that she used to bathe daily in rosewater. By mixing rose essence with sandalwood oil she invented rose iitr. Later she started to prepare other types of iitr by using flowers other than rose.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Nu&#x301;rja&#x301;ha&#x301;n was a Persian lady. This uncommonly beautiful woman was sold by her father in India. Her real name was Meher-Un-Nisa&#x301;. During Akbar&#146;s time, Burdwan<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> was the capital of Bengal. It was during this time that she was married to the governor (or subedar) of Bengal, Sher Afgan. Selim, the son of Akbar&#146;s Rajput wife (later known as Ja&#x301;ha&#x301;ngiir after ascending the throne), put pressure on Sher Afgan to surrender Meher-Un-Nisa&#x301; to him but Sher Afgan did not agree and so there was a fierce battle in Burdwan between Sher Afgan and the Mughal army.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Sher Afgan was slain in the battle (his grave is still in Burdwan city) and Ja&#x301;ha&#x301;ngiir forcibly abducted Meher-Un-Nisa&#x301; by force. At first Meher-Un-Nisa&#x301; refused to marry her husband&#146;s killer, Ja&#x301;ha&#x301;ngiir, but later, under the pressure of circumstance, she agreed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->After her marriage to Ja&#x301;ha&#x301;ngiir her new name became Nu&#x301;rja&#x301;ha&#x301;n. Ja&#x301;ha&#x301;ngiir was an unstable drunkard; India was actually ruled by Nu&#x301;rja&#x301;ha&#x301;n. Both Ra&#x301;jiya&#x301; Begum during Pathan rule and Nu&#x301;rja&#x301;ha&#x301;n during Mughal rule, became famous as especially skilled female administrators. But the name of Nu&#x301;rja&#x301;ha&#x301;n is more famous for iitr. Nu&#x301;rja&#x301;ha&#x301;n was also a highly skilled poet<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in the Farsi language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Speaking about iitr reminds me of an experience from the old days. I was staying in an average hotel in the city of Gaya doing research on the culture and civilization of Magadha. At the time I was working in the hilly wilds around Gaya searching for the deep, hidden similarities between the pre-Buddhist Magadha civilization and the ancient civilization of Rarh. I had found a striking similarity between the two and had never before felt such excitement and enthusiasm in my research. In terms of my river valley research I was concentrating then on the Naerain&#x32D;jana&#x301;-Mohaniya&#x301;-Phalgu River basin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The hotel was small but neat, clean and orderly, as if someone&#146;s house had been turned into a hotel. I arrived there about six in the evening, took a good look at the bedroom and the bathroom, and then, after finishing some important work, I retired early, tired after the day&#146;s labours. Sleep came on quickly. Ah yes, before sleeping I noticed a white stone iitr-pot in one corner of the dressing table, a Gayan artifact of ancient Ma&#x301;gadhii culture. I could tell that the iitr-pot had not been used in a long time because it did not smell at all of iitr.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Sometime later, I&#146;m not sure exactly what time it was, I was awakened by a strange sensation just above the ankle. There was a dim light in the room &ndash; the rest of the lights I had turned off before going to bed. What did I see in that dim light when I looked down but what looked like a pair of hands catching me just above the ankles! I freed my legs with a jerk and called out in Magahii: &ldquo;Who are you? Why have you come into my room like this? This is not good.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The two hands drew back. Then I saw a shadowy figure slowly move back into the dark part of the room and lose itself behind the dressing table. I quickly got up, turned on the lights and thoroughly searched the bedroom and the bathroom as well as the closet but no one was there. The door was still locked from the inside as I had left it, which meant that nobody had come in from outside. Then what was it? Whose hands was it with their indistinct touch? And those hands had left the scent of jasmine essence!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Keeping the light on I lay down and called out mentally: &ldquo;Hey, bodiless one, have courage, come out once again. I never do anyone any harm, so there is no possibility of you being harmed by me. Come and tell me your untold story.&rdquo; But nothing or no one came out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Then suddenly I see&#8230; what is this? Astonishing! Smoke is rising out of that abandoned iitr-pot. But how? And that smoke was filled with the scent of jasmine. I was dumbfounded. Gradually the smoke began to twist into coils. They became denser and denser, but what was behind those coils of smoke could not be seen or understood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->After a short time the smoke began to thin and what did I see behind the coils but a young man of good breeding, perhaps twenty-four or twenty-five years old. He looked at me and greeted me politely with folded hands, stood silently for a while, then softly made his way towards the door. He opened the locked door and quietly went outside. I found this all very mysterious.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->He went down the stairs from the first floor to the ground floor but his footsteps were completely silent. He was walking but no sound was coming. I also followed silently behind him, determined not to leave him until I found out who he was&#8230; for what reason he had entered my room at one in the morning&#8230; what it was he wanted to say.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The main entry door to the hotel was locked, but he opened it and went straight out into the street. I was following right behind him but he never turned back to look. The city was dead quiet. Not even a dog was awake and about. He walked on and so did I. Not far from the hotel was the Phalgu River, and after a short time he reached the river and stopped. He stood there silently for a short time, then turned around to look at me and said in Magahii: &ldquo;I have given you trouble&#8230; quite a lot of trouble&#8230; please don&#146;t mind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What trouble have you given me?&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I followed you of my own accord. I wanted to see what your destination would be.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I entered and left your room abruptly and came here for no other reason than that you would follow behind me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I have come to hear what you have to say,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Tell me briefly whatever it is you want to say.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->He looked around once carefully in all directions and then began. &ldquo;At the moment there is no one here besides the two of us; in these surroundings my words will make a stronger impression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am a child of Magadha. History has never done full justice to this land of Magadha. Every dust particle of its villages and markets is mixed with the gold-dust of its heritage but no one has properly recognized it or recorded it. The little that has been written about it has been written by foreign historians &ndash; some out of sport, some out of merriment. The shrivelled Phalgu that you see today was not always in this condition. The hills of southern Magadha were once covered with dense forests. Beyond the mountains, from the north to the south, the Ma&#x301;gadhii river valley was also covered with thick forests. Even a portion of the plains and the banks of the river were also forested. This heavily-forested Magadha used to enjoy an abundance of rainfall and thus the rivers were full of water twelve months out of the year. Because of the abundance of forests there was no problem of soil erosion, and because the forests contained the water there was very little severe flooding. Seeing the Magadha of today, it is difficult to imagine the lush green Magadha that once was.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You are certainly aware of the fact that Magadha was once a vast empire. At the time of Ashoka and Samudragupta it was probably the largest empire in the world but nothing lasts forever. Those glorious days came to an end and a cimmerian darkness descended over Magadha. The most difficult days in Magadha&#146;s history drew nigh during the reign of Skandagupta.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tell me a little more, in brief.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->He went on. &ldquo;Skandagupta was one in a string of unworthy sovereigns to occupy the throne of Magadha. At that time the empire had disintegrated and the kingdom was on the point of collapse, confined to its ancient borders. To the north was the Ganges and north of that Mithila, which was at one time part of the empire of Magadha and which Rarh&#146;s King Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka had wrested from the hands of Magadha. To the east were the Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a and Cakravarttii mountains. In the eastern region of the Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a Mountains was Angadesh and the Magadha Empire. King Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka of Rarh also took possession of these areas. In the eastern regions of the Cakravarttii Mountains was the land of Rarh, which came under Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka&#146;s direct rule. The southeast corner&#146;s border was Sametashikhar. After that was ancient Rarh, which the king of Rarh had conquered. The southern portion of the Ramgarh Mountains to the south and the western portion of the Shon&#x301;a River to the west were first controlled by the king of Kashii, Citrasena. After his fall, this entire area was controlled by the royal house of Tha&#x301;niishvar. Magadha did not have a direct struggle with Prabha&#x301;karavarddhana but rather with Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana and Hars&#x301;avarddhana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; I&#146;ve gone on quite a bit about the borders of Magadha at that time. I hope you didn&#146;t mind. Without it the picture would not be complete.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I am enjoying listening.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Magadha had lost all its previous power and glory,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;King Skandagupta was a weak-minded, vacillating drunkard. He did very little of what we normally consider great deeds; rather he led Magadha to the brink of destruction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Of course, nothing in this world is completely one-sided. No matter how much historians blame him, Skandagupta did some good also. This city of Gaya, which we are standing in the heart of, was designed by him. He founded Sanskrit schools and training centres in various parts of Magadha, such as Dva&#x301;dashavarddhaka&#x301; (Va&#x301;ravigha), Brhaddhika&#x301; (Var&#x301;ahiya&#x301;), Madhukamadha&#x301; (Moka&#x301;ma&#x301;), Urubilva (Araba&#x301;l), Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a (Gidhaor&#x301;), and so forth, which endured for quite some time. He was the first to introduce the use of the Ma&#x301;gadhii language of that time (Western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii) in government service alongside Sanskrit. Still, he watched the Magadha Empire crumble in front of his eyes. He died watching an entire empire fall apart due to his own incompetence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At that time there was a fierce struggle going on for the capture of Magadha between King Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana of the royal house of Tha&#x301;niisvar and Rarh&#146;s King Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka. Tha&#x301;nisvara&#146;s kings used to repeatedly move their capital from place to place, but Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka did not. Rather, he would enlarge his capital according to necessity and befitting the times. He founded Pain&#x32D;cagaorh [the five ancient parts of Bengal] after capturing Anga and Mithila&#x301; and then North Bengal (Barendra), Central Bengal (Samatat&#x301;) and East Bengal (Vaun&#x32D;ga). That is, during his time Bengal was divided into five political divisions: (1) Rarh, (2) Mithila&#x301;, (3) Samatat&#x301;, (4) Barendra, and (5) Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k (East Bengal or Shriibhu&#x301;mi or Cat&#x301;t&#x301;al was then included in Bengal) &ndash; but he kept his capital at Karn&#x301;asuvarn&#x301;a.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There were several reasons for the war between Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana and Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka.

Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka&#146;s main aims were to take possession of Angabhu&#x301;mi and to root out the Buddhist religion and culture from Magadha. Although Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana put on a show of liberality he was really narrow-minded. In actual fact, he never treated the Shaivite religion as equal to the Buddhist religion. Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka was a staunch follower of Shaivism and completely against Buddhism. He openly declared that as long as one drop of blood remained in his body, he would not allow Buddhism the right to enter either Rarh nor Pain&#x32D;cagaor&#x301;a,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  or Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>

There was no other region in all of India which was as fertile and as affluent at that time. Thus everyone had their greedy eyes set on Ambabhu&#x301;mi. Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana and Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka were no exceptions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Their style of attack, however, differed.

You are certainly aware of the fact that, according to social and religious regulations, idols can no longer be used for worship once there is any defect or deformation in them. So Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka had the different statues of Buddhist gods and goddesses deformed with a chisel. Today you will find that most of the ancient Buddhist religious statues still in existence have had their noses broken off.<!-- /block --></p>

Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka not only extirpated that ancient Bodhi Tree, he also dug a deep ditch around it afterwards and filled it with honey so that the ants would come and eat whatever remained of the roots while they devoured the honey; as a result that Bodhi Tree could not grow back again.<!-- /block --></p>

Thus there were no history books in either Sanskrit or any of the Pra&#x301;krta languages. The real beginning of the teaching and study of history came during the time of British rule.

It would be a mistake to say that neither one wanted to see the other; neither one of them could even stand hearing the other&#146;s name. Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka, in an unexpected development, captured Ka&#x301;nyakubja, slew its king, Cakra&#x301;yu&#x301;dha (in some people&#146;s opinion, Inra&#x301;yudha), the husband of Ra&#x301;jyavarddana&#146;s sister, Ra&#x301;jyashrii, and installed his own nephew from Rarh, Keshariivijaya, on the throne, giving him the name Indra&#x301;yu&#x301;dha (some say Cakra&#x301;yu&#x301;dha). Ra&#x301;jyashrii returned to her father&#146;s house and instigated her brothers, Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana and Hars&#x301;avarddhana, to turn against Rarh. As a result, Magadha, which lay between those two lands, had to suffer many outrages. This is our Magadha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Mag means &lsquo;he who moves about independently&rsquo;, that is, one who does not follow the Vedic injunctions. Dha means &lsquo;follower&rsquo;. The land which follows the anti-Vedic, Buddhist doctrine is magadha. The Sanskrit dha is transformed into ha in Pra&#x301;krta. Thus magadha becomes magaha &ndash; the name of the language is magahii. Following the Buddhist era, the language of all of eastern India was this Magahii Pra&#x301;krta. Lord Buddha, The Enlightened, made his appearence in this land.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Our Magadha is situated in the northeast corner of the prehistoric Gondwanaland. Since Gondwanaland is the oldest land on earth, it is also the original home of human beings, the birthplace of human civilization. Rarh is in eastern Gondwanaland. In the prehistoric era, human beings came from Rarh to make their home in Magadha and they brought with them the current of their civilization and culture. Just as the geography of Magadha slopes downwards from north to south and the rivers flow from north to south, similarly the culture and civilization flowed from south to north. Thus the people of Rarh and Magadha are fundamentally one. Like the people of Rarh, the common people of Magadha are dark-skinned. Magadha borders Rarh along its south-east border. The skin and bodily structure of the people of Rarh and Magadha are identical. There is also a noticeable similarity between their languages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Earlier I told you that in those days Magadha was full of forests and had abundant rainfall so there was no need of irrigation. The pre-Aryan people of Magadha used to believe that their land received rainfall due to the grace of the sun-god. Thus they used to worship the sun-god according to their ancient local customs, once during the autumn paddy harvest and again during the spring sun harvest (chaetii harvest). This sun-worship of pre-Aryan Magadha is known today as chat&#x301; pu&#x301;ja&#x301;. This worship was not performed according to Aryan rules. It was a completely local Magadha practice. The people of Magadha did not bow their heads and submissively accept any of the Aryan practices. For that reason the Aryans called the land magadha. They were afraid of Magadha and used to pay it respect. Thus, to satisfy their grudge and vent their spite, they declared Magadha an unholy land. They said that if a man died there he would not go to heaven and they made efforts to forcibly impose their language, culture and civilization on Magadha. It is up to the historians and social scientists to consider just how successful they were in their efforts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Magadha did not accept the Aryan civilization. In ancient Magadha there was no custom of racial or caste divisions. The caste system in Magadha came much later due to the influence of the Aryans. Even after the advent of the caste system, the Kraoin&#x32D;cadviipii and Magadha&#146;s Shrotriya Brahmins did not like the severity of caste divisions. For this reason the Kraoin&#x32D;cadviipii and Magadha&#146;s Shrotriya Brahmins were not recognized by the Brahmins of northern India.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;It was an unbelievable and unforgettable happening. Nearly two and a half thousand years ago two great spiritual leaders appeared on the earth at about the same time on the soil of Magadha to sow there the seeds of their spiritual teachings. One was Vardhama&#x301;na Maha&#x301;viira and the other was Gaotama Buddha. Gaotama Buddha was the son of the feudal king of the central terai, Shuddhodana (Malla dynasty, Sha&#x301;kya branch of the Ks&#x301;atriyas), and his wife Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;devii. He practised austerities for a long time in Magadha in the areas of the Bara&#x301;bar, Brahmayoni and Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301; mountains. His Guru in Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Sain&#x32D;jaya (Nawada district), was also from Magadha. Although what is called avidya in his philosophy is not the same as pradha&#x301;na or prakrti in Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya, there is some similarity between the Buddha&#146;s concept of avidya and the Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya concept of pradha&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The Buddha attained enlightenment in the village of Urubilva, located on the bank of the river Naerain&#x32D;jana&#x301; (Urubilva is called Bodhgaya today). That Suja&#x301;ta&#x301; who fed him ks&#x301;iira [rice pudding] and saved his life at that moment when the period of his radiant austerities had brought him to the point of death, was Buddha&#146;s cousin and the wife of a certain feudal king of Magadha. One should remember here that at that time the Naerain&#x32D;jana&#x301; river coming from the south joined the Mohanika&#x301; (Mohaniya&#x301;) river near Urubilva and flowed together as the Phalgu river from there, later joining the Ganges near Modhukamadha&#x301; (Moka&#x301;ma&#x301;). About 2000 years ago the two rivers underwent some physical changes due to a huge earthquake and for that reason the Phalgu river of today is much smaller than it was.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At any rate the prince of the Shakyas, Gaotama, attained enlightenment on Magadha soil. Many say that Buddha first introduced the Buddhist dharmacakra [wheel of dharma] and initiated his first disciple near Benares in the Is&#x301;ipattana Migada&#x301;ba (Rs&#x301;ipattana deer grove, alias Sa&#x301;rangana&#x301;th or Sa&#x301;rana&#x301;th). Although this is partially correct, it is not the complete truth. It is certainly true that he introduced the dharmacakra in the Is&#x301;ipattana deer grove and that his five disciples, Kaon&#x301;d&#x301;inya (Kaon&#x301;dilya), Bappa (Vapra), Bhaddiiya (Bhadreya), Moha&#x301;na&#x301;ma, and Ashsha&#x301;ji (Ashvajit), were present there. But he gave his first initiations on Magadha soil &ndash; to Sa&#x301;riputta, the son of Ru&#x301;pasa&#x301;ri, and Maha&#x301;moggallan Arhan, the son of Maha&#x301;moggalii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;In those days Magadha&#146;s matriarchal system still retained some influence alongside the patriarchal system. So Buddha&#146;s first two disciples in Magadha were known by their mother&#146;s names. The merchant that the city of Pa&#x301;t&#x301;aliiputra was named after due to his philanthropy also carried his mother&#146;s name in accordance with the matriarchal system. The name of the merchant&#146;s mother was Pa&#x301;t&#x301;alii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Varddhama&#x301;n Maha&#x301;viira was born in Vaesha&#x301;lii in a Vaeshya family. His father&#146;s name was Siddha&#x301;rtha and his mother&#146;s name was Trishala&#x301;. Like the Buddha, however, he did not propagate his teachings first in his native land but came to Magadha to do so.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One does not have to go far to find the reason why both of them selected Magadha as the proper place for their work. Magadha was not bound hand and foot with the bonds of the Vedic religion. Their natural liberal mentality gushed forth in all aspects of their lives. Buddha was successful in spreading his spiritual teachings there because they were based more on logic than on superstition and belief. Of course, the spirit of revolt against conventionality was present in Varddhanama&#x301;na Maha&#x301;viira&#146;s teachings also, but in the opinion of the Magahii people his doctrine of ahim&#x301;sa&#x301; [non-violence] did not accord well with reality so they were not able to accept it easily. Of course, some people did accept it, but others considered him an unrealistic theoretician and tried to bring him down to earth by using occult powers. Thus he felt the need to go elsewhere to propagate his new religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At that time the most famous city for progressive thinking, education and culture was A&#x301;stikanagar (Atthinagar), the capital of Rarh. Varddhama&#x301;n Maha&#x301;viira went there and stayed nearly eight years. There he managed to fit his doctrine of ahim&#x301;sa&#x301; into a somewhat realistic framework. Some prominent merchants of A&#x301;stikanagar accepted his doctrine and they renamed the city Varddhama&#x301;n [Burdwan] after him. Thus it is said that the Jain religion was first established in Rarh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Thereafter he took the road back to Magadha from Burdwan and stopped for a short time in a small village named Sva&#x301;miistha&#x301;na (Sva&#x301;miistha&#x301;n &rarr; Sa&#x301;inchittha&#x301;n &rarr; Sa&#x301;inchithiincha&#x301; &rarr; Sainthiya&#x301;) on the banks of the Mayu&#x301;ra&#x301;ks&#x301;ii River to preach his gospels.

At one time Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta was used not only in eastern India, but in central India as well among the educated community for the exchange of thoughts. Educated people used to show the same zeal for learning Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta as they showed for learning Sanskrit. The structure of the Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta language is both straighforward and easy. The grammar is also not complex. Both Maha&#x301;viira and Buddha gave their teachings in the Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta of that time which many people today call Pa&#x301;li. A great deal of literature was composed in the Pa&#x301;li language and its successor Occidental Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii. Magadha also had its own script. Inscriptions in that ancient Ma&#x301;gadhii script can still be found in certain places in Bodhgaya.

He built a large army through whatever means he had at his disposal and took Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana by surprise when his adversary was temporarily absent from his capital, taking possession of the city. After this he waged a fierce war against Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana in which Ra&#x301;jyavarddhana was defeated and slain.

According to the scriptures, the elderly, women, the sick, the disabled, conscientious dissenters, under-age men, and emissaries must not be killed.

In their hearts the people remained Shaivites but on the outside they became Buddhists. Later on, during the time of Shankaracharya, a small number of Rarh&#146;s Jains and large numbers of Buddhists throughout Bengal accepted the Puranic religion. This may have been because in Rarh there was some similarity between the traditions of the Puranic religion and the Digambar Jain doctrine of that time.

At that time Magadha&#146;s last general, Agnimitra, and his younger brother, Chandraketu, were directing its final efforts to resist Hars&#x301;avarddhana and a great war ensued. In the battle of Bara&#x301;bar Hill, near the city of Gaya, Magadha&#146;s army was utterly routed and destroyed. Even then Agnimitra did not accept defeat.

<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root tap is &ldquo;to heat&rdquo;, &ldquo;to go through hardship&rdquo;. Thus tapa means &ldquo;to welcome hardship in order to accomplish something for the attainment of welfare (shreya)&rdquo;. The word tapasya&#x301; comes from this word tapah (tapas). Tap + ac gives us tapa. That which brings heat is called a&#x301;tapa. If we add lyut&#x301; to the verbal root tap we get the word tapana which means &ldquo;to heat&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which heats&rdquo;. If we add kta to tap we get tapta [hot]. Before the use of the Farsi word garam became prevalent in Bengali, the word tapta was used more. When I was a young boy I noticed that the old people of Burdwan district used to use the word tapta rather than garam (bha&#x301;t ektu tapta a&#x301;che, ektu va&#x301;ta&#x301;s kare dii [the rice is a little hot, let me blow on it a little]). Just as the Farsi word garam was not used much at that time, the Turkish word hava&#x301; (which is now spelled ha&#x301;oya&#x301;) was also not used much.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->Sunlight brings warmth, thus sunlight or raodra is called a&#x301;tapa. The etymological meaning of the word raodra is &ldquo;fierceness&rdquo; or &ldquo;violence&rdquo;. From this word raodra we get the word raoda&#x301; in Bihar and roda in Bengali and Angika&#x301;.

<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->The rice that we get by parboiling the paddy, then drying it and husking it with a husking pedal is called seddha [boiled] rice because the paddy is boiled in order to prepare it. In Bihar it is called us&#x301;na&#x301; ca&#x301;ur. The rice we get by parboiling the paddy and drying it is called mur&#x301;i rice. And that rice which is not boiled at all but which is washed and then left in the sun to dry is called a&#x301;tapa ca&#x301;l or a&#x301;lo ca&#x301;l because it has been dried in a&#x301;tapa and not boiled. In the same way you can have both seddha and a&#x301;tapa varieties of beaten rice. Widows did not eat rice outside their home because it was cooked. For the same reason seddha rice and seddha beaten rice was not used for worship.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->Because the paddy for making seddha rice is boiled, it is somewhat malleable. Thus it breaks less at the time of husking. Because the a&#x301;tap paddy is relatively less malleable it breaks more during husking and leaves more broken bits of grain. In the olden days in Bengal the broken bits of grain from a&#x301;tapa rice were also sold in the market at a good rate. People used to like to use these broken bits for cooking rice pudding.<!-- /block --></p>
