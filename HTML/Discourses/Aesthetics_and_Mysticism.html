<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Dharma should be understood properly by all. And that&#146;s why I said that there should be an immediate Tamil rendering [of the author&#146;s previous discourse] &ndash; there should be renderings in all people&#146;s languages. Let people understand it properly and do accordingly. Last night I said that above the &ndash; &ldquo;beyond the&rdquo;, not &ldquo;above&rdquo; &ndash; beyond the periphery of material mobility, there is the world of aesthetics; and above it, beyond it, there is the world of mystics. The world of mystics and the world of aesthetics are for human beings. And each and every human being should get a proper chance, should get adequate chance, to move into those worlds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->So you boys, you girls, you intellectuals, this should be your duty &ndash; so that common men&#146;s worldly burdens are minimized, so that they may get ample chance to move into higher worlds and utilize their energy for higher and subtler pursuits. The entire aesthetics is the only charming entity in human life. Had there been no aesthetics, human life would have been just like a desert. A slight touch of aesthetics in this anxiety-[ridden] life of human beings is just like an oasis in a desert. Art, architecture, literature, music &ndash; everything &ndash; had its origin, had its starting point &ndash; where? Just at the common point of aesthetics and mystics. That&#146;s why in ancient India, both in A&#x301;ryavarta music and Daks&#x301;inatya music (commonly known as Karnataka music), music was devotional. Music used to get its inspiration from mysticism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->You should revive all these subtler expressions of humanity. You should remember that human life is not like a flower, it is like a collection of so many flowers, and that collection of so many flowers is the charm of human life. Human life is not like a flower; it is like a beautiful garden of so many flowers. Let all those flowers develop, and let the final movement of all those expressions of charm and fascination be goaded unto Parama Purus&#x301;a. Whatever I do, whatever we do, whatever we will be doing, just to please the supreme charmer, just to please the supreme source, just to please the Supreme Progenitor &ndash; there cannot be any other aim of human life.<!-- /block --></p>
