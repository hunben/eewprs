<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In this Universe of ours, there is nothing non-causal. Do you know the meaning of non-causal? Non-causal means &ldquo;having no cause&rdquo;. In hoary past, there was a great philosopher named Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da. He said in his theory &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;va&#x301;t ka&#x301;rya&#x301;bha&#x301;vah<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a means cause, Abha&#x301;va means want. Where there is no cause, there cannot be any effect. He was a scientist, and he invented the Atomic Theory. He was Mahars&#x301;i Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da. Long before Dalton&#146;s Atomic Theory, about 1500 years ago, 1000 years after Buddha, he said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;va&#x301;t ka&#x301;rya&#x301;bha&#x301;vah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Where there is no cause, there cannot be any effect&rdquo;, and it was he who established the fact. Everything in this Universe of ours is causal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, here we are. Say a few years ago, none of you knew that Baba is on this Earth. None of you knew that Baba loves you. But Baba was there, and Baba loved you, though you were not acquainted with Baba. Is it not the fact? And I think, now some of you feel that Baba loves you, at least a little. Don&#146;t I love you a wee bit? (Baba makes a pinch measure with His fingers). And I also realize that you love Me very much. (Baba makes a grand measure with his arms spread wide). You do not know, but it may or may not be a fact. Rather, it may be a fact that I knew you. Nothing is non-causal in the Universe. You came in close contact with Me, I came in close contact with you. This is also not non-causal. Certainly there is some cause behind this actual happening. The cause may or may not be known to you. There are so many people in this world. Why did you, boys and girls, come in close contact with Me, but not others? Certainly there is some cause. And perhaps this cause or seed germinated in long past, say, 5000 or 10,000 years ago. The seed was there and it germinated, and finally, when its sprout was out, you came in contact with Me. What is sprout? The white portion of the tree that first comes out of the seed. So, when nothing is non-causal, your coming in close contact with Me is also not non-causal. There is some cause, you do not know. It may be that in hoary past you were also in close contact with Me. It may or may not be on this Earth, on this planet. It may be on some other planet that you were known to Me. It may be that on that planet, we sat like this and decided that, &ldquo;Let us go to that small planet known as Earth, and there we may do some work.&rdquo; And, just to fulfil the pledge of ours, we have come here. So nothing is non-causal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->This Cause and Effect Theory is called Ka&#x301;rya-Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Tattva. In Sanskrit, Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a means cause. Tattva means theory. Those who are theoreticians are called Ta&#x301;ttvika in Ananda Marga, because Tattva is theory. The range, the jurisdiction of this Ka&#x301;rya-Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Tattva is within the scope of mind &ndash; within the scope of collective microcosm, and also Macrocosm, Separately for Macrocosm and collective microcosm. You should know the difference.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->A particular man, a particular living being has got the ectoplasmic structure of microcosm, but the mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a is bigger than collective microcosm, because the entire crude world of quinquelemental factors is also a part of Macrocosm, a part of the mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This Cause and Effect Theory functions within the scope of collective microcosm. And above and beyond the range of this collective microcosm, there may be Cause and Effect Theory within the scope of Macrocosm as well. But as we can not bring Macrocosm within the scope of unit minds, rather it can not be tethered by logic and reasoning, that&#146;s why we may say that this Cause and Effect Theory functioning within the range of microcosm. The starting point of mind is zenith point of Cause and Effect Theory functioning within the range of microcosm. The zenith existence is beyond the periphery of this theory. It depends on the sweet will of Parama Purus&#x301;a. And human Cause and Effect Theory can not go beyond that zenith point.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->If one wants to know something more beyond the scope of that zenith point, one is to coincide one&#146;s own existential nucleus with that final zenith point. When one will be one with the Macrocosm, one will know how sweet the Macrocosm is. And that, one can do by dint of one&#146;s devotional Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; without devotion is meaningless, a waste of time. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; with devotion means maximum utilization of human existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So you may or may not know the logic. You may or may not know the philosophy. You may or may not know the spirit of Cause and Effect Theory. But if you have got devotion, if you have got love for the Macrocosm, you will get everything. And the secret of Parama Purus&#x301;a is known only to Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is why, if you want to know Parama Purus&#x301;a, you won&#146;t be able to catch Him with the help of Cause and Effect Theory. You will have to become one with Him. There is no other alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
