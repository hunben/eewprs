The next day, perhaps, you gave one to a friend and by doing so you felt a certain pleasure. May be the following day, during a meeting, you extolled the qualities of <I>rasama&#x301;la&#x301;i</I> and that also gave you a certain pleasure. In other words, in different ways, large or small, you are getting pleasure and only pleasure. Who is giving this pleasure? <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. It is not enough that He illumines all things, He also pleases everyone, through different ways and means, under different conditions. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> gives pleasure in accordance with one&#146;s wishes.<!-- /block --></p>

A certain businessman sees the place and thinks: &ldquo;Ah, here would be a good place to start a flower business or a sweets business. People will buy them and offer them in worship.&rdquo; Another person thinks, &ldquo;Here I can pass my old age economically.&rdquo; He stays there. Thieves think that a lot of people come here to take bath in the Ganges. There will be a lot of opportunity to pick their pockets. A thief goes there thinking that. People feel pleasure in different ways. And an old lady quarrels with her daughter-in-law and says, &ldquo;I will go away to Kashi [Benares.]&rdquo; Thus <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> pleases human beings in different ways. Hence, <I>ra</I> is used in the sense of <I>rain&#x32D;jayati ima&#x301;n loka&#x301;n ityarthe</I> [in the sense of &ldquo;dyeing the mind of every living being of this world&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>

One who has intellect is <I>dhiima&#x301;n</I>. One whose <I>dhii</I> is very good is <I>sudhii</I>. And <I>dhii</I> also means &ldquo;unit mind&rdquo;. This unit mind in a state without intellect is also called <I>dhii</I>. <I>Dhiyo</I> also means &ldquo;intellect&rdquo;, &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;. Since it is <I>Vayam</I>, that is, <I></I>&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our intellect&rdquo;, then it becomes <I>dhiya</I> in plural. <I>Dhii, dhiyam, dhiya.

<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><I>Dhiyo jo nah pracodaya&#x301;t</I>. <I>Nah</I> is a Vedic word that means &ldquo;our&rdquo;. In Sanskrit it is <I>asma&#x301;kam</I> and in Vedic Sanskrit <I>nah</I>. Since it is an old portion of the <I>Rgveda, asma&#x301;kam</I> is not used here but rather <I>nah</I>. The full form of the word <I>nah</I> is <I>nas</I>. <I>Na-s</I>, this <I>nas</I> is pronounced as <I>nah</I>. You can pronounce <I>na</I> with this <I>visarga</I> [aspirated ending, transliterated by &ldquo;h&rdquo;]; you can also pronounce <I>na</I> by adding a <I>hasanta</I> [consonantal ending]; and you can also pronounce it <I>nas</I>. Since the Vedic language originally came from the Russian language, there is a close relationship between the two. The Russian <I>nas</I> and our <I>nas</I> or <I>nah</I> are somewhat the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->What is the prayer in this? &ldquo;I am meditating on that <I>Savita&#x301;</I>, or Father of the seven strata &ndash; <I>bhu&#x301;, bhuvah, svah</I>, etc. &ndash; on effulgence worthy of adoration.&rdquo; Why are we meditating? We are meditating so that He may guide our intellect and understanding along the path of righteousness. Let our intellect not be degraded, because if human beings&#146; intellect is all right then everything is all right. But if a person&#146;s intellect becomes degraded, then no matter how many qualities one has, everything becomes spoiled. So, as long as a person does not get the path of sadhana, he or she should pray to god for one thing or the other. This prayer is called Vedic initiation. The younger ones learn this Vedic initiation from their elders; in other words, [they learn] &ldquo;Tell me how should I pray to God.&rdquo; Thereafter, when one gets the grace of God, one receives Tantric initiation. <I>Mantras</I> like <I>is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra</I> constitute part of Tantric <I></I> initiation. When God is satisfied as a result of Vedic initiation then the desire for salvation arises. It is said &ndash; <I>Muktya&#x301;ka&#x301;un&#x32D;ks&#x301;aya&#x301; sadguru pra&#x301;ptih</I> [&ldquo;When the desire for liberation arises, one gets the Sadguru&rdquo;]. When the desire for liberation awakens, then by the grace of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> a person obtains Tantric initiation. Vedic initiation is only necessary as long as a person does not receive Tantric initiation. There is no need, nor will there be any need, for Vedic initiation, after a person gets Tantric initiation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The name of this <I>Savitr</I> mantra is <I>Savitr Rk</I>. It is not the &ldquo;Ga&#x301;yattrii Mantra&rdquo; because <I>ga&#x301;yattrii</I> is the name of the metre. According to the rules of this metre, each line has eight metrical units. The convention of the Vedas is that each <I>shloka</I> is composed by a certain sage (<I>rs&#x301;i</I>), and each <I>shloka</I> is written in a certain metre. What does each mantra <I></I>contain? In each mantra <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is addressed by a certain name. The sage who composed this <I>mantra</I>, which is the sixty-second <I>rk</I> of the tenth <I>sukta</I>, third <I>man&#x301;d&#x301;ala</I> of the <I>Rgveda</I>, was not able to write it. I have already said that written script did not exist then. The name of the sage who composed this mantra was <I>Vishva&#x301;mitra</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->We must keep in mind that Sanskrit grammar and Vedic grammar are not the same. Actually during the Vedic era, there was no grammar. By the time written script was used for the Vedic language, the Sanskrit era had arrived. It was then that Pa&#x301;n&#x301;ini wrote his grammar. During the Vedic era there was no grammar. It was only a spoken language, so when looked at from grammatical point of view, it has many errors. For example, the word <I>Vishva&#x301;mitra</I> is grammatically incorrect. According to grammar, it should be <I>Vishvamitra</I>. However the sage&#146;s name was <I>Vishva&#x301;mitra</I>. So, the letter <I>a&#x301;</I> had to be retained even though the meaning becomes reversed &ndash; he who is <I>amitra</I> of the universe, meaning &ldquo;not friend&rdquo;. Still his name was <I>Vishva&#x301;mitra</I>. So, the name of the sage was <I>Vishva&#x301;mitra</I>, and the name of the metre is <I>ga&#x301;yattrii</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->I mentioned that the <I>mantra</I> has three lines and each line has eight metrical units. And what is the name of the deity? How is <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> addressed in this <I>mantra</I>? He is addressed as <I>Savita&#x301;</I>. <I>Tatsaviturvaren&#x301;yam&#x301; &ndash; Savita&#x301;</I> is the deity of this mantra. <I></I>That is why the <I></I>name of the <I>Rk</I> is <I>Savitr Rk</I>. No one should say <I>ga&#x301;yattrii mantra</I> because that name is incorrect. <I>Ga&#x301;yattrii</I> is the name of the metre.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Now, according to the old rule, girls did not have the right to hear this mantra. If they heard it they would have molten lead poured into their ears. It was even considered a sin to recite it where a girl could hear. What would happen if a girl heard it? It would be a sin. If <I></I>it is a sin for a girl to hear the mantra then I am also committing a sin by reciting it. The point is that I am saying it then you [girls] are hearing it. I am taking on your sin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->There is another mistake that many people commit. While reciting the mantra, they do not repeat the <I>on&#x32D;m&#x301;</I> in the middle. An <I>on&#x32D;m&#x301;</I> is recited before the mantra [<I>On&#x32D;m&#x301; bhu&#x301;r bhubah svah</I>] and another <I>on&#x32D;m&#x301;</I> at the end [<I>pracodaya&#x301;t on&#x32D;m&#x301;</I>]. And another <I>on&#x32D;m&#x301;</I> is recited which comes from the original or actual <I>mantra</I> [<I>on&#x32D;m&#x301; tatsaviturvaren&#x301;yam</I>], that is, <I>on&#x32D;m</I> is repeated three times in this mantra. However, many people mistakenly do not repeat the second <I>on&#x32D;m</I>. It should be repeated. If not, the pronunciation is incorrect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->For those who have attained Tantric initiation, who have gotten <I>is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra</I>, there is no longer any need for this <I>mantra</I> because, it has been said in this mantra &ndash; &ldquo;Show me the way.&rdquo; In Tantric initiation the path has been attained, so there is no more question of this. If you ask someone to show you Dharmatalla Street [in Kolkata] and he shows you, then now your task is to walk. Are you going to approach this person again and ask him to show you Dharmatalla Street? Of course, now the name Dharmatalla has been changed. Actually, it was Dharmat&#x301;ha&#x301;kur Tala&#x301;, meaning that there was a temple there, thus Dharmatala&#x301;. There is also a <I></I>Dharmatala&#x301;, Dharmat&#x301;ha&#x301;kur <I></I>in Salkia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->During the Middle Ages, nearly everyone in Bengal was Buddhist. However the king at that time was Hindu. So he did not allow people to worship Buddha. Instead of taking the Buddha&#146;s name, they used second refuge (<I>sharan&#x301;a</I>) of the three refuges. The three refuges are &ndash; <I>Buddham&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; gaccha&#x301;mi, Dhammam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; gaccha&#x301;mi, Sam&#x301;gham&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; gaccha&#x301;mi</I> [I take refuge in the Buddha, in the Dharma, and in the Sam&#x301;gha]. They were afraid of taking the name of Buddha, so they took the name of Dharma. Thus, they used to call the Buddha <I>Dhamma</I>. They called him <I>Dhammat&#x301;ha&#x301;kur</I>. They did not say Dharma because Dharma is Sanskrit. In the <I>Pra&#x301;krta</I> language, it is Dhamma, Dhamma T&#x301;ha&#x301;kur. So, the Dharmatala in Salkia and the Dharmatalla in Kolkata came from the previous name Dhammat&#x301;ha&#x301;kur. That is what happened. Thus, there is no need of prayer for those who have already come to the path of sadhana because <I>Pra&#x301;rthana&#x301;rcana&#x301; ma&#x301;traeva bhrama mu&#x301;lam<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I> [&ldquo;Prayer and ritualistic worship are but a source of confusion&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
