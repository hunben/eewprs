<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Why is the book Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata so named? The Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata is an educative history, and the name of the author of this book is Veda Vyasa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->First I will say something about the author. Veda Vyasa was known as Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Dvaepayana Vyasa at first. He was born in a fisherman&#146;s family. They were living just on the patch of land where the Ganges and the Yamuna join near Prayaga. The area through which the Yamuna flows is covered with black soil, due to which the Yamuna water looks somewhat black. The soil of the Ganges is yellowish, hence the water of the Ganges is yellowish. The soil of the patch of land where Veda Vyasa was born was blackish (krs&#x301;n&#x301;a). Due to the black soil, that patch of land was known as Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Dviipa. The boy who was born in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Dviipa was thus named Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Dvaepayana (&ldquo;one who lives in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Dviipa&rdquo;). Because his family title was Vyasa, he was known as Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Dvaepayana Vyasa. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Dvaepayana Vyasa was a man of letters. He wrote very many books. He was a great man.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The Vedas had become almost extinct then. The Indians of that time were not conversant with the Vedas till the advent of Veda Vyasa about 3500 years ago. It was Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Dvaepayana Vyasa who properly edited the Vedas and reintroduced them to the people at large. Therefore he became popularly known as &ldquo;Veda Vyasa.&rdquo; So the author of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Dvaepayana Vyasa or &ldquo;Veda Vyasa.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata is itiha&#x301;sa (educative history). According to the then Indian system books were classified in four divisions &ndash; ka&#x301;vya, pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, itikatha&#x301; and itiha&#x301;sa. The subject matter of kavya might not be real, but the way of expression is lucid and beautiful. &ldquo;Va&#x301;kyam&#x301; rasa&#x301;tmakam&#x301; ka&#x301;vyam&rdquo; &ndash; stories which were narrated in a graceful language were known as &ldquo;ka&#x301;vya.&rdquo; Kalidasa wrote ka&#x301;vya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Next is pura&#x301;n&#x301;a (mythology). In it the stories told are not real but have educative value. Therefore it has its value in society. For instance, the Ramayana is a purana. Shrii Vyasa wrote eighteen pura&#x301;n&#x301;as to educate the people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;dasha pura&#x301;n&#x301;es&#x301;u Vya&#x301;sasya vacanadvayam; Paropaka&#x301;rah pun&#x301;ya&#x301;ya pa&#x301;pa&#x301;ya parapiid&#x301;an&#x301;am.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->By writing different stories in the pura&#x301;n&#x301;as, Shrii Vyasa intended to educate the masses. To make people at large understand that by doing good to others a person acquires virtues (pun&#x301;ya) and by harming others incurs vices (pa&#x301;pa), Shrii Vyasa wrote eighteen pura&#x301;n&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Next is itikatha&#x301;. In English this is known as &ldquo;history&rdquo;. Itikatha&#x301; is a chronology of events. In itikatha&#x301; there is simply a collection of different happenings. In it the author bothers little about the educative value of the affairs. People at large derive little benefit from knowing the dates of birth and death of different kings. But when and where the society is moving, what turn it has taken at a particular time and to which path it will take, is all indicated in itikatha&#x301;. In other words, what the condition of society was in the past and what it is at present is all brought home by itikatha&#x301;. Itikatha&#x301; is also known as &ldquo;pura&#x301;katha&#x301;&rdquo;, &ldquo;itivrtta&rdquo;, &ldquo;pura&#x301;vrtta,&rdquo; etc., in Sam&#x301;skrta. It is known as &ldquo;history&rdquo; in English.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Fourth is itiha&#x301;sa. &ldquo;Iti hasati ityarthe itiha&#x301;sa.&rdquo; The meaning of the root of &ldquo;hasati&rdquo; is &ldquo;laugh.&rdquo; That means, it is illuminating (projjvala). That portion of the itikatha&#x301; which has educative value can alone be known as itiha&#x301;sa. In schools and colleges the students read Indian itikatha&#x301; and not itiha&#x301;sa. All history is not itiha&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Dharmartha-ka&#x301;ma-moks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; niitiva&#x301;kyasamanvitam; Pura&#x301;vrttakatha&#x301;yuktam itiha&#x301;sa pracaks&#x301;yate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Itiha&#x301;sa is that itikatha&#x301; from which a man gets the fruits of caturvarga &ndash; dharma, artha, ka&#x301;ma and moks&#x301;a &ndash; as well as a system of the dos and don&#146;ts of niiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->What is ka&#x301;ma? The desire for mundane objects &ndash; name, fame, wealth, etc., is ka&#x301;ma. The desire to make efforts to get food and clothing is also included in the scope of ka&#x301;ma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The next varga is artha. Artha is that which relieves pain. The pain of hunger is relieved when one buys something and eats it. Hence money is the cause of the removal of the pain of hunger. Therefore money is known as &ldquo;artha.&rdquo; Similar is the case in the psychic sphere. Suppose you are mentally disturbed when you are not able to know the meaning of something. The moment you know it your mental trouble is gone. Meaning therefore is known as &ldquo;artha.&rdquo; So in the psychic field also, &ldquo;artha&rdquo; means that which removes pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The next varga is dharma. &ldquo;Dharma&rdquo; means psycho-spiritual development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The fourth varga is moks&#x301;a. As long as a person is away from Parama&#x301;tman there will be some trouble or other whether one is righteous or unrighteous. Pain is finally removed only by obtaining moks&#146;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Varga&rdquo; means &ldquo;class&rdquo; there are four classes. The first is physical; the second physico-psychic, the third psycho-spiritual, and the fourth, spiritual. Hence the itikatha which begets the fruits of the four vargas and has the dos and don&#146;ts of life in it is known as &ldquo;itiha&#x301;sa.&rdquo; So the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata is an itiha&#x301;sa, the author of which is Krsna Dvaepayana Vyasa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now let us know why this book is named Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata. When the Aryans came from Central Asia to India, they came first to the Saptanada Desha (the Land of Seven Rivers), which later on was known as Pain&#x32D;canada Desha or Punjab, (the Land of Five Rivers). Next they entered the Kashmir area. There they saw pebbles which were bluish in colour, looking like jambu (a fruit that resembles an olive except for the blue colour). These pebbles were then known as &ldquo;jambushila&#x301;&rdquo; (pebbles looking like jambu). The country in which, jambushila&#x301; was found was named Jambu Dviipa. At present Jambu is known as Jammu. Jambu Dviipa at that time meant the area stretching from Afghanistan to the Philippines, all of Southeast Asia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->There was and still is a fertile land within Jambu Dviipa where food was easily available. The time that the people of that area had left over from work they utilized in psychic and spiritual pursuits. They practised every possible means of psychic development. The patch of land which easily yielded grains was known as Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a. The word &ldquo;bha&#x301;rata&rdquo; is derived from the Sam&#x301;skrta root &ldquo;bhar&rdquo; plus the root &ldquo;tan&rdquo;. When the root &ldquo;bhar&rdquo; suffixed by &ldquo;al&rdquo; is combined with the root &ldquo;tan&rdquo; suffixed by &ldquo;d&#x301;a&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;bha&#x301;rata&rdquo; is derived. And the word &ldquo;vars&#x301;a&rdquo; means &ldquo;country&rdquo; (it can also mean &ldquo;year&rdquo; or &ldquo;rainy season&rdquo;). &ldquo;Bhar&rdquo; means that which nourishes, and &ldquo;tan&rdquo; means that which causes to expand. Food here was easily available to the Aryans as compared to Central Asia, and the extra time at their disposal was utilized in physical, psychic and spiritual expansion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tan&rdquo; means &ldquo;to expand.&rdquo; The body of a child goes on expanding up to the age of thirty-nine, so the body during this period is &ldquo;tanu&rdquo; &ndash; that which expands. After thirty-nine the body is known as &ldquo;shariira&rdquo; which means that whose nature is to decay. The body decays externally or internally after the thirty-ninth year of one&#146;s age. The body of a child is known as &ldquo;tanu&rdquo; and that of an adult is known as &ldquo;shariira.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Therefore this patch of land was known as Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a. Almost 7000 years ago Lord Sadashiva was born. During His period people were most undeveloped. The then people were partly knowledgeable about medicine, art, architecture and education, but nothing did they do systematically. People never shared their knowledge with others, because they thought that their prestige would be lessened. Thus so many methods of medical treatment and so many crafts were gradually lost due to long periods of disuse. In other words, there was no system for all human endeavours. For song, dance, music, medicine and all other endeavours He gave a system. That means the crude-natured people came under a system, under a pattern, through the efforts of Lord Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Then came Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a about 3500 years ago, when the war of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata took place. People&#146;s individual qualities then had not taken a collective shape. People did not know the art of living collectively. The individual qualities that lacked a sense of collectivity were given such a sense by Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Suppose a person has a faculty for medicine. If one&#146;s medical knowledge is channelled and utilized in a medical college, this will bring about the collective shaping of one&#146;s individual attribute. This applies to all faculties. Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a wanted to bring about a social synthesis, the seed of which was sown by Lord Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->It was seen at the time of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a that though Amga, Bamga, Kalimga, Magadha, Saorastra and other kingdoms (Amga Bamga Kalimgesu Saorastra Magadhesu ca) were within Bharatavarsa, they fought among themselves because they had no collective sense. Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a thought that if He combined all there would be collective spirit in the true sense of the term. Then alone all human faculties would get expanded. He tried to make people understand, but they did not understand, because there was no collective spirit in them as was the case in ancient England.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In ancient England there were so many countries, named Sussex, Essex, Yorkshire, etc. Along with these there were Wales and Scotland. At last all combined and made Great Britain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Similar were Amga, Bamga, Kalimga, Saorastra and Magadha in India. Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a wanted to combine them and make Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata (Great India). To synthesize them all Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was born, and to help in the mission of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a came the Pain&#x32D;ca Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avas, Bhisma, Vidura and the others. Therefore the book is known as Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata (Great India).<!-- /block --></p>
