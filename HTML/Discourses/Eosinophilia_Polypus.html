<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->A remedy<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Take a little camphor and some <i>ma&#x301;skala&#x301;i</i> beans and boil them mildly at a low temperature in pure mustard oil in a thin brass pot. In case a brass pot is not available, use an iron, copper or silver pot. Once this preparation has been made, put that boiled oil and those <i>ma&#x301;skala&#x301;i</i> beans in a glass jar, corking it firmly and tightly, so that it can be preserved for up to a month if necessary. Be particular to use a good, solid cork, for if the cork is not firm and solid, the camphor may evaporate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now prepare a leaf-packet of a green banyan leaf and pour that prepared mixture into it. Now light a mustard oil lamp and hold that leaf-packet over its flame. When the packet becomes somewhat scorched and its contents start dripping, catch the mixture in a pot. Now keep some warm water ready at hand. Dip your little finger in that oil, push the finger inside each nostril as deep as possible, and rub. Having rubbed both the nostrils well in that fashion, take warm water (as warm as you can endure), and draw it in through the nostrils and expel it through the mouth. Repeat the use of the water, and again repeat, for a total of three times through both nostrils.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Having used the water three times, use your little finger again to rub the oil inside the nostrils, and repeat the drawing of the water, as hot as bearable, three times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Repeat the alternation of oil and water for a total of six times, in two instalments of three times each. While expelling the water through the mouth, insert your middle finger inside your throat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now holding a mouthful of warm water, splash your eyes repeatedly with the same warm water from the pot. Thereafter your morning <i>vya&#x301;paka shaoca</i><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> should be completed as usual.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->When suffering from <i>na&#x301;sa&#x301;shula,</i> or if the nose, throat and lungs are all weakened at the same time, this remedy will also yield a good result.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In <i>na&#x301;sa&#x301;shula</i> extra flesh grows inside the nose, throat or lungs. People who use snuff suffer mostly from this disease. It is true that patients do not die of this disease, but they endure much agony from it. When the disease becomes chronic, the patient becomes nasal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Those who are accustomed to smoke <i>vir&#x301;i</i> and cigarettes suffer most from cancer. With cancer also this remedy yields results. But before using this medicine, patients of either disease should strictly give up the habits of smoking <i>vir&#x301;i</i> and cigarettes, taking snuff, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
