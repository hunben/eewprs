<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Doctors are mainly concerned with negative microvita. Each and every day microvita &ndash; more negative microvita &ndash;  bring so many ailments from other planets and celestial bodies to Earth. They come through different inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the course of their study, doctors should try to find out the coincidence between the characteristics of metazoic cells and multicellular protozoic cells in both the physical and psychic realms.  This will greatly help doctors in finding out the medicines for many diseases. Moreover, doctors are not acquainted with many diseases that are yet to come to Earth. If doctors can find out the factuality of negative microvita, they can prevent attacks of negative microvita before they occur &ndash; before they reach the planet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Disease is caused by negative microvita. When people take allopathic medicine to cure a disease, the medicine disturbs the ecological balance of the body because more negative microvita get concentrated at the point of the disease. Allopathic medicines do not kill diseases &ndash; diseases die by their own natural death. Although the medicine may check the disease, the increased concentration of negative microvita can overcome the effect of the medicine.  In fact, the increased concentration of negative microvita caused by allopathic medicines creates many new types of diseases, and due to this, two or three new diseases are presently being created every decade.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So what is the solution to this problem? Our approach should be two fold &ndash; external and internal. Externally we should take medicines to check diseases, but internally we should perform spiritual practices to increase the concentration of positive microvita and thereby kill the negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Today medical science has reached a threshold point. People know the specific medicines exist for certain diseases, so if they get sick they take these patented medicines. Consequently the role of doctors has diminished. Now medical science is at the top of a declining slope, and except for surgery it has lost its importance for ordinary people. Only microvita theory can overcome this situation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In homoeopathy also  the need for doctors is not so great because all the medicines are mentioned in books. If people feel the need for some medicine they can easily prescribe for themselves. Homoeopathy should embrace surgery, and if this is done it will be good for the all-round welfare of the people.<!-- /block --></p>
