<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ka is the first consonant of the Sanskrit alphabet. All the languages of the world which are descended from Sanskrit use ka as their first consonant. All those languages which are adopted-descendants, that is, those which are not directly descended from Sanskrit, but whose vocabulary is full of Sanskrit, also use ka as their first consonant. Both Sanskrit and the world&#146;s phonetic science are arranged in such a way that if ka is used as the first consonant it is very convenient, and if not, then quite troublesome. If ka is not the first consonant, then not only practical difficulties arise but also grammatical difficulties. It becomes impossible to achieve a well-knit system regarding grammatical aphorisms, rules and decisions if ka is not the first consonant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The special facility that results in the use of Roman script due to the lack of consonant and vowel diphthongs, that is, due to the system of consonants not being written improperly side by side, can be lost if the arrangement of letters does not follow Sanskrit practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Sanskrit does not have its own script. In the first half of the Vedic era, Sanskrit literature was composed without script. The invention of script was in the latter half of the Vedic era, but despite the lack of script in the first half of the Vedic era, alphabetic classification existed, and thus when script was invented it was also arranged according to the existing practice of alphabetic classification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit language was first written in the Bra&#x301;hmii and Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii scripts, which were approximately seven thousand years old. Both these scripts were arranged according to Sanskrit phonetics. In subsequent times, the scripts that arose chiefly from Bra&#x301;hmii, and secondarily from Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii, that is, India&#146;s original Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script (the original mother of today&#146;s Kashmiirii, D&#x301;ogrii and Punjabi Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; scripts), Na&#x301;rada (the mother of today&#146;s Gujarati, Na&#x301;grii, Devana&#x301;grii, Mor&#x301;ii, Curuva&#x301;lii, etc. scripts) and Kut&#x301;iila&#x301; (Bengali) script, are arranged according to those phonetic rules.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Sanskrit does not have its own script. Wherever it was written or studied or taught, it used to use whatever script was prevalent in that country at that time. Keeping practicality in mind, if Sanskrit is written nowadays in Roman script, its phonetic practice should be according to its own alphabetic system, that is, the letters should be arranged ka, kha, ga, gha, una&#8230; in this way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Nowadays several languages descended from Sanskrit are written in Arabic script (Farsi script) for various historical reasons. Those languages are: Sindhii, which is descended from Saendhavii Pra&#x301;krta (the name of its original script is La&#x301;ha&#x301;ndei), the Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya Pra&#x301;krta-descendant Kashmiirii (the name of its original script is Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; &ndash; Kashmir&#146;s Sanskrit books and birth records are still written in this script), Peshawar (Purus&#x301;apur) and Afghanistan&#146;s (Ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;r) language (this language is also descended from Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya Pra&#x301;krta &ndash; pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya &rarr; pashto. Its original script is also Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;), Farsi (its original script also came from Bra&#x301;hmii). In addition to these, there are the Sanskrit adopted-descendants, Baluchi (it is Baluchistan&#146;s original language belonging to the Dravidian branch), and Bra&#x301;hoi (it is also a language of the west bank of the Sindhu river-basin. It is also of Dravidian origin as well as being an adopted descendant of Sanskrit). The other important language of this group is Malay (it is the original language of Malaysia and Singapore. It is included within the Malay family of languages and its original script is Kut&#x301;iila&#x301; (Bengali)). Although Malay is written nowadays in Arabic script for historical reasons, this Sanskrit adopted-descendant has no relation to the Arabic branch of languages. Still, it contains many Arabic words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->All those Sanskrit-descended languages and Sanskrit adopted-descendants which use ka as their first consonant may encounter difficulties at every step in the construction of grammatical aphorisms and the composition of phonetic rules. The s&#x301;a rule, n&#x301;a rule, and system of conjuncts are all unscientifically and disorderly formulated. In many cases, there being no possible formula to apply,  it is said: &ldquo;that&#146;s the way it&#146;s been done&rdquo;. I say, even if Roman script is used for convenience in the world of grammar, its alphabetic system must be arranged according to Sanskrit rules. Otherwise it will have to suffer the results of its own errors. Thus ka is the first consonant of the alphabet of Sanskrit-descended languages and adopted-descendants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->One meaning of the word ka is &ldquo;water&rdquo;. That which is covered by ka, that is, water, (which is kena in the sense of being covered by water) is kaccha.  In ancient times that portion of western India which is situated at the northwest corner of the Ta&#x301;ptii river-basin and the southeast corner of the Sindhu river-basin fell below sea level due to a terrible earthquake of volcanic origin. Sea-water inundated the land of that region and the area became surrounded by water. From then onwards it was called kaccha. There is another place a short distance from there which became partially inundated with sea-water. That area, which was under the moral supervision of Maharshi Bhrgu, was given the name Bhrgu Kaccha (Bharoca). Since that region was situated between Gondawanaland and the ancient Ba&#x301;luca-A&#x301;ra&#x301;ballii mountain range, the entire area was transformed into sargasso sea according to the laws of nature. Thus, as a result of being inundated by sea-water, there remains the possibility of finding mineral oil in the water beds of this area, or beneath the soil where there is no water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Our well-known kalmii [a leafy vegetable similar to spinach] grows in ka, that is, water, floating on the surface until it becomes very long. If you catch hold of one part and pull it, the distant portion will also be raised. Thus, the name of kalmii sha&#x301;k in Sanskrit is kalambii sha&#x301;ka. Actually, the word kalmii is derived from the Sanskrit word kalambii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When manifestation first sprouts within the vast scope of the unmanifest, the Cognitive Faculty is bound by the Creative Faculty. This bound entity is known in Buddhist philosophy by the name of sam&#x301;vrttibodhicitta. In theist philosophy it is given the name ka&#x301;ryabrahma. At that time one portion of the Cosmic Mind becomes the objective counterpart and one portion becomes the subjective counterpart. If there is no object there can be no subjectivity. Thus, since the unmanifest has no object, it has no subject either. In the manifest state the object exists so the subject also exists. Ka is the acoustic root of the objectivated counterpart of the Cosmic Mind, that is, ka signifies sam&#x301;vrttibodhicitta, or ka&#x301;ryabrahma. And that portion of the Cosmic Mind which is the witness of the acoustic root ka has om  as its acoustic root (a + u + m). Bear in mind, the acoustic root of the causal factor of the Cosmic Mind is not (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om but om. (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om refers to the unmanifest Cosmic Entity, regardless of manifestation or non-manifestation, beyond the phenomenal world or within it. Thus we see that another meaning of the word ka is &ldquo;objectivated Cosmic Mind&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->That ka is the acoustic root of the Cosmic Mind transformed into object was certainly known to some few people during Vedic or ancient times. Thus they used a vertical mark to stand for the ka sound as a symbol of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and as a symbol of the binding force or Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; they drew a [[horizontal]] line. In order to signify the Cosmic Mind which has been transformed into the Cognitive Entity due to the bondage of Prakrti, they drew a plus sign [+] as a combined mark with the line signifying Prakrti over the line signifying Purus&#x301;a. In the process of writing this combined mark quickly without lifting the hand, it has taken on the form k: [ka] in modern Bengali. Because all sounds in the practical world are based on the objectivated Cosmic Mind, ka is the first consonant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Since the letter ka is related through the system of mutual replacement to the sound ca, ca becomes the first letter of the second varga<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->; and since t&#x301;a has a relationship of mutual replacement with the sound ca, it becomes the first letter of the third varga. Since ta has an acoustic and lightness<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  relation to t&#x301;a, it is the first letter of the next varga. Since the ka, ca, t&#x301;a and ta vargas are grouped among the long sounds, pa becomes the first letter of the following fifth varga. Since there is no opportunity for a varga system beyond the fifth varga, the acoustic root of destruction, ma, has been kept as the last letter of that varga. Besides these, the remaining letters are either antahstha varn&#x301;a (vowel conjuncts) or us&#x301;mavarn&#x301;a [aspirates]. These aspirated sounds are known as us&#x301;mavarn&#x301;a because at the time of pronunciation the air of the vocal cavity becomes heated. Thus we see that if ka is kept as the first consonant, then acoustic consistency is preserved. Thus, ka is the first consonant of the alphabet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Kakanda<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root kan&#x301;/kan (kan&#x301;i/kani) is &ldquo;to shine&rdquo;, &ldquo;to create sound&rdquo;, &ldquo;to groan&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be injured, or to run away for fear of being injured&rdquo; or &ldquo;to go quickly&rdquo;. Although in the Vedic language this verbal root is mainly constructed with n&#x301;a, in Laokika (comparitively recent) Sanskrit both n&#x301;a and na are used. &ldquo;That which shines&rdquo; or &ldquo;that whose attraction is desired&rdquo; is kan&#x301; + da = kanda. All those plants which yield their crop below ground (tuber crop), such as potato, red potato, yam, sha&#x301;nkalu [a conch-shaped tuber], ol, arum, are called kandashaka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->People care for the potato plant and desire it, not for the plant itself, but for its subterranean crop. This is equally applicable to all below-ground crops, thus all those crops which are produced below ground we call kanda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That which shines&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is desired&rdquo; &ndash; while using the word kanda in this sense, the people of that time came into contact with such objects whose attraction was irresistible to them. They also used to use the word kanda for those objects. Often, due to some extra attraction, the sound was doubled or lengthened (prs&#x301;i diirgha) in accordance with the natural law, thus in those cases also the word kanda became kakanda. The first consonant, ka, was doubled. Kakanda  means &ldquo;gold&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->When the people of the prehistoric era came into contact with gold they became fascinated by its colour and gave it the name suvarn&#x301;a. The etymological meaning of this word is &ldquo;beautiful colour&rdquo;. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;gold&rdquo;. When the Aryans entered India they came to Jambudviipa and found traces of gold particles in the rivers there. Because they found gold particles in the rivers of Jambudviipa they gave that land another name &ndash; Ja&#x301;mbunada (jambunada + sn&#x301;a).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Wheat&rdquo; in Sanskrit is godhu&#x301;ma. Its etymological meaning is &ldquo;that thing which gives rise to a pleasing vibration in the tongue&rdquo;. I have said several times in the past that the original Persian language is a descendant of Sanskrit. From this word godhu&#x301;ma we get the word gondu&#x301;ma in old Persian. In various Indian languages we get the words gehun, gahum, gahun, gehuma, gohun, gaham (in Rarhi Bengali and parts of Orissa), gam, etc. from this godhu&#x301;ma. When wheat matures its colour becomes somewhat golden. Thus wheat also used to be called kakanda or kan&#x301;aka in old Sanskrit. Wheat is also called kan&#x301;aka in the Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta descendant, Punjabi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Earlier I said that kanda can be spelled with either n&#x301;a or na if its meaning is &ldquo;to shine&rdquo;, &ldquo;to create sound&rdquo;, etc. For this reason both spellings, kanda and kan&#x301;da, are correct. Na and da are dental letters, thus no difficulty arises if we write nda, but according to the conjunction rules of linguistic science, a dental letter cannot be combined with a cerebral letter. Thus the conjunction n&#x301;a with da is not allowed. Kanda must be spelled with nda. Nowadays the spelling of kanda with na is prevalent. In the Vedic era, however, the letter n&#x301;a was much more common. Thus the word kan&#x301;d&#x301;a was also used to mean kanda or &ldquo;gold&rdquo;. The meaning &ldquo;gold&rdquo; for the word kan&#x301;d&#x301;a has disappeared.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Kaga<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Etymologically, kaga signifies two things. Ka means sam&#x301;vrttibodhicitta [the bound Cognitive Faculty]. With this meaning &ldquo;movement towards sam&#x301;vrttibodhicitta&rdquo; or towards crude thought is called kaga (ka + gam + d&#x301;a = kaga). The other etymological meaning of the word kaga is &ldquo;one whose movement is towards ka&rdquo;, that is, water. For &ldquo;movement towards water&rdquo; or &ldquo;descending into water&rdquo; there is also the Vedic verbal root il. Il + ac gives ila which means kaga. If we take the word ka to mean water then one colloquial meaning of the word kaga is &ldquo;buffalo&rdquo;. If a buffalo sees water it cannot resist taking a dip, thus a synonym for &ldquo;buffalo&rdquo; is kaga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Kaca<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The root verb kac means &ldquo;to shine&rdquo;. The etymological meaning of the word kaca is &ldquo;shining&rdquo; or &ldquo;luminous&rdquo;. Colloquially, it refers to the guru of the gods, Brhas&#x301;pati&#146;s son, Kaca. Some of you must have read the story of Kaca-devaya&#x301;nii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Kacurii<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Kaca + purii = kacapurii &rarr; kacaurii &rarr; kacaorii &rarr; kacurii. Bear in mind, in Sanskrit the word purii is sometimes used to mean &ldquo;city&rdquo; or &ldquo;town&rdquo;, but it does not refer to the entire town, but rather a specific part of town, such as Daetyapurii [demon-town], Yaks&#x301;apurii [ghost-town], Shatrupurii [enemy-town]. The word purii, from which kacurii has come, is not a pure Sanskrit word. It is a north Indian Hindi word. When nuchis [a deep-fried unleavened bread] are fried in pure ghee then they are called shakkulii or sham&#x301;kulii or sham&#x301;khulii. In Bengali both luchi and nuchi are equally correct. When the dough for these nuchis is mixed with some ghee for leavening and fried in a pan of ghee, it is called soma&#x301;lika&#x301; in Sanskrit and purii in north India. If it is fried in oil, whether it is deep-fried or fried with sprinkled oil, it is not considered nuchi &ndash; it is called purii. For example, d&#x301;a&#x301;lpurii which is fried in oil. We won&#146;t say d&#x301;a&#x301;lluchi, we say d&#x301;a&#x301;lpurii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bread&rdquo; in Sanskrit is rot&#x301;ika&#x301;. In any case, that purii which is fried in pure ghee and shines, that is, becomes tempting, was kacapurii &rarr; kacurii. Many are of the opinion that approximately five thousand years ago in old Tamil (dramil), the word kaoccesa was prevalent, meaning &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;immature [kaci]&rdquo; or &ldquo;tip&rdquo;. In its corrupted form we get the words kocce/koce which mean &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;tip&rdquo;. Similarly, we get the word kocin, meaning &ldquo;small island&rdquo;. A small boy we call kaci chele. The word kaci in Bengali comes from old Tamil. A newly-developed tip of a pumpkin [la&#x301;u] vine we call kaci [la&#x301;u] d&#x301;aga&#x301;. So, in some people&#146;s opinion the word kacaorii has come from koccepurii (koccepurii &rarr; kocceurii &rarr; kacaorii &rarr; kacurii).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Kad + jala = kajjala, that is, where water expands and takes the form of vapour or clouds. Thus kajjala signifies &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;. Bear in mind, here va is not adjoined to ja. Kat + jvala = kajjvala. Kat means &ldquo;ugly&rdquo;; kat means &ldquo;black&rdquo;. &ldquo;That black-coloured object which shines&rdquo; is kajjvala. Kajjvala means &ldquo;collyrium&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

The root verb kat&#x301;h has been used a little to mean &ldquo;to move forward&rdquo;. From the verbal root kat&#x301;h plus ac we get the word kat&#x301;ha. Etymologically kat&#x301;ha signifies &ldquo;that which is deluded or which deludes&rdquo;, or &ldquo;which is hard-earned&rdquo;. Colloquially, kat&#x301;ha signifies:<!-- /block --></p>

For this reason the fish was given the name karttika&#x301;. The Maethilii word kavai has come from this word karttika&#x301;. It also means kai fish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Kadamba<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The root verb kad means &ldquo;to swell up or expand&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be deluded&rdquo;, &ldquo;to create delusion&rdquo;. Kad + ambac = kadamba. Etymologically, the word kadamba means &ldquo;that which has created attraction&rdquo;, or &ldquo;that which has expanded&rdquo;. It has several colloquial meanings:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->1) The kadam flower, whose other name is niipa. Its original home is India and Southeast Asia. Although there are several varieties, both large and small, there are two main varieties. The first is a small-sized flower which is also used as a food when mature for making chutney, pickle, and ambal [a sour broth used as a condiment]. The second variety is a large flower &ndash; although not as tempting as a food, it has a pleasant smell. The blooming of this flower during the rainy season has been alluded to in various ways in ancient literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->2) The second meaning of the word kadamba is dudhiya grass, a grass which grows well in temperate climates. It grows nicely in the plateau climate of Ranchi so the nearby cowherds and sheep-tenders take their animals to these areas to graze during spring and summer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->3) A third meaning of the word kadamba is &ldquo;green turmeric&rdquo;, that turmeric which is found in clusters at the base of the turmeric plant. This green turmeric is a cure for skin disease, but since it is a little poisonous it is not edible except as medicine. Shunt&#x301; turmeric [dry turmeric] is prepared by boiling this green turmeric and drying it in the sun. This shunt&#x301; turmeric is used in cooking. Since this green turmeric had the capacity to eliminate the causes of diseases, people in olden times used to smear their bodies with green turmeric paste and bathe before weddings and festivals in order to prevent the outbreak of disease during large gatherings. This festival is still celebrated to some extent and is known as ga&#x301;traharidra&#x301; [ga&#x301;tra means &ldquo;body&rdquo; and haridra&#x301; means &ldquo;turmeric&rdquo;]. Green turmeric is also a cure for eczema. One small measured teaspoon of chopped green turmeric mixed with one or two drops of pure honey and one tulsi leaf, taken with an empty stomach, is considered a medicine for eczema.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Turmeric leaf is called parn&#x301;a in Sanskrit. The word parn&#x301;a means &ldquo;any mature leaf&rdquo;. Immature, red leaves are kishalaya. Green leaves are patra and in the turmeric plant they were called parn&#x301;a. The third meaning of parn&#x301;a is pa&#x301;n&#x301; [betel leaf] (Its Sanskrit name is na&#x301;gavallarii). Ta&#x301;mbula does not refer to betel leaf but rather to any table spice. In this respect, betel leaf belongs to the category of ta&#x301;mbula. According to tradition, when Pa&#x301;rvatii was performing austerities she used to wear clothes made of turmeric leaves stitched together. Thus her name then became Parn&#x301;ashavarii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->4) Another meaning of the word kadamba is &ldquo;turmeric-coloured mustard&rdquo;. Indian mustard is of roughly three varieties. All three varieties of mustard go by the name kat&#x301;ugandhabiija. (not kat&#x301;ubiija; kat&#x301;ubiija means &ldquo;chilli&rdquo; or &ldquo;black pepper&rdquo;). In olden times kat&#x301;ugandhabiija oil used to be called  kat&#x301;utaela, that is, kat&#x301;utaela means any kind of mustard oil. Thus today also mustard oil is called kar&#x301;uya&#x301; in Bihar and certain other parts of India. Kat&#x301;u &rarr; kad&#x301;u &rarr; kar&#x301;u. Kat&#x301;u  means &ldquo;spicy hot&rdquo;. Mustard oil is somewhat spicy and pungent, hence the name.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->a) Ra&#x301;i mustard [rapeseed]. Its seeds are small and blackish-red. The plant is small, less pungent, and has less chaff. Its chaff is used as manure and as feed for animals. The chaff yields a higher ratio of oil. Its seeds should be sown at the end of early autumn in paddy land when the land is a little muddy, as part of the pigeon-harvest.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> When the paddy is cut, the tips of the mustard plants also get cut, and as a result the mustard plant gives off new offshoots. Due to the many offshoots, the plant produces more flowers during winter season, and a greater yield as well. Its greens are less caustic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->In land where other crops cannot be cultivated during winter due to a scarcity of water, farmers can also cultivate peas, grams, khesari [a variety of pigeon-pea] and other small lentils as a part of the pigeon-harvest. In order to plant for the pigeon-harvest, the soil should be well-turned and it is good if a little extra liquid fertilizer is used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Some people prefer to grow rapeseed alongside wheat. This is not bad, but still one should bear in mind that wheat can be sown until the seventh day of the solar month Paos&#x301;a (Bengali Paos&#x301;a) [late December] but if rapeseed is sown so late it may yield less, so those who wish to get a mixed harvest with rapeseed and wheat should sow an early-season variety of wheat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->b) T&#x301;or&#x301;i/t&#x301;ar&#x301;i: This is grown just at the end of early autumn or beginning of late autumn in sun-harvest land or in yellow-coloured soil mixed with a little ash. The land is tilled and then the seeds are sown. Those who don&#146;t like to use chemical fertilizers can allow castor-oil plant fertilizer[rer&#x301;i]  to decompose and use that in the soil (it is better if cultivated rer&#x301;i chaff is used in place of wild rer&#x301;i chaff). In land which suffers from scarcity of water at the end of winter season, it is profitable to cultivate t&#x301;or&#x301;i in place of other sun-harvest crops or yellow mustard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->The t&#x301;or&#x301;i plant is a little bigger than the ra&#x301;i plant. Its seeds are reddish and a little bigger than ra&#x301;i seeds. It gives a somewhat greater yield and comparatively more oil than ra&#x301;i. Its chaff is more valuable as animal feed and manure than ra&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->c) True mustard, or yellow mustard. It can only be cultivated profitably in land which remains moist at the time of flowering and which does not dry out altogether when the pods are produced. Its seeds are sown in land tilled for the sun-harvest. It gives a good yield if the land has been fertilized either with chemical fertilizer or decomposed, cultivated rer&#x301;i chaff. It is considered true mustard in regards to taste, colour, smell and quality. The plant is large and gives a good yield. Its greens are extremely caustic. With a little irrigation the cultivation of this variety of mustard is the most profitable. This mustard does not like wet climates. At one time it was cultivated throughout Bengal and its seeds used to be exported to different countries. Although today its production has decreased as a result of a lack of proper agricultural practices, if sincere efforts are made then an increase in its production would not be impossible or unachievable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Yellow mustard flowers carry honey (floral nectar) and also have different kinds of medicinal value. Kadamba refers to this variety of mustard.<!-- /block --></p>

Kad + ac = kada. Its etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which is deluded, or is deluding&rdquo;, or &ldquo;that which has expanded&rdquo;. Colloquially, kada means &ldquo;vapour&rdquo; or &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; because water expands to produce vapour or clouds. That vegetable which is watery, that is, which has expanded due to water, is kadu or kaduka. Kadu means &ldquo;round la&#x301;u&rdquo; [gourd] (ala&#x301;bu means la&#x301;u  of any shape). The word kadu in Bengali is borrowed from Sanskrit. The word la&#x301;u is a Sanskrit-derivative; the original word is ala&#x301;bu. &ldquo;That plant which is watery&rdquo;, that is, which has become expanded due to water, is kadala (kad + alac). That is its etymological meaning. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;banana tree&rdquo;. Kadali/kadalii means &ldquo;fruit of the banana tree&rdquo;. Generally, kadali/kadalii refers to any variety of banana or plantain, but to refer specifically to ripe bananas the word rambha&#x301; must be used. In Bengali ka&#x301;n&#x32D;ca&#x301; kala&#x301; [green banana] and ka&#x301;n&#x32D;cakala&#x301; [green-banana] are not identical.

They used to delude others, and others &ndash; that is, us &ndash; were deluded by them. Thus we were also kada.

<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->During those days I once had a true experience regarding the kada meaning of the railway timetables, while travelling on the BNWR (Bengal and Northwestern Railway).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->The BNWR line extended roughly from Katihar to Kanpur. Its head office was in Gorakhpur and it was managed by the company.

<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->I was travelling to a district headquarters of north Bihar. First I had to go by the EI Railway (EIR &ndash; now ER) to a dock on the Ganges. From there I had to cross the Ganges by steamer and pick up the BNWR at its docking line on the other side. This train would take me a few miles to a junction station on the BNWR main line. There I would have to change trains and get down a few miles later at yet another junction station, that is, I would have to change trains in that third junction station in order to reach my final destination some forty miles away, that is, the concerned district headquarters. Altogether, the distance travelled was only about eighty miles, but the journey required fourteen hours.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->I left home towards dawn and after overcoming various hindrances I reached the third junction at six in the evening and waited in the waiting room&#8230; waited and waited.

At one time it had had four legs but in some prehistoric era one leg had broken off and it had not been repaired since. Of the two chairs, one had both arms broken off, and the other was missing the right arm while the left arm was loose. I didn&#146;t feel safe sitting in the chair with the loose arm so I sat in the chair with no arms.

<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But what was the matter?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Some unknown person had taken away the doors and windows long before. The lights were off because the bulbs were missing. Previously, the railway officials had the bulbs stamped BNWR in white letters to prevent them from being stolen, but when that didn&#146;t stop the thefts, they started printing &lsquo;stolen from BNWR&rsquo; on the bulbs. The idea was that if the thief was not completely shameless, then he would be too embarrassed to use it at home, because if any relative or friend would see it they would know that the head of the house had stolen the bulb from the BNWR. But since even that didn&#146;t prove any obstacle to the thievery, railway officials of late had stopped putting in bulbs. So there was nothing left to do but sit in a dark compartment. People travelling during the dark fortnight had started carrying torches with them. Of course, during the bright lunar fortnight they didn&#146;t need to; the inside of the compartment was illumined by the moonlight.<!-- /block --></p>

Show me your ticket.&rsquo; He showed me his ticket. &lsquo;But this is a third class ticket,&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;In first class people sit on cushions,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;therefore the extra fare.

If I wanted to check their tickets I would have had to climb on top of them. That didn&#146;t agree with me much so I got into a passenger compartment, a first class compartment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There were two differences between these first class compartments and those of other railways that I particularly noticed.

<a name="81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The second difference I noticed was that the word &lsquo;toilet&rsquo; was written in large letters on the washroom door.

<a name="116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When she arrived she told her son-in-law: &lsquo;I&#146;ve come after a long absence so don&#146;t go out on duty today.

<a name="117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;For this reason the guard won&#146;t go back on duty. He won&#146;t come back, so the train won&#146;t budge.

<a name="118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Didn&#146;t you protest,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that as a result the guard is creating a big mess and putting so many helpless passengers to trouble?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;How could I dare to put up a protest?&rdquo; replied Aklmand. &ldquo;I also do such things from time to time.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Huh, well I&#146;ll be!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Don&#146;t you know the story of the goat-ghost from hell?&rdquo; asked Aklmand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;If you know it then tell it to me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->Aklmand began telling the story. &ldquo;Once there was a chubby, jet-black goat-ghost. He used to stay in the raorava section of hell [the lowest stratum of hell], in a seventh floor flat which often gave him trouble due to a lack of water. He used to quarrel and feud twice a day with the other tenants and the owner. One day the ghosts from the building approached the other ghosts of hell and informed them of this. Hell&#146;s ghosts thanked them many times over and said: &lsquo;We haven&#146;t eaten goat-flesh for ages. Since we&#146;ve become ghosts, we&#146;ve lost count of how long we&#146;ve been here in hell.  We haven&#146;t had a single chance to eat goat-flesh since we&#146;ve come to hell, because even though cow-ghosts arrive now and then, not a single goat-ghost does. The goblins in the wood-apple trees on the road that leads from earth to hell reach down and pull them up and cook them in the portable stoves they keep in the tree branches, so they can have goat-meat curry simmered with Ganges water along with their rice and ghee.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;You won&#146;t find a single goat-ghost who has had the chance to make it all the way to hell. Now that we&#146;ve learned that a goat-ghost has come to your place, our joy knows no bound. Shut off the tap-water in your building. Cut the electricity. When he comes downstairs to quarrel with you we will pounce on him and take him away with us.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;While the ghosts were discussing this among themselves in the building a cow-ghost overheard them. He went to the goat-ghost and informed him. The goat-ghost didn&#146;t waste any time, but ran breathlessly away until he had crossed heaven&#146;s border. There was some dispute over his passport and visa, to be sure, but when heaven&#146;s border-guards heard his sad story, they were overcome with compassion and let him enter heaven. After entering heaven, the goat-ghost approached the gods and lodged a complaint against the ghosts of hell. He said: &lsquo;Tell me gods, how can one possibly remain in hell with such worries?&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Everything about the ghosts is a mess,&rsquo; said the gods. &lsquo;They conspired to eat you without even considering the day or date, didn&#146;t they?&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Yes they did,&rsquo; replied the goat-ghost.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Therein lie our differences with the ghosts,&rsquo; said the gods. &lsquo;If we are going to eat you we&#146;ll choose an auspicious day for it. We&#146;ll bathe you in the Ganges on the new moon, apply vermilion to your forehead, that is, you understand, we&#146;ll do everything according to the rules.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=129 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The goat-ghost smelled danger and rather than waste any time, he fled to the Creator, Brahma&#x301;. With great trouble he slipped the security net and entered Brahma&#x301;&#146;s chambers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;What is wrong, goat-ghost?&rsquo; said Brahma&#x301;. &lsquo;Why are you panting so hard?&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=131 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Look sir,&rsquo; said the goat-ghost. &lsquo;I was in hell but the ghosts didn&#146;t let me stay there. They plotted to cut me up and eat me. Fearing for my life I came to heaven, but when I arrived here I also saw the gods looking at me and licking their chops, so I came here to ask you for shelter.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=132 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Leave my chambers at once,&rsquo; said Brahma&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="133"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=133 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Where can I go if I leave your chambers?&rsquo; asked the goat-ghost.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="134"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=134 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Do what I say,&rsquo; replied Brahma&#x301;. &lsquo;Leave at once. My mouth is also watering seeing your lovely succulence.&rsquo; &rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph -->Aklmand said: &ldquo;So you see, even though I know that the guard was doing wrong, it wasn&#146;t possible for me to protest. My situation on that day was just like that of the Creator, Brahma&#x301;. I&#146;ve also done the same thing the guard did today now and again, so can I oppose what the guard is doing and still save face?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=136 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Still, it is true,&rdquo; said Aklmand, &ldquo;that this train&#146;s timetable is completely kada.  I should tell you about one incident that concerns this. It happened four or five days ago. A gentleman from a nearby village was travelling somewhere on the main line train. He arrived at the station and asked the station master: &lsquo;Stationmaster sir, can you tell me how many minutes late the number seventeen train is?&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=137 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;How many minutes late!&rsquo; the stationmaster replied. &lsquo;That train is coming ridiculously late today.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="138"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=138 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The village gentleman thought: &lsquo;If the train is going to be so late then let one thing be done. The Ganges is only four kilometres from here. Let me go and take a bath in the Ganges to earn some religious merit, then I&#146;ll put on the tilak [religious mark] and sandalwood, eat some beaten rice, yoghurt and per&#x301;a&#x301;, and then return to the station. Since the train is so late, I&#146;m sure I&#146;ll get back to the station long before the train comes.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="139"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=139 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The gentleman had just left when he suddenly saw the train he wanted heading towards the station. He rushed back to the station and asked the stationmaster: &lsquo;Stationmaster sir, just a little while ago you told me that the train was very late today, but now I see that the train has arrived right on schedule.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="140"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=140 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; the stationmaster replied, &lsquo;what I said was quite correct. This is yesterday&#146;s train; it&#146;s twenty-four hours late.&rsquo;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="141"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=141 type=paragraph -->I was dumbfounded to hear this. Astonishing!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="142"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=142 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Seeing all these things,&rdquo; Aklmand continued, &ldquo;I was struck with amazement. I felt like a pa&#x301;par&#x301; bouncing in a frying pan, dazed and bewildered&#8230; a Sir&#x301;ir nar&#x301;u with crispy puffed rice.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
