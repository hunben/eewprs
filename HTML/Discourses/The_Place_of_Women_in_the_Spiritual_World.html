<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Some time ago, I said many people incorrectly believe that only men can attain success in the spiritual world. They say that although women may make some progress in the spiritual sphere, they will have to come down to earth in the form of males to attain final salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->I said that this is an absurd and irrational idea as women are the children of God just like their male counterparts. Could any father want his sons to prosper in all ways while his daughters remain backward? Certainly he would not and could not want such a thing. Not only do parents take their sons on their laps and play with them; they do the same with their daughters. Sometimes they even have more affection for their daughters, thinking, &ldquo;They won&#146;t be with us much longer. They&#146;ll be getting married soon and will move in with their husbands, so let us give them more love and affection. After all, we are not sure how well they will be treated by their mothers-in-law.&rdquo; Some parents expect their sons to support the entire family once they have grown up and started earning money. Even though they have no such expectations for their daughters, they still love them dearly. Their love is deep and sincere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->On what basis, therefore, is the argument propounded that women will not attain salvation, whereas men will? It is a totally irrational idea. Why was such an idea propagated at all? The reason is that so-called religion, which arose wherever capitalism permeated every sphere of life, was in the hands of opportunists with their own vested interests. In order to subjugate women, it was proclaimed that they were not entitled to attain salvation. After repeatedly hearing this, women developed an inferiority complex, became men&#146;s slaves and were reduced to the status of maid-servants. This absurd idea was propagated with the sole intention of exploiting women. But when human civilization first sprouted, these things were unknown, as women were totally free. From a study of Bengali history, we learn that there was equality between men and women. They would hunt together; and the women would sometimes carry the slaughtered animals from the forest. Women were equally free in all respects. But later, when the so-called civilization spread, it was obsessed with the psychology of cunningness; the exploiters&#146; psychology gripped it, and women were made captives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the early stages of spiritual education when human beings were first taught the concept of dharma, many enlightened sages, both male and female, were born. In those days, both men and women made equal contributions to the world of spirituality: Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha, Vishva&#x301;mitra and Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;valkya were among the illustrious men; and Maetreyii, Gargii and Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301;, among the illustrious women. They were equal in all respects and greatly enriched the world of spirituality with their teachings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Gargii was born many years ago. Once, in the royal court of King Janaka, she challenged Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;valkya to a debate on the spiritual scriptures. Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;valkya found it difficult to answer her poignant questions and was soon on the point of being defeated by her. Utterly frustrated, he said, &ldquo;Gargii, if you don&#146;t stop now, your tongue will drop off.&rdquo; Gargii was compelled to shut her mouth. Unable to beat Gargii in the debate, Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;valkya misused his powers to force her to stop.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->One day, Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;valkya fell seriously ill. His two wives, Maetreyii and Ka&#x301;tya&#x301;yanii, attended on him with due care and affection.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> It is a fact that some men are ordinary and some are extraordinary. Similarly, some women are ordinary and others are extraordinary. After recovering from his illness, Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;valkya said to Ka&#x301;tya&#x301;yanii, &ldquo;I would like to give you a present. What would you like?&rdquo; His wife replied, &ldquo;Let me see I&#146;d like some new clothes, some new jewellery, in fact, so many things.&rdquo; And she made a long list of all the things she wanted. Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;valkya bought everything she asked for and then asked Maetreyii, &ldquo;What would you like? Clothes, jewellery, or any other valuable thing?&rdquo; Maetreyii remained silent. Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;valkya continued, &ldquo;Just a little while ago, Katya&#x301;ya&#x301;nii said she would like some new clothes, jewellery, and so many other things. What would you like?&rdquo; Maetreyii replied, Yena&#x301;ham&#x301; na&#x301;mrtasya&#x301;m&#x301; tena&#x301;ham&#x301; kim kurya&#x301;m. &ldquo;What will I do with things which will not remain with me permanently? Of what use are the objects which will not establish me in immortality? The expensive clothes I wear today will be torn in a few days. The jewellery I wear today will no longer be fashionable tomorrow as the designs change from age to age. A certain design was fashionable in my grandmother&#146;s day, another one in my mother&#146;s day and yet another in the present day. No design is permanent forever. It&#146;s nice of you to offer me such things, but none of them will remain with me. I will have to leave them all behind when I depart from this world; so what use are they, and why should you tempt me with them?&rdquo; Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;valkya then asked, &ldquo;Please tell me what you would really like.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you can,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;please give me that thing which will remain with me permanently, which I&#146;ll be able to preserve forever, which will establish me in immortality. I don&#146;t want anything else.&rdquo; Then Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;valkya gave her a number of instructions, upon which a major part of Ra&#x301;ja&#x301; Yoga is based.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->No one should be foolish enough to think that women did not practice yoga in the past. You girls should always remember that if anyone underestimates you, or looks upon you as inferior, you should give a very blunt reply.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301;, who was a so-called raks&#x301;asii [a name contemptuously given by the Aryans to the indigenous people of India] was married to Citrasena, the king of the Gandharvas. In their marriage contract it was agreed that Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301;, and not the king, would be responsible for the education of their children. Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301; always maintained that women are more spiritually inclined and devoted than men and are therefore more capable of properly educating their children. With this idea in mind I told one of the members of our WWD [Women&#146;s Welfare Department] to launch a movement promoting women as primary school teachers. So, according to the marriage contract, and with the king&#146;s consent, Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301; started teaching the first child. As soon as he was seven years old, he became an ardent spiritualist and went to the mountains to live the life of a yogi. Following his departure, Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301; promptly started educating the second child. The king became angry, fearful that all his children would embrace a spiritual life due to Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301;&#146;s unusual education. There was nothing he could do, however, since he feared Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301;. Not only was she the most beautiful woman in the world, she was also highly educated. He was therefore unable to oppose her to her face. Moreover, she was a ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii, and he was frightened that she might even devour him! The second son also became a sannya&#x301;sii [renunciant] in due course.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->According to historical records, Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301;&#146;s children were the first to embrace missionary life and take the vow of sannya&#x301;sii-hood in order to serve humanity. Prior to that, there were sannya&#x301;siis, no doubt, but they dressed themselves as sadhus more to enjoy delicious gifts of laddu [sweet balls], pu lau [fried rice dish] and malpoa&#x301; [a type of sweet] than to render any service. Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301;&#146;s sons were very different since they became sannya&#x301;sis to serve the suffering humanity as ideal missionaries. Everyone praised them, saying that they had never seen such ideal yogis. This was due to Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301;&#146;s unique education. The third son also followed in the footsteps of his elder brothers. One day, Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301; was putting her fourth child, a three-month-old baby, to sleep with the following lullaby:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Shu&#x301;ddho&#146;si buddo&#146;si nirain&#x32D;jano&#146;si sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra m&#x301;aya&#x301; parivarpito&#146;si.<br>Sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra svapnam&#x301; tyaja mohanidra&#x301;m&#x301; Mada&#x301;lasolla&#x301;pam uva&#x301;ca putram.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Dear son, although you are but a child in a small human frame, you are the veritable expression of the Supreme Consciousness. You are an ever-holy, ever-enlightened entity. As long as you think that you are only a small child, you are spiritually ignorant, but when you realize that you are a part of that Supreme Entity, you become that Supreme Entity, you become spotless (nirain&#x32D;jano&#146;si).&rdquo; The mistakes that people make, the crimes and sins they commit, leave a mark imprinted on their minds which remains as a sam&#x301;skara&#x301;. This spot or mark is called ain&#x32D;jana in Sanskrit. Ain&#x32D;jana also means a kind of black mark which is used to decorate the eye. &ldquo;My dear child, there is no black spot in your mind. You are spotless. You are unassailed by any kind of sin.&rdquo; Sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra m&#x301;aya&#x301; parivarpito&#146;si: &ldquo;You are beyond the spell of the illusory Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; of this mundane world. You are the embodiment of the pure and unblemished self.&rdquo; Sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra svapnam&#x301; tyaja mohanidra&#x301;m: &ldquo;What is this world after all? Human beings think this world is real, but to the Absolute Entity it is only a mere dream, having no real existence. That is why I tell you to break the spell of illusion which makes you dream about all the attachments of this world.&rdquo; Mada&#x301;lasallopam uva&#x301;ca putram&#x301;: &ldquo;This is how Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301; teaches her son.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->While she was teaching her son in this way, the king, beside himself with anger, came and accused her of having wrongly educated their children. They both started to quarrel, and Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301; said in protest, &ldquo;Don&#146;t you remember our marriage contract? I was the one entrusted with the education of our children. Now that you have broken the contract, I will no longer remain with you.&rdquo; And she left him. The story goes that soon after she drowned herself in the River Ganges. The king was determined to give his fourth child a good education. By the way, do you know what name he gave to his son? He called him &ldquo;Alarka&rdquo;. What better proof of his ignorance could you ask for? In Sanskrit, alarka means &ldquo;mad dog&rdquo;! Due to the king&#146;s faulty education, Alarka became wicked in all respects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->As depicted in many stories, soon after Alarka became king, his kingdom was attacked by a neighbouring king. Alarka was defeated in battle and forced to leave his kingdom. Utterly dejected, he suddenly remembered that on the eve of her departure, his mother had given him a ring and advised him to break it open if ever he found himself in great danger, as it would provide good advice for him. Alarka thought that this was the best time for him to break open the ring. Inside he found a small piece of paper on which several instructions were written: &ldquo;Give up all sorts of company. If you are unable to do that, then only keep the company of good people. Give up all sorts of desires. If you are unable to do that, then cherish only one desire: the desire for salvation.&rdquo; Then Alarka decided to give up everything and go out in search of an ideal. His quest brought him to Vakreshvra, in the west of Birbhum district [in the presentday West Bengal, India] where the great sage As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vakra was doing penance. There are some hot springs there. Alarka, seeking advice, asked the sage a number of questions. On the basis of Alarka&#146;s questions and As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vakra&#146;s answers, a part of Ra&#x301;ja&#x301; Yoga was evolved which is known as As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vakra Samhita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Later, when Alarka&#146;s reputation as a great yogi had spread far and wide, the conquering king requested him to take back his kingdom. I have already said that Mada&#x301;lasa&#146;s sons were the first sannya&#x301;sis to embrace missionary life and serve the common people. &ldquo;Alarka, come and take back your throne,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Alarka, &ldquo;I&#146;m too busy now as I have to propagate dharma in the world. I am bound to serve the society and thus have no time to look after the affairs of the royal administration.&rdquo; This is the story of Mada&#x301;lasa&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There is no plausible proof that women were spiritually undeveloped in the past. On the contrary, they were greatly advanced. Moreover, it is seen in various artistic and literary depictions that women were not undeveloped in any age. To say something like that is a downright falsehood. In the days of Buddha, many women were also highly evolved, and there is no reason whatsoever to suppose that women are any less developed in this modern age. It is a fact, however, that women&#146;s rights were curtailed in many ways in the past and that amends should be made for that. In Ananda Marga we have done this by giving women equal rights. We hope that women will also advance along the spiritual path with the same speed as their male counterparts. I do not find any justifiable reason why women should lag behind in this age.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  To attend to someone is called shushru&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301; in Sanskrit. There is some difference between the terms seva&#x301; and shushru&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;. The latter is derived from the root verb shru + san + tai and literally means &ldquo;the desire to hear&rdquo;. A nurse will normally ask a patient, &ldquo;Hello, how do you feel today? Are you in any pain?&rdquo; The nurse will then treat him or her according to the answers given. In order to render good service, one must know what is troubling the patient, and hence the term shushru&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;.</p>
