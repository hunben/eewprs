<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The fact that the fortune of every individual, not only of this earth, but of the entire cosmos, has been wreathed together will have to be admitted one day by humanity. A spiritual aspirant has to fetch that auspicious moment sooner by his pauseless effort, service and propagation of the great Ideology. This alone is the supreme task for the present humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The ks&#x301;atriya does not worry about the future. He jumps right into the licking flames of fire; he leaps from lofty mountains and in rockets pursues planets and their satellites. He wants only conquest; he wants to be a conqueror, and not to be merely alive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Struggle is the dharma or characteristic of a ks&#x301;atriya. The ks&#x301;atriya, imbued with indomitable vital force, represents high-spiritedness. A shu&#x301;dra stops short before the mightiness of a mountain. The sky-kissing mountain is a Divinity to him. He bows to it. Dissuading the ks&#x301;atriya from climbing the mountain, he says to him entreatingly, &ldquo;God will get angry. Please do not climb.&rdquo; The ks&#x301;atriya goes ahead. Keeping the summit of the mountain under his feet, he declares that he has conquered the mountain. He invents dynamite and, blowing up the mountain, he makes his path through it. To make a slave of matter is the nature of a ks&#x301;atriya. Willingly or unwillingly, ks&#x301;atriyas have to come into the limelight. The Vedic age, the age of the Maha&#x301;bharata in India, ancient Greece, ancient Egypt, even some societies of today &ndash; all have been zinging and resounding with heroic tales of the ks&#x301;atriyas. Their existence, be it long or short in human history, stirs up a sensation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Like the ks&#x301;atriya, the vipra is always engaged in a fight, but his fight remains limited to the intellectual arena. The vipra lives only by his wits and intellectuality. When a vipra wages a fight, almost all of that fight takes place in his nerve-cells; he takes but little work from his muscles. The work of muscles is done by his obedient servants, the ks&#x301;atriya and the shu&#x301;dra. Many wars have been fought in the history of the world. Millions of dull-witted shudras, thousands of brave ks&#x301;atriyas of equally dull intellect, have lost their lives; but the laurels of victory have come to the vipra ministers, who never so much as peep at the battle fields from a distance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The ks&#x301;atriya&#146;s clash with another ks&#x301;atriya is an heroic clash, sword for sword. The vipra&#146;s is an intellectual clash: ruse for ruse, diplomacy against diplomacy. Fair or foul, the impact of these clashes is gigantic. Such impacts shake the very foundation of the society. And so when a real vipra leader leaves the world, his footmarks remain imprinted on the breast of the world for a long time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Isms&rdquo; that separate man from man are all encouraged and patronized by the vaeshyas. Casteism, provincialism, nationalism, racism, are nurtured chiefly with the money of the vaeshyas, who finance the disintegration and division of the human race, so that the people may not in any way raise their voice against the rapacious vaeshyas. The vaeshyas, buying the vital force of the ks&#x301;atriyas and the intellectual force of the vipras with the power of their money, keep the ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras enslaved for a long time. A vaeshya&#146;s financial strength carries more weight than a vipra&#146;s power of speech and intellect, not to speak of the ks&#x301;atriya&#146;s physical strength, and so a vaeshya has no difficulty at all in buying the vipra&#146;s brain and the ks&#x301;atriya&#146;s brawn with his money.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Human civilization now faces the final moment of a critical juncture. The dawn of a glorious new era is on one side and the worn-out skeleton of the past is on the other. Man has to adopt either of the two.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->You, the spiritual soldiers, are the worshippers of the Divine. Hence, I call you to adorn this crimson dawn deluged with glorious light.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Victory is surely yours.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->[filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The subtle feelings which could not be expressed in this life may or may not be expressed in the next life. Art is the expression of unquenched thirst. The technician of this life becomes a genius in the next life. Genius is inborn, but a technician is one who has developed an ordinary skill into an extraordinary talent.<!-- /block --></p>
