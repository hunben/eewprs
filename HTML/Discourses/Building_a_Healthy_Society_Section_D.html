<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Lack of security in society leads to the disintegration of society itself. Any society where security against injustice is not provided to people cannot exist long. Lack of security also increases because of indiscipline. If the laws of society are not obeyed social security will not be possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The most important requisites for social security therefore, are that there should be no injustice and there should be strict discipline.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><b>No Injustice</b>. If security in society is to be maintained there must be no economic, sexual or racial injustice. Economic injustice is usually the result of lack of appreciation of the dignity of labour. Occupational distinctions in society lead to economic injustice. In Ananda Marga it is laid down that it is better to serve as a sweeper and earn one&#146;s own living rather than be dependent on others for one&#146;s livelihood. If such importance is given to one&#146;s own earning and living many economic injustices will cease to exist. Economic injustice also comes about because of the hording instincts of human beings. People want property only for themselves. If only they felt that property should be shared by others also many economic injustices will not be committed. In our Marga all the property of the universe is considered to be the common property and has to be utilized jointly. This idea leaves hardly any scope for economic injustice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Another form of injustice in society is discrimination based on sex. Instances of one sex being considered inferior to the other are very common. Women in a sizable area of the world are considered as the private property of men and are meant for their pleasure only. In many so-called advanced countries of the world of the world women do not have the right to vote in the general elections for the government of the country. In other countries women are considered unfit to take part in spiritual practices. In our Ananda Marga both men and women have equal responsibilities. In the manner prescribed for marriage in our Marga both men and women have equal responsibility. In our Ananda Marga there is no bar on women&#146;s entitlement to spiritual practices. Women and men are considered on the same footing and there is no question of men considering themselves superior to women.<!-- /block --></p>
