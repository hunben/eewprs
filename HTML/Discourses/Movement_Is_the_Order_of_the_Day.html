<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know, nothing is fixed or stationary in this universe of ours. Everything moves. Movement is the order of the day. Movement expresses living stamina. Even the big bodies, even this universe, are not fixed or stationary; because the earth moves, and along with the movement of the earth, the big body also moves. So everywhere there is mobility and motivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This world is created by <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> through the movement of His Macrocosmic stuff. So nobody can remain fixed in this universe. One must move, and that movement may be positive movement or may be negative movement, but movement must be there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This psychic movement of <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is known as <i>sain&#x32D;cara</i> and <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i>. And human movement towards <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> towards the subtler, rather, subtlest goal is nothing but an accelerated movement of  <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i>. If a man says, &ldquo;I am not doing any spiritual practice, but I am a moralist. I won&#146;t budge on moralistic principles,&rdquo; such a man, we should know, will have to move. And because there is no positive movement of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara,</i> his movement will be negative. That is, a day will come when the man will become worse than human beings. So just to maintain the acceleration of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara,</i> a man must do spiritual practice, otherwise there must be downfall.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now when the movement is towards the subtler entity, that movement is called <i>devajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i> or <i>amrtajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i>.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And where the movement is a negative one, that is, negative <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara,</i> it is called <i>bhu&#x301;tajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i>.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  So if a man is a super-moralist, but he doesn&#146;t do any spiritual practice, his downfall is inevitable; that is, his movement towards <i>bhu&#x301;tajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii</i> is inevitable. So wise people must do spiritual practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now, <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is everywhere. <i>Amrta</i> [spiritual nectar] is a creation of His. <i>Bhu&#x301;ta</i> [solid factor] is also a creation of His. So when a man resorts to <i>devajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i> or <i>amrtajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is with him and helps him in all possible <i>and impossible</i> ways. Similarly, when a man resorts to <i>bhu&#x301;tajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is with him and helps him in all possible <i>and impossible</i> ways. <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is always with each and every creature, the virtuous or the sinners; both are equally helped by Him. The virtuous can see him, can feel His existence, and the sinners cannot. This is the only difference. And why can the virtuous feel His presence, and why can the sinners not feel His presence?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It is a knotty question, but the reply is not at all knotty, the reply is very simple. Between the virtuous and <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> the veil of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> is very thin, and it disappears very easily; when a man&#146;s distance from the Cosmological Nucleus goes on decreasing, the veil of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> becomes thinner and thinner and finally disappears. And when a man resorts to <i>bhu&#x301;tajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na,</i> the veil of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> is very thick, and goes on becoming thicker and thicker as his distance from the Cosmological Nucleus increases.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now due to this veil of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;,</i> due to the dexterous hands of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;,</i> the crude world stands between the man and his <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> where otherwise there is no difference. The difference is of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i>-ic creation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[These <i>upa&#x301;dhis,</i> differentiating marks, are characteristics of both the Supreme Subject and of the unit.

Take away these differentiating marks, and it will be difficult to distinguish between the two.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And finally, when this veil of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> disappears, there is no difference between microcosm and Macrocosm, no difference between <i>jiiva</i> and <i>Shiva</i>.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The difference between the <i>jiiva</i> and his Lord <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is just the difference of titles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->When there remains the veil of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;,</i> the Cosmic Entity is the nucleus of the order and is the creator of everything including this quinquelemental world. And at that time the <i>jiiva</i> is the creator of his physical, psychic and other bodies. And when this veil of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> disappears, the <i>jiiva</i> becomes <i>Shiva</i> and there remains no individual small body or small mind or anything that may be treated as a projection of microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->But when due to disappearance of this veil of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;,</i> that is, when the <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> becomes thinner and thinner and finally vanishes, what does happen? <i>Samyaunnira&#x301;sena Parah na jiivah</i> &ndash; &ldquo;There remains neither the objective counterpart nor the subjective counterpart.&rdquo; The object and the subject become one, and that oneness is the supreme oneness, the supreme singularity of the Macrocosm, the supreme singularity of the Cognition. As long as there is <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;,</i> there is title. When we give a club to a man, we say he is a wrestler. When we attach a kingdom to a man, we say he is a king. And when the title of &ldquo;club&rdquo; or the title of &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; is taken away, we say he is a man. There remains neither any wrestler nor any king; these are of titular creation. Similarly, the difference between <i>jiiva</i> and <i>Shiva</i> is of titular creation, and this difference of title is created due to the veil of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i>. Now how to do away with this veil of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i>? The reply is very simple. The Lord says:<!-- /block --></p>
