<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s topic of discourse is &ldquo;Microcosm and Macrocosm&rdquo; &ndash; the unit and the Cosmic. The main difference between microcosm and Macrocosm is that microcosm suffers from imperfection whereas Macrocosm is perfect. In other words, the unit is imperfect and the Cosmic is perfect. But through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or persistent spiritual endeavour microcosm attains perfection, it becomes Macrocosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual or intuitional practice is the process of transmutation of the unit into the Cosmic. Microcosm (Jiiva) and Macrocosm (Shiva) do not have a subjective difference. Soul is one. The difference lies in the object; it is objective rather than subjective. For, transmutation can never be possible if there is objective difference. The difference being objective, only an objective change will bring change in the subject.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Microcosm is multipurposive but its flow is unilateral. On the other hand, Macrocosm is uni-purpose but its flow is multilateral. There is no end to the desires of microcosm. Sometimes it desires fame and sometimes it desires money. But it can make itself travel at one time in one direction only. His mind cannot be simultaneously engaged in a book and in a football game. While reading, if he thinks of the football game his mind is diverted from the book. Similarly, he cannot enjoy the football game if in the football game he begins to think about his books. Hence, the flow of the unit is unilateral. It travels only in one direction, at one time, whereas Macrocosm is uni-purpose but multilateral. There is only one thought of Macrocosm and that is the well-being of all. This is His one sole purpose. Yet Macrocosm is a multi-lateral flow. He does many things simultaneously. He is feeding you, creating the world, making rivers, canals and birds. Everything is being created in His mind. Hence there is much variety in His mind. It has been said about Macrocosm,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a evedam&#x301; sarvam&#x301; yadbhu&#x301;tam&#x301; yacca bhavyam;<br>Uta&#x301;mrtatvasyesha&#x301;no yadannena&#x301;tirohati.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This Purus&#x301;a is sahasrashiirsa&#x301;. In Sam&#x301;skrta &ldquo;Sahasra&rdquo; means one thousand but in Vedic language &ldquo;sahasra&rdquo; means &ldquo;many&rdquo;. One person works with one brain. He works according to it and his praise and criticism is also done accordingly. But Purus&#x301;a is Sahasrashirs&#x301;a ; He works with innumerable brains. So if the unit tries to compete with the Cosmic, he is bound to be defeated. It is quite natural. We work with our brain but Parama Purus&#x301;a works with all the brains of the world. He works with this collective brain and He is its master. The portion which has not been converted into brain cells remains as matter, so it also has the potentiality of a brain. That is why He is sahasrashiirs&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sahasrashiirs&#x301;a&#x301; Purus&#x301;ah sahasra&#x301;ks&#x301;ah sahasrapa&#x301;t. It means one who has innumerable eyes. But now the question arises as to how Macrocosm can have eyes. When matter remains associated with microcosm, in the Macrocosm there is always the witness of matter for Macrocosm is a witnessing counterpart of matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->But what is microcosm? Microcosm is a part of Macrocosm. For instance, one drop of water in the sea is microcosm and the sea is like Macrocosm. So the reflection in microcosm will naturally be inside Macrocosm. Thus whatever microcosm knows Macrocosm also knows. But whatever Macrocosm knows microcosm does not know. Suppose there is a reflection of something in a drop of water, then it is also reflected in the sea because the drop of water is a part of the sea. If the thing is big then its reflection is not possible in a drop of water, there is need of innumerable drops. Hence a unit does not know everything because complete reflection in him is not possible. So whatever we know Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; knows, and whatever we do not know Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; knows that too.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->How do we know an object? Our sense organ comes in contact with the object and the sympathetic vibration which is produced reaches through the nerves to a particular point in the brain and then we have perception. When through the brain the vibration reaches the mind we get the cognition, because the presence of the object is in the mind and the vibration of the object directly reaches the mind. That is why the limbs are not needed. Parama Purus&#x301;a does not require the help of limbs. For instance, if there is an elephant outside, to see it we need physical eyes. The tanma&#x301;tras of the object are reflected in a particular portion of the brain through the eyes and then the picture of the elephant is formed in the mind; there after we see the elephant in the mind and get cognition that there is an elephant outside. But the elephant which we make in our mind does not need an external eye to be seen. So everything is in the mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This universe is His mental creation. This universe is the Macropsychic conation. That is why He does not need limbs and external eyes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now why innumerable legs? Time, space, person &ndash; these three relative factors have been born out of His imagination. They have flows and their wavelengths always vary. But wherever these three main factors &ndash; namely spatial, temporal and personal &ndash; are present, it becomes difficult for the unit to control them because it is itself guided by these three factors. The unit is influenced by them and moves with their help. But He in whom these three are contained, is not a slave to them nor is subjected to them. For instance, if we are in Fatehgarh and want to go to Lucknow, immediately we cannot reach there physically. If we go by train or car it will take some hours. If we go by rocket even then it will take one or two minutes. It will surely take some time. It is not possible for us to totally control the time factor. Microcosm is subjected to these three factors. In this case he is being subjected to the temporal factor for he cannot control it. But Macrocosm is not bound by these factors. He is Ka&#x301;la&#x301;dhisha; He controls the temporal factor. This why it has been said: He has innumerable legs, meaning that He has one leg in Lucknow, so it is not necessary for Him to go to Lucknow. But the people of Fatehgarh will say He is in Fatehgarh too because His one leg is there also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Similarly, the people of Lucknow will say His leg is here and so He is in Lucknow. Hence it has been said that He has innumerable legs, because He is beyond the scope of the temporal factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Sa bhu&#x301;mim&#x301; vishvato vrtva&#x301;&#146;tyatis&#x301;t&#x301;haddasha&#x301;un&#x32D;gulam. Land means material expression. Land means Ka&#x301;rya Brahma. It does not only mean soil. But what is this Ka&#x301;rya Brahma? What is the physical expression? Wherever Parama Purus&#x301;a is expressed or attributed, He is the effect. And wherever He is the witnessing counterpart there He is the causal factor. What is this world which we see? We have come in the form of effect. It has been said earlier that Macropsychic conation comes in the form of effect and that portion of the effect which has not been metamorphosed, is left in the form of witness. For instance; if a person has made something by using his hands to cut something, then the thing which he has made is the effect and the remaining position which we see is causal. The universal has not been created by Macrocosm&#146;s own body but out of His mental body. This expressed universe is Ka&#x301;rya Brahma and the remaining portion is Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma. Ka&#x301;rya Brahma and Ka&#x301;rana Brahma together form Saguna Brahma or attributed Consciousness, or qualified Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The acoustic root of Ka&#x301;rya Brahma is (ka). That is why those who serve this world are known as ka&#x301;pa&#x301;lika. What is this acoustic root? For Him the universe is a mental creation. How is mental creation done? It is a collection of innumerable mental waves. Everything has been created with particular types of mental waves. If by a scientific process we are able to create differences in the waves, then we will be able to convert this into that, iron into gold. Mercury can be converted into gold very easily by removing the difference in the waves. There are innumerable waves. The waves of Ka&#x301;rya Brahma and Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma are jointly known as Saguna Brahma. Everything has a particular type of wave behind it. Wherever there is an action or existence there is a vibration, and wherever there is vibration there is sound and there is colour. The sound may or may not be audible, the colour may or may not be visible, but it is there. So the material expression &ndash; the Ka&#x301;rya Brahma or the Effect Brahma &ndash; consists of many waves. These waves have the sound ka&#x301; as the first consonant in the collection of ta&#x301;ntric varn&#x301;mala. Wherever there is a wave of Ka&#x301;rya Brahma there is a sound. The expressed universe is the Ka&#x301;rya Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now, the waves in the expressed universe have the sound &ldquo;ka&rdquo; That is why we will call &ldquo;ka&rdquo; the acoustic root of Ka&#x301;rya Brahma, the acoustic root of &ldquo;Effect Brahma&rdquo;. For example when we walk there is sound like khat&#x301; khat&#x301;. So the acoustic root like walking is khat&#x301; khat&#x301; khat&#x301;. When we laugh there is a sound like ha&#x301; ha&#x301; ha&#x301;. So where there is Ka&#x301;rya Brahma we call it land. The land which we think to be mud is also Ka&#x301;rya Brahma. In Sam&#x301;skrta there are many names for land or Karan Brahma They are Bhu&#x301;, Bhu&#x301;mi, Dhara&#x301;, Dharitrii Sarvam&#x301;saha&#x301;, Vasumatii, Gotra ku, Prthivii, Prthvi Ks&#x301;ama&#x301;, Avanii, Medinii, Mahli.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->What is inside this expressed Brahma? In every unit there is the presence of the Cosmic. But how is this possible? Take, for instance, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian sea and the Gulf of Cambay. They are all in the Indian Ocean. We can call the sea at Puri as Indian Ocean but we can not call the Indian Ocean everywhere as the Bay of Bengal. The sea in Bombay can not be addressed as the Bay of Bengal but we can call it Indian Ocean. Sah Bhu&#x301;mirvishvato Vrttva&#x301;. Atyatis&#x301; thaddasha&#x301;ngulam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Where there is expression, there is the abode of Brahma and where there is an absence of psycho-physical expression, there too He is present. But how? According to the fundamentals of Yoga Sha&#x301;stra it is said that He is present at a distance of ten fingers. But here it does not mean that Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is present only at a distance of ten fingers above the earth and above that He is not present. It is not so. It means something different. It means that this expression of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is in the phase of extroversion. But how is this phase possible? What kind of phase is it? Let us take the story of creation. It is right to say that there is Cosmic entity and the Cosmic consciousness which are transcendental entities. But nothing concrete is created. The flow continues and gradually emerge geometrical figures of sentient, mutative and static principles. Then only it can be felt that there will be a systolic vibration in the body. Vibration is always wavy, always systaltic, always pulsative. Due to this the feeling of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; comes in the creation. This &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; feeling is extremely dominant. In all of us there is an &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling and you know that &ldquo;I&rdquo; by your name, by your body and by your activity. Due to our worldly existence we know that I am the master of so and so. The removal of this feeling is extremely difficult. The feeling that I am now here is most difficult for us to bring in ourselves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->After the first phase of the sain&#x32D;cara, namely, the basic principle, there is a second phase known as the primordial state or primordial principle. It is difficult to understand the expression in the primordial principle. After this due to clash and cohesion, waves make their appearance, which is then known as the vibrational principle. There are some glands in some parts of the human body which are in the scope of vibrational principle. There are others which come in the scope of primordial principle. What is our Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? Right from the starting point of physical expression it moves in an upward direction. We have to cross the vibrational principle in order to reach the realm of primordial principle, from where we have to come to the basic principle. In the scripture they say that we have to lift the Kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii from the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra to reach up the Sahasra&#x301;ra: Kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii means coiled serpentine. &ldquo;Coiled&rdquo; means that the potential energy is in coiled form. The five lower cakras &ndash; mu&#x301;ladha&#x301;ra, sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na, ma&#x301;n&#x301;ipura, ana&#x301;hata and vishuddha cakra are the controlling seats of fundamental factors. Then what is above vishuddha Cakra? There comes the scope of mind. From a point in the pituitary gland of the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; Cakra the mind is controlled both directly and indirectly. This is the scope of expression. Above the primordial, in the space up to the basic, up to the Sahasrara Cakra there is no expression, nor does it have the realization of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; feeling; So Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;&#146;s scope is also in A&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; Cakra and the fundamental factors beneath it. He is also present in the space between the A&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; Cakra and Sahasra&#x301;ra Cakra. His rule is present there too. This space is ten fingers long. Thus it is said that His rule is in this physical world as well as ten fingers above it.<!-- /block --></p>
