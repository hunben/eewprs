<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the concluding portion of &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Supra-Aesthetic Science&rdquo;, the last discourse of this book, the following two especially devotional shlokas have been referred to:<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="plain"><center>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</center></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Gopa&#x301;lapa&#x301;lam&#x301; Shishupa&#x301;lapa&#x301;lam&#x301; Shriikrs&#x301;n&#x301;acandram&#x301; satatam&#x301;<br>nama&#x301;mi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->These two shlokas are the verbal expression of the particular devotional feeling that the jiivas realize on the eve of their total merger into the Cosmic flow, having arrived step by step at the pinnacle of devotion. This appendix is intended to explain the underlying import of these two shlokas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Vrinda&#x301;vana. The presence of Vrajagopa&#x301;la in Vrindavana is a symbolic expression of the Cosmic presence in the spiritual stratum. Normally that presence remains beyond the psychic periphery of unit beings. Vrindavana in this case does not represent the physical Vrindavana. It represents human sentimentality, the sweetest recesses of the human heart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The subtlest, the most delicate, portion of the human mind is the controlling point of human cordiality. When the human mind is focused on that particular point, it starts to experience the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;aliila&#x301; [Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s pastimes with His devotees]. The human heart, which is Vrindavana, is the nucleus of all the warmth and sweetness of the human mind. Human beings are always eager to rush towards the mohanatattva [supreme attractive force] which lies covert in the inner Vrindavana. Parama Purus&#x301;a also enhances the degree of spiritual attraction and increases the jiivas&#146; desire to rush towards Him. Due to this intense spiritual attraction the mind refuses to entertain any other psychic object. One may try in vain to persuade the mind to desist from thinking of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but even then the mind will think of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and nothing else. Human beings at that stage lose their ordinary propensities and cling to their spiritual object alone. Thus microcosmic bearing is turned into Macrocosmic bearing.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[The restless mind rushes towards Him not caring for anything else.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The person who has intellectually understood this sweet Entity but who has not brought Him within the domain of realization is really bha&#x301;gyahata [unfortunate]. The one who has realized this Entity is really bha&#x301;gyaba&#x301;n [fortunate]. He or she listens to the divine music of the magic flute and is transported in joy. Therefore a mystic poet has said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Adya&#x301;pi a&#x301;ma&#x301;r Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a ba&#x301;nsharii ba&#x301;ja&#x301;y,<br>Kona kona bha&#x301;gyaba&#x301;n shun&#x301;iba&#x301;re pa&#x301;y.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->[My beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a plays His flute even today. Only the lucky ones get to listen to His music.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->At that stage all the discriminating tendencies of spiritual aspirants are obliterated, the intellect ceases to function, and Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the naraliila&#x301; of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the physical Vrindavana, even the dust of Vraja [Vrajaren&#x301;u], all become fused into one. Strangely enough, in the human mind where innumerable thought-waves rise and fall, there remains only one thought, the thought of Vrindavana. Naraliila&#x301;. Let us come to naraliila&#x301;. The question arises, if Parama Purus&#x301;a, or Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, constantly remains in the inner Vrindavana of the human heart, then what is the necessity of His assuming human form in order to come in contact with microcosms. Why this naraliila&#x301; &ndash; the taking of human form by Parama Purus&#x301;a to fulfil His divine mission? Parama Purus&#x301;a has two manifestative aspects &ndash; nitya&#x301;nanda bha&#x301;va [Parama Purus&#x301;a in His original and impersonal form], and liila&#x301;nanda bha&#x301;va [ Parama Purus&#x301;a in His operational expression]. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a came to earth in the form of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti for the restoration and dissemination of devotion and spiritual bha&#x301;va. To highly-evolved spiritual aspirants, the naraliila&#x301; of Parama Purus&#x301;a is as sweet as His Prabhuliila&#x301;, or nitya&#x301;nanda bha&#x301;va. So the devotee who has established perfect parallelism with the Cosmic flow of Parama Purus&#x301;a is bound to sing the glories of naraliila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Govardhana cetanashiila&#x301;. &ldquo;Govardhana&rdquo; in common parlance refers to the Govardhana Mountain where Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a played His divine sport. However, the subtle significance is this: Go means the indriyas, and vardhana means &ldquo;nourishment&rdquo;. So govardhana means &ldquo;that which sustains and develops the indriyas&rdquo;. And cetanashiila&#x301; means &ldquo;living stone&rdquo; [a stone which expands in volume over time]. Due to the desire of my beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the indriyas and microcosmic minds develop like a cetanashiila&#x301;. When the entire capacity of the indriyas is pinnacled, the indriyas  become suspended in the mind, and the mind becomes suspended in Parama Purus&#x301;a. To the extent that the indriyas are not developed, people think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is as inaccessible as a jewel lying at the bottom of the ocean, as the stars in the sky. Conversely, when the indriyas are developed, one feels that He is no longer inaccessible. Hence jaya Govardhana cetanashiila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Shrii Yamuna&#x301;. Just as there is a Yamuna River in the physical sphere, in the subtle psychic sphere also there is a certain flow which leads microcosms towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. It was by the Yamuna that Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a used to move, playing His divine sport. To the devotees the Yamuna remains a hallowed memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Vrajaren&#x301;u. &ldquo;Vraja&rdquo; ordinarily means the land of Mathura where Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a played His unique and historical role, and ren&#x301;u means dust particles. Vraja in the philosophical sense implies movement while getting joy. When spiritual aspirants move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, it does not denote physical movement but psychic movement. This movement in the world of bha&#x301;va is called vraja parikrama&#x301; [circumambulation in the psycho-spiritual sphere]. This vraja parikrama&#x301; is a sacred act. Just as in the naraliila&#x301; of my beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a every dust particle of Vraja became sacred due to the holy visits of countless devotees, so the bha&#x301;varen&#x301;u of the paths of the psycho-spiritual world, trodden by countless sa&#x301;dhakas, is equally sacred. Hence the heart of the devotee sings jaya to Vrajaren&#x301;u.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Kuin&#x32D;javana. In ordinary parlance, kuin&#x32D;javana means an arbour, a small place surrounded by foliage. In the spiritual sphere, kuin&#x32D;javana implies a very secret cavity in the human heart from where Parama Purus&#x301;a sends out His irresistible divine call to His numerous devotees. This kuin&#x32D;javana is the favourite haunt of Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. If it had not been for kuin&#x32D;javana, from where would He have sent out His divine call?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->[Gopika&#x301;ven&#x301;u. Ven&#x301;u means &ldquo;bamboo flute&rdquo;, and gopika&#x301;ven&#x301;u means &ldquo;a flute which emits melodious notes regaling the hearts of devotees&rdquo;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Hence gopika&#x301;ven&#x301;u and kuin&#x32D;javana are equally dear to devotees. When the jiivas are about to merge their microcosmic existence in the Macrocosmic existence, they become confused. They remain in ecstasy while thinking about physical things such as Govardhana, cetanashiila&#x301;, Shrii Yamuna&#x301;, Vrajaren&#x301;u, kuin&#x32D;javana and gopika&#x301;ven&#x301;u. They make no differentiation between things of the mundane and spiritual worlds. They sing the glories of naraliila&#x301; at one moment, and at the next moment they sing the glories of Parama Purus&#x301;a, or Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. However, the mental balance is tipped in favour of Parama Purus&#x301;a, Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Finally arrives the long-awaited aparoks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti [direct realization]. In that auspicious moment the sa&#x301;dhaka fully comprehends the hidden import of the supreme stance and cries out in joy, &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, I couldn&#146;t realize You until now. But now I understand that You are that very Gopa&#x301;lapa&#x301;laka, Shishupa&#x301;lapa&#x301;laka.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Here gopa&#x301;la means the jiiva&#x301;tman. That is, gopa&#x301;la means the forces of light. Go, as I have already said, means indriya, and gopa&#x301;la means the reflecting plate of the indriyas, that is, the jiiva&#x301;tman. Parama Purus&#x301;a is &ldquo;Gopa&#x301;lapa&#x301;la&rdquo; [pa&#x301;la means &ldquo;protector&rdquo;] because He is the lord of all jiiva&#x301;tmas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->He is also Shishupa&#x301;lapa&#x301;la. &ldquo;Shishupa&#x301;la&rdquo; here means the forces of darkness. So Parama Purus&#x301;a is also &ldquo;Shishupa&#x301;lapa&#x301;la&rdquo; because He does not annihilate those forces, but instead creates a congenial environment for their evolution to higher stages of existence. It implies that just as the Lord protects the virtuous in a positive way, He also protects the wicked in another way which is proper for them. He is the protector of both sinners and saints. Hence I salute that Shriikrs&#x301;n&#x301;acandram, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram [Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the Beautiful], the repository of endless virtues. I salute Him not a million times, but always, in every fraction of a second.<!-- /block --></p>
