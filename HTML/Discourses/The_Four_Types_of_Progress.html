<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know, in our universe nothing is static, nothing is stationary, everything moves. Movement is the order of nature. Movement is the order of [the psychic realm, also]. Where there is no movement, there is no beginning of [life]. Immobility means complete death. This physical world, in all its five fundamental factors, is always moving, and nothing in the universe can be separated from this collective flow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In human structures, there is internal movement within the small protoplasmic cells. [Similarly in protozoa.] In metazoic structures, the [intercellular] spaces are always increasing or decreasing, and in this way there is movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[Our minds] move internally and create external pressure on other microcosms, and also create a commotion in the Supreme Macrocosmic structure. Nothing is static, nothing is stationary. In this way, in a spiritual [context], the path never ends.  It begins at one extreme in the least subtle form of the Macrocosm and keeps moving towards [eternal blessedness].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This is the system, in the small sphere of the atom as well as in other material structures. Mars moves with its satellites, Deimos and Phobos. The sun and all its planets move in eternal space. Nothing is without movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->(1) In the human structure, in all the living structures, in the case of all animate objects, there is complete movement. Your mind is attached to portions of the physical body, the nerve fibres and nerve cells to which everything is connected. This is your physical movement. Your physico-psychic body<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> associated with your physical body moves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->(2) Then your second movement is your psychic movement. (Your first movement is your physical movement, the movement of the nerve fibres, of the nerve cells. The second movement is your psychic movement.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->(3) The third movement is your psycho-spiritual movement, that begins in the psychic sphere and moves toward the spiritual self.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[(4) And the fourth movement is spiritual movement.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Regarding psychic movement and psychic progress, this psychic movement is not only a movement of human beings but a movement of all living beings, of all animals and of all plants which move psychically. In this psychic movement, human minds can move from one point to another, one projection converted into another projection, one psychic matrix transmuted into another matrix or matrices. In the case of plants, however, this psychic movement is nothing but inborn instinct. In the case of [un]developed animals also, the movement is nothing but inborn instinct. They move by instinct, there is no autonomous thinking. In the case of [under]developed animals, there is a small touch of autonomous thought; in the case of humans, they can think anything and everything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->This is the speciality of human beings &ndash; autonomous thinking. And when this is strangled, impeded or restrained by something internal or external, the impeding entity is a dangerous entity for human progress. When human psychic growth is stopped in this way, the restriction that has impeded human ideas or thinking or human projections can be called dogma. The progress of human society must be always free from all types of dogmas; otherwise human progress will move forever backwards. Human progress will be blocked forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The third human progress, as mentioned, is psycho-spiritual progress. What is psycho-spiritual progress? We obtain pleasure from our spiritual progress or through our psychic approximations or through different types of psychic projections, either internal or external. Depending on the subtleness of the object of projection, the more blissful or happy one will be. In this way, each and every human being must strive for this psycho-spiritual progress. This is the special realm of human beings. No animal can make this psycho-spiritual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->But the best progress is spiritual progress. When the psychic body of the intellectual person directs itself towards this spiritual progress, this summit, this goal of human propensities; when it marches towards knowledge and finally becomes one with the highest wisdom within the kingdom of eternal knowledge;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> this is spiritual progress. A spiritual aspirant must always remember that within himself or herself there is a happy blending of progress in all the four spheres: physical, psychic, psycho-spiritual and spiritual.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Recently I said, perhaps in Israel or in Turkey, that among these four types of progress, the physical and the psychic are objective in nature and the psycho-spiritual and spiritual are subjective in nature. That is, in human beings there are two important options of progress: the objective and the subjective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In this world, you require food, medicine, shelter, education and so many other things; a healthy economic structure, a life free from exploitation; things for the healthy maintenance of your physical body and to maintain the proper order of the objective level. You cannot ignore, you cannot deny, your necessities. You should carry out your duty in this objective sphere, and at the same time you must not forget that you are a glorified human being. You have to elevate yourself to the excellence of human glory, to the greatness of humanity. In this way, your progress in the psycho-spiritual sphere must go forward without barriers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In this kingdom of psycho-spiritual movement, human beings cannot tolerate any barriers. Also you should remember that your original source is the Supreme Father. He is the Causal Matrix, the Supreme Origin, the culminating point of all your movements.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->In this way all your energies, all your tendencies, must be goaded towards that Supreme Entity, Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Father, who created everything. Therefore I must say that yours should be a happy blending of objective and subjective worlds. Ours is a subjective approach with objective adjustment, towards the subjective goal of the Supreme. This is the blissful blending of the objective and subjective worlds. If this blissful blending is achieved, a human society will be created. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->A subjective approach is the important question, but while you move towards the subjective end, you must maintain an adjustment with the objective world. There is no alternative. And this goal, when human society will be established in this supreme idea in the very near future, will produce a more constructive human society according to a plan.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The humanity of the universe will unite; and we await anxiously that happy moment.<!-- /block --></p>
