All these parts combined together were known as the <i>Tripit&#x301;aka</i>, and were called the Buddhist <i>sha&#x301;stra</i> [scripture].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The word <i>pa&#x301;li</i> originated from <i>pallii</i>, which [in adjectival form] means <i>deha&#x301;tii</i>, or "rural", "rustic" or "unsophisticated". As Bhagava&#x301;n Buddha preached in the common language of village folk, Hindu pandits named his language <i>bha&#x301;kha&#x301;</i> [colloquial language]. Pali was also known as Pa&#x301;talii Bha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301; [<i>bha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;</i> = "language"]. Common people could not follow Sanskrit, which was the language of the pandits only.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Later on the Maha&#x301;sa&#x301;m&#x301;ghikas called themselves Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;niis, and they called the Sthavirava&#x301;diis Hiinaya&#x301;niis. But the Hiinaya&#x301;niis called themselves Thera&#x301;va&#x301;diis. In India there was no state backing for Hiinaya&#x301;na except during the time of [the rulers] Kanishka, Habishka and Vasishka, and hence Hiinaya&#x301;na could not flourish. Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na had state backing, and naturally had a larger number of followers. The philosophy of the Hiinaya&#x301;niis could only be preached in Ceylon [Sri Lanka], Burma [Myanmar], Siam [Thailand], Java, Borneo, etc., whereas the philosophy of the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;niis was propagated in India, Siberia, Japan, Tibet, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There are four kinds of philosophical doctrine [discussed later in this chapter] among the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;niis. The reason for this difference of opinion is <i>a&#x301;tman</i> and its object. Bhagava&#x301;n Buddha used the word <i>atta&#x301;</i> in Pali for <i>a&#x301;tman</i>. The word <i>atta&#x301;</i> is also used in place of "self". The <i>bhiks&#x301;us</i> could not understand the sense in which Bhagava&#x301;n Buddha used the word <i>atta&#x301;</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><b>Charvaka</b>: At the time of Buddha, <i>na&#x301;stika mata</i> [the school of atheism] was predominant. Maharshi Ajita Keshakambali was the predominant pandit of the <i>na&#x301;stikas</i> [atheists]. Most of the books of <i>na&#x301;stika mata</i> were written in incomprehensible language, and so its propagation was not very widespread. Ajita Keshakambali believed in Charvaka, who propounded a materialistic philosophy. Buddhist philosophy is not a materialistic philosophy. The Charvaka school of philosophy believes in <i>caturbhu&#x301;ta</i> [four fundamental factors] only. This is also known as <i>deha&#x301;tmava&#x301;da</i> [the doctrine that the body is everything]. This philosophy accepts <i>caturbhu&#x301;ta</i>, namely, earth, water, fire and air, that is, <i>ks&#x301;iti, apa, teja</i> and <i>marut</i> [respectively]. According to Charvaka, <i>caetanya</i> [consciousness] came into existence by the combination of the four <i>bhu&#x301;tas</i> [fundamental factors], just as mixing lime and catechu produces a red colour. According to Charvaka, <i>pain&#x32D;cama bhu&#x301;ta</i> [the fifth fundamental factor] is formed like this and does not actually exist. Charvaka Philosophy does not believe in <i>a&#x301;tman, Parama&#x301;tman</i> or the Vedas. Hence Charvaka was termed <i>na&#x301;stika</i>, because those who do not believe in <i>a&#x301;tman, Parama&#x301;tman</i> or the Vedas are called <i>na&#x301;stikas</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph --><b>Buddhism</b>: Why did India accept Buddhism? There are various reasons for this, but the main ones are the following: First, the [Vedic] pandits never preached philosophy to the common people. They hated their language and called it <i>bha&#x301;kha&#x301;</i>. Secondly, at that time there was no eminent philosopher, or <i>tattvadarshii</i>. Thirdly, the people in general were not ready to accept the pandits. Fourthly, the <i>a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas</i> [spiritual teachers] of that age, Shrii Sain&#x32D;jaya and Shrii Gaya Kashyapa, could not convince Bhagava&#x301;n Buddha [of their philosophical beliefs]. All these factors led to the widespread propagation and acceptance of Buddhism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Buddhism believes in rebirth and transmigration of souls, so the question arises, who is reborn if there is no <i>a&#x301;tman</i>? This question became a point of controversy among the <i>bhiks&#x301;us</i>, and later among the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii pandits.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Buddhism believes in <i>karmaphala</i>. If <i>karmaphala</i> is accepted, the question arises, who performs <i>karma</i> [action] and who gets the <i>karmaphala</i>? Therefore the existence of <i>a&#x301;tman</i> has got to be accepted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Towards the end of Buddha&#146;s life, some of his disciples asked him about the existence of God. They asked two questions: "Does God exist?" and "Is it a fact that God does not exist?" In reply to both questions Buddha remained silent. As Buddha remained silent to both the questions, some of his disciples interpreted this to mean that there is no God. Another section of his disciples understood that God exists. Yet a third section came forward with the interpretation that there is God, but God is beyond the expression of <i>asti</i> ["is"] and <i>na&#x301;sti</i> ["is not"]; that is, God&#146;s existence is inexplicable. Actually, God is supramental.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Shrii Shankaracharya discussed the following subjects with Buddhist philosophers: The <i>shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;diis</i> said that the universe came out of nothing and will go into nothing, everything being a dream. This was questioned by Shankaracharya, who said that even if the universe is nothing or a dreamland, there should be someone who witnessed the dream. The <i>shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;diis</i> replied that there was no dreamer. The universe is an illusion (<i>bhrama</i>), just as a rope mistaken for a snake is an illusion. Shankaracharya said that this could not be possible. The <i>shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;diis</i> said that this could only be understood through sadhana, while Shankaracharya said that it was not possible to have a dream without a dreamer. If the universe is an illusion like mistaking a rope for a snake, there had to be something like a rope which could be mistaken for the universe. Without a rope it would not be possible to mistake it for a snake. Besides this, there must be a person to make the mistake; similarly, there must be someone to have the illusion of the universe. This means that there must be some other entity to realize it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->The <i>ma&#x301;dhyamikas</i> [<i>shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;diis</i>] said that nothing does not actually mean nothing (<i>shu&#x301;nya</i>) &ndash; what you call <i>Brahma</i>, we call nothing &ndash; so the illusion of the universe is <i>Brahma</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->The <i>ks&#x301;an&#x301;ikava&#x301;diis&#146;</i> answer to Shankaracharya&#146;s question was that the illusion is always <i>ks&#x301;an&#x301;ika</i> [transient]. Shankaracharya&#146;s question on this was that, according to him, <i>Brahma</i> was <i>ana&#x301;di</i> and <i>ananta</i> but that the <i>ks&#x301;an&#x301;ika</i> entity comes in a moment and disappears the very next moment, so where does the <i>ks&#x301;an&#x301;ika</i> entity come from? Something must certainly exist between the span of creation and that of destruction. The <i>ks&#x301;an&#x301;ikava&#x301;diis</i> replied that it is destroyed with the creation. Shankaracharya replied that this shows that there is no existence. The <i>ks&#x301;an&#x301;ikas</i> felt defeated, but they still replied that the existence was negligible. This was not a satisfactory explanation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The pandits of <i>pratyaks&#x301;a va&#x301;hya vastuva&#x301;da</i> and <i>a&#x301;numeya va&#x301;hya vastuva&#x301;da</i> also argued for their philosophies, but no one could withstand the questioning of Shankaracharya, hence all four sections of Buddhism were defeated by Shankaracharya. After their defeat they made friends with Shankaracharya and accepted <i>kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii tattva</i> [the concept of raising the latent spiritual potentialities in human beings], and as a result [transformed] <i>Baoddha yoga&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</i> [<i>ks&#x301;an&#x301;ika vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nava&#x301;da</i>] came into existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->There are several defects in Shankaracharya&#146;s philosophy. According to Shankaracharya the universe is based on a fixed object influenced by <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;;</i> the fixed object is called <i>Brahma</i>. There is an illusion in mistaking a rope for a snake. Now the question arises, who has the illusion of [i.e., mistakes a rope for] a snake? One who already knows about snakes. If there is an illusion of <i>Brahma</i> for the universe, it means that the real universe is somewhere else. Thus the theory <i>Brahma satyam&#x301; jaganmithya&#x301;</i> is defective. This is a wrong interpretation given by Shankaracharya. Buddhists did not question it and hence it was accepted at the time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->Shankaracharya does not believe in <i>jiivas</i> [living beings] and <i>jagat</i>. Then the question arises, for what [or whom] does the illusion exist?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The universe has not been created and hence there is no <i>Sagun&#x301;a Brahma</i> [Qualified Supreme Entity]. Shankaracharya believes only in <i>Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma</i>. Shankaracharya says that the universe is like a dream and the dreamer is also <i>Brahma</i>, as he did not believe in <i>jiivas</i>. When <i>Brahma</i> is <i>nirgun&#x301;a</i> [non-qualified] how can He see, as seeing is also a quality. This was forgotten by Shankaracharya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Again, according to Shankaracharya, everything that is seen and experienced is due to the influence of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i>.

<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->Again, Shankaracharya says that there is no such thing as <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> exactly, rather <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> Itself is an illusion. A person in the desert sees water, houses, trees, etc., from a distance, but actually there is nothing. In the absence of <i>jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i>, the person experiences an illusion. When there is <i>vika&#x301;ra</i> [transformation] in <i>Brahma</i>, how can the universe be an illusion?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->Shankaracharya says that where there is <i>Brahma</i> there is <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i>. Then the question arises, is <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> nothing? If there is no <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i>, how can It influence [Brahma]? To overcome this Shankaracharya says that <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> is not even nothing, It is inexplicable (<i>anirvacaniiya</i>). Again the question arises, who created <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> if <i>Brahma</i> did not create It? Then <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> becomes <i>Sagun&#x301;a Brahma</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->3. Both believe that <i>Prakrti</i> is not within <i>Purus&#x301;a</i> but is a separate entity. This is also illogical since <i>Prakrti</i> is only energy, or the <i>shakti</i> of <i>Purus&#x301;a</i>, and like the <i>da&#x301;hika shakti</i> [burning capacity] of <i>agni</i> [fire], <i>Prakrti</i> cannot be a separate entity. These philosophies are called <i>dvaetava&#x301;da</i> [dualistic] because they believe in two separate entities: <i>Purus&#x301;a</i> and <i>Prakrti</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
