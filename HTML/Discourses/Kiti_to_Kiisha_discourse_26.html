<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->We have been discussing <I>ka</I> for a long time &ndash; today also we will continue. Last Sunday we discussed <I>kikhi</I> &ndash; isn&#146;t it? Today let us first take up the word <I>kit&#x301;i</I>. The verbal root <I>kit&#x301;</I> + suffix <I>i = kit&#x301;i</I>. The <I></I>verbal root <I>kit&#x301;</I> means to move evoking fear, to frighten, or to walk in such a manner that others feel frightened. So etymologically the word <I>kit&#x301;i</I> means &ndash; one who provokes fear in others while walking on the path. <ol> <li>The sight of a prowling wild boar evokes a feeling of fear in a person. It is just possible that the wild boar in that case did not have any intention to attack or even to frighten the person concerned. It was just roaming about as per its own sweet will. In common usage, a wild boar is therefore called a <I>kit&#x301;i</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><li>Suppose a rhinoceros is simply enjoying itself by wallowing in mud and slime &ndash; in eating mud and chewing grass. Even then a person can feel frightened, and in fact people do get frightened.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><p>Both kinds of rhinoceros &ndash; one with one horn and the other with two horns &ndash; are called <I>kit&#x301;i</I>. You surely know that a rhino is one of those prehistoric animals, which, although on the verge of extinction, somehow still survives. It is believed that the prehistoric rhino was one and half sizes larger than the present ones. Although there is no definite proof, it can be said on the basis of certain strong inferences that the ancestors of the present rhinos had several horns on the upper part of the body. Those horns were also stronger than the horns of today&#146;s rhinos. The present day rhinos have very weak vision. It is not easy to know the quality of vision of ancient rhinos. Prehistoric rhinos have evolved into the one-horned rhino, two-horned rhino, wild boar, and common hog of our time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><p>There are [[four]] major differences between the rhino and a member of the hog family. <ol> <li>The skin of a rhino is harder, thicker and more invincible than that of any other animal. The skin of the hog family, on the other hand, is very thin. It is quite unimaginable that a ferocious animal like the wild boar could have such soft skin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><p>I have seen communities in the Ranchi region boiling a wild boar along with its skin. They told me, &ldquo;Sir, after boiling you can simply rub off the skin.&rdquo; It is due to this meagre hide that the hog does not serve any commercial purpose. In ancient times items like brushes were made from the hair of particular parts of the hog&#146;s body. With the invention of plastic in modern times, that need no longer exists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><p>The invincible skin of a rhino was used as a shield in olden times. Now the use of a shield for fighting is on the wane. Rhinos have also become scarce.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><li>Another difference between a rhino and members of the hog family is that the latter avoid water and are dirty by nature. But a rhino loves water and is much cleaner than a hog. Apart from this, there are certain minor differences as well. A rhino has weak vision, while the vision of a hog is by and large quite good. A domesticated hog is a pusillanimous animal, while a wild boar is very brave and obstinate. A rhino is brave but not obstinate; it is rather jolly in temperament. So much so that even in its wild state, it is not a natural enemy of anyone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><p>Domesticated hogs are generally vegetarian, but they have no objection to eating very hideous and dirty items. Wild boars are sometimes vegetarian, sometimes carnivorous, according to the situation. However, the wild boar is a very favourite food of tigers, and tigers frequent the Sunderbans where antelopes and wild boars abound. Even then, there remains some kind of long and distant familiarity between the tiger and the wild boar. An adult wild boar avoids the adult tiger. An adult wild boar kills the tiger cub and eats its flesh. And an adult tiger kills the wild boar that is yet to come of age and eats its flesh. The flesh of the wild boar is a very favourite food of the tiger.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><p>Once upon a time there was a dense population of wild boars in every part of Bengal. Names like Barabanii (<I>Bara&#x301;habanii</I>, that is, the forest inhabited by many boars), Barabhum (<I>Bara&#x301;habhu&#x301;m</I>: the capital was Bara&#x301;haba&#x301;za&#x301;r &ndash; Barabazar), bear evidence of this. The name of Baranagar near Kolkata, however, is of recent origin. It is said that the Portuguese used to export pork from that town. That is why the place was named Bara&#x301;hanagar [<I>Bara&#x301;ha</I> or <I>Bara&#x301;</I> means a &ldquo;boar&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><p>A rhino is vegetarian by nature. It is not the enemy of any particular animal. Daunted by its hard, thick and adamantine skin, no one dares to attack it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><p>At one time there were rhino populations in various parts of India. What to speak of the prehistoric age, even just one hundred and fifty years ago, herds of rhinos used to roam the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region. Many rhinos lived at the foot of the Rajmahal hills, in the Birbhum district and along the southwest bank of the Padma and Bhagirathii rivers. The smaller sized rhinos thrived in the Sundarbans even one hundred and fifty years ago. The flesh of the rhino was a very favourite food, [a delicacy] for the Bengalis of that period. One feels quite astounded to learn or to think that human beings have killed the rhinos not only for their horns or skin but also for the flesh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><p>In India some rhinos still exist; they are found in the Duars region of North Bengal and upper Assam, the temperate plains of Bhutan and central Nepal. Everywhere they are counting the days until their final extinction. Human beings of ancient times believed that the medicine made from the rhino&#146;s horn could rejuvenate them. So the cruel practice of poaching rhinos prevailed in every age and continues to prevail even today. The situation has come to such a pass that the few one-horned or two-horned rhinos that still remain may disappear any time from the face of the earth. Although there is a slight increase in their population in the Kaziranga Sanctuary of Assam, one rarely comes across them in ordinary forests. The medicinal properties of the rhino horn are neither a verified truth nor has it any scientific basis. Is it not extremely abominable to exterminate an innocent creature due to some wrong notion?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><p>Let me mention in this connection that fossil records provide evidence that at one time rhinos thrived in coastal Orissa, Caromandal, at the foot of the Sivalic range [Himalaya], in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Hariyana. Quite large-sized rhinos inhabited Bankura of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region and Manbhum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><p>According to some, one branch of ancestors of the hog family, of the rhinos and boars, when attacked by more ferocious animals, escaped into the water, and these are now known as porpoises. Like the boars, the porpoises are also mammals. Since, strictly speaking, the porpoises were originally terrestrial animals, they cannot breathe properly under water. That is why even today they surface from time to time above the water and then again dive under.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><p>There are various reasons by which it can be proved and established that the porpoise is a descendant of certain prehistoric terrestrial animals. But it cannot be emphatically claimed that a porpoise is the descendant of a member of a hog family, because the members of the hog family are strongly allergic to water. The population growth rate of domesticated hogs is exceptionally high. In this regard, it exceeds any other terrestrial creature. In the insect family it is comparable only to a <I>kit&#x301;ibha</I> [locust].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><li>The population growth rate of wild boars is much lower than that of domesticated hogs. The population growth of rhinos is miserably low. On the one hand a minimal increase in population and on the other the slaughtering ceremony of the human beings &ndash; the combination of the two has brought rhinos to the brink of extinction. Officially not a single rhino remains in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region or in the Sunderbans. In this connection, let me tell you that the horn of a rhino is nothing but a thick, solid mass of hair.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><li>Rhinos like a humid tropical climate, and they live only in such regions. However, hogs are seen to survive in any climate and in any part of the world except unusually cold regions. While in Spain sitting on a hillock on the beach of the Mediterranean, I saw the wild boars of that country. Although they appeared to be like the wild boars of Bengal in every respect, I noticed a difference in complexion. The wild boars may not be declining in number as fast as the rhinos, but they are also fast heading towards extinction. From my personal experience I know that at one time a substantial number of wild boars inhabited the River Behula basin (Ga&#x301;un&#x32D;gur) in Burdwan district. I doubt if even a few still remain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><p>Both rhinos and wild boars are called <I>kit&#x301;is</I>. So in order to make a distinction between the two in ancient times, certain scholars used to describe the rhino as a big <I>kit&#x301;i.</i> </ol></ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><i>Kit&#x301;ibha</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><i>Kit&#x301;i + bha + d&#x301;a = kit&#x301;ibha</I>. The etymological meaning of the word <I>kit&#x301;ibha</I> is &ldquo;that which looks like a <I>kit&#x301;i</I>&rdquo;. In common usage, <I>kit&#x301;ibha</I> means the following: <ol> <li>Bug. There are two reasons why a bug is called <I>kit&#x301;ibha</I>. Suppose you have returned very tired &#133; it is already night &#133; you are about to sleep. Then suddenly you notice a bug on your bed. Well, you might have immediately killed the bug. But you are left with the apprehension that since you have spotted one bug, there must be more bugs in the bed. &ldquo;I will lose my sleep for nothing tonight.&rdquo; You are frightened by the bleak prospect of spending an agonizing night. The kind of fear that you experience on seeing the bug is similar to the kind of fear you have on seeing a rhino or a boar. So a bug is called <I>kit&#x301;ibha</I>, that is, like a <I>kit&#x301;i</I> [rhino].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><li>In ancient times people used to say that there is another reason for calling a bug <I>kit&#x301;ibha</I>. That is, if you look at a bug through a magnifying glass, making it fifty or hundred times larger than its actual size, you will see that it is a creature of horrifying appearance. Howsoever brave and valorous you may be, you are sure to be frightened by the terrible sight of the hugely magnified bug. That is why another name for bug is <I>kit&#x301;ibha</I>. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

For example, the insects which are nurtured in the <I>sha&#x301;l</I> tree or the jujube tree <I></I>are known as <I>tasara kiit&#x301;a</I>. <I>Tasara</I> [a coarse silk] is produced in ample quantity in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region and in the <I>sha&#x301;l</I> forest of Chotonagpur. The weaving of <I>tasara</I> cloth used to be done extensively in Katwa, Raniganj, Bankura and in the Tantiipara of Birbhum. There was a time when Bengal <I>tasar</I> was famous outside India. The Europeans loved to wear suits made of <I>tasar</I>.

The climate of certain parts of Bengal and Bihar is congenial to the production of <I>muga&#x301;</I> silk.

<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph --><p>The cultivation of mulberry silk was introduced into India a few thousand years ago under the influence of China. That is why the alternative name of mulberry silk in Bengali and Sanskrit is <I>ciina&#x301;m&#x301;shuk</I>. When the word <I>kiit&#x301;aja</I> is used to mean silk, it becomes a neuter gender; that is, its form will be <I>kiit&#x301;ajam</I> (like the word <I>phala</I>). The mulberry silk is called <I>garad</I> in Bengali. Although many <I></I>types of <I>garad</I> exist, there are primarily two kinds; one is <I>ghiya&#x301;</I> (ghee-coloured) and the other is <I>dudhiya&#x301;</I> (shining white). When the chrysalis of the mulberry silk breaks out of the cocoon, then the threads become coarse. It is then called <I>mat&#x301;ka&#x301;</I> instead of <I>garad</I>. When the chrysalis of a <I>tasar</I> breaks out of its cocoon, the coarse thread produced is called <I>ket&#x301;e</I> instead of <I>tasar</I>. Afterwards the silkworm was taken from Bengal to Kashmir and Mysore. Kashmir silk, Bangalore silk or Mysore silk are actually local variations of Murshidabad silk.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="122"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph --><li>In intelligence a monkey is somewhat close to human being. There are, however, some mentally retarded persons, whose intelligence is less than a monkey&#146;s. The word <I>ba&#x301;nara</I> is generally used for them. &ldquo;You have the shape of a human being but your intelligence is like a monkey&#146;s &ndash; stop aping please.&rdquo; Whatever may be the level of intelligence, a monkey does not wear clothes, although it understands the difference between water and fire. That is why the word <I>kiisha</I> means &ldquo;a monkey&rdquo;.<!-- /block --><br>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph --><p>One Mr. Mukherjee used to live in our city. When he used to stay in his own village in Burdwan district, all the village people used to gather at his house in the evening and sit round him listening to his stories. When he would come to our town in connection with his work, it was a common sight that, if not the city people, the local people would be pestering him for stories. They would go on clamouring, &ldquo;Mr. Mukherjee, sir, please tell us stories &#133; we want stories &#133; more stories &#133; colourful stories &#133; funny stories.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph --><p>Mr. Mukherjee was a very simple, gentle, refined and unassuming gentleman. If a difficult question occurred in anybody&#146;s mind, people used to bring it to the notice of Mr. Mukherjee, and he would invariably answer it to their satisfaction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph --><p>Once Mr. Subodh Ganguly, a very close acquaintance of mine, asked Mr. Mukherjee, &ldquo;Well, Mr. Mukherjee, you say that monkeys are very intelligent. Why don&#146;t they wear shirts and pants like us?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph --><p>Mr. Mukherjee said, &ldquo;It&#146;s a very difficult question. It involves societal norms, economics and social progress. So I can answer only after I have given serious thought to it.&rdquo; The next day Mr.. Mukherjee appeared with a grave look &#133; a distressed mind ... wrinkles on his forehead.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph --><p>Everybody asked, &ldquo;What&#146;s the matter, Mr. Mukherjee? What happened?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph --><p>Mr. Mukherjee said, &ldquo;Just see! All my fun and stories have been nipped in the bud by the radio news.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="129"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=129 type=paragraph --><p>Subodh said, &ldquo;I thought that today you would answer my question. So won&#146;t you then sit on the veranda this evening?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph --><p>Mr. Mukherjee said, &ldquo;No, today my mind is in a very bad condition. Our great government will impose taxes even on petty government officers like me. Today I am not in a position to have our session. You wait for 15 to 20 minutes alternately, and see; if I turn up, well and good; otherwise, you&#146;ll know that I&#146;ve gone to bed.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=131 type=paragraph --><p>Mr. Mukherjee&#146;s audience kept on anxiously waiting for him, like crows at a sacred place, looking all the while at the sky. But, alas, no one heard the footsteps of Mr. Mukherjee.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=132 type=paragraph --><p>Then suddenly came the sound of Mr. Mukherjee&#146;s footsteps [and they saw his] quiet, controlled, expressionless face. The wrinkles of anxiety had vanished. With profound conviction, Mr. Mukherjee exclaimed, &ldquo;Eureka! &#133;Eureka! &#133; Got it! &#133; Got it!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="133"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=133 type=paragraph --><p>All the people shouted in chorus, &ldquo;What have you got Mr. Mukherjee? What have you got? Please tell us. Please!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="134"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=134 type=paragraph --><p>Mr. Mukherjee replied, &ldquo;Then hear a few secret words &ndash; very confidential, philosophical statements &#133;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph --><p>Some time ago, the world conference of monkeys was held in Kiskindhya&#x301;nagar [the habitat of monkeys according to the <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I> epic]. There some of the wise and highly qualified delegates said, &ldquo;We must keep pace with the progress of civilization. Since the hoary past, a monkey is called <I>kiisha</I>. The word <I>kiisha</I> means one who has knowledge, intelligence and everything, but who does not wear trousers and coats. It is time we think seriously whether in the changed situation we should start wearing trousers and coats.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=136 type=paragraph --><p>Many heavyweight MP&#146;s were also present in that conference. They said, &ldquo;In such serious matters as this, we should not take any decision. Rather, let us take a poll &ndash; and let us form a high-powered commission.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=137 type=paragraph --><p>The delegates reacted in a chorus: &ldquo;There is no means to know which monkey is living publicly or secretly in which part of the world and on which tree! Moreover, not all monkeys understand the language of all monkeys communities, because there are linguistic differences in each community. There is no script either&#133;. nor is there any written literature&#133; not a single newspaper on record. So the media used for tabulating public opinion will not be of much use. In this situation, instituting a powerful commission is sure to be very effective.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="138"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=138 type=paragraph --><p>A powerful commission was formed, and it was resolved that everybody would be bound by the decision of the commission.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="139"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=139 type=paragraph --><p>In due course of time, the verdict of the commission was published. The commission recommended a special type of three-quarters trousers (neither half nor full) so that the tail could easily come out from between the legs. On the body, there would be a kind of nylon shirt, which would not get torn when in contact with the branch of a tree, nor would it give way when pierced by a thorn. There would be no need to send these trousers and shirts recommended by the commission to the laundry (washerman&#146;s house) for six months. In other words, this dress would be most convenient in every respect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="140"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=140 type=paragraph --><p>A few days after the publication of the commission&#146;s recommendations, another conference was convened. The organizers of the conference declared, &ldquo;The recommendations of the commission are definitely acceptable, but meanwhile an untoward event has taken place. After the publication of the commission&#146;s verdict, the deputy minister of the social welfare department contacted a reliable supplier. The name of that agency is Universal Traders Company Unlimited. They were prepared to supply an unlimited quantity of clothes to all the countries of the world. They would have continued to do so, but eventually there developed a difference of opinion between the agency and the deputy minister.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="141"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=141 type=paragraph --><p>The deputy minister told the supplier, &ldquo;All the monkeys of the world will wear your clothes. So you will make a huge profit. For this you must pay me at least ten lakh rupees as <I>sela&#x301;mi</I> [bribe].&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="142"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=142 type=paragraph --><p>The clothing company replied, &ldquo;If we pay you ten lakh <I>salami</I>, the deal will not be commercially viable. We can pay you five lakh at the most. Not a chipped cowry more! Moreover, you know that the monkey population is always on the wane, like the moon of the dark fortnight. The demand that we have today will not be there tomorrow.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="143"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=143 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;As a result of the haggling between the clothing company and the deputy minister, the plan of wearing cloth was abandoned.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="144"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=144 type=paragraph --><p>All asked, &ldquo;Then?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="145"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=145 type=paragraph --><p>The President of the conference said, &ldquo;Then, in private discussion with both parties, we settled it at seven and half lakh.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="146"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=146 type=paragraph --><p>All anxiously asked in a chorus, &ldquo;Then? Then?? Then???&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="147"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=147 type=paragraph --><p>The President said, &ldquo;Now there is no hindrance in using the trousers and shirts made by the company; there is no reason to object either.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="148"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=148 type=paragraph --><p>Then suddenly a young monkey M.P. (a young Turk) shouted, &ldquo; This can&#146;t be allowed ! This can&#146;t be allowed. Clothing not allowed! Not allowed!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="149"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=149 type=paragraph --><p>Everybody asked, &ldquo;Why? &#133;Why?? &#133;Why???&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="150"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=150 type=paragraph --><p>The young monkey explained, &ldquo;Suppose we all wear trousers and shirts, then what will be the difference between humans and uourselves? Moreover, even the best part of the tail will remain hidden in the trousers. And therefore, the most honourable Government will not spare us. At once income tax will be imposed on us. So if we want to save ourselves from the clutches of the income tax, we&#146;d continue to be <I>kiisha</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="151"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=151 type=paragraph --><p>The followers of the young monkey shouted in a chorus, &ldquo;Not allowed! Not allowed!! Clothing not allowed!!! &#133; Not allowed&#133;Not allowed &#133;Hoop! Hoop! Hoop!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  The name of the district is Rajsahi; the name of the district head quarters is Rampur. Rampur is part of Boyalia. That is why it used to be called Rampur-Boyalia. Nowadays many people refer to Rampur- Boyalia as Rajsahi.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)   Similarly the name of the district is Maldaha &ndash; the name of the district headquarters is English Bazar. Many people wrongly refer to English Bazar as Maldaha town. There is already a separate town named Maldaha which is now called Old Malda by many.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)   The name of the district is Murshidabad &ndash; the name of the district headquarters is Berhampur.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)   The name of the district is Birbhum &ndash; the name of the district headquarters is Suri. Formerly Rajnagar was the district head quarters.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)  The word <I>ja&#x301;du</I> is Persian; the word <I>gar</I> is also Persian. So <I>ja&#x301;dugar</I> is a Persian word. To distort into <I>ja&#x301;dukar</I> is meaningless. We can say that the word <I>ja&#x301;dukar</I> is incorrect.</p>
