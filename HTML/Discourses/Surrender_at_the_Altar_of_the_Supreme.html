<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is called Darpaha&#x301;rii, which means &ldquo;Pride-snatcher&rdquo;. One thing He will not tolerate is ego. He is uni-purposive and multilateral: He is doing everything at once. He is running the whole universe, so He is multilateral. But He is uni-purposive because He has only one purpose: to bring all His creatures back to Him, to merge in Him again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Human beings, on the contrary, are unilateral and multi-purposive. They can only do one thing at a time &ndash; they cannot do two things at once &ndash; so they are unilateral. And they are multi-purposive; they have so many desires. The human being thinks [Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; was smiling and looking steadily at one particular Margi], &ldquo;Shall I go to see my brother in America? But then if I do, I will not be  able to see Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; there! I will ask Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; what to do! But how can I ask Him? When will I see Him?&rdquo; [Later that Margi confirmed that these had been the exact thoughts going through his mind some days before he had come to Ranchi to see Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->You have only one goal in life, one duty &ndash; to surrender at the altar of the Supreme. You have only to wish &ndash; that His plan for you may be successful. I think you have understood?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->We get all our power from Him. He can do anything, and He reserves all His vast powers and does not delegate them to anyone. Why? Because they might misuse them.<!-- /block --></p>
