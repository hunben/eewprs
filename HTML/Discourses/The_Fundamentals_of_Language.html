<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Each and every language has five fundamental characteristics: The first is that it must have its own verbal forms. For instance, we say in English, &ldquo;Ram is going&rdquo;; in Hindi, Ram ja raha hay, and in Sam&#x301;skrta, Ramah gacchati. English has its own verb forms, &ldquo;is going,&rdquo; Sam&#x301;skrta also has its own verb forms &ndash; &ldquo;gacchati&rdquo;. Pa&#x301;harii Punja&#x301;bi is also a language because it too has its own verbs &ndash; for example, aks&#x301;a basha or aks&#x301;ar&#x301;a dasha. This is the first characteristic of a language: it has its own verbs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301;, there are some verb endings such as -ti (gacchati), -tah (gacchatah), -anti (gacchanti), -si (gacchasi), -thas (gacchathah), and -tha (gacchatha&#x301;), etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The second characteristic of a language is case endings for nouns, for example, &ldquo;Ram&#146;s sister is eating bread&rdquo;; in Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301; we say, Ramasya bhaginii rot&#x301;ika&#x301;m&#x301; kha&#x301;dati. In Hindi we say Ra&#x301;m rii bhaen rotii kha&#x301;ra&#x301;hii hay. And in Paha&#x301;r&#x301;ii language, Ra&#x301;m ki bhaen rot&#x301;ii kha&#x301;ndii. In Punjabi language there is a tendency to pronounce in the tirjak style (the &ldquo;a&rdquo; sound tends towards the &ldquo;o&rdquo; sound). In English &ldquo;Ram&#146;s&rdquo; means &ldquo;of Ram&rdquo;; in Sam&#x301;skrta Ramasya (we add -sya); in Hindi, Ramki; In Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii, Ram rii (the suffix -rii is added). These are called case endings; they vary from language to language, and from the linguistic point of view, every language which has its own case endings deserves to be recognized as a language. In this respect Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii Punjabi is also a language different from Hindi, since both have their different case endings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The third characteristic of a language is its own pronouns. For example, we say, &ldquo;He is going to Calcutta.&rdquo; In Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301;, Sah kalika&#x301;ta&#x301;m gacchati. In Hindi, &ldquo;Vah kalika&#x301;ta&#x301; ja raha hay.&rdquo; In Pahari, Naes&#x301;ae kalka&#x301;tta calao ja&#x301;sao. Thus each language has its own pronouns: &ldquo;he&rdquo; in English, vah in Hindi, sah in Sam&#x301;skrta and sao in Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii. (There is some similarity between Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;rii and Sam&#x301;skrta). In this respect Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii is a separate language, not merely a dialect; and Dogrii, too, is also a separate language, as I have told you previously.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The fourth characteristic of a language is that it must have its own vocabulary. Even if a learned person contradicts you in this regard, you should give a firm reply. It is my conviction that all will accept your logical opinion regarding the science of linguistics. Any language which has its own vocabulary has to be recognized as a separate language. Some reputed scholars in Hindi may argue against this; thus you should know the correct reply in advance. Some orthodox supporters of the Hindi language may argue in Hindi, and you will have to give the reply in Hindi. If you speak in English, they may not like to speak with you, because in their opinion English is a foreign language. There are some people who do this to hide their weakness in English. But the strange thing is this &ndash; that they send their own children to study in English-medium schools.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;wheat&rdquo; in English is gehun in Hindi and kanaka in Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii, kanakha in Punjabi, and kanaka in Dogrii. In Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta the original word was kanaka, from which the other derivatives kanakha, kanakan, etc. have come. From the mother language of Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta have emerged the three languages of Dogrii, Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii and Punjabi. For instance, when we say in English, &ldquo;What is the staple food of the Punjab?&rdquo; (Usually the article &ldquo;the&rdquo; is not used before the name of any particular province; but it is used before Punjab. This is a peculiarity of the English language). The Sam&#x301;skrta translation of this sentence will be saptanadasya mukhya&#x301;nnah godhu&#x301;mo&#146;sti. In Sam&#x301;skrta godhu&#x301;ma means &ldquo;wheat&rdquo;, and asti means &ldquo;is&rdquo;. (Asti in Sanskrit, ast in Persian. So you see what a great similarity there is between these two languages).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Again, in the Persian language it is said, Hanoj Dehlii du&#x301;r ast (&ldquo;Delhi is still far from here&rdquo;). Ya&#x301; dost nist dushmane dushman ast (&ldquo;He is not my friend, he is the enemy of my enemy&rdquo;.) In Sam&#x301;skrta na&#x301;sti, in Persian nist &ndash; what a close similarity! In the same way, there is another word nest na&#x301;bud (&ldquo;no solid ground under one&#146;s feet&rdquo;). The Hindi rendering of the Sam&#x301;skrta sentence Saptanadasya mukhya&#x301;nnah godhu&#x301;mo&#146;sti will be Gehun Punja&#x301;b ka&#x301;mukha khadya, and in Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;rii it will be Ka naki Punjab naedii pradha&#x301;na, or Kanaka Punjab nadii kha&#x301;s. &ldquo;Wheat&rdquo; in English is godhuma&#x301; in Sanskrit, gehu in Hindi, and kanaka in Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii. Thus these four languages each have their separate vocabularies. And as Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii has its own vocabulary, it should be recognized as a separate language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The fifth characteristic of a language is that it must have its own literature, classical or folk. Now, when the Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii farmers sing songs at the time of harvesting, are these songs composed in pure Urdu of Lucknow city? Certainly not. They are composed in the farmers&#146; own Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii language. The songs are their folk literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->These five above-mentioned characteristics are the essential conditions of a separate language. Thus I say that Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii is a full-fledged language. It is not Hindi, it altogether different. Those who cry out &ldquo;Hindi, Hindi!&rdquo; in fact want to forcibly impose the Hindi language on the Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii people so that they will become the slaves of the Hindi-speaking people, just as English was imposed on the Indian people to enslave them. This is a type of psycho-economic exploitation. Try to understand well the implication of this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Let me make the matter of psycho-economic exploitation even more clear. Suppose a certain Hindi chauvinist has come to see you. When you speak to him, you will certainly speak in Hindi, and so will he. But he is speaking his mother tongue, whereas you are not. Perhaps ungrammatical Hindi words will come out of your mouth. But it is obvious that in your expression there may be some fundamental errors, and the use of words will not be precise and to-the-point. This will create a diffidence in your mind, a kind of inferiority complex, whereas the Hindi-knowing people may suffer from superiority complex. They may think of you, &ldquo;What a fool he is! He cannot speak with grammatical precision!&rdquo; But instead if you speak in your own mother tongue, your expression will be grammatically correct. So when you speak Hindi you become somewhat inferior to those Hindi-speaking person and, talking advantage of our inferior position, they may exploit you economically. They should not be given this opportunity of psycho-economic exploitation. If  this sort of psycho-economic exploitation is tolerated, if they are given the opportunity to exploit for long, they will become rulers and you will become their subjects. This is how psycho-economic exploitation is perpetrated; in the first stage the exploiters impose inferiority complex in your mind by creating psychic pressure. When your language is suppressed, you will feel mentally inferior and develop some psychic weakness. Taking advantage of this psychic weakness, the exploiters will continue their psycho-economic exploitation. So those who advocate the cause of Hindi thus pave the way for psycho-economic exploitation. Actually they are not your friends.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->It is also true that the Hindi language has many dialects; the spoken language varies from district to district. But Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii is not a dialect of Hindi, Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii itself is a language altogether different from Hindi. I hope you have well understood these five characteristics of a language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->So if the Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii-speaking people demand that the Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii language should be used in all spheres of their social life, that will not at all be irrational; in fact, Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii should be used in courts, schools and colleges, in official correspondence, in airports, and in radio stations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Three scripts can be used writing Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii: the Ta&#x301;m&#x301;rii script which is the popular script of this region, Dogrii script which is used in the Dogrii-speaking areas, and Sirmaorii script which is used in the Nahan areas.  Devana&#x301;grii script is not popular here; it is the script of Gujarat. Hindi is also the script of Gujarat; it has no relation to the script used in this area.  The inscriptions on the rocks and stones that can be excavated from this area are not carved in Na&#x301;grii script because Na&#x301;grii script was never popular in this area. The Ta&#x301;m&#x301;rii script is popular in Kinnore area also. This script has some similarly to the Tibetan script. In a mountain cave in Tibet, it is written in Ta&#x301;n&#x301;rii script, On&#x32D;m&#x301; mane padme hum, on&#x32D;m&#x301; mane padme hum. Thus Ta&#x301;m&#x301;rii script should be used in writing the Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii language. As I already told you, when the Dogrii language will be used for local purposes, the Dogrii-speaking people will also feel proud. They will think that they, too, have something of their own, that they are not anyone&#146;s slave. If some one contradicts you in this regard, you should give them a fitting reply. Although no written book is available now, yet three or four-hundred-year old books in Dogrii script will certainly be found right in this area. If there are any Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301; knowing scholars here, they will tell you all about this. There should be many Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301;-knowing scholars, because wherever there were kings, there were Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301; schools and Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301; scholars.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->You should search for old manuscripts written on bark or palm leaves. Many manuscripts were written on bark or leaves (bhurjapatra), and I find many bhurja trees all around this area.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->As I told you earlier, the old books were not written in Devana&#x301;grii script, for this script was imposed from outside. In fact, the Devana&#x301;grii script is a script of the Gujarat scholars. As many people are not aware of the exact history, they wrongly think that Devana&#x301;grii is the original script for writing Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301;, but this is not at all the case. Actually Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301; has no script of its own; so there was a rule that when Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301; was written, it could be written in any script. Thus Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301; is always written in the script of the concerning area. It is written in Bengali script in Bengal, and in Tamil script in Madras. It is not written in Devana&#x301;ga&#x301;rii script in Madras. When the British established universities for higher education, they decided that when Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301; would be taught in each university, Devana&#x301;grii script should be used to write it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The language of Himachal Pradesh, the local language here, is born out of Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta, and Hindi is born of Shoraseni Pra&#x301;krta. Many people are not aware of this fact. Had they been aware of it, there would not be so much conflict regarding languages and scripts. Even those who are educated and respectable people are also not aware of this fact. Had they known this, they would have certainly conveyed these facts of history to others.<!-- /block --></p>
