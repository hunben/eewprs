<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discussion is sama&#x301;sa [compound words]. The word samasta is used extensively in Bengali. However in Bengali the meaning of the common Sanskrit-borrowed words samasta, sakala, samagra is not identical. It has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Yadyapi bahuna&#x301;dhiise tatha&#x301;pi pat&#x301;ha puttra vya&#x301;karan&#x301;am;<br>Svajanah svajano ma&#x301;bhu&#x301;t sakalam&#x301; shakalam&#x301; sakrt shakrt.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A language has many words which are pronounced practically the same but which have different meanings, and it also has words which have many different meanings. Then again, there are many words which differ slightly in spelling but greatly in meaning. If one is to learn how to use such words correctly one needs to study and acquire mastery in grammar. Otherwise one&#146;s own mistakes will be passed on to others. Thus the aforementioned verse says: &ldquo;O son [puttra], even though you have studied much, do study a little grammar.&rdquo; Incidentally I would like to mention that puttra is not spelled putra. The people of those days imagined that there was a certain hell by the name of Put. It was their conception that if one&#146;s son would do the ritual funeral offering then one would be saved from that hell. Adding the suffix d&#x301;a after the verbal root trae makes tra, that is, &ldquo;that which rescues [tra&#x301;n kara&#x301;]&rdquo; or &ldquo;one who saves&rdquo;. Put + trae + d&#x301;a = puttra. In other words, since both the words put and trae have a ta, the spelling of the word putra must retain the two ta&#146;s. Many people mistakenly spell the word putra. Similar is the case with ga&#x301;yattrii (gae + shatr = ga&#x301;yat + trae + d&#x301;a + the feminine iniip = ga&#x301;yattrii). It is also spelled with two ta&#146;s. The word pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya also has to be spelled with two ta&#146;s because the word is derived from pashca&#x301;t + tyaun&#x32D;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->We were discussing the necessity of learning grammar. If one knows grammar it is beneficial both at home and everywhere else. The knowledge of grammar enables a person to take their place in the society at large and to maintain good social relations with their kith and kin [a&#x301;tmiiya-svajana]. Now let us have a look at the word svajana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Svajana means &ldquo;one&#146;s own people&rdquo;, &ldquo;kinsman&rdquo;, &ldquo;relatives&rdquo;, while shvajana means kukur [dog]; the related Sanskrit words are kukkura, sa&#x301;rameya.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Hence if anyone writes shvajana instead of svajana out of ignorance or carelessness then it is doubtful whether their good relations with their svajana will remain. Even feeding them coconut ladus [a type of sweet] will not put that sweet relationship right again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The situation is similar with sakala and shakala. Kalena saha itya&#x301;rthe &ldquo;sakala&rdquo;. Kala means &ldquo;sprout&rdquo;. Sakala means &ldquo;that from which the sprout has emerged&rdquo;, in other words, that which is manifest or expressed. Everything in this universe is a manifest entity. For example, in philosophy it is called sakala brahma, that is, manifest brahma. When unmanifest it is nis&#x301;kala brahma or nirgun&#x301;a brahma. But if the word is written with sha, that is, shakala, then its meaning becomes &ldquo;piece&rdquo; or &ldquo;part&rdquo;. For example, upalasakala refers to an entire pebble while upalashakala refers to a piece of a pebble. A simple little error like this turns the meaning of the word upside down. Sakrt means &ldquo;once&rdquo;, for example, sakrt kuru &ndash; &ldquo;do it once&rdquo;. Shakrt, however, means &ldquo;feces&rdquo;; its Vedic synonyms are ucca&#x301;ra, mala, etc. The word socca&#x301;ra that even many educated people write or say nowadays to mean &ldquo;vocal&rdquo; is completely erroneous. The meaning of the word socca&#x301;ra is &ldquo;one who has defecated but who has not yet cleaned themselves&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->It is a good idea, not only with Sanskrit and Bengali grammar, but also with the different foreign words used in Bengali, to know something about how to use them. Many people use the word vadan to mean &ldquo;countenance&rdquo;. I have seen in Bengali poetry: nishidin heri tava prasanna vadan [day and night I behold your pleasing countenance]. Does the word vadan come from the Sanskrit verbal root vad and the suffix anat&#x301;? No, not at all. If it had come from the Sanskrit verbal root vad then its use would have been limited to matters connected with the vocal apparatus, that is, limited to the tongue, soft palate, and lips. It certainly would not be used for the entire face. Actually the word is Farsi and its primary meaning is &ldquo;countenance&rdquo;, that is, primarily the entire face and secondarily the entire front side of the body. If I say in Urdu vadanpar cot&#x301; la&#x301;gii hae, then it does not mean that a blow has been struck only to the lips and tongue, nor to the brow, cheek, nose, lips. In this case it means that the entire body has been injured, especially the front side. Hence it would be better not to say nishidin heri tava prasanna vadan because the face, hands, feet, shoulder are not pleasing or unpleasing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now the meaning of sakala and samasta are not the same. The meaning of the word sakala has already been discussed and the meaning of the word samasta is &ldquo;the united form of many&rdquo;, what is called &ldquo;collective body&rdquo; in English. The substantive form of the adjective samasta is sama&#x301;sa. Thus the meaning of the word sama&#x301;sa becomes &ldquo;the meaningful condensed form of a word cluster&rdquo;. We can also call it a &ldquo;compound word&rdquo;. For example, the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; [ra&#x301;jasabha&#x301;] in Farsi is ada&#x301;lat or kacha&#x301;rii; these have become a&#x301;da&#x301;lat and ka&#x301;cha&#x301;ri in Bengali. &ldquo;Dancer&rdquo; is narttaka. So if we want to say ra&#x301;jasabha&#x301;r narttaka in English we would say &ldquo;dancer of the court&rdquo;. Instead of using so many words we can also condense it and say &ldquo;court-dancer&rdquo;. This saves time and effort and a new compound word has also been created. The compound word in this instance is formed by combining the first word &ldquo;court&rdquo; and the second word &ldquo;dancer&rdquo;. This kind of compound word is found in practically every language of the world but only in Sanskrit and its daughter languages has the compound word-dependent sama&#x301;sa been extended grammatical acceptance. Although sama&#x301;sa exists in other languages it has not been extended full acceptance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The &ldquo;of&rdquo; that I have used in the phrase &ldquo;dancer of the court&rdquo; is an indeclinable. Both prepositions and conjunctions in English are indeclinables. &ldquo;The&rdquo; is the definite article. Now the definite article remains unchanged in the majority of the world&#146;s languages but there are some exceptions. For example, in French the definite article le is used for masculine gender words while la is used for feminine gender words and les for the plural. So we see that in French the definite article changes according to the gender and number of the noun. For example, &ldquo;an uncle&rdquo; in French is un oncle. With elision it becomes unoncle. On the other hand, in Urdu it is ek caca&#x301; or ek cacii [an aunt]. Bear in mind that the word caca&#x301; is Urdu but the word kaka&#x301; is Farsi. The pure Bengali word is khur&#x301;a&#x301;, khur&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, the compound word &ldquo;court-dancer&rdquo; is created by removing the indeclinable &ldquo;of&rdquo; and the definite article &ldquo;the&rdquo; from the phrase &ldquo;dancer of the court&rdquo;. The English &ldquo;of&rdquo; and the Bengali ra or er are signs that denote the sixth case. Now when an indeclinable or preposition is dropped in order to form a compound word it has to be seen which indeclinable or preposition is dropped and in which case it is used. Here the indeclinable &ldquo;of&rdquo; is dropped. &ldquo;Of&rdquo; is used in the possessive case and in Bengali ra and er are used in the sambandha ka&#x301;raka [genitive case], as marks signifying the sixth case-ending. Hence the compound word, or sama&#x301;sa, which is formed by eliminating the sixth case is understood to be s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii [sixth] tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa. The sama&#x301;sa that is formed by dropping the case-ending of the first word is called tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa. Thus the word &ldquo;court-dancer&rdquo; is considered to be s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa. A similar word in English is &ldquo;courtyard&rdquo;. If we interpolate it we get &ldquo;yard of the court&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Similarly, &ldquo;expert litterateur&rdquo; signifies &ldquo;expert in literature&rdquo;. The English &ldquo;in&rdquo; is an indeclinable. In Bengali e, te and ete are used for &ldquo;in&rdquo;. These are signs which denote the seventh case. In other words, in the aforementioned example the compound word is formed by dropping the sign of the seventh case-ending &ndash; &ldquo;in&rdquo; or e. In other words, in Bengali we say sa&#x301;hityanipun&#x301;a for the English &ldquo;expert in literature&rdquo;. Hence both &ldquo;expert litterateur&rdquo; as well as sa&#x301;hityanipun&#x301;a are saptamii [seventh] tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa. So if any compound or collective word is interpolated in this way one gets the concerning sama&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now the phrase which is created to interpolate the compound word is called the sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya or vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya. We should know why the name vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya is used. In olden times when the pandits were teaching their students they used to sit on blankets or seats spread out on a wooden cot. There was a small table in front of the students. The seat on which the pandits would sit to talk about sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya was called the vya&#x301;sa&#x301;sana. And the sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya that used to be explained while sitting on that vya&#x301;sa&#x301;sana was called the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya. This vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya exists in all the world&#146;s languages and so does sama&#x301;sa. However it is only in Sanskrit and its daughter languages that sama&#x301;sa has been given full grammatical acceptance, not in any other language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->English is also full of sama&#x301;sa but sama&#x301;sa has not been unambiguously accepted in English grammar. Had it been, English grammar would have been even more systematic. Due to sama&#x301;sa meaning crystallizes and time is saved. It enriches language and increases its expressive power through the creation of a great number of new words. Hence, since sama&#x301;sa is found in practically all the world&#146;s developed languages, it should be given full grammatical acceptance. This denial of full acceptance to sama&#x301;sa is a grammatical weakness. Nothing in a sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya or vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya should be ambiguous. The more expressed the meaning is, the better. In this way one can easily determine which sama&#x301;sa it is. If it is not, if a word in the sama&#x301;sa remains implied, then it will be difficult to determine the sama&#x301;sa. Take, for example, ham&#x301;sa-dimba [swan-egg]. This compound word is not ham&#x301;ser [male swan&#146;s] dimba but rather ham&#x301;siir [female swan&#146;s] dimba because male swans do not lay eggs. So one must say ham&#x301;siir dimba. Similar is the case with cha&#x301;gadugdha [goat-milk]. Here also the sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya is cha&#x301;giir dugdha, not cha&#x301;ger dugdha. Thus the meaning in a sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya must be clearly expressed &ndash; implying it will not do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->When a relationship is established between two words and one is a figurative form of the other then it is ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya sama&#x301;sa. For example, bhasmabhu&#x301;san&#x301;a [ash-ornament] means bhasmaru&#x301;pa bhu&#x301;s&#x301;an&#x301;a [decoration in the form of ash]. Of course this is madhyapadalopii [dropping the central word] karmadha&#x301;raya, however since here bhasma [ash] is explained as a special form [ru&#x301;pa] of decoration I have called it ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya. It would not be incorrect usage if it were called madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya, however, since ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya is a part of madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya. Teachers should acquaint their students with ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya and students should point out instances of ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya in their answer papers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Another example in English is &ldquo;mother-plant&rdquo;, which becomes &ldquo;plant serving as mother&rdquo;. Here a special relationship has been established between &ldquo;plant&rdquo; and &ldquo;mother&rdquo; and a particular importance has been ascribed to &ldquo;plant&rdquo;. &ldquo;Plant&rdquo; has been given a specific role. Similarly, in Bengali if a relationship is established between ma&#x301;ta&#x301; [mother] and taru [plant] and a sama&#x301;sa is created &ndash; ma&#x301;trru&#x301;pa&#x301; taru &ndash; then a special role is ascribed to taru; that is, taru is considered to be a mother according to this special role. Since it takes a special form, that is, the form of a mother, its vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya will be ma&#x301;trru&#x301;pa taru, that is, ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya sama&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Taru in the role of mother does not imply respect or praise. We use the word nya&#x301;ya or mata to establish a relationship of respect or praise. In such a case the sama&#x301;sa no longer remains ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya. It becomes a different sama&#x301;sa. Take, for example, ra&#x301;jasim&#x301;ha. Here a special relationship is established between the words ra&#x301;ja [king] and sim&#x301;ha [lion] but no specific role has been given to either word. In other words, rather than being ra&#x301;ja&#x301; ru&#x301;pa sim&#x301;ha it is ra&#x301;ja&#x301; sim&#x301;her mata or ra&#x301;ja&#x301; sim&#x301;her nya&#x301;ya [king like a lion]. Here a comparison is drawn between the two words and the sama&#x301;sa produced by that comparison is upamita sama&#x301;sa because the king has been compared [upamita] to a lion. We should point out here that while the word ru&#x301;pa in ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya sama&#x301;sa occurs in the middle of the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya, mata or nya&#x301;ya in upamita karmadha&#x301;raya can be either in the middle or at the end of the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya, although it is generally at the end.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->When a comparison is drawn between two objects then generally the object compared is the first word and the object to which it is compared is the following word, for example, ra&#x301;jasim&#x301;ha. Here ra&#x301;ja is positioned first and sim&#x301;ha follows. Thus the sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya is ra&#x301;ja&#x301; sim&#x301;her nya&#x301;ya and it is upamita sama&#x301;sa. However in the case of sim&#x301;hava&#x301;hu the object to which it is being compared is the first word, that is, the situation is reversed. A similar example is gajer gamaner nya&#x301;ya gamana [movement like an elephant&#146;s]. Here the gamana in the following position has been compared to the gamana [movement] of an elephant. Hence it is upama&#x301;na sama&#x301;sa. An English example is &ldquo;crystal-clear&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;as clear as crystal&rdquo;. This is clearly a compound word and upama&#x301;na sama&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In Bengali grammar there is a difference between tatpurus&#x301;a and upapada sama&#x301;sa. Grha&#x301;gata &ndash; the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya for this compound word is grhe a&#x301;gata [arrived at home]. In this sama&#x301;sa the seventh case-ending mark e has been dropped making it saptamii [seventh] tatpurus&#x301;a suma&#x301;sa. When an Englishman approaches England in a ship and recognizes its familiar climate and environment he knows it is his home-climate. The meaning of this &ldquo;home-climate&rdquo; is &ldquo;climate of home&rdquo;. It has been compounded into one word. The sama&#x301;sa is formed by dropping the English indeclinable &ldquo;of&rdquo; so this is tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa, true enough. However, in the case of compounds where a specific person or thing is brought in to express the adjective of the tatpurus&#x301;a sama&#x301;sa in a special way then it is called upapada sama&#x301;sa. There the sama&#x301;sava&#x301;kya uses the pronouns jini [he, she], je [that, one], ja&#x301;ra&#x301; [those], jah [which], for example, grhe esechen jini, tini grha&#x301;gata [He who has arrived home is grha&#x301;gata] &ndash; upapada sama&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Next comes bahuvriihi sama&#x301;sa. The word briihi means &ldquo;that in which is hidden the potential for an abundance of food&rdquo;. Take paddy, for example. From paddy we get uncooked rice, cooked rice, puffed rice, beaten rice, khai [a variety of puffed rice], mur&#x301;ki [parched rice coated with molasses], and so on. Thus another name for paddy is briihi (briihi &rarr; riihi &rarr; risi &rarr; ra&#x301;is [rice]). The Modern English word &ldquo;rice&rdquo; comes from vriihi. The old Latin word riihi comes from vriihi, from riihi comes the derived word rici and from this the Modern English word &ldquo;rice&rdquo;. Hence the word bahuvriihi means &ldquo;that which has a great expressive capacity&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Let us say, for example, someone says bhasmabhu&#x301;san&#x301;a [ash-decoration]. It can have many vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya, for example, bhasmer mata bhu&#x301;s&#x301;an&#x301;a, bhasma eman bhu&#x301;s&#x301;an&#x301;a, bhasmaru&#x301;pa bhu&#x301;san&#x301;a, bhsamaru&#x301;pa bhu&#x301;s&#x301;an&#x301;a je tattve rayeche or bhasmabhu&#x301;san&#x301;a ya&#x301;r. That is, a number of sama&#x301;sa forms can be found in it. Their controlling sama&#x301;sa is vahuvriihi. Now the words ja&#x301;ha&#x301;r or ja&#x301;te (yasya or yasmina) are added to the end of the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya of all those compound words which allow the opportunity for composing more than one vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya. The aforementioned example is one &ndash; bhasma bhu&#x301;san&#x301;a ja&#x301;r. Another example of bahuvriihi sama&#x301;sa is gajagaman. Someone says gajer mata gamana &ndash; upama&#x301;na sama&#x301;sa. Another person says gajer gamana, that is, s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii [sixth] tatpurus&#x301;a. Someone else will say gajaru&#x301;pa gaman &ndash; ru&#x301;paka karmadha&#x301;raya. And yet another will say gajer gamaner mata gaman ja&#x301;r. A proper analysis of the last phrase yields the real vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya, that is, it is bahuvriihi sama&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Earlier I stated that first the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya has to be determined correctly in order to determine the sama&#x301;sa. In other words, the meaning should not be left ambiguous and the actual form shall have to be manifested. Otherwise it will not be possible to determine the sama&#x301;sa. Incidentally this reminds me of a story.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Once a lioness gave birth to four cubs in a London zoo (what we call cir&#x301;iya&#x301;kha&#x301;na&#x301;). When the news was submitted by the census officer to his boss for approval before giving it to the press for publication, it was written: &ldquo;A lioness in one London zoo has given birth to four cubs.&rdquo; The boss was displeased when he saw the news and said: &ldquo;Why has the word London been retained? That can be to the advantage of the enemy.&rdquo; So the news was edited to read: &ldquo;In one zoo of one city in England a lioness has given birth to four cubs.&rdquo; When he sent the revised report on to his boss, the boss said: &ldquo;A zoo in England means the London zoo. That can be to the advantage of the enemy.&rdquo; So it was rewritten &ldquo;A lioness has given birth to four cubs in a zoo in a certain city in one country of the earth.&rdquo; When the new report was sent to the boss he said: &ldquo;The London zoo is the best in the world. It has no equal. So if you say &lsquo;zoo&rsquo;, it means the London Zoo.&rdquo; So he revised the report to read: &ldquo;A lioness has given birth to four cubs in a certain place in a certain city in a certain country of the world.&rdquo; He in turn sent the news report to the top officer who said: &ldquo;What, have you no brains at all! &lsquo;Lion&rsquo; means a British lion. So if you say &lsquo;lion&rsquo; it will give everything away.&rdquo; So he corrected it: &ldquo;A certain animal gave birth to four young in a certain place in a certain city in a certain country of the earth.&rdquo; When the report reached the highest officer he said: &ldquo;I haven&#146;t been able to teach you or make you understand anything.

<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->As I have said, it is better not to imitate this kind of censorship. It does not provide the proper wherewithal [sura&#x301;ha&#x301;] for the determination of sama&#x301;sa. Ah yes, this word sura&#x301;ha&#x301; is also not a native Indian word. The word su, which means &ldquo;good&rdquo;, is Sanskrit and the word ra&#x301;ha&#x301;, which means &ldquo;road&rdquo;, is Farsi. The two have been blended to make one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Next comes dvigu sama&#x301;sa. Dvigu sama&#x301;sa is used for the &ldquo;one&rdquo; of a collectivity where a mixture of many gives rise to one. For example a collection of three strata is triloka. A collection of four Vedas is Caturveda. The coinciding of three ahas is tryahasparsha, and so on.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> It is obvious from the above examples that numerical words are mentioned in the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya of dvigu sama&#x301;sa, such as &ldquo;three strata&rdquo;, &ldquo;four Vedas&rdquo;, &ldquo;three ahas&rdquo;, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In some people&#146;s opinion the words trilokiina&#x301;tha, dva&#x301;rika&#x301;na&#x301;tha, etc. are incorrect. They say that trilokii means triloker na&#x301;tha, so why should we write na&#x301;tha? Their argument cannot be completely brushed aside.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  But in my opinion we can save trilokiina&#x301;tha and dva&#x301;rika&#x301;na&#x301;tha on the strength of nitya sama&#x301;sa. If trilokiina&#x301;tha is taken to mean trilokii-I-na&#x301;tha then in that case it can be considered correct in Sanskrit as nitya sama&#x301;sa although it is incorrect in Bengali. Similar is the case with dva&#x301;rika&#x301; in the sense of dva&#x301;raka&#x301;r na&#x301;tha. How can this then be again dva&#x301;rika&#x301;na&#x301;th? But it can in the case of niyta sama&#x301;sa. For example, dvarika&#x301;-i na&#x301;tha in this sense is nitya sama&#x301;sa. Here dva&#x301;rika&#x301;na&#x301;tha is not dvigu sama&#x301;sa but trilokiina&#x301;tha is partially dvigu sama&#x301;sa and partially nitya sama&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Bear in mind that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was Dva&#x301;raka&#x301;na&#x301;tha, not Dva&#x301;rika&#x301;na&#x301;tha, and that Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a was Trilokana&#x301;tha, not Trilokiina&#x301;tha. As with the word ana&#x301;thinii, one can try to make it forcibly stand up but it is better not to prop it up in this way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Some sama&#x301;sa are completely dependent on the indeclinable. For example, in English one says &ldquo;from Cape Comorin to the Himalayas&rdquo;. To say this in Bengali &ndash; samudra theke hima&#x301;cal paryanta [from the ocean to the Himalayas] &ndash; one says a&#x301;samudrahima&#x301;cala &ndash; here both theke and paryanta are indeclinables. A&#x301;samudrahima&#x301;cala has been created with the help of these two indeclinables. The sama&#x301;sa which is based on such indeclinables is called avyayiibha&#x301;va sama&#x301;sa. Ka&#x301;r-o beya&#x301;davii dekhe Ra&#x301;mba&#x301;bur a&#x301;ga&#x301;pa&#x301;shtala&#x301; jvale ut&#x301;hla [On seeing anyone&#146;s bad manners Mr. Ram would flare up]. Here the compound word a&#x301;ga&#x301;pa&#x301;shtala&#x301; is formed from a vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya that depends on indeclinables, for example, a&#x301;ga&#x301; haite pa&#x301;sh haiya&#x301; tala&#x301; paryanta [from the top of the head passing down to the soles of the feet]. Hence it is avyayiibha&#x301;va sama&#x301;sa. If we say figuratively a&#x301;ga&#x301; o pa&#x301;sh o tala&#x301; then it is dvandva sama&#x301;sa, of course, but by this Mr. Ram&#146;s mood at that moment is not clear, so instead of dvandva sama&#x301;sa it will be avyayiibha&#x301;va sama&#x301;sa. Still this is avyayiibha&#x301;va sama&#x301;sa for Bengali words. A similar non-compound expression is juto sela&#x301;i theke can&#x301;d&#x301;iipa&#x301;t&#x301;h [from sewing shoes to reading the Chandi]. If we wish we can say it as a compound word &ndash; a&#x301;ma&#x301;ke juto sela&#x301;i-can&#x301;d&#x301;iipa&#x301;t&#x301;h karte hay. Here the phrase is not juto sela&#x301;i and can&#x301;d&#x301;iipa&#x301;th. It is juto selai theke can&#x301;d&#x301;iipa&#x301;th paryanta chot&#x301;a bar&#x301;a sab ka&#x301;j kare jete hay [all large and small work has to be done from the sewing of shoes to the reading of the Chandi].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Similarly, we use avyayiibha&#x301;va sama&#x301;sa in Sanskrit. For example, a&#x301;pa&#x301;damastaka, which means &ldquo;from foot to head&rdquo;, is also avyayiibha&#x301;va. One thing has to be kept in mind if we are to determine avyayiibha&#x301;va sama&#x301;sa. Not all Sanskrit indeclinables are indeclinables in Bengali. These kinds of Sanskrit indeclinables (but non-indeclinables in Bengali) can be avyayiibha&#x301;va in Sanskrit but not in Bengali, for example, pra&#x301;tarbhraman&#x301;a [morning-journey]. In Sanskrit this is avyayiibha&#x301;va but in Bengali it is s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurus&#x301;a and madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya. The phrase pra&#x301;ter bhraman&#x301; is s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurus&#x301;a and the phrase pra&#x301;tahka&#x301;liin bhraman&#x301; is madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya. The word pra&#x301;tah [early morning] is an indeclinable in Sanskrit. It does not take any case-ending so it cannot be tatpurus&#x301;a in Sanskrit. In Sanskrit it is avyayiibha&#x301;va or madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya while in Bengali it is s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurs&#x301;a or madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;raya, not avyayiibha&#x301;va. Pra&#x301;tah means the same thing in Bengali as it does in Sanskrit, but while it is an indeclinable in Sanskrit it is a non-indeclinable in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->A Sanskrit synonym for pra&#x301;tah is kalyam, that is, the early morning of the next day &ndash; not the entire day. It is from sunrise until forty-five minutes afterwards &ndash; pratyus&#x301;e bhavet kalyam. The proper Bengali synonyms for kalyam are bhor, viha&#x301;n, etc. The Sanskrit for what we call ka&#x301;l in Bengali &ndash; &ldquo;tomorrow in English&rdquo; &ndash; is shvah (the word shvah also means &ldquo;dog&rdquo;). The &ldquo;day-after-tomorrow&rdquo; in Sanskrit is parashva (parshu in Bengali). Some people take a fancy to writing parshu parsu. No, it cannot be spelled with su, only with shu. Those who fancy it should restrain their fancy. This kind of whimsical use of spelling upsets languages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In English when two events take place in the past then the first becomes past perfect and the second becomes past indicative. Take, for example, &ldquo;the doctor arrived&rdquo; and &ldquo;the patient died&rdquo;. Now if the death of the patient happened before the arrival of the doctor then in English one says: &ldquo;The patient had died before the doctor arrived.&rdquo; Similarly, in Sanskrit if two actions of a particular entity take place serially then the adjective for the first is placed first and the adjective for the second follows. The sama&#x301;sa that is created in this way is called supsupeti sama&#x301;sa, for example, agre supta pashca&#x301;t utthita (agre supta pashca&#x301;dutthitah). This supsupeti sama&#x301;sa is classified under karmadha&#x301;raya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Now let us come to the subject of dvandva sama&#x301;sa. Dvandva is a collective of two or more unequal words. When these two or more words are placed side by side one of them changes. There is no need to use the Sanskrit conjunctions o, ka, or ca. A new compound word is created, for example, giri and sindhu. By putting these two dissimilar words together a compound word is created &ndash; girisindhu. One thing to bear in mind here is that many people often use the word evam&#x301; instead of the conjunction o [and]. However evam&#x301; does not mean o, nor is evam&#x301; a Bengali word. It is a Sanskrit word which means &ldquo;in this way&rdquo;. For example, evam&#x301; kuru means &ldquo;do it like this&rdquo;. Hence evam&#x301; will not work in place of o in the vya&#x301;sava&#x301;kya of dvandva sama&#x301;sa. In the spoken Bengali of the village areas the word a&#x301;r is used, not evam&#x301;, for example, baoma&#x301;, ca&#x301;l a&#x301;r d&#x301;a&#x301;l niye eso [daughter-in-law, bring rice and d&#x301;a&#x301;l]. No one says Baoma&#x301; ca&#x301;l evam&#x301; d&#x301;a&#x301;l niye eso.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->One speciality of dvandva sama&#x301;sa is that if two proper nouns ending in a are put together then the ending of the first word of the compound word changes to ii, for example, kusha and lava = kushiilava. In ancient India it was the practice in Sanskrit drama that two small boys would come on stage and one would announce the names of the characters in the drama while the other would announce [ghos&#x301;an&#x301;a] the names of the actors and actresses playing them.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Those who used to make the announcements were called kushiilava.

A great forest [aran&#x301;ya], that is, a forest that extends a great distance, we would call aran&#x301;ya&#x301;nii. But we would not call a great yavana a yavana&#x301;nii. The script with which the yavanas write is called Yavana&#x301;nii. However, bear in mind that a great vana [forest] is not called vana&#x301;nii. There is no such word as vana&#x301;nii. If any gentleman or woman names their daughter Vana&#x301;nii, tell them that. It is up to them whether or not they listen to you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->A couple of similar words are ketakii and vipa&#x301;sha&#x301;. Actually these two words were neuter gender in very ancient times. So even though there is a flower named ketakii and a river named &ldquo;Vipa&#x301;sha&#x301;&rdquo; girls should not be given this name. This was the instruction of the ancient authors of the scriptures.

The Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a has ka&#x301;vya quality as well as educational value so the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a is both ka&#x301;vya and pura&#x301;n&#x301;a. However it is not itikatha&#x301; or itiha&#x301;sa because itikatha&#x301; (its English synonym is &ldquo;history&rdquo;; its French synonym is histoire) is a chronicle of actual events.

<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->As the story goes, when Ram was completely unable to defeat the powerful Ravana, who had Shiva&#146;s power, during their fierce battle, he performed a worship of Shiva in the hopes of pleasing him. In the mantra of obeisance at the end of the worship Ram used the name Ra&#x301;meshva&#x301;ra for Shiva. He said: Tvam&#x301; Ra&#x301;masya iishvarah itya&#x301;rthe Ra&#x301;meshvarah &ndash; (s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tat) [You are Ram&#146;s Lord; in that sense you are Ra&#x301;meshvara]. Shiva objected strongly to this and said: &ldquo;Ra&#x301;masya iishvarah iti Ra&#x301;meshvarah &ndash; I don&#146;t accept this. Ra&#x301;mah yasya iishvarah sah Ra&#x301;meshvarah&rdquo; &ndash; (bahuvriihi sama&#x301;sa). That is, Ram is Ra&#x301;meshvara to those for whom he is Lord. In other words, &ldquo;I think of Ram as my Lord.&rdquo; Ram said: &ldquo;How can I be Shiva&#146;s Lord?&rdquo; This set off a verbal dispute between the two. Probably the sound of weapons also started ringing out, one with the bow and arrow and the other with the trident. The sea-girt earth trembled. Groups of men and bears and monkeys started shaking violently out of fear. Everyone became afraid and wondered: &ldquo;What is going on, what is going on! What cataclysm has befallen us!&rdquo; With folded palms they entreated them: &ldquo;You are both great souls. We don&#146;t want there to be a war between you.&rdquo; The two of them said: &ldquo;We are also keen to avoid war. Tell us what sama&#x301;sa it will be and everything will be finished.&rdquo; Then they all replied in one voice: &ldquo;What need is there for a quarrel over who is whose Lord? Ra&#x301;maeva iishvarah iti Ra&#x301;meshvarah &ndash; nitya sama&#x301;sa (Ram is the Lord, in this sense Ra&#x301;meshvara &ndash; nitya sama&#x301;sa).&rdquo; Everyone accepted that Ram was God.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  In the Puranic imagination there is a hell where the god of death, Yamaraj&#146;s gate is guarded by sentries. Chief among them is a female dog whose name is Sarama&#x301;. The word sa&#x301;rameya is derived by adding the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;eya in apatya&#x301;rtha to the root word sarama&#x301; in tadhita&#x301;rtha; it means &ldquo;progeny of Sarama&#x301;&rdquo; or &ldquo;progeny of a female dog&rdquo;. Be careful that no one names their daughter &ldquo;Sarama&#x301;&rdquo;. Of course Vibhiis&#x301;an&#x301;a&#146;s wife in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a was named Sarama&#x301; but that Sarama&#x301; was not human. She was a female demon.</p>

In this case the word bebhul is incorrect. However if someone says bebhul it is okay.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)  Many people use the word ullekha to mean ghos&#x301;an&#x301;a. Bear in mind, ut + lekha = ullekha, that is, informing about what is written. If it is oral then the word ullekha is not used.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)   Yavana means &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; &ndash; those who do not follow the Indo-Aryan culture. This is not an insult.
