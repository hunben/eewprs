<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The root verb <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is used with several different meanings, for example, &ldquo;to walk a crooked [<I>kut&#x301;ila</I>] path&rdquo;, &ldquo;to make somebody walk a <I></I>crooked path&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be dishonest&rdquo;, &ldquo;to make somebody dishonest&rdquo;, &ldquo;to walk on the path of <I>adharma</I> [unrighteousness]&rdquo;, &ldquo;to make somebody walk on the path of <I>adharma</I>&rdquo;, <I></I>&ldquo;to strike&rdquo;, &ldquo;to create obstructions in the path of honesty&rdquo;, &ldquo;to cut into pieces&rdquo;, &ldquo;to build a wall of obstacles&rdquo;, &ldquo;to peck or to nibble&rdquo;. There are also different etymological meanings based on these usages. The colloquial usages of the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> are as follows: <ol> <li>Tree. The roots of a tree move in a crooked way; they advance in a zigzag manner. The branches and offshoots of a tree also move on a tangled and crooked path; they hardly ever move in a straight path. Thus <I>kut&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;tree&rdquo;. Generally <I>kut&#x301;a</I> refers to a large tree. It was customary to use the spelling <I>ku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> in the case of poisonous trees, but even if it is spelled with a short <I>u</I>, it cannot be considered incorrect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><p>When the word <I>ka&#x301;laku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> is used for a poisonous tree, then it is understood that its poison is very strong. In that case <I>ku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> must be spelled with <I>u&#x301;</I>. In addition to poisonous trees, the word <I>ka&#x301;laku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> is also used to refer to any kind of poisonous plant. There is an amusing observation in this regard. Many people playfully call tobacco (<I>ta&#x301;ma&#x301;ka</I>) <I>ta&#x301;maku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> [ta&#x301;mraku&#x301;t&#x301;a]<I></I>, but this is merely in jest. There is no original Sanskrit word for tobacco since tobacco was introduced into this country from abroad during the Mughal era. At that time it was not given a Sanskrit name, as was the case with guava (<I>perukam, biijapu&#x301;rakam</I>), chilli (<I>kat&#x301;ubiijam</I>), papaya (<I>amrtaphalam</I> &ndash; the Bengali word <I>pen&#x32D;pe</I> is derived from the English word &ldquo;papaya&rdquo; as is the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali word <I>pipha&#x301;</I>) and so on, all of which came from outside India. The actual meaning of the word <I>ta&#x301;mraku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;copper mountain&rdquo;, not tobacco. The scholars of earlier times used to say in jest:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ta&#x301;maku&#x301;t&#x301;am&#x301; mahaddravyam&#x301; shraddhaya&#x301; diiyate yadi,<br>Ashvamedhasamapun&#x301;yam&#x301; t&#x301;a&#x301;ne t&#x301;a&#x301;ne bhavis&#x301;yati.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><p>That is, tobacco is indeed great. If somebody offers someone tobacco with reverence, then with each puff of tobacco the person takes, the donor receives a benefit equal to that derived from the <I>Ashvamedha Yajin&#x32D;a</I> [Horse Sacrifice].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li>The pot used for drinking water is known as <I>kakubha</I>. If the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is used then it means a water pot that is somewhat bent or curved (<I>vakra&#x301;yita</I>: The verbal root <I>vak</I> means to move in a tortuous or twisted manner; from this comes the words <I>vakra</I> [bent or crooked], <I>vaka</I> [stork], etc). You must have noticed that the upper portion of a glass is not exactly the same as the lower portion. In a small pitcher (<I>ghat&#x301;i</I>) the upper part or the brim is curved in such a way that water can be easily drunk without touching the lips. So glasses, <I>ghat&#x301;is</I> and other water-pots, which have been specifically designed for conveniently drinking water, are known as <I>kut&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><p>In ancient times the hard shells of ripe coconuts were also used for drinking water. So <I>kut&#x301;a</I> also means the shell of the ripe coconut. If a coconut shell is broken into two pieces, the pieces are also called <I>ma&#x301;la&#x301;</I>. Many people use this coconut <I>ma&#x301;la&#x301;</I> for storing kitchen spices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><li>Some people also use the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> to mean <I>kun&#x32D;jo</I> [a pitcher with a long and narrow neck]. No one drinks water directly from a <I>kun&#x32D;jo</I>, even if they avoid touching it with their lips. But it is true that in old Sanskrit, in a few rare cases the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> was used to mean <I>kun&#x32D;jo</I>. Without taking into consideration whether that usage was proper or not, the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> can be used to mean <I>kun&#x32D;jo</I> by virtue of the specific grammatical rule <I>nipa&#x301;tana siddha.</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;. Whether a mountain rises straight upward or diagonally, its surface is not smooth; it has innumerable rough spots, pits and ditches, caverns and cavities. For this reason a mountain is called <I>kut&#x301;a</I>. If <I>ku&#x301;ta&#x301;</I> is written with a long <I>u&#x301;</I> when referring to a mountain, then <I></I>this does not refer to the entire mountain but rather only to its summit and adjacent areas. Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a (<I>grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a &gt; gidhdhaud&#x301;a &gt; gidhdhaur&#x301;a &gt; gidhaor&#x301;a</I>)<I></I>, Annaku&#x301;t&#x301;a (mountain of rice), Amaraku&#x301;t&#x301;a <I></I>(many people erroneously say <I>amarakot&#x301;a</I>)<I></I>, Ku&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;shila&#x301; (some people erroneously say <I>kot&#x301;ashila&#x301;</I>), Ku&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;sura (demon of the mountain &ndash; many people erroneously say <I>kot&#x301;a&#x301;sura</I>), Cit&#x301;raku&#x301;t&#x301;a, etc., are all preferably spelled with <I>ku&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><p><I>Kut&#x301;a</I> does not only mean large mountains. It also refers to all its diminutive forms such as hills, knolls, mounds and hillocks.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><li>You may be familiar with <I>hastakut&#x301;ika&#x301;</I>. The words <I>hastakut&#x301;aka</I> and <I>hastakut&#x301;ika&#x301;</I> were generally used for big and small hammers respectively. You must have seen a big hammer at a smithy and a small hammer at a goldsmith&#146;s shop. In Bhojpuri a big hammer is called <I>hathaor&#x301;a&#x301;</I> and a small one <I>hathaor&#x301;ii</I>. This big hammer or <I>hathaor&#x301;a&#x301;</I> is also called <I>kut&#x301;a</I>. <I>Kut&#x301;apis&#x301;t&#x301;a kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha</I> means &ldquo;a cauldron that has been pounded with a hammer&rdquo;. Generally cauldrons <I>(kar&#x301;a&#x301;)</I> are of two types: hammered cauldrons and cast cauldrons. Cast cauldrons do not last long; moreover, they crack if they are exposed to sudden changes in temperature. But hammered or wrought cauldrons are quite durable. So housewives prefer wrought cauldrons even though they are a little more expensive. It is this wrought cauldron that is called <I>kut&#x301;apis&#x301;t&#x301;a kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha</I> in proper Bengali. The proper name for a cauldron used for cooking is <I>kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha</I> (<I>kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha&#x301; &gt;kad&#x301;a&#x301;ha &gt;kar&#x301;a&#x301;ha &gt;kar&#x301;a&#x301;i &gt;kar&#x301;a&#x301;)</I>. However, when there is a <I>kar&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [hardened skin] on someone&#146;s foot, the proper word for it is not <I>kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha</I> but rather <I>karn&#x301;ika&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><li>Have you ever seen a <I>kella&#x301;</I> or a <I>durga</I> [fort]? The word <I>kella&#x301;</I> or <I>kii-la&#x301;h</I> is of Persian origin. The word <I>durga</I> is <I>tatsama<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I>. The etymological meaning of <I>durga</I> is &ldquo;a place difficult to reach&rdquo;, one which requires a great deal of struggle in order to go there, for which one has to expend a lot of energy to reach. A fort is generally built in places where people cannot easily approach; for instance, on the summit of a hill, land guarded by a river, or on an uninhabited island. The outer walls of a fort are built so that they are difficult for an enemy to attack. Its stronghold is built so that from behind its cover the fort commander&#146;s men can fight off the aggressor. If the fort is situated on a level plain, then trenches are dug around it and filled with water. Those of you who have seen the Monghyr fort have seen its trenches. The river Ain&#x32D;jana&#x301; at Goa&#x301;r&#x301;i-Krishnanagar was such a trench. At that time the Khar&#x301;e was a surging river, so its waters were used to supply the Ain&#x32D;jana&#x301;. I believe the Kaun&#x32D;kana&#x301; canal (Nadia) was also dug for use as a trench. Since no fort was simple or straightforward, and because in ancient times when choosing sites for their construction, preference was given to hills and mountains, one of the meanings of <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;fort&rdquo;. In ancient Sanskrit both the spellings <I>durga</I> and <I>du&#x301;rga</I> were in vogue.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><p>In ancient India there used to be a temple or mosque adjacent to a fort. In the Puranic era some people used to keep a <I>durga&#x301; ba&#x301;r&#x301;ii</I> [house of Durga&#x301;] or a <I>durga&#x301;</I> <I>mandir</I> [temple of Durga&#x301;] inside a fort in honour of the goddess Durga&#x301;, the presiding deity of a <I>durga</I>. The eight-armed mythical goddess Durga&#x301; was considered to be the goddess of weapons. The concept of a ten-armed Durga&#x301; came later on. The ten-armed Durga&#x301; was first introduced in Bengal at Taherpur in the district of Rajshahi in Barendrabhu&#x301;mi [North Bengal]. The king of that region, Kam&#x301;sana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a Roy, was the first to worship Durga&#x301; on Bengali soil, for which he spent seven lakhs of rupees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><li>Often a palace was attached to a fort. These palaces were also known as <I>kut&#x301;a</I> or <I>kut&#x301;apra&#x301;sa&#x301;da</I>. In English the word was &ldquo;castle&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><li>Often people who assemble for a bad purpose consolidate their forces in certain places. People assembled for a good purpose also consolidate their forces in different places for a particular course of action. Such a place where a person or persons consolidate their forces is called <I>gha&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;i</I>.The word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is used for this <I>gha&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;i</I> [camp]. A camp of robbers can also be described as a robbers&#146; <I>kut&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><p>In this respect, you should have a clear idea of the distinction between the words <I>gha&#x301;ti and gha&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;i</I>. <I>Gha&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;i</I> means &ldquo;centre of power&rdquo; and <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;i</I> means &ldquo;valley&rdquo; (not an <I>avava&#x301;hika&#x301;</I> or basin). Some of you may know that in the area known as Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, especially western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, there is often a mountainous or hilly valley or <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;i</I> on the way from one prosperous region to another. Robbers would often attack in these <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;is</I>. The kings of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h used to employ a particular kind of officer to save innocent people from the hands of these <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;i</I> robbers. They were called <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;wa&#x301;ls</I>. I knew a gentleman who had the surname Sengupta. When asked for the name of his father, he used to give the word Gha&#x301;t&#x301;wa&#x301;l as his surname. When questioned further, he explained that his forefathers had worked for generations as <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;wa&#x301;ls</I> in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, so they used the surname Gha&#x301;t&#x301;wa&#x301;l. The word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> cannot be used for <I></I>this <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;i</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is house or residence. The word <I>kut&#x301;i</I> can be used for a small house. Even though the meaning of the word <I>kut&#x301;ira</I> is nearly identical, the word <I>kut&#x301;ira</I> is chiefly used for an earthen house or also a bamboo and thatched house. It is not necessary to use the word <I>parn&#x301;akut&#x301;ira</I> for this because <I>kut&#x301;ira</I> itself means <I>parn&#x301;asha&#x301;la&#x301;</I> [a hut thatched with tree leaves]. (<I>Shrii Ra&#x301;ma, Laks&#x301;man&#x301;a Janaker ba&#x301;la&#x301;/ Basati karen nirma&#x301;iya&#x301; parn&#x301;asha&#x301;la&#x301;</I> &ndash; <I></I>&ldquo;Shrii Ra&#x301;ma, Laks&#x301;man&#x301;a, and the daughter of Janaka live here having constructed a <I>parn&#x301;asha&#x301;la&#x301;</I>.&rdquo;) However, <I>kut&#x301;t&#x301;ii</I> or <I>kut&#x301;t&#x301;ira</I> does not mean &ldquo;house&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;hill&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><li>Now, the tool you commonly use to cut stone, this <I>ga&#x301;in&#x32D;iti</I> [pickaxe], is it completely straight? Is it just like a crowbar from top to bottom? No, a pickaxe is not straight; it is bent. One end is bent and tapers downward while the other end is also bent and widens outward, and the tip is pointed. The pickaxe was used in coal mines in earlier times before the scientific means of cutting coal was introduced. The pickaxe is still used to cut stone or stony soil. One of the meanings of <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;pickaxe&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><li>I am sure you know that if a third thing is placed between two other things then it is called &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo;. In English the spelling is &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; but the pronunciation is not &ldquo;sand-wich&rdquo;; it should be &ldquo;sandich&rdquo;. For example, Greenwich is written &ldquo;Green-wich&rdquo; but it is pronounced &ldquo;Greenich&rdquo;. If you put some <I>ghugni</I> [an Indian food preparation] made of raw gram between two slices of bread then we call it a sandwich or <I>kut&#x301;a&#x301;nna</I>. If a person or an object gets caught and flattened between two other objects,then it is said that he has been sandwiched between them (in colloquial Bengali we say that he has been <I>chin&#x32D;r&#x301;echyapt&#x301;a&#x301;</I>, that is, flattened like <I>chin&#x32D;r&#x301;e</I>, or a grain of flattened rice. The word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> can be used for this also). So you see, the proper Bengali for &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; is <I>kut&#x301;a&#x301;nna</I>, and that which is sandwiched is called <I>kut&#x301;a</I>. Bear in mind that the English word for <I>ya&#x301;dugarii</I> (the feminine form of <I>ya&#x301;dugara</I>), &ldquo;witch&rdquo;, is not pronounced &ldquo;ich&rdquo; but &ldquo;wich&rdquo;. Only if the word &ldquo;wich&rdquo; is the latter part of a word is it pronounced &ldquo;ich.&rdquo; A gentleman known to me, Mr. Pund&#x301;arika&#x301;ks&#x301;a Poundfoolish, once translated &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; as <I>ba&#x301;luka&#x301;-da&#x301;kinii</I> (sand-witch). Stay away from such kinds of translations!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><li>When a person uses an ornament, they wear it on some part or another of their body. The rest of the time they certainly will not hang it from a nail on the wall; it is kept in an attractive box or casket. In proper Bengali a small box or casket is called <I>pet&#x301;ika&#x301;</I> or <I>main&#x32D;jus&#x301;a&#x301;</I>. Similarly, when someone uses a weapon it remains in his hand, but the rest of the time he does not keep the weapon dangling from his arm; it remains sheathed. This boxed ornament or sheathed weapon is called <I>kut&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><p>In Bengali we use the word <I>ba&#x301;ksa</I>. The Bengali word <I>ba&#x301;ksa</I> came from the English word &ldquo;box&rdquo; during the early days of British rule. (None of you should ever pronounce it <I>baska</I>, even by mistake. Likewise, do not say <I>decki</I> [for <I>dekci</I>, &ldquo;cooking pail&rdquo;], <I>riska&#x301;</I> [for &ldquo;rickshaw&rdquo;], <I>phuruli</I> [for <I>phuluri</I>, &ldquo;fried gramflour drop&rdquo;]; also do not say <I>liil a&#x301;ka&#x301;sh</I> [for <I>niil a&#x301;ka&#x301;sh</I>, &ldquo;blue sky&rdquo;] or <I>na&#x301;l gorut&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [for <I>la&#x301;l gorut&#x301;a&#x301;</I>, &ldquo;that red cow&rdquo;]. Before the word <I>ba&#x301;ksa</I> was introduced in this country, the words <I>pyan&#x32D;t&#x301;ra&#x301;</I>, <I>pya&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;</I> etc. were used. Although they are now no longer used, we sometimes still use the expression <I>ba&#x301;ksa-pya&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;ra&#x301;</I> .<!-- /block --></p>

No, certainly not. First you pile the grain in heaps in the granary; then you sweep and clean it, boil it or wet it and dry it in the sun, and then perhaps husk it with the husking pedal. Then you put it into the pot and cook it, is it not?

<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><li>Bullfights were prevalent in ancient times in certain countries of the world.

It is worth mentioning that in old Arabic also bulls were called <I>t&#x301;aura&#x301;</I>. Although the relation between Latin and Arabic is a distant one, they are not altogether unrelated. However the connection was through Hebrew and Greek. The bull used to die in this fight. In ancient Greece, when a criminal was sentenced to capital punishment, he was pushed in the lion&#146;s cage with a weapon. After fighting for some time the convicted man would generally be killed in the battle, and this scene may have delighted the spectators. The purpose of this sport was for the man to be killed by the lion. However the purpose of sending a man into a large arena to fight a bull was to see who emerged victorious. Generally the bull died because if it became obvious that the bull was going to win, then the spectators would kill the bull.<!-- /block --></p>

Perhaps it still exists to some extent. In this fight a male buffalo was tied and there was a man in the arena. If the man was injured in the fight then the people used to kill the buffalo. Although the fighting was heroic in nature, it was also somewhat repulsive. At any rate, when this bullfighting was between bulls, then in many instances the horn of the defeated bull used to break and the bull lost a great deal of blood from its head. This bull with a broken horn is also called <I>kut&#x301;a</I>. These bullfights stopped after the cow became recognized as a deity, although not completely.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph --><li>The word <I>prata&#x301;raka</I> means &ldquo;one who cheats&rdquo;. To cheat means to first generate faith and then to inflict injury. If fish food is sprinkled in a pond while angling then the fish may think that the visitor is providing food; he is my friend. So they approach. Then at that point if someone fits a fishhook with food, and the fish takes the food with unhesitating confidence, and then if it is reeled in with the hook piercing its mouth and is killed, that would certainly be the deed of a cheat.<!-- /block --></p>

So since ancient times people have condemned both catching fish with a fishhook and the fowler&#146;s way of catching birds. No honest man should do it. It is not cheating when fish are caught with a net. For this reason the fisherman&#146;s profession was not considered as despicable as the fowler&#146;s, because they do not kill innocent creatures by making them swallow bait. Under no circumstance can harming a person or a creature after winning their confidence by tempting them with food be considered the deed of an honest person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph --><p>Many years ago I used to hear about a class of people who would cheat others by promising them that their gold would be doubled. Generally they used to visit the women when the men were out and tell them that they could double their gold with their magical power. If the women did not trust them they were welcome to put them to the test. These housewives would test them by first giving them a small gold ring or an earring or any similar trinket and asking them to double it. These fellows used to keep a stock of light ornaments. They would ask the women to shut their eyes and the women would shut their eyes. Then they would add rings or earrings from their stash and show to the women that their ring or earring was doubled. Once the women were firmly convinced after seeing these feats they would bring out their gold ornaments, place them before the cheats and ask them to double them. Again the women were asked to keep their eyes shut. Then they would tie the ornaments into a small bundle and made good their escape. They were swindlers. They used to realize their own selfish ends after gaining the confidence of the common people. One word for such &ldquo;confidence men&rdquo; is <I>kut&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph --><p>On that day I had reached Howrah station early in the morning.

The moment I came out of the station I ran into Sujit, yes, Sujit, our Sujit, Sujit Mitter, my playmate from the old days, my study companion. He was studying in Bhagalpur College and I in Kolkata. We were great friends. We used to look forward to seeing each other during holidays and vacations. We would meet in Jamalpur by the reservoir, or near the field, or on one bench or another. Sujit was greatly interested in Bengali literature, particularly in the field of Bengali literature&#146;s speciality, its portrayal of society. I was more inclined towards astrology and was completely uninitiated in literary matters, an unknown traveler in that realm. Even though Bengali was my mother tongue, I could only speak it; I had never approached its literary shores. The little education I had was in English. My limited ability to move in that literary realm owed everything to the little I had heard from Sujit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph --><p>Then I ran into that very Sujit. There we were, face-to-face. Sujit was the scion of an aristocratic family. He had a refined and tasteful bearing and conduct. Anyone would have wanted such a friend.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph --><p>We arrived at the bus stand. The people from the bus company were shouting at the top of their lungs with a somewhat distorted Bengali pronounciation: &ldquo;Ghus-sur&#x301;ii-ii-ii, Ghus-sur&#x301;ii-ii-ii, going to Ghus-sur&#x301;ii-ii-ii, going to Ghus-sur&#x301;ii-ii-ii.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph --><p>They are hard-working people. They came to work hard and from a long distance away.

<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph --><p>It was quite some time later when we reached the outskirts of Ghusur&#x301;i after crossing a large portion of the city of Howrah. The city of Howrah is high in some places, low in others, replete with factories and neighborhoods of gentle, civilized folk. Howrah has been an industrial town since its very inception. There was a time when there was a factory here at every turn. It is difficult to find another such industrial town anywhere in the world, although at present Ludhiana and Batala of the Punjab can boast of a similar glory. This is quite good, no doubt, but Howrah should not lose its distinction. Both government and private agencies derive a very good income from this industrial town, although in general we can say that the city is neglected. Only a very small fraction of what is spent for the improvement of Kolkata is spent on Howrah. Moreover, the sacrifices that Howrah has made for the improvement of Kolkata are indisputable. Kolkata is like a golden lamp with a slender wick made of fine cotton and clarified butter for fuel, while Howrah is like the lamp-stand that bears it on its head. It seems to bear the black stain from the lamp&#146;s burnt oil. Will no one pay any attention to Howrah? The British did not neglect the town in this way when they founded it in an area of marshy wetlands [<I>ha&#x301;or&#x301;</I>] after draining the water and filling in the holes and ditches. A botanical garden was developed here as well as one of India&#146;s oldest engineering colleges. The Shalimar gardens were fashioned in imitation of the Shalimar gardens of Kashmir. The place is still commonly known today as Shalimar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph --><p>The Howrah district was second to none in the area of scholarship. There was a time when a large number of Sanskrit scholars used to live at Ma&#x301;ju, Shyampur, Andul, Pen&#x32D;r&#x301;o-Vasantapur and Sa&#x301;n&#x32D;tra&#x301;ga&#x301;chi. They were quite erudite. The British selected Howrah, as a developing area of Bengal, to be the residence of the representative from Bhutan. Later on that particular place became known as <I>Bhot&#x301;ba&#x301;ga&#x301;n</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph --><p>It is this Howrah that we are passing through, neglected by history just as Urmila, the wife of Laks&#x301;man&#x301;a, was neglected in the <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. We reached Ghusur&#x301;i and arrived at Sujit&#146;s house some seven or eight minutes after getting down at the bus-stand. It was a neat, middle-sized, fashionable house, with the kind of lovely, colorful gardens in front and on the sides known as <I>kut&#x301;apa</I> in Sanskrit literature. I could not help but praise Sujit&#146;s taste. I also had to admire his choice of place.

<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph --><p>We spent a few hours together in free and intimate conversation&ndash; laughing, gossiping and dining. Sujit&#146;s wife Sunanda came from an aristocratic family and was a simple and unassuming woman who was also a paragon of hospitality.

<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph --><p>The noon hour passed and it became afternoon, time to return. In those days Ghusur&#x301;i was half-urban and half-rural. With the onset of the evening, silence reigned, and after nine at night it became completely deserted. People were going to sleep around that time. I returned to my aunt&#146;s house in Belgachia. As I was leaving, Sujit made me promise to visit him in Ghusur&#x301;i whenever I came to Kolkata and could spare a little time. I also thought that I must certainly visit Ghusur&#x301;i &ndash; the gold bracelet of Sujit&#146;s love.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph --><p>Many years passed after that. Much water had flowed down the Ganges.

I still remember that scene. A certain Faizul Mian&#x32D;a&#x301; used to supply us with firewood <I></I>every <I></I>morning. He could never leave without conversing with me for a few minutes about his daily joys and sorrows.

<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph --><p>I would just smile.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph --><p>Today that Dinajpur of long ago sometimes haunts the dark alleys of my mind.

<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph --><p>It was Monday. A telegram arrived from Ghusur&#x301;i from Sunanda informing me that Sujit was seriously ill; it would be good if I could go there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph --><p>It was a shock to my mind. Sujit was my childhood friend, my playmate, my study companion and a distant relation as well. It is hard to imagine how much he loved me.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph --><p>I decided to leave the next day.

<a name="73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph --><p>Then I woke up. It was three o&#146;clock in the morning.<!-- /block --></p>

After finishing a few urgent tasks during the day, I bought some fruits and other suitable food for Sujit, and by the time I reached Howrah it was already evening. When I arrived, I heard that due to some temporary trouble the buses were not running to Ghusur&#x301;i, though efforts were being made to resume the bus service. After some time I heard that an understanding had been reached and the buses were running again. I could hear the sound: &ldquo;Ghus-sur&#x301;ii-ii-ii, Ghus-sur&#x301;ii-ii-ii, going to Ghus-sur&#x301;ii-ii-ii?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Sunanda wanted to come but I didn&#146;t let her because even though Ghusur&#x301;i is on the edge of becoming a true township, it&#146;s still rural at heart. After nine everything is completely still, the solitude of silence. Here the women don&#146;t go outside after nightfall.

<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph --><li>The Aryans entered India in stages. During the first stage they reached the land of the seven rivers, or Saptasindhu<I></I>, being the Sind and with it six other rivers: the Shatadru or Shataluj or Sutlez (that which flows in a hundred streams); the Bipa&#x301;sha&#x301; or Bias (that which moves in a zigzag manner or which makes things wet while moving around. The Aryans in the Vedic language of that time used the word <I>bipa&#x301;sha&#x301;</I> in neuter gender. For this reason they never gave the name Bipa&#x301;sha&#x301; to either their sons or their daughters); the Ira&#x301;vatii or Ravii (that which contains much <I>ira&#x301;</I> or water); the Candrabha&#x301;ga&#x301; or Cenab (the combined form of the two rivers, Candra and Bha&#x301;ga&#x301;); and the Vitasta&#x301; or Jhelum (one whose width is noteworthy). Along with the land of the seven rivers they also colonized the kingdom of Shivi. There is a controversy regarding the location of the kingdom of Shivi, but as far as I can tell, the kingdom of Shivi is the ancient name of what we presently call Sindh (<I>U&#x301;s&#x301;iinara na&#x301;mah ra&#x301;ja&#x301; shivi ra&#x301;jya deshe &ndash;</I> &ldquo;the king is called Us&#x301;iinara in the kingdom of Shivi&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph --><p>In the next stage of <I>Sindhu</I>-<I>Saoviira</I>, the Aryans reached Haritdha&#x301;nya <I>(Haritdha&#x301;nya &gt; Hariaha&#x301;nna</I> &gt; <I>Hariha&#x301;na&#x301;</I> &gt; <I>Hariya&#x301;na&#x301;</I>). In the following stage they reached Brahma&#x301;vartta and Brahmars&#x301;idesha (the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Yamuna rivers, also known as Praya&#x301;g). During the age of the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I>, a large part of Brahma&#x301;varta was known as the kingdom of Shu&#x301;rasena with its capital at Mathura; its king was Kam&#x301;sa and afterwards Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The Shu&#x301;rasena Kayasthas are called Mathura&#x301; Kayasthas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph --><p>In the subsequent stage they reached the kingdom of Ka&#x301;shii. When they attempted to proceed from Ka&#x301;shii towards Magadha and Videha they faced great resistance. They even declared Magadha to be a non-Vedic or non-Aryan land. Upon conquering Videha after great struggle, they performed the <I>trihotriiya</I> sacrifice (a ritual sacrifice performed by three sacrificial priests; generally a sacrifice is performed by one) and named it the Trihotriiya land or Tirhut (the name Mithila is almost contemporary with Videha). After somehow conquering Mithila and Magadha, they proceeded towards Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and there they met with insurmountable opposition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph --><p>This conflict between Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and the Aryan civilization kept Bengal beyond the ambit of A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta until the end. Bengal belongs neither to A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta nor to the Deccan. Even though the Bengali language is one of the luminaries of Sanskrit and Aryan language group, the Dravidian influence is predominant in the physical composition of the Bengali race. This proves that the Aryans could not settle here permanently; the physical composition of Bengalis reflects a far greater Austric-Dravidian influence than Aryan influence. There is also considerable Mongolian influence, especially in North, East and Southeast Bengal. The Dravidian influence is extremely strong in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h (thus, according to anthropology, Bengalis are Austrico-Mongolo-Negroid). Not only did the Aryans meet with resistance at the borders of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, it is rumored that at Barjyabhu&#x301;mi (Birbhum) when they saw the Aryans, the [local indigenous] population unleashed their pet dogs and wolves (<I>vrkavya&#x301;ghra</I>) against them. So the Aryans used to say that the land of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had to be abandoned <I>(Barjjyaniiya)</I>, that is, it is <I>Bajjyabhu&#x301;mi</I>. Regarding Bengal it was said: &ldquo;We do not understand what the people of that land say in their chirping bird language.&rdquo; In later times many <I>sma&#x301;rtas</I> [scholars of social scriptures] made an injunction that, except for the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sa&#x301;gara pilgrimage, if anyone came to Bengal, then they would be considered to have committed a sin both of commission and omission. They used to arrive by boat during the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sa&#x301;gara pilgrimage, take their bath and return again by water without ever touching the soil of Bengal; thus they avoided the crime of touching the land.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph --><p>Just as the Aryans met with resistance to the east in Bengal, similarly in the south they came up against the insurmountable summits of the Satpura and Vindhya Mountains. Since the Vindhya Mountains were so difficult to cross, the following areas remained out of the Aryan reach: the southern areas of Maharastra that lie across the Vindhya Mountains (Vidarbha is part of A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta but Ma&#x301;ra&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; and Koun&#x32D;kan&#x301;a are part of the Deccan), Triliun&#x32D;gabhu&#x301;mi (Telengana or Andhra), Karna&#x301;t&#x301;akdesh (or the land of Kannada), Gomantaka (Goa), Dra&#x301;mila (Tamil Nadu), Kerala and the southern part of Orissa (Utkala: the northwestern part of Orissa, which was known as Koshala or south Koshla, however, was regarded as a part of A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta, and that is why even today there still remains a significant cultural and psychological gap between Koshala and Utkala). For similar reasons, the Pathans and Mughals also failed to significantly extend their dominion over this area. It is said that Maharishi Agastya was the first to cross the Vindhya Mountains along with his followers and extend the Aryan influence into the south. From that time onwards, the area south of the Vindhyas came to be known as Da&#x301;ks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;tya or <I>Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;patha</I> or <I>Da&#x301;ks&#x301;in&#x301;a</I> (the word Deccan is derived from the word <I>da&#x301;ks&#x301;in&#x301;a</I>).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph --><p>According to a story in the Puranas, Maharshi Agastya had to use diplomacy [<I>kut&#x301;abuddhi</I>] when he entered the Deccan. The Vindhya Mountains were very high peaks. The Aryans were not able to cross to the other side. So they said to Agastya: &ldquo;Nobody is your equal in diplomacy. Please find some way to destroy the height of the Vindhya Mountains.&rdquo; Maharshi proceeded south. When the Vindhyas saw Maharshi Agastya approaching, they bowed down their head in his honour. Agastya said: &ldquo;Bless you. I am headed south. Unless and until I return, you should remain in the same state of salutation, that is, with your head bowed.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph --><p>The Maharshi proceeded south and never returned. The Vindhyas remained with their heads bowed and the Aryans were able to easily enter the south. Because of this fame for diplomacy [<I>kuta&#x301;budhi</I>], Maharshi Agastya became famous as <I>kut&#x301;amuni</I> or <I>kut&#x301;ars&#x301;i</I>. So you see, one meaning of <I>kut&#x301;amuni</I>, <I>kut&#x301;ars&#x301;i</I> or <I>kut&#x301;aja</I> is Maharshi Agastya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph --><p>This word <I>agastya</I> is also found in Hebrew and Latin as &ldquo;Augustine.&rdquo; The name of the month of August is also derived from the word <I>agastya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph --><li>In the Dva&#x301;para era, the versatile Dronacarya was well known for his diplomacy in addition to his famed mastery of the art of weaponry and different scriptures. It is said that he concealed certain parts of this knowledge of weaponry and scriptures from his disciples but taught them to Arjuna. Supposedly he taught Arjuna diplomacy as well. The sages, saints and learned philosophers never considered diplomacy to be a good thing. It was their firm opinion that it led to the degradation of humanity and the decay of spirituality. In their opinion, just as a thief is caught by a thief, an exorcist is killed by a ghost, a snake charmer dies of snake-bite, similarly a practitioner of diplomacy is destroyed by diplomacy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph --><p>This is what happened in the case of Dronacarya. His son&#146;s name was Ashvaththama, and Ashvaththama was also the name of an elephant killed in the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> war. Dronacarya was informed of the death of Ashvaththama, the elephant, when Yudhisthira proclaimed <I>ashvaththa&#x301;ma&#x301; hatah</I> [Ashvaththama is dead]. When he said <I>iti gaja</I> [the elephant] in a soft voice, the drums and tom-toms were loud enough that Dronacarya could not hear that portion. He thought that it was his son, Ashvaththama, who was dead. He became so upset on the battlefield that he was killed in the battle. According to a Puranic story, Ashvaththama was blessed with the boon of immortality (like Hanuman), thus Ashvaththama did not die nor can he [ever]. In olden times some people used to consider Ashvaththama a virtuous person [<I>pun&#x301;yashloka</I>]. In later times people used to consider Vaedehii instead of Ashvaththama as virtuous:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph --><p>Dronacarya had great affection for Ashvaththama, not only because he was his own son but also because Ashvaththama was revered and considered virtuous by many.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph --><p>Thus the death of Dronacarya resulted from his hearing, through a diplomatic stratagem, the bad news of Ashvaththama&#146;s death.

In the post-Buddhist era the Kayastha rulers stood beside the Brahmins for the purpose of establishing traditional orthodox religion in Bengal. As a result traditional orthodox religion may have been established but the long-term reaction in the life of the people of Bengal was not good.

If vegetables for cooking are cut into long slices (first by cutting into two pieces then slicing down the middle), into cubes (by halving the half slice), into round pieces (by not making the broader side of the vegetable smaller, but rather cutting the longer side into pieces at small intervals; fried potatoes are generally cut into round slices), or into thin pieces (by cutting into thin, long pieces; fried potatoes are sometimes cut into thin pieces), and so on, then the word <I>kut&#x301;t&#x301;aka</I> can be used for these different styles of cutting. The potatoes for potato-<I>caccar&#x301;i</I> [a curry preparation] are sometimes cut into minute pieces. The word <I>kut&#x301;t&#x301;aka</I> can be used for all these.

You can recognize Kayasthas when you see them. Even if they differ somewhat in appearance, they are also Bengalis. There is a vast difference in appearance between the Brahmins of Maharastra and the Ma&#x301;ra&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;s. By comparison, the difference between the Kayasthas and non-Kayasthas of Bengal is negligible. It often goes unperceived. Moreover, it cannot be denied that there has been racial intermingling.</p>
