<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The word eka is derived by adding the suffix kan to the verbal root in. The meaning of the verbal root in is &ldquo;to advance obliquely or tapering to a point, while moving quickly&rdquo;. Tiryak &rarr; tirachaa &rarr; teracha &rarr; tiracha&#x301; / teracha&#x301; / terecha&#x301;. Where multiple ideas or propensities or purposes become pointed like a needle, become centered in a point, while moving in rapid step, then the verbal root in is used for that style of moving. That is, the etymological meaning of the verbal root in is &ldquo;to become pointed&rdquo;, &ldquo;to arrive at a single point after abandoning multiplicity&rdquo;. Thus the verbal root in implies leading the many forward on the path of synthesis. By adding the suffix kan to this verbal root in we get the word eka. The etymological meaning of the word eka is &ldquo;the point of a needle&rdquo;. Since the point of a needle cannot be many, cannot be two-three-four-five, its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;one&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This word eka, derived from the verbal root in, is originally Rgvedic. In this world there are a great many languages descended from Vedic. Latin and its European descendants are all Vedic. The northern languages of Central Asia are descended from Vedic. The languages of south and southeast Asia are either descended from Vedic or have vocabularies which are rich in Vedic words. From the Rgvedic word eka we get the old Persian word iyak which carries the same meaning. From this word iyak, in later times, comes the word ik in several languages, and from the numerical adjective ik we get the words ika&#x301;i, ikka&#x301; and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There are many words used in Vedic which come from eka such as ekada&#x301;, ekaka, eka&#x301;kii, and many others. Eka + ka = ekaka [solitary] which means &ldquo;where work and business are centered on one&rdquo;. Eka&#x301;kii [alone] means &ldquo;absence of multiplicity&rdquo;. Ekada&#x301; means &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo;. By adding the suffix da&#x301;c to the root eka in the nominal inflection we get this word ekada&#x301; which means &ldquo;at one certain time&rdquo;. By adding the suffix dha&#x301;c to the root eka we get the word ekadha&#x301; which means &ldquo;to flow in a single stream&rdquo; or &ldquo;to proceed with a single inspiration&rdquo;. The suffix da&#x301;c is generally used to signify &ldquo;temporal succession&rdquo; and the suffix dha&#x301;c &ldquo;continuity&rdquo;. Shatadha&#x301; [hundredfold] means &ldquo;to be carried in the flow of shata [one hundred];&rdquo; similarly, bahudha&#x301; [in many ways] means &ldquo;to advance in the flow of bahu [many].&rdquo; I wanted to explain the meaning of a few words derived from eka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Roughly speaking, the languages descended from Vedic include the majority of the European languages, the Middle-East&#146;s Turkish language, Armenian, Farsi, Uzbeki, Tazaki, Kazaki, Pashtu, Kashmiri, Pahari or Pahari Punjabi, Dogri, Punjabi, Sindhi, Multani, Hariyanwi, Hindustani, Marwari, Dhundharu, Miwati, Haraoti, Mewari, Malwi, Kacchi, Kathiawari, Gujrati, Marathi, Khandeshi, Niwari, Barari, Konkani, Garhwali, Kumayuni, Brajabhasa, Awadhi, Bundeli, Bagheli, Chattisgari, Halwi, Bhojpuri, Magahi, Nagpuri or Sadri or Sadani, Sambalpuri, Oriya, Bengali, Singhali, Angika, Maethilii, Gorkhali (Nepali) and Assamese.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Besides the languages descended from Vedic, there are many languages in the world which are not Vedic in origin but which contain a great number of Vedic Sanskrit words. In some cases the number is greater than that of some Vedic descendants. For example, among the Dravidian languages (dra&#x301;mil  &rarr; dra&#x301;vil  &rarr; dra&#x301;vir&#x301;  &rarr; ta&#x301;mil), the proportion of Sanskrit words in Malayalam is greater than that of the pure Vedic language Kashmiri. There is also a great abundance of Sanskrit words in Telugu and Kannad. In both the Thai and Indonesian languages, there is such an abundance of Sanskrit words that it exceeds that of Pashtu,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> a direct descendant. Those languages which are not descendants of Vedic or Sanskrit, but which contain a great abundance of Sanskrit or Vedic words, we can call snigdha tadbhava [adopted descendants]. Each member of the Malay group of languages of southeast Asia (Malay, Sumatran, Balian, Javan, Tagalog, etc.) is an &ldquo;adopted descendant&rdquo;. The amount of adopted descent among the Indo-Burman languages is not equal in each case; the greatest affinity to Vedic among these languages is found in the Thai language (Siamese). There is no other language existing outside of India that has such a large Vedic and Sanskrit vocabulary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Although there is some small Chinese influence in the pronunciation of the Siamese language and dialects, the influence of the Gaod&#x301;iiya (Bengali) style of Sanskrit pronunciation is significantly greater. The reason for this is most likely because a prince of Rarh, Sahasrabahu, founded his kingdom there in ancient times. After conquering parts of Thailand and Malaysia, he annexed them into his own kingdom and named his capital Singhapur (Singapore) after the capital of Rarh.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Since the country was always shya&#x301;mala [green] he named it Shya&#x301;madesh. In recent times the name of Shya&#x301;madesh has been changed, of course, but the word shya&#x301;ma<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is still quite current in the people&#146;s daily life there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, Sahasrabahu&#146;s conquest of Siam took place approximately two thousand years ago. While staying in Thailand this fact especially attracted this writer&#146;s ear. Many words that were used in the Bengali of that time (Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii) still survive today in their original form in the Thai language. As a final word I will add that without the proper cultivation of the Sanskrit language, it is impossible, not only in the field of the science of language, but also in the world of psychic expression, to be considered a true scholar or learned person. The cultivation and teaching of Sanskrit is indispensable in the world of education. And although it is a little off the subject, it is good to mention here that as far as race or community or nation goes, while the Bengalees are Austrico-Mongolo-Negroid with little Aryan influence, the Bengali language is of pure Sanskrit lineage.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Ekars&#x301;i. Eka + rs&#x301;i = ekars&#x301;i. Ekars&#x301;i is the name of a kind of fire which was considered very sacred by ancient people. In the Vedas it is written:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Vra&#x301;tyastvam&#x301; pra&#x301;n&#x301;asya rs&#x301;iratta&#x301; vishvasya satpatih;<br>Vayama&#x301;dyasya da&#x301;ta&#x301;rah pita&#x301; tvam&#x301; ma&#x301;tarishva nah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the Atharvaveda, the word Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a is frequently used for Parama Purus&#x301;a. For Parama&#x301; Prakrti the words Rayi, Raya&#x301; and Raye are used. In this shloka it is said, &ldquo;O Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, O Parama Purus&#x301;a, You are a high, great object, as sacred as the ekars&#x301;i fire. Conversely, You are a very ordinary object like any other object. This universe is finally dissolved in You.&rdquo; (Atta&#x301; means &ldquo;eater, devourer&rdquo;.) &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, we offer ghee and many other objects for Your satisfaction. You are the very dynamism, the mobility, inherent in the existence of all entities.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In prehistoric days, human beings did not know about fire. Prehistoric human beings used to live on fruits, roots, tender green leaves and raw meat. Those places where the Aryans used to live were also teeming with white bears, wolves and other animals. The Aryans would fall prey to attacks by these animals, but they also used to kill them with the help of their stone weapons. The raw meat of the animals they killed, especially the liver, spleen and heart, was their favourite food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->They knew neither how to light a fire, nor the use of fire. Out of fear and devotion they used to venerate Agni [fire-god] as their deity. They used to be afraid of lightening and believed that when the earth shook it was because it was afraid of lightening, that the earth was terrified. Indra, the king of this lightening was the absolute authority, so he was the best of all. One root meaning of the word indra is &ldquo;best&rdquo;. To them Indra deserved worship. The god of snow-storms, Marut [the wind], was another venerable entity to them. The huge waves of the sea brought terror to their minds, thus Varun&#x301;a, the god of the sea, was another of their chief deities. Agni, Marut, Indra, Varun&#x301;a and the rest stood out before these prehistoric humans as their chief gods. Behind these powerful, mighty, variously-manifest entities was another solitary entity. Those who searched for Him were the rs&#x301;is of that initial era. With this search the first dawn of the Vedas filled humanity&#146;s eastern cultural horizon with its crimson light.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The days passed. A few thousand years went by. They used to wear animal skins, not to cover their shame, but rather to save themselves from the cold&#146;s fierce grip (for this they used the verbal root u&#x301;rn&#x301;u). Such was the condition of the humans of those days. Language was still undeveloped and they had yet to discover script, but they used to band together and live in mountain caves, and they used bone and stone implements. With the help of these implements they would draw pictures depicting their prehistoric thinking and experiences. These were the oldest examples of their art.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Time continued its inexorable march. Human beings discovered fire. The discovery of fire, or better to say, the invention of fire, marked the most significant day in human history. After the invention of fire, people began to use it. It took a few more centuries to refine the uses of fire. Gradually, people learned to use fire properly. They learned to eat roasted meat instead of raw meat and to make other kinds of food much tastier by partially cooking them.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> They learned the use of salt. Earlier they used to satisfy their bodies&#146; need for salt by licking salty earth. Ultimately, with the help of fire and other means, they were able to produce salt and learned how to use it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->We can look at this special stage of human civilization as the time when prehistoric humans stepped into the periphery and power of history. After the terrifying night of their dark caves, the first dawn of optimism started to peep over their eastern horizon. The crimson dawn was another of their gods.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->This first moment of the invention of fire distinguished human beings as the greatest of living creatures. Through the use of fire, sky-kissing civilizations were built that could give everything to humankind &ndash; everything, that is, except life&#146;s deeper beatitude. One of the contributions civilization did make was to give humans an engulfing, domineering pride over all life. This pride may one day tumble them from the highest peaks down to the ground and turn them into dust.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Fire is indispensable. Humans cannot survive without fire. Metallurgy, and the manufacture of wheels, vehicles, weapons, agricultural tools and weaving machines, are all by the grace of fire. It is not an easy task to prepare fire. In the initial stage, they produced fire through the frictional heat of rubbing two pieces of flint together. Fire could not be kept by just anybody. A few rs&#x301;is [sages] were designated to keep fire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In those days, people lived mainly in the forests, constructing shelters in tall trees in imitation of birds&#146; nests, or in mountain caves. Gotra [which also came to mean &ldquo;clan&rdquo;] was the Vedic word for both &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; and &ldquo;large forest&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->In the beginning, a head woman would be the leader of each gotra. She was the gotrama&#x301;ta&#x301; [matriarch]. Later came the age of male dominance. The head of the gotra would then be a male rs&#x301;i. His followers took pride in the rs&#x301;i, who was designated to keep the fire. That fire-keeping sage was called a sa&#x301;gnik or a&#x301;gnihotrii. He would worship fire as a holy god. He would offer sumptuous foods into the fire for the satisfaction of A&#x301;gni, the fire-god. This was called havana. The general term for these offerings and sacrifices was yajin&#x32D;a. The word yajin&#x32D;a (yaj + na) means &ldquo;action&rdquo;, a special type of action, an auspicious action. The root verb yaj means &ldquo;to do a work&rdquo;. Yaj + ghain&#x32D; = ya&#x301;ga. When a sa&#x301;gnik fell ill or was absent, his patnii [wife] or son would protect the fire and provide it fuel. In this connection, I would like to discuss something about the meaning of the term patnii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Prior to Lord Shiva, there was no institution of marriage in human society. As fathers and mothers were not bound by the ties of duty, the innocent children suffered tremendous hardship. The mothers had to bear a great burden as they had to shoulder the entire responsibility of rearing the children. The result was that the women&#146;s progress in different spheres of life was thwarted. Shiva, through the application of logic and strength, forced husbands and wives into a social bond. That was the first time social marriage took place in this world. The system that Shiva introduced has continued in different ways throughout the world into the modern age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->After Shiva&#146;s time, opportunistic men divided the social status of women into various categories. We can roughly analyse the following levels:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><b>Patnii</b>: A patnii enjoyed equal religious and social rights as her husband.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Her children were entitled to all religious and social rights as their inheritance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><b>Ja&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: A ja&#x301;ya&#x301; was deprived of the religious rights, but was entitled to the social rights of her husband. Her children were entitled to the religious and social rights of their father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph --><b>Bha&#x301;rya&#x301;</b>: A bha&#x301;rya&#x301; was not allowed any of the religious or social rights of her husband. But as the marriage was recognized, her children were entitled to the religious and social rights of their father. A bha&#x301;rya&#x301; was married only to perpetuate the lineage, not to give the woman dignity. That&#146;s why it was declared: Puttra&#x301;rthe kriyate bha&#x301;rya&#x301; [&ldquo;A bha&#x301;rya&#x301; is taken on only for the sake of male children&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><b>Kalatra</b>: Some time before the Buddhist age, the system of kalatra was introduced, but it did not receive encouragement in the Buddhist period. It remained in an obscure form, but later gained ascendancy in the post-Buddhist age. In this husband-wife relationship, the wife did not enjoy the religious and social rights of her husband. The children were also denied any of the paternal religious or social rights; they inherited their mother&#146;s gotra, caste and social rights according to the system of anuloma and pratiloma.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> For instance, if the father was a Vipra, an &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;, and the mother a Shu&#x301;dra, their child did not receive its father&#146;s caste; that is, the child was not a Vipra, but was put into the caste of its mother, that is, was treated as a Shu&#x301;dra. Or suppose the father belonged to the Bharadva&#x301;j Gotra. His child did not necessarily belong to the Bharadva&#x301;j Gotra. For instance, if the mother&#146;s gotra was Ka&#x301;shyapa, then her child belonged to the Ka&#x301;shyapa Gotra. If, furthermore, the marriage was not socially recognized, the children were not entitled even to their mother&#146;s gotra and caste. They were vra&#x301;tya [outcaste].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The word vra&#x301;tya occurs in the shloka in the earlier part of this essay. That is, in the period when this shloka was composed there was a rejected fifth caste suggested by this word vra&#x301;tya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Although kalatra means &ldquo;wife&rdquo;, it is neuter gender. It will not be declined as kalatrah or kalatra&#x301; but as kalatram. (Yad bharttureva hitamicchati tad kalatram [&ldquo;One who wishes the welfare of her husband is kalatra&rdquo;].)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->(Similarly, the word da&#x301;ra means &ldquo;wife&rdquo;, but it is in masculine gender and plural number. So its declension will be like that of nara [&ldquo;man&rdquo;]. That is why when it is declined in the first case, it will always be da&#x301;ra&#x301;. When it is used in a sentence, da&#x301;ra is changed into da&#x301;ra&#x301;. But as the original word is da&#x301;ra, the Sanskrit expression is da&#x301;ra parigraha [&ldquo;to take a wife&rdquo;], not da&#x301;ra&#x301; parigraha when used in the sense of a man&#146;s marriage. A widower will be called mrtada&#x301;ra, not mrtada&#x301;ra&#x301;, a bachelor is akrtada&#x301;ra and not akrtada&#x301;ra&#x301;.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Needless to say, as the children of kalatras were not entitled to paternal religious and social rights, they were not permitted to keep fire either. If a kalatra marriage was socially recognized, the children were entitled to the maternal religious and social rights. Only if their mother was permitted to keep fire did her children inherit the right to keep fire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><b>Niyoga custom</b>: When the kuliina [high born] system abruptly burst forth like a meteor or comet, cursing the whole society, its corollary, niyoga, spontaneously burgeoned.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->It was extremely difficult for the kuliinas who married so many women to maintain them all with food and clothes. Some of the wives stayed in their husband&#146;s house and the rest of the wives would remain in their fathers&#146; houses. In many cases, even though a child of a kuliina wife was recognized as the legitimate child of its mother&#146;s lawful husband, usually it was the offspring of a socially unrecognized mate of the wife. These socially unrecognized mates were called niyoga pati [niyoga husband]. The children would call that particular man niyoga pita&#x301; [niyoga father], and the children were niyoga putra [niyoga sons]. The Pandava brothers of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata were the niyoga putras of different fathers. Society somewhat accepted this system. Although the children inherited the gotra and caste of their mother&#146;s legitimate husband, or even his social and religious rights, they did not inherit the natural inheritable qualities of their fathers, as there was no blood relation between the husband and the niyoga putras. In this niyoga system, the number of kuliinas increased by leaps and bounds, but the standard of quality could not be kept. The inevitable result of this ugly system was that the intellectual level of the kuliinas gradually declined. The children of the niyoga pita&#x301; could inherit the social and religious rights of their socially-accepted father, but were not authorized from the paternal side to keep fire. Most of them were not born or brought up in the paternal home, rather they would stay with their maternal uncles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph --><b>Pratiloma</b>: In the cases where the father was of an upper caste and the mother was of a lower caste, the offspring born under such an anuloma system were entitled to their father&#146;s gotra and caste but not his religious and social rights. (This was the case in the patriarchal social system. But in the matrilineal social system the children would inherit the mother&#146;s gotra, caste and social and religious rights.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->But if the marriage took place under the pratiloma system, the children were only entitled to their father&#146;s gotra, but not his caste nor any other rights whatsoever. Nor were they entitled to their mother&#146;s gotra, caste, or social and religious rights. Hundreds of castes and sub-castes were created due to the children born out of this socially-unacceptable pratiloma system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->In Bengal also, many small castes and communities were created, and they exist to this day. Needless to say, none of these castes had the right to keep fire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->You can easily understand from these events and various marriage systems that women were merely playthings in the hands of a group of opportunistic, capricious men. Today their position has changed on paper, but the actual position remains virtually the same as before. People guided by righteous intellect should be vocal against these ugly customs and injustices to women. Further, they should work to abolish these things without any more delay. The path which Lord Shiva showed for social emancipation should be adhered to by His followers. The path should be made wider, paved well, and made easily accessible, instead of making it more thorny.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->What I have said about the preservation of the sacred fire was the norm but there were some few exceptions. There were even some rs&#x301;is who did the various works for preserving the fire by themselves such as the fire rituals, feeding it with wood and so on. They did not even take the help of their sons and wives. A fire that was preserved and tended by one such rs&#x301;i was known as ekars&#x301;i. An ekars&#x301;i fire was considered extremely holy. The shloka which was quoted at the beginning refers to Parama Purus&#x301;a as being as ordinary as an outcaste and also as holy an entity as an ekars&#x301;i fire, that is, He is the best of the best and the commonest of the common, the supreme of the supreme and the lowest point among all low points.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->In ancient times there was the custom of interring a person after death or floating the body on water. After the discovery and invention of fire people considered it proper to burn the dead body. Thus in the pre-Vedic and at the beginning of the Vedic era the prevalent custom was to bury the body. In later times, much later times, the system of cremation came into vogue. When the system of cremation became common people used to think: This rs&#x301;i who tended, preserved and meticulously served the fire throughout his life with the help of orally-pronounced mantras will no longer preserve the fire with the help of those mantras. Thus, at the time of offering his dead body to the fire, the ekars&#x301;i fire should first touch his mouth one last time; then let the burning grass or hay consume the rest of him. This custom of touching the mouth with the ekars&#x301;i fire gradually became transformed into a social tradition. Those who did not maintain the ekars&#x301;i fire also had fire put into their mouths. The rule was even introduced for those who had nothing to do with the fire at all. What was tradition became a compulsory social observation.<!-- /block --></p>

I do not even like to think about the abominable way we put fire in the mouth of our recently departed loved ones at the time of performing their funeral rites. The mantra also is also unusual.

Some of them had frets and others not. Just think of it! Shiva had to make practically superhuman efforts with this primitive <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;</I>. He had to invent the scale. He had to string his instrument very carefully to get the proper sound. It was Shiva who made the <I>ra&#x301;gas</I> and <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;iis</I>. He introduced soul-stirring modulation into them. He felt the need for musical metre &ndash; without metre and tempo there could be no song. To maintain the rhythm he invented the horn and the <I>d&#x301;ambaru</I> [a small drum shaped like an hourglass]. In the post-Shiva, Vedic era this tabor and horn took the form of the <I>mrdaun&#x32D;ga</I>. That was during the end of the Yajurvedic <I></I>era and the beginning of the Atharvavedic <I></I>era.

The word ekasaran&#x301;a can also be used for such a procession. Several persons are moving side by side along a single path. They are one-another&#146;s ekasaran&#x301;a.

<a name="120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->We get the word aun&#x32D;ga from the verbal root anj. The meaning of the verbal root anj is &ldquo;of some portion going out or advancing from the original structure&rdquo;. For this reason hands and feet and so forth are called the aun&#x32D;ga of the body. Thus, etymologically, one who has only one aun&#x32D;ga is eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;the planet Mercury&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->In most cases planets are those heavenly bodies that revolve around stars, such as the earth, Mars, Mercury, Saturn and so on. When several or more stars collectively resemble a certain animal or some other figure, and if they rest within the orbit of the sun and moon or other planets of this solar system then they are called &ldquo;constellation&rdquo;(ra&#x301;shi). A star or group of stars located in any of the portions of a constellation is called naks&#x301;atra. The smaller heavenly bodies that revolve around planets are called &ldquo;satellites&rdquo;, that is, the heavenly bodies that revolve around stars are called planets (graha) and the heavenly bodies that revolve around planets are called satellites (upagraha). For example, the earth&#146;s satellite is the moon; Mars&#146;s satellites are Deimos (daetya) and Phobos (bhaya). Because of the proximity of Saturn&#146;s satellites from one another they appear to form a ring. Thus Saturn has a ring of satellites revolving around it. In ancient times astrologers were unable to find any satellite of Mercury so they gave it the name eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->When stars move in circum-rotarian fashion while remaining in a liquid or gaseous state then small portions of these stars shoot off and go into orbit around them. These portions of stars that break off and go into orbit around them are known as planets. It is not that a large portion always breaks away from the parent body; small and extremely small portions also break away. Some of these small or extremely small portions return to the parent star and some go into orbit around the newly-created planets. Those that go into orbit around planets become satellites.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->It often happens that a newly-created planet has circum-rotarian motion. All newly-created planets revolve around stars but some revolve circumrotarian-wise and some do not. The earth does and for that reason it has both day and night. Those that do not revolve in such fashion remain in either eternal-night or eternal-day. When planets which revolve circumrotarian-wise remain in a gaseous or liquid state, portions of their body also often break off and go into orbit around them. These are also satellites. It was the opinion of ancient astrologers that the moon was formed in this way, that is, a certain portion of the earth broke away and went into orbit around it. It was the conception of those ancient astrologers that there was a great pit left in that portion of the earth from which the moon broke away, and that pit was the Pacific Ocean (the largest and deepest ocean). The old Sanskrit name for the Pacific Ocean was ks&#x301;iirasa&#x301;gara or ks&#x301;iiroda&#x301;rn&#x301;ava. Thus we even find in the moon&#146;s dhya&#x301;na mantra:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->If any smaller star, planet or satellite falls on a larger star, planet or satellite then that smaller falling star, planet or satellite is called ulka&#x301; [meteor]. A meteor need not be the entire body of a star, planet or satellite; it may also be a fractional portion of that structure. As a result of collision with a falling meteor, deviation of orbit sometimes occurs, or can occur. As a result of this deviation of orbit it is natural that a change occurs in the daily or yearly motion as well. In the last few thousand years certainly, and even in the last few hundred years, it is only natural that the earth&#146;s daily and yearly motion has undergone some change, thus it is incumbent upon the astrophysicists that they recalculate the exact time of the earth&#146;s daily and yearly cycles each year, or if this is not possible then at least every few years. Otherwise, we will be forced to carry the burden of our mistaken measure of time in many diverse spheres of life, and that is not at all desirable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->It will have to be carefully investigated if it is possible or not for any living being, microbe, living seed, plant or vegetable seed to travel from one planet to another through the medium of these falling meteors. Some people are of the opinion that the people of ancient times used to address as deva those beings who had arrived from other planets. The truth of their opinion should be carefully verified.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->In many people&#146;s opinion, if a powerful heavenly body or meteor approaches close to a star then often a loose portion of that star will separate from the original body and go into orbit around it. They are also planets and normally other small portions of the star do not break away along with them. And because the newly-created planet itself is not always in a gaseous or liquid state no satellite is produced from its body. Planets created in this way remain alone; they are eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga. Mercury is such an eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga planet, thus in the language of the ancient astronomers eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga meant &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo;. You can also use eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga to mean &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo; in Bengali. Budhava&#x301;r [Wednesday] can also be called Eka&#x301;un&#x32D;gava&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
