<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Whatever exists in this world has some meaning behind it. Even every word that we use has a history of its own. It may be that not many are aware of that meaning. But that does not mean that there is no meaning in it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Every word has a history. Fifteen thousand years ago, the word ratha was in use. The usual meaning of the word ratha is &ldquo;chariot&rdquo;. But why was the chariot called ratha? There would be a charioteer, and he, in those ancient times, in order to goad the horses to pull the chariot, would make a sound like ra&#8230; ra&#8230; ra. Upon hearing which the horses would immediately start running. When he would make a sound like tha&#8230; tha, the horses would stop. Since the chariot was controlled by the sounds ra and tha, it came to be known as ratha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There are so many things in the world the meaning of which is not known to many. Take for instance the name of this town, &ldquo;Ludhiana&rdquo;. Not many are aware of what the word means. But it does have a meaning. In the Vedic language there was a word lodhra, which is the name of a flower. The women of those ancient times would use the pollen of this flower as their face-powder. There was also in the Vedic language a word dha&#x301;nya, meaning any green vegetation. This land had lodhra-dha&#x301;nya in abundance, and the local dialect of the land, about 3500 years ago, was Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta. The original Vedic Sanskrit &ldquo;Lodhra-Dha&#x301;nya&rdquo; became corrupted by Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta to &ldquo;Lodhdha Ha&#x301;nna&rdquo;. Then 2500 years ago, that word became changed in Demi-Paesha&#x301;cii into &ldquo;Lodhdhaa&#x301;nna&rdquo;, which then in Old Punjabi took the form of &ldquo;Lodhiya&#x301;na&rdquo;. Now in modern Punjabi it is &ldquo;Ludhiya&#x301;na&rdquo;. [Anglicized in turn as &ldquo;Ludhiana&rdquo;.] In the same way, there is not a single word that does not have some meaning behind it, though people may or may not be aware of that meaning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->One such word is &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;, the meaning of which is not known to many. In Sanskrit the verb krs&#x301; means &ldquo;to do research&rdquo;, &ldquo;to find out&rdquo;. So the Entity that one attains by making one&#146;s mind subtler and subtler,  through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and bhajanas, is called &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. In other words, what someone attains through profound culture and sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The second meaning of the verb krs&#x301; is &ldquo;to attract&rdquo;, &ldquo;to draw everything to one&#146;s own self&rdquo;. The nucleus of our solar system is the sun, and a number of planets, satellites, etc., are orbiting round the sun. The sun is attracting all the orbiting objects towards itself. It is because of this attraction that the planets, satellites, etc., are able to move round their nucleus along their own orbits. Similarly, He who is attracting the whole universe towards His own self, is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Thus Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is the greatest force of attraction in the universe. No one can go beyond the ambit of His attractive force. People may or may not come close to Him, but under no circumstances can anybody transcend the limits of His being. And where would anyone go, after all? Outside His being there is nothing and nobody. Hence to Him who has the greatest attractive power, we give the name &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You also know that of all the colours from white to black, black has the greatest force of attraction. That is why in Sanskrit black is called krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now let us talk a little about history. About 3500 years ago, this Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a [India] of ours was divided into many fragments. There was no unity among the different kingdoms, and in the absence of unity, the development of the common people was not possible. Yet Bha&#x301;rata is one and indivisible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of &ldquo;Bha&#x301;rata&rdquo;? In Sanskrit the root verb bhr means &ldquo;to provide with subsistence&rdquo;; and the root verb tan means &ldquo;to increase&rdquo;, &ldquo;to enhance&rdquo;. So bha&#x301;rata comes to stand for a land where all the necessary means of subsistence are available, with ample scope for all-round development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a [vars&#x301;a = &ldquo;land&rdquo;] was divided into a number of diverse smaller states which had no unity among them. And in the absence of unity, no development of the country as a whole was ever possible. But culturally Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a is a land of a single social group. Here was born in days long past a great maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a whose ambition it was to bring the fragmented parts of the land together and to establish a bond of unity among them. And that He did accomplish. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was the great personality of that age who could attract everyone with His extraordinary personality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->You may ask, then why did Lord Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a have to plan out the battle of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata?<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> You should bear in mind that whenever someone wants to accomplish a task, he or she has to devise certain means for the purpose. You can get your work done with sweet words. But it is a fact that not everybody can be induced to work by sweet words! If the driver of an ox cart tells his oxen, &ldquo;Oh my dears, please turn left or turn right,&rdquo; the oxen may or may not pay heed to the request. That is why the driver is found to have a sharp prod in his hand. People who are sincere and good will readily do the job on the basis of sweet words. But some people are as obstinate as oxen. For them the application of force is needed. And when that fails, then even sterner measures are required. That explains why the battle of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata had to be orchestrated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->It would not be correct to say that He had to fight the battle, because Lord Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a himself did not take part in that battle. But He devised the plan of the battle. He had to do this under pressure of circumstances. Where sweet words do not work, or simple reason fails, the application of force is the only weapon to accomplish the job. Words that the mind will not easily obey, flesh and bone obey when struck a blow. This Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was an historical figure. Descending to the earth of that time in the form of a human being, He accomplished a great task in human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those of you who are students of science, particularly of medical science, must know that the human body has a number of glands. They secrete different types of hormones, and these secretions determine the mental vrttis [propensities] of human beings. On these secretions also depend the nature, conduct, and the behaviour patterns of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->To control the propensities there are certain cakras [psycho-spiritual centres or plexi] located in different parts of the body. These cakras in turn are controlled by the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In fact all the functions of the organism are controlled by the sahasra&#x301;ra. So when someone wants to ascend, to become spiritually elevated, they have to raise their jiivabha&#x301;va [microcosmic bearing] to a higher level. This jiivabha&#x301;va is known in the language of the scriptures as the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii [latent divine force]. The kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii should be aroused and made to ascend gradually step by step from the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  to the central controlling point in the sahasra&#x301;ra. This jiivabha&#x301;va, or kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii shakti, is called &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo; in Tantric scriptures, while the central controlling power in the sahasra&#x301;ra, from where all the manifold activities of humans are controlled, is called &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. When the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii reaches the sahasra&#x301;ra, the person attains moks&#x301;a [non-qualified liberation]. This is the significance of &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; in yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->These are some of the interpretations of the word &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. But whatever interpretation we give, one thing should always be remembered &ndash; that all the &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;as&rdquo; are ultimately one and the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The essence of dharma, its mystery, lies hidden in Parama Purus&#x301;a. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is the controller of the whole universe. Even then He is not far away from you. Who in this world is nearest of all to you? Certainly it is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. And whom do you love most in the world? Again it is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Maybe you love Him unconsciously, while He loves you consciously. Very well does He know who in this world is a sinner and who is virtuous. Knowing full well what is what, He loves all without discrimination. He does not keep aloof from anybody out of contempt. He never says that He will not allow So-and-so a place in His heart because that person is a sinner. To Him a sinner and a virtuous person are equal. You should always remember that whatever be the past history of a person, that person&#146;s link with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, from beginningless time to endless time, will always remain the same. So never under any circumstances should you allow any sort of doubt or anxiety to enter your mind.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata literally means &ldquo;Great  India&rdquo;. Hence Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata became the name both for the campaign led by Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to unify India, and for the epic composition about that campaign. Here it means the former. &ndash;Trans.</p>
