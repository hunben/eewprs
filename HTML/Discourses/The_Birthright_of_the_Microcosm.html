<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As you know, all are the progeny of the same Supreme Progenitor. He created this universe and He created this material world, as well as His living children. Now, when he created the material world, the inanimate world, the plants and the human beings, common sense says that the entire world belongs to His children irrespective of caste, creed, religion, nationality, standard of education, standard of wisdom, or standard of physical, mental or spiritual strength. It is the vested interests, with their mean and base motives, that create disparity among living creatures, especially among human beings. So those who exploit others and want to enjoy this created world by depriving others of their legitimate and paternal rights, are the enemies of society. They are the enemies of humanity, and they are the enemies of the cultured and civilized world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe brhante.&rdquo; His created beings, His loving sons and daughters, His children, are moving round Him. They cannot get themselves detached from Him because He is the Supreme Nucleus and others are just like electrons moving round the nucleus. So Purus&#x301;ottama, Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Father, the Supreme Progenitor, is in the centre, and the others are moving and dancing round Him. They move along with their different psychic and physical pabula.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Physical needs are not the same for all. So, I have said that they are all moving with their respective pabula. Similarly, psychic longings, psychic desires, psychic propensities are not the same for all. Here it has been said, &ldquo;ajiiva&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;occupations&rdquo;, both physical and mental, that is, pabulum. It is a fact that each and every individual has got his respective physical pabulum and also psychic pabulum. But this does not mean that one&#146;s physical pabulum or psychic pabulum should be snatched away by others. That is, one must not be deprived of one&#146;s physical or psychic pabulum. Those who do such a thing, or try to do so, I have said, are the enemies of human civilization. They are the cursed children of the Supreme Progenitor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe.&rdquo; According to mental propensities, mental longings and desires, mental thirst and hunger, the jiivas get different frameworks, different physical structures, in order to quench their thirst, to satisfy their hunger. So, some are in animal form, some are in insect form, some are in plant form, and some are in human form. And even in human form they are different from one another in accordance with the difference in their reactive momenta. Now, according to the difference in their reactive momenta, there is a difference in distance from the Nucleus. Someone is a few inches away, someone a few feet, someone a few miles away &ndash; but all are moving around the Nucleus around Him. Somewhere the radius is small, somewhere the radius is big. Someone is moving around Parama Pita&#x301; in one way, someone else in another way, and someone else in still another way. But they are all moving, and each being has its own radius according to its reactive momenta. Move they must. They will have to move round Him, just like electrons moving round the nucleus. &ldquo;Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe.&rdquo; So they are moving with their own physical and psychic pabula, in their respective structures, in their respective forms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, when one&#146;s goal goes from crude to cruder, the distance, i.e., the length of the radius, increases. The person has drifted away from the centre because of his base thoughts, base longings and base actions. And when the thoughts and actions go from subtle to subtler, the length of the radius decreases, and a day comes, a sweet moment comes, when the person becomes one with the Nucleus. That is what is called moks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tasmin ham&#x301;so Bhra&#x301;myate Brahmacakre.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ham&#x301;so&rdquo; means &ldquo;jiiva&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;living&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ham&#x301;so&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the jiiva. Each and every object has its own acoustic root. &ldquo;A&rdquo; is the acoustic root of creation. &ldquo;Ae&rdquo; is the acoustic root of knowledge. &ldquo;Ka&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the expressed world. &ldquo;Kha&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the sky. &ldquo;Ra&rdquo; is the acoustic root of energy. Similarly, &ldquo;ham&#x301;so&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the jiiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tasmin ham&#x301;so Bhra&#x301;myate Brahmacakre.&rdquo; This ham&#x301;so, this jiiva, is moving in its Cosmic system, on its Cosmic route. The small system is the atomic system, and bigger than the atomic system is this ethereal system of ours. In the atomic system there is a small nucleus, and electrons are moving round it. And in our ethereal system, the earth is the nucleus and the moon is moving round it. And similarly, in our Brahma Cakra, Purus&#x301;ottama is the Nucleus, and each and every entity, animate or inanimate, is moving around Him. And they will be moving round Him. &ldquo;Prthaga&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; prerita&#x301;rain&#x32D;ca matva&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; All entities will continue to move around Him as long as they feel that they and their Nucleus, the progeny and the Progenitor, are different and far away from each other. And when they feel, &ldquo;I am part of the Supreme Father and I should be one with Him,&rdquo; they become one with Him in this big ocean of divine nectar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->And what happens then? &ldquo;Jus&#x301;t&#x301;astatastena&#x301;mrtatvameti.&rdquo; Created beings attain immortality. You know that attaining immortality is not within the reach, not within the capacity, of human stamina. For this the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a is an essential prerequisite. And this grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a is always showering on all without exception. Therefore, attaining immortality is the birthright of every human being. Those who want to deprive human beings of their birthright are the enemies of mankind. They are demons in human form. Expose such demons, such cursed persons of the human society, and establish a society free from all exploitation. See that all opportunities for exploitation, even a wee bit of exploitation, are eliminated.<!-- /block --></p>
