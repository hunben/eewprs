<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Matter and Abstract.&rdquo;  Some intellectuals are of the opinion that matter is bottled-up energy.  No, matter is not bottled-up energy. The characteristics and different wonts and specialties of energy are quite different from those of matter.  The mass of matter has got nothing to do with energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is matter?  It is &ldquo;known I&rdquo; in the cosmic arena in different planes of inferences, and these planes of inferences have nothing to do with one another. They have got minimum proximity to one another.  Somewhere there is maximum solidity, somewhere maximum dilution, and these phases of dilutions and solidities vary in huge number.  So matter is not bottled-up energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Chlorophyll and sun rays are not the same thing.  Sun rays are light energy, which as per the rule, may be converted into electrical energy, sound energy, magnetic energy and so many energies known and unknown to the world.  They are interchangeable and inter-transmutable.  But the position of matter is not such.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Chlorophyll is helped, is moved, by sun rays.  It is the inherent wont of energy to create movement.  Rather, energy and movement are inseparable.  They are inseparable from each other.  Chlorophyll is conveyed, is carried, by sun rays &ndash; and not only sun rays, but by the different rays of different celestial bodies.  And this movement of different bodies through the media of energies does not pass in a straight line; that is, the movement is of systaltic character, of pulsative nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Where this movement in the plane of inferences of cosmic nature, that is, in the cosmic arena, creates a reflection only, there the reflected energy creates a sort of sentient reaction.  And where there are reflections as well as refractions, these are of mutative character, creating mutations of various nature.  And where there is no reflection, only refractions, they are of static nature. There is staticity in them.  So matter is not bottled-up energy &ndash; it is &ldquo;known I&rdquo; in the cosmic arena, in the arena of the cosmos.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, the entity or entities coming within the conception of the mind are pure abstract, and those coming within the perceptions or feelings of the sensory or motor organs are matter, pure matter.  But the position of energy and microvita is on this silver line of demarcation between matter and abstract.  Energy generally comes within the range of perception, but not always.  Energy in its subtle form does not come within the range of perception. Subtle microvita also do not come within the range of perception, but they come within the range of conception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->You know, both microvita and energy are active in different planes of expressions, that is, in different physical or psycho- spiritual planes of the unit or collective propensities, and in the physical planes of inferences.  But microvita are more active in the physico-psycho-spiritual strata, and energy is more active in the physical planes of inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Regarding the strength or influence of energy and microvita, this much can be said &ndash; energy is stronger in the physical planes of inferences than in the physico-psycho-spiritual planes of the unit and collective propensities.  And microvita are stronger in the physico-psycho-spiritual realm of the unit mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Regarding positive and negative microvita &ndash; negative microvita function in a better way in the physical and physico-psychic strata, and positive microvita in the psychic and psycho-spiritual strata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So there should be maximum utilization of the potentialities of the expressed and emanated energy as well as of the expressed and emanated microvita, both positive and negative.  There is also use of negative microvita for the all-round and integrated development of this living world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Microvita influence human intellect and also a portion of human intuition. The favourite fields of positive microvita are the psychic and psycho-spiritual strata, and the favourite fields of negative microvita are the physical and physico-psychic strata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Energy is a blind force.  It has got no conscience &ndash; what is to be done or what should not be done, this sort of conscience is lacking in energy.  But microvita are not like that; that is, they are not blind forces.  They have the support of conscience behind them. This is another fundamental difference between energy and microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The effect of energy on different material bodies comes within the periphery of human knowledge if the wavelength is of medium standard &ndash; not extremely long or not extremely short. But the effect of microvita is to be felt &ndash; it cannot be expressed through language, it cannot be shown in the physical level. You must not try to acquire that occult power, but sometimes, by the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, it appears automatically.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Microvita, like energy, pass through various planes of inferences, and also through various planes of propensities.  In the inference of say touch, microvita increase the temperature in the external sphere and decreases it in the internal sphere.  In the case of odour, they decrease the temperature in the external sphere and increase the same in the internal sphere. But generally, regarding other inferences, such as sound and others, sometimes they may increase externally and sometimes they may decrease externally, according to the medium through which those microvita pass.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now, energy is inter-transmutable and interchangeable, but matter is not inter-transmutable or interchangeable.  It undergoes metamorphosis, metamorphosis once, but not always; that is, one way but not vice versa.  In the cosmic arena, in the cosmic stratum, if we try to dissociate what we feel or what we conceive or what we perceive into the &ldquo;knower&rdquo; and &ldquo;known&rdquo; portions, the cosmos in the physical level is the &ldquo;doing&rdquo; entity in the physical level and is microvita; and the &ldquo;done&rdquo; portion is the world of physicality.  And the &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; faculty in the cosmic level is the supreme cause or the subtlest form of energy, and the &ldquo;known&rdquo; portion or the &ldquo;known&rdquo; counterpart is the psychic and psycho-spiritual worlds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Energy, if it comes in direct contact with this world of physicality, is converted into so many energies &ndash; magnetic energy, electrical energy and many other energies.  And when that very energy functions through the cosmic &ldquo;known&rdquo; world, the Cosmic &ldquo;Known&rdquo; Entity, then it creates different psychic faculties, different psychic worlds. And if after passing through the Cosmic &ldquo;Known&rdquo; Entity it comes down towards the plane of cosmic or individual propensities, its movement is towards the crude, towards crudification.  But if it moves towards the cosmic cognitive faculty it is converted into psycho-spiritual movement, and finally spiritual movement or into the Spiritual Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Similarly, a microvitum, although it is initially the &ldquo;doer&rdquo; portion of the cosmic arena, if it passes through the expressed world of &ldquo;done&rdquo;, then it may create something good or something bad in the universe. If the movement is from a subtler plane to a cruder plane, it deteriorates or depraves the human mind or the standard of human conduct. But if the movement is towards a subtler plane, towards the subtler inferences of cosmic light, then it helps human beings, it helps spiritual aspirants, to attain the goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Microvita, when passing through different planes of inferences and also planes of propensities, can not only change the bodily temperature or temperatures of the mass, they can also create a radical change in the psychic wave, a change in wavelengths, a change in hormone secretion, and metamorphosis and transmutation in the mass and movement of hormones.  This should also be carefully remembered and noted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->It is the duty of the intellectuals of the world to continue doing research work regarding the movements of energy and of microvita when passing through the &ldquo;done&rdquo; world of the cosmic or individual propensities, or through the &ldquo;known&rdquo; world of cosmic inferences, or passing through both  types of planes; and also regarding the movement of energy passing through the plane of the &ldquo;known&rdquo; or the &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; world &ndash; the world of the &ldquo;known&rdquo; counterpart of the cosmos &ndash; and also through the world of individual propensities and different planes of individual inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->I would like intellectuals in the future to conduct experiments in their external physical laboratories and also in their internal psycho-spiritual laboratories. And you boys and you girls, you are to help them in accelerating the speed of their research work.<!-- /block --></p>
