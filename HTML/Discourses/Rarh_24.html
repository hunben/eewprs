<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The world is rhythmic. The subtler reverberations in human brains which manifest themselves in the realm of language are the first mundane expressions of the subtle world. Hence the sound tanma&#x301;tra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  is the subtlest of tanma&#x301;tras. Whether or not an individual is educated, he or she can give ecstatic expression to his or her deep feelings only through language. One may say that the subtlest stratum of art is the lines of drawing, and not words or language spoken or written. This is true, but are not &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; and &ldquo;writing&rdquo; here just two different names for language? &ldquo;Aban Tagore writes pictures.&rdquo; What is the meaning here of the word &ldquo;writes&rdquo;? It means that he actually writes language [through painting]. Humans cannot express in the form of spoken language even one per cent of what they feel deep inside; they cannot express in writing everything that they can express in spoken language; and they cannot express through drawings everything that they can express in writing. This is why I said elsewhere that the art of painting is a subtler art &ndash; because here even higher expressions remain confined within a few lines of drawing. It is like a violin, which has no frets, amid musical instruments studded with frets.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> But the fact of the matter is that the expression is purely acoustic. The resonance of wisdom that lies within these acoustic expressions easily captivates the human mind and seizes human attention, carrying it to the realm of ideas. This evidently happened in the past due to the inspiration created by the Shaeva ideal of Lord Sada&#x301;shiva, and thus it was possible to distribute the taste of aesthetic feelings through the medium of the inner sweetness of the human mind. This is Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s Baul, and that Baul is thoroughly drenched with Shaeva Dharma. The spirit of Baul is: &ldquo;I am unable to embrace Him and make Him my own &ndash; Him whom I know, recognize and realize, and who is my nearest kin, my life and soul (in Rabindranath&#146;s words jiivan devata&#x301;) &ndash; and in a bid to embrace Him, I roam about, searching him vigorously in heaven, earth and the nether world.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ra&#x301;r&#x301;her Ba&#x301;ul, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;her Ba&#x301;ul, ka&#x301;re tumi ca&#x301;o?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ca&#x301;i ya&#x301;ha&#x301;re pa&#x301;i ne ta&#x301;re kotha&#x301;y bale da&#x301;o.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->If Shiva is the life and soul not only of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, but also of the world, we can say that Baul is the worldly reverberation of the Shaeva ideals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->I have already said that kiirtana is prevalent in various places and various forms. But one of the reasons for the ineffability and divine sweetness of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s kiirtana is that it is inspired by the ideas embodied in Baul. The other kinds of affair related to vocal and instrumental music are concerned with body and mind, i.e.; their appeal is to body and mind. And therein lies their supremacy and other-worldly charm which can be touched, yet cannot be touched. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s kiirtana, on the other hand, based on Baul, appeals to the mind and also to the soul. So the kiirtana of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h not only overwhelms the human mind; it causes a person to become completely lost. Kiirtana composed according to nandana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na induces in a person the tactual perception of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  The kiirtana of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is not merely sam&#x301;giita [song, dance and instrumental music]; it sways the finite humankind with the vibration of the unlimited and infinite; it makes humans in their little homes hear the call of the far-away blue firmament. Hence it is outstanding and unparalleled.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Let me say one more thing. Kiirtana is not like Baul, which is more verbal than written. Kiirtana is both verbal and written. So of course kiirtana comes within the purview not only of culture, but also of literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The life of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is ensconced in Baul. The psychology of the people there is basicalLy to be content with little. Once their bare subsistence is more or less assured, they no longer run after money.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The jhumur songs of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h fall within that part of literature which is connected neither with hita [welfare] nor with ahita [troubles]. I do not mean to say by this that jhumur songs are lacking in subtlety; subtlety is very much there. [Jhumur songs can delight people as long as they are not inclined towards ahita.] Jhumur songs are indigenous to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Bhavakritananda Ojha of Deoghar was the main composer of jhumur songs. Another important composer was Pachai Shaikh of Manbhum. Here is an example of a jhumur song:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->What we mean by ma&#x301;rga sam&#x301;giita, or classical music, is to control and direct musical notes and rhythmic expression through an approach based on acoustic science and psychology. This classical music (dance-song-instruments) takes on different characteristics in different places. These local characteristics are called ghara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;s [styles particular to particular places]. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii kiirtana also has four such styles, viz., 1) Manoharsha&#x301;hii, 2) Gara&#x301;nha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, 3) Renet&#x301;i and 4) Manda&#x301;ran&#x301;. In other forms of musical culture also, besides kiirtana, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had its own styles. Vishnupur, the capital of Mallabhum, for centuries occupied the highest place in the classical expression of music. Most of the famous singers not only of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, but also of Bengal as a whole, hail from Vishnupur or its neighbouring areas. Due to a lack of proper effort and zeal, the Vishnupur style is now on the brink of ruin.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)   Literally, &ldquo;minutest fraction of that,&rdquo; i.e., of a given rudimental factor of matter. Also translated &ldquo;generic essence&rdquo; or &ldquo;inferential wave&rdquo;. The various types of tanma&#x301;tras convey the senses of hearing, touch, form (vision), taste and smell. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)   In A Few Problems Solved Part 1, &ldquo;The Practice of Art and Literature&rdquo;, the author has said: &ldquo;Yet it is in painting and sculpture, which are considered the subtlest of all arts, that we find the true expression of the wonderful aesthetic sense of the human mind. In the calm stillness of a painting or a sculpture, all has to be vividly expressed &ndash; laughter and tears, hopes and fears, gestures and language. Indeed, it is the arts of painting and sculpture that beautifully bridge the gap between the mundane and the supramundane.&rdquo; &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)   Nandana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [aesthetic science] is the science of giving joy to others and getting joy from others. Mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [supra-aesthetic science] is the science by which the supreme draws the microcosms closer to Himself through inferential and other ectoplasmic attractions, or by attracting others to Himself through His irresistible charms. It is the endeavour to ensconce the microcosmic entity, the individual entitative rhythm, in the eternal being, the infinite rhythm of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Other music comes within the scope of aesthetic science, but kiirtana comes within the scope of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. So of all the branches of music, kiirtana is the best. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)   In the rural language of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, many persons pronounce the word as rag instead of rog [&ldquo;disease&rdquo;]. For example, the word bar&#x301;a rag is used for the disease of leprosy.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)   Baul means the bakul flower (Spanish cherry, Minusops elangi) and is not related to Ba&#x301;ul, i.e., the Bauls. The author has noted here: &ldquo;In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali, bakul is pronounced baul, e.g., Bakalpur &rarr; Baulpur &rarr; Bolpur.&rdquo; &ndash;Trans.</p>
