Notes: <p class="Para_Notes">This discourse was originally published in an Ananda Marga magazine that identified it as a DMC. Since, however, this is clearly just a summary of the DMC, and since the original language is not known, it should not be taken as a verbatim rendering of the discourse. &ndash;Eds.</p>

<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There is nothing beyond the periphery of the Macrocosm.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  The natural wont of everybody is to know one&#146;s surroundings; and each and every existence is surrounded by Him, the Macrocosm. So the unit being, with limited knowledge and limited ability, tries to know Him, although He is beyond the reach of his or her endeavours, either positive or negative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Macrocosm is guided by His own philosophy, own logic and rationality which is beyond all human [intellect]. Human existence, the human mind, is a small, a very small, fraction of that Supreme Entity. Hence it is not possible for a human being to know Him either intellectually or through any other type of human endeavour. And because He remains unknown, the human mind tries to move towards Him. And this movement towards that Supreme Unknown is the human urge, is the microcosmic urge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This is the urge. There is never-ending attraction. There cannot be any repulsion. There is only attraction, whether negative or positive. In the phase of extroversion, crude matter is created because of the negative attraction. But there cannot be any repulsion, nothing can remain outside Him. There cannot be anything outside the Macrocosm. So in the phase of extroversion, there is negative attraction. Attraction is always there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the counterpart to extroversion, that is, in the phase of introversion, the urge is also there. And who created this urge? That very Entity, that very supra-psychic Macrocosmic Entity created that urge. And that urge has four aspects: <ol> <li>[Vista&#x301;ra.] An urge of expansion in unit beings. The unit wants to expand, and as a result of this longing for expansion, knowingly or unknowingly, it moves towards the Supreme. <li>[Rasa.] The unit entity moves in a rhythmic order, in a pulsative order, in a systaltic style, in the universal flow; maintaining symmetry, rather maintaining parallelism, with the Cosmic flow. As a result of this flow, the jiiva moves towards the Supreme Hub, being goaded unto the Supreme Nucleus. <li>[Seva&#x301;.] The longing exists in the unit mind: &ldquo;I must do something concrete for my Supreme Progenitor.&rdquo; <li>[The spiritual longing for the supreme stance (tadsthiti) also exists in the unit mind:] &ldquo;Let my mind, let my existence, let my everything, be one with the Supreme.&rdquo; </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->These are the four phases of urge in the microcosm created through the grace of the Macrocosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->From the side of the Macrocosm, there is attraction, Macrocosmic attraction. From the side of the microcosm, there is the four-fold urge. This attraction and this urge &ndash; the Macrocosmic attraction as an emanation of the Macrocosmic conation, and the microcosmic urge &ndash; keep the balance of this universe. They keep the equilibrium of this universe and maintain the equipoise of this Cosmos. This is the liila&#x301; [divine sport] of Parama Purus&#x301;a. To surrender oneself in this liila&#x301; is the wisest thing.<!-- /block --></p>
