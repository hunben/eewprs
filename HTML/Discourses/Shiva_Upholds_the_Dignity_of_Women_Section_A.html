<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Each clan used to live on a separate hill, and the leader of that clan was respected as the patriarch (rs&#x301;i) of the clan. The affiliations of the gotra [clan] people were indicated by the name of that particular rs&#x301;i. After the patriarchal system was established, the members of one gotra would forcibly kidnap women from other gotras to their own gotra, their own hill. Thus immediately after the marriage, the woman&#146;s gotra would change, because she was than a member of a different gotra, a separate hill.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->All this invariably led the different clans into bloody conflicts. Those who were defeated in battle were captured as slaves and the women were taken to the harems of the victors. The victorious clan would then occupy the hill, the gotra of the vanquished clan. Thus within one gotra, there were many sub-gotras, called pravara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The women were forcibly carried away, their hands bound in iron chains. Even to this day, women in Bengal and some other areas wear iron bangles on their wrists after marriage &ndash; the symbols of their ancient servitude. One should clearly under stand this. The males who would attack the neighbouring hills would tie up the women and carry them to their own hill. Even today, during the marriage ceremony in certain parts of India, the bride&#146;s clothes are tied to the clothes of the bridegroom. This enslavement of the defeated gotra was a great humiliation, especially for the women. Sometimes, during the battle, the men would strike the heads of the women with an axe, causing blood to flow. Up until the present, at the time of marriage, women use a vermilion cosmetic mark on their foreheads &ndash; a symbol of blood. However, Shiva, by introducing the Shaeva [Shaivite] system of marriage, brought an end to this shameful chapter of human history.<!-- /block --></p>
