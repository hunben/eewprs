<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->To control the various propensities of human mind there are various glands and sub-glands which form certain nerve centers inside the spinal column. They are called plexii in Tantra. Each and every plexus regulates a certain number of propensities. The hormones secreted from these particular glands influence the concerning sub-glands, the other lower glands, and the vrttis controlled by their respective glands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The food and drink we take every day is converted into rasa (fluid), rakta, flesh, fat, bone marrow and lymph etc. Ultimately the lymph is converted into hormones of various types. The special hormone secreted from the spiritual aspirant&#146;s pineal gland flows into the pituitary plexus. At that time if one&#146;s mind remains engaged in pure spiritual thoughts that hormone flows from the pineal gland down the left side to the pituitary gland, and then to other plexii, glands and sub-glands, nerve fibres, nerve cells, veins and arteries, etc. This excessive flow of pineal hormone revitalises all the lower plexii. On the other hand, if one&#146;s mind remain preoccupied with crude thoughts then the pineal hormone gets burnt up at the pituitary plexus. The lower plexii and glands, due to the lack of supply of pineal secretion, do not enjoy any spiritual bliss. But when the pineal hormone flows through the pituitary plexus to the lowest plexii, the undeveloped plexii of the body become healthier and revitalized. As a rule the upper chakras control the lower ones. So the svadhista&#x301;na chakra controls the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra chakra, the manipura chakra controls the svadhista&#x301;na and mu&#x301;ladha&#x301;ra chakras, the ana&#x301;hata controls the man&#x301;ipura, svadhista&#x301;na and muladha&#x301;ra chakras, and the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; controls all the lower cakras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->At the time of pineal secretion if a sa&#x301;dhaka goes into sama&#x301;dhi &ndash; he or she visualises or experiences a kind of divine aura around the ana&#x301;hata chakra. The sa&#x301;dhaka realizes that he or she is experiencing a divine dip in the holy aura, and feels indescribable bliss in the heart. In that exalted state of realization every object of this universe seems to be extremely sweet, and one derives immense bliss which no worldly object could ever provide. The sun&#146;s rays, the moon beams, the land, the water, in fact everything appears to be emanating continuous stream of blissful nectar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Idam&#x301; ma&#x301;nusam&#x301;sarves&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301;<br>Madhvasya&#x301; ma&#x301;nu&#x301;s&#x301;asya sarva&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni madhuh<br>Aya&#x301;ma&#x301;tma&#x301; sarves&#x301;a&#x301;m bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; madhvasya a&#x301;tmanah<br>Sarvani bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni madhuh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Even a sworn enemy appears to be very sweet at that time. Everything is sweet. In Vaesnava philosophy this stage of sama&#x301;dhi is called madhura bha&#x301;va. In Tantra it is called anindya&#x301;nanda rasa sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Characteristics of Anindya&#x301;nanda Rasa Sama&#x301;dhi<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The different plexii of the body get revitalized due to abundant hormone secretion and become more active than before. The sa&#x301;dhaka enjoys immense bliss. Due to excessive feelings of joy the nerve cells and the nerve fibres become ineffective. A very sweet relation of love between the devotee and Parama Purus&#x301;a is established. Throughout the blissful experience a sweet taste is felt. This state is one of the thirty-two prominent states of bliss experienced by highly developed sa&#x301;dhakas. The special characteristics of this sama&#x301;dhi is that it cannot be attained by one&#146;s own personal efforts, but only through the grace of the Guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Of course, to attain supreme spiritual salvation it is not necessary for a sa&#x301;dhaka to experience any sama&#x301;dhi at all. For example, a passengers travelling on a Calcutta-bound train may or will not be able to see the sights of Jamalpur or Bhagalpur towns if the doors and window-shutters are closed. Although the passengers are unaware of the towns they are passing through, they still reach their destinations. In the spiritual world also, the sa&#x301;dhaka, while ideating on the Supreme will certainly pass through the different stages of realization without necessarily being aware of it. When the all-merciful Ta&#x301;raka Brahma physically comes to Earth in the form of a Sadguru He helps the deserving sa&#x301;dhakas to attain this type of sama&#x301;dhi. Even when He is physically absent in this world He helps the deserving persons to attain this sama&#x301;dhi through other gurus.<!-- /block --></p>
