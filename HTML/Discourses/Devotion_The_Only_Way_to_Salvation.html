It is the characteristic of the microcosm that it becomes one with the inferences of its pabulum and acquires all its qualities. That is why it has been said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[If even the most wicked people worship Me with a concentrated mind, I will liberate them from the three bondages (physical, psychic and spiritual).]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Who is a sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;r[a]? Dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii means &ldquo;sinner of the worst category&rdquo;, and sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra means &ldquo;sinner who is hated even by dura&#x301;ca&#x301;riis for his or her sins&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And what is bhajana? You know, in the process of ideation there are several varieties. One of those varieties is bhajana. When the sa&#x301;dhaka employs all his or her sensory and motor organs in serving his or her object of ideation, that is called bhajana. Devotees sing the name of their Lord, and their ears hear that kiirtana, that bhajana; that is, all their indriyas, all their sensory and motor organs, are engaged in serving the Lord. That particular type of ideation is called bhajana. Here the Supreme Self says that if even a sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra does bhajana &ndash; &ldquo;ideates on Me&rdquo; &ndash; ananyabha&#x301;va [or ananyabha&#x301;k &ndash; &ldquo;with single-minded devotion&rdquo;] &ndash; then what will happen? So&#146;pi pa&#x301;pavinirmuktah &ndash; that is, &ldquo;even that sinner, that sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, will be freed from all the bondages of sin.&rdquo; That is, &ldquo;I free him from all the bondages of pa&#x301;pa [sin],&rdquo; and mucyate bhava bandhana&#x301;t.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Mucyate Bhava Bandhana&#x301;t<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What is pa&#x301;pa? What is the bandhana of pa&#x301;pa? You know, there are two main varieties of pa&#x301;pa. One is pa&#x301;pa itself, and the other is pratyava&#x301;ya. In the code of morality, there are several dos and don&#146;ts. &ldquo;Do this&rdquo; &ndash; these are dos. &ldquo;Don&#146;t do this&rdquo; &ndash; these are don&#146;ts. Dos are called vidhi in Sanskrit, and don&#146;ts are called nis&#x301;edha in Sanskrit. If one does not adhere to the code of dos, one commits pratyava&#x301;ya, and if one does not adhere to the code of don&#146;ts, one commits pa&#x301;pa. &ldquo;Don&#146;t steal&rdquo; is a don&#146;t, so if one steals, one commits pa&#x301;pa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now within this pa&#x301;pa there are three varieties. One is pa&#x301;taka. The sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii; the sinner of the worst category is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii. But pa&#x301;taka means simply disobeying the code of morality. Suppose one forcibly takes ten rupees from a particular man. The one who takes it commits pa&#x301;pa. But if that person pays back that amount, and that particular man from whom the ten rupees were stolen excuses the thief, then that pa&#x301;pa committed by the thief is neutralized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->But atipa&#x301;taka cannot be neutralized; there is no atonement for that kind of pa&#x301;taka. Suppose a man cuts off the hand of an innocent person: he cannot give back that particular hand; that is, in such a case the pa&#x301;pa is unatonable. Here you say that he has committed [atipa&#x301;taka]. And maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka &ndash; maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka is a kind of atipa&#x301;taka, but its result is of recurring nature. Suppose a bad man, a corrupt businessman, discovers a particular method of adulteration. For example, he discovers the method of using papaya seeds in the [black pepper]. Here he starts a particular pa&#x301;taka, and this pa&#x301;taka will be of recurring nature, because other businessmen will learn it from him; so its effect will be of recurring nature. This particular nature of pa&#x301;taka is called maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So pa&#x301;taka is atonable, but atipa&#x301;taka is not atonable; and maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka, you know, is the worst type of [ati]pa&#x301;taka. If one wants to atone for maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka, one will have to sacrifice one&#146;s life for the cause of the entire universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->But here the Lord says, &ldquo;If that sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra&rdquo; &ndash; that is, that maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii &ndash; &ldquo;ideates on Me, then I will help that person, I will free that person from the bondages of pa&#x301;pa.&rdquo;  And mucyate bhava bandhana&#x301;t &ndash; that is, &ldquo;that person becomes free from bhava.&rdquo; What is bhava? Bhava means &ldquo;reactive momentum&rdquo;, as the factor [of unserved sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras] causing rebirth. &ldquo;The sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra even becomes freed from bhava&rdquo; &ndash; that is, he or she attains the supreme state. &ldquo;He or she becomes one with Me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->You are all sa&#x301;dhakas. You should remember this, you must not forget this.
