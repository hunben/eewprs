<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam</I> (&ldquo;Blissful Discourses&rdquo;) series assembles all the known General Darshana discourses given by Ma&#x301;rga Guru Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti. General Darshana (GD) <I>pravacanas,</I> or discourses, were those given to Ananda Marga members, often as a part of daily routine, in whatever locality Ma&#x301;rga Guru happened to be staying in at the time. Normally briefer and lighter in tone (though no less profound in their fundamental meanings) than the discourses given on the formal occasions of Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (DMC), these <I>pravacanas</I> were sometimes delivered in a very intimate way to relatively small groups of Ma&#x301;rgiis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam</I> series was first begun in 1978 when the author resumed, after a gap of some years, his practice of giving regular discourses to his followers &ndash; an audience that by then included spiritual aspirants from many countries of the world as well as from India. The series began with the GD discourses given by the author at that very time; it then for several years kept pace with, and maintained the sequence of, the GD discourses that the author gave over those subsequent years. Hence the series up through Part 22, which part contained <I>pravacanas</I> from the year 1984, was published by 1985. Each part was published at least in the original language of the majority of its <I>pravacanas</I>. And as regards English translations of those parts published originally in Bengali or Hindi, such translations up through Part 8 lagged only a little behind the originals; the English Part 8 was published in 1987.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Subsequently, from the year 1994 through the year 2000, <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 23-34 </I>came out, containing mostly GD discourses of the author from before 1978. And of those twelve books, Part 23, Part 30, Part 31, Part 33 and Part 34 came out published originally in English. But between 2000 and the present there was no publication in English of any of the <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam</I> series; hence the translations of Parts 9-22, 24-29 and 32 were much overdue. There has been a long-standing demand from our esteemed readers for these parts, and the present book, <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 9</I> <I>&amp;</I> <I>10, </I>is a step towards the fulfilment of that demand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 9</I> <I>&amp;</I> <I>10</I> contains the author&#146;s GD discourses given between February and April 1979, in Kolkata and at different places in India where the author stayed in connection with an extensive tour. These discourses are on varied topics such as spiritual philosophy, spiritual practice, history and culture; and truly contain the author&#146;s valuable and practical guidance for all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 1-3 </I>and <I>5</I> came out originally in English. While reprinting those parts in 1986 and 1987, and while printing for the first time the translations of Parts 4 and 6-8, a decision was made to standardize the size of each part. The result of this was that a few of the discourses at the end of the Bengali Part 4 came out in the reprinted English Part 5; and this in turn affected subsequent parts. So now three discourses that appeared in the first Bengali edition of Part 8 appear here in the English Part 9. They are: &ldquo;Always Do the Kiirtana of the Lord&rdquo;, &ldquo;Wherever My Devotees Sing&rdquo; and &ldquo;Take Refuge in Parama Purus&#x301;a with Unswerving Attention&rdquo;. These three discourses should henceforward be considered as belonging to Part 9.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Weighing the feedback of our readers and all other considerations, we have now decided to print two parts of <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam</I> to a volume and to use a bigger and more conventional book size than had been used previously for the<I> A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam</I> series. Henceforward, the various parts of the series will all be published in this manner.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Of the twenty-six discourses herein, fifteen were originally given by the author in Bengali and eleven originally in Hindi. The discourses &ldquo;History of Bengal &ndash; 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;History of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hbhu&#x301;m&rdquo; had been translated into English in 1988 and had appeared in <I>A Few Problems Solved Part 3,</I> and &ldquo;&#x301;Take Refuge in Parama Purus&#x301;a with Unswerving Attention&#146;&rdquo; had appeared in <I>Discourses on Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and the Giita&#x301;,</I> 1999. (&ldquo;&#x301;Take Refuge in Parama Purus&#x301;a with Unswerving Attention&#146;&rdquo; had appeared in <I>Discourses on Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and the Giita&#x301;</I> as &ldquo;&#x301;Bhajate Ma&#x301;manyabha&#x301;k&#146;&rdquo;. In the next printing of that book the title &ldquo;&#x301;Take Refuge in Parama Purus&#x301;a with Unswerving Attention&#146;&rdquo; will be used.). Minor English re-editing of these three discourses has now been done by our staff. The rest of the discourses have been newly translated (in all cases from their Bengali versions) for the present book.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Within the present book, as within each part of <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam,</I> the chronological order of the discourses has been maintained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate in the Publisher&#146;s Note &ndash; in addition to the original language of each discourse, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if other than in this book, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the translators have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Many readers are concerned that the author&#146;s discourses, as published, should adhere as closely as possible to the precise wording the author used in speaking. For this reason, in the case of discourses given originally in English, the editors do not alter pronouns and other terms which the author in his life time considered &ldquo;common-gender&rdquo; words. As the author once said, &ldquo;You know, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is not only masculine gender, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is common gender also. &lsquo;Man is mortal&rsquo; &ndash; here &lsquo;man&rsquo; means both male and female.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The author was a natural advocate of women&#146;s rights and on at least one occasion indicated that &ldquo;lopsided justice&rdquo; in language should be eliminated at some future date. In keeping with his guideline and with present-day trends, it is our policy in the case of translated discourses (where the published wording will necessarily be that of the translators) to use gender-neutral language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus <I>ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra</I> can be read, &ldquo;the root <I>tr</I> prefixed by <I>ava</I> and suffixed by <I>ghain&#x32D; </I>becomes <I>avata&#x301;ra.</I>&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Acknowledgements<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->This book is the result of the assistance and the support lent by many persons in various ways. Their sincere efforts are helping us develop an ever more professional system of work, so that the immense contribution of Shrii P.R. Sarkar can be presented in the best possible manner. Some esteemed readers, or better to say, lovers, of Shrii P.R. Sarkar&#146;s books have come forward to make arrangement for the continuous publication of his books over the coming years; thanks to them, progress is being made in building up a committed and dependable sales network. Any interested person can come forward to participate in this effort.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Ideally every new book translation undergoes initially a draft by the main translator, then &ldquo;first editing&rdquo;, then &ldquo;second editing&rdquo;, then final verification. Other important functions include coordination of the different steps, and the development and management of a sales network. Some of those who have contributed to these efforts: Deva&#x301;shiis&#x301;a translated (from the original Bengali) all sixteen of the discourses taken from <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 8 </I>and <I>9</I>. Deva&#x301;shiis&#x301;a also did the semi-final verification of the eight discourses from <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 10</I> that had not previously been published in English. Prof. A&#x301;ditya Mohanty translated all of the eight discourses from <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 10</I> that had not previously been published in English. Ga&#x301;yattrii Ghista and Ta&#x301;raka Ghista did the second editing of those same eight discourses. Ga&#x301;yattrii Ghista and Shiva Mazzola re-edited the two discourses of <I>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 10</I> which had previously been published in <I>A Few Problems Solved Part 3</I>. Ma&#x301;dhava Basak did typing, DTP work and office work. Vasanthan Parameswara proofread the entire book after its second editing. Kirit Dave took on sales management and coordination work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->We are also indebted to many others who gave constant encouragement and necessary inputs. Final verification and parts of other tasks were done by the staff of Ananda Marga Publications.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->If any defects be found, readers may be sure that they do not derive from the illustrious author, nor are they the responsibility of those who contributed to the work; rather they are the responsibility of the Publications staff alone.<!-- /block --></p>
