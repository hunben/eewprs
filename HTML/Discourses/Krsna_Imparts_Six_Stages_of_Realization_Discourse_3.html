<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->When Parama Purus&#x301;a incarnates Himself as Ta&#x301;raka Brahma [the Liberating Supreme Entity] at a certain transitional period, the people of that period invariably enjoy some special privileges. The privileges enjoyed by the people are the veritable proof of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma&#146;s advent or incarnation. Let us analyse how Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a tried to help and actually did help elevate people on the path of spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When people attain progress in the realm of spiritual realization, that progress is divided into six stages &ndash; sa&#x301;lokya, sa&#x301;miipya, sa&#x301;yujya, sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya, sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi and kaevalya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><b>Sa&#x301;lokya</b>: At the stage of sa&#x301;lokya, people feel that they have come onto the earth at the same time as Parama Purus&#x301;a. The greatest achievement of human life is that one has come to live in this world at the same time that Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself has chosen to incarnate on this earth as Ta&#x301;raka Brahma. The great devotee Vrindavana Das observed, &ldquo;It is my greatest misfortune that I was not born at the same time that the Lord chose to incarnate Himself on this earth.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->E hena sampad ka&#x301;le gora&#x301; na&#x301; bhajinu hele<br>Tachu pade na&#x301; karinu a&#x301;sh;<br>Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Caetanya T&#x301;ha&#x301;kur Shrii Nitya&#x301;nanda<br>Gun&#x301;a ga&#x301;y Vrinda&#x301;vana Das.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->He lamented, &ldquo;How unfortunate I am that when the Lord was physically present on this earth, I did not come. I was born later.&rdquo; It is truly a great misfortune, a spiritual affliction, to be born a little before or after the Lord&#146;s advent &ndash; it is indeed a spiritual affliction. The very thought that Parama Purus&#x301;a was on earth at the same time that I was brings a sense of ecstasy, an immense joy. This state of joy or bliss is termed sa&#x301;lokya. (Loka means &ldquo;the world&rdquo;. In Bengali loka means &ldquo;human being&rdquo;, but in Sanskrit it means a stratum [in this case, the world].)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was in Vraja, the people felt intense joy and a sense of pride that a great personality in the form of a young man had chosen to live in their midst. Those who came in contact with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a also felt that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was with them, guiding them, on all strata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Oddly enough Duryodhana, even though he was apparently Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s enemy, was convinced that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was not an ordinary person. He thought that if he could win Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s support, he would be very fortunate. So on the eve of the Kuruks&#x301;etra war he went to Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to ask Him for help. Both Duryodhana and Arjuna went to Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a for help.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Arjuna was more advanced than Duryodhana so far as the realization of sa&#x301;lokya was concerned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Duryodhana arrived at Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s palace before Arjuna to find Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a lying in bed with His eyes closed pretending that He was fast asleep. Arjuna came afterwards and took his seat near Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s feet. [Duryodhana had seated himself beside Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s head.] Suddenly Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a sat up and acted as if He had just awakened. He did it in such a way that He looked first towards Arjuna sitting near His feet and said, &ldquo;Oh, welcome Arjuna, you&#146;ve come. It&#146;s good to see you.&rdquo; Then He caught sight of Duryodhana and said, &ldquo;Welcome Duryodhana, you have come too. It&#146;s good to see you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This was all pretense, of course, because Duryodhana had actually come earlier. But his realization of sa&#x301;lokya was less than Arjuna&#146;s; he did not have the deep realization that Parama Purus&#x301;a, Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, had incarnated on the earth. Hence he could not get the benefits of sa&#x301;lokya, while Arjuna easily could. Now the entity who was pretending to be asleep was not Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the constant wielder and player of the magic flute, but instead was Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the keen-witted person, the person with the pinnacled intellect. Had He been Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, he would have played His magic flute, drawing Duryodhana as close to Him as Arjuna. Here lies the difference between Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a employed the tactics of diplomacy whenever necessary &ndash; and in those days that was quite often.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>Sa&#x301;miipya</b>: The second stage of spiritual realization is sa&#x301;miipya. Now in the first stage, people realize they have been born at the same time and in the same world as their Lord. In the second stage, they feel close to Parama Purus&#x301;a, close enough to talk to Him on friendly terms, even regarding extremely personal matters, and thus be relieved and comforted by Him. Sometimes people feel so close to Him that they go to Him not necessarily to disclose their personal difficulties, but for relief, for consolation and to gain sufficient strength to withstand the difficulties and troubles, the storms and stresses, of personal life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Many people who came to Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; and they were very common people &ndash; had this realization of sa&#x301;miipya. But those who had the privilege to come in contact with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a were either highly-educated people and great saints, or kings and dignitaries. Not everybody had the privilege to come into contact with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and enjoy the realization of sa&#x301;miipya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those who had the experience of sa&#x301;lokya or sa&#x301;miipya had to pass through various difficulties and hardships. The path of attainment was in no way simple and smooth. In the case of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the realization of sa&#x301;lokya and samiipya was attained with very little difficulty, but in the case of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, one would not necessarily get the realization of sa&#x301;miipya as an inevitable concomitant of sa&#x301;lokya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>Sa&#x301;yujya</b>: Next comes the stage of sa&#x301;yujya. It implies close contact, almost body contact, the closest proximity imaginable. Most of the people of Vraja had enjoyed the realization of sa&#x301;yujya, for they had dined, sung, played the flute and danced with, and sat close to, their dearest Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. But it was not so easy to attain the state of sa&#x301;yujya with Pa&#x301;rasara&#x301;thi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Only Arjuna, the third of the five Pandava brothers, was blessed with this realization. None of the other brothers had the opportunity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><b>Sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya</b>: The next stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practice] is sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya. It implies that &ldquo;Not only am I close to Him, but whenever I think of Him I see Him in all directions.&rdquo; Now how do people attain this state of realization? One may attain this state by becoming His closest and most intimate companion &ndash; His father, mother, wife, son, or any near and dear relation &ndash; or one may realize Him in another way. If one commits many sins and becomes a confirmed sinner, one always remains in mortal fear and thinks of Him &ndash; &ldquo;Ah me, I am doing such ignoble deeds, the Lord is watching everything.&rdquo; While thinking thus, one either becomes mad or dies. Ravana<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> looked upon Parama Purus&#x301;a as his enemy, and ultimately died at the hands of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Kansa also looked upon Parama Purus&#x301;a as his enemy. Consequently, just one week before his death, Kansa saw the reflection of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a everywhere: in the sky, in the wind, in the trees and in the land and water. History tells us that in those days the primary school children were taught &ldquo;Ka is for &lsquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rsquo;&rdquo; The followers of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a would say, &ldquo;Ka is for &lsquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rsquo;&rdquo; But Kansa, out of extreme fear of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; a kind of fear complex &ndash; demanded that teachers teach &ldquo;Ka is for &lsquo;Kansa&rsquo;&rdquo; instead. Kansa saw Him everywhere and consequently became mad: became mad a week before his death, and then met his physical death. (Ravana also looked upon Parama Purus&#x301;a as his enemy.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now it is true that one may attain Parama Purus&#x301;a by being His enemy, but that path is a torturous and cruel path. It would be better that no one be made to endure such afflictions, because such a person remains condemned by society as long as human history endures. When this realization of sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya (visualizing Parama Purus&#x301;a in each and every particle of this universe) results out of immense love for Parama Purus&#x301;a, that is the genuine realization, the true realization, and is something enjoyable, something exceedingly sweet and precious. When human beings become restless for the attainment of Parama Purus&#x301;a, when they strive hard to realize Him in all their actions (and ultimately succeed), their zeal, their irresistible urge for the Lord, is called ara&#x301;dhana&#x301; in Sanskrit (a &ndash; ra&#x301;dh + anat&#x301; + ta&#x301; [feminine suffix] = ara&#x301;dhana&#x301;), and the entity who does this ara&#x301;dhana&#x301; is known as &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;. Here Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; represents the mind of a devotee. The people of Vraja felt and realized Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in all their thoughts and actions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Jale Hari, sthale Hari, anale anile Hari,<br>Graha ta&#x301;ra&#x301; su&#x301;rje Hari, Harimay e trisam&#x301;sa&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[Hari is everywhere, Hari is in everything: on land, in water, in wind and in fire. He is in the sun; He is in the three worlds.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In the case of the sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, people see Him in everything. The Pandavas experienced this realization as His inseparable friends and devotees, and the Kaoravas as His formidable foes. Those who are criminals or sinners think of Parama Purus&#x301;a as their enemy. &ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s foes would think in fear, &ldquo;here comes the enemy Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rdquo; Thus the whole world became polarized during His lifetime. This polarization also took place during the period of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but it remained partial. At the time of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the polarization became complete. Society became divided into opposing camps: on the one side those who were extremely committed to Him, ever ready to lay down their lives for His mission and ideology, and on the other side those who became so angry and so hostile that they could not even tolerate His name, far less His existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><b>Sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi</b>: Next comes sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi. Sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi occurs when spiritual aspirants realize Parama Purus&#x301;a in all possible ways and in all conceivable manners. Not only do the devotees see Him, they also remain united with Him, one with Him. That is, the sa&#x301;dhaka has the feeling that &ldquo;I exist, He also exists, and there is a link between us.&rdquo; There is a subject, there is an object, and there is a verb connecting the two. This is the proper significance of sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi. There is some difference between the meanings of sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi and of sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya. In sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya, the import is, &ldquo;I exist and, my Lord, You also exist,&rdquo; whereas in sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi it is, &ldquo;I have become one with You.&rdquo; But the question of my having become one with You remains. That is, there is an &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, though very tenuous. Otherwise how can I say that I have become one with You? To put the idea in another way, here in sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi the devotee and the Lord are extremely close, but duality remains nevertheless. The devotee exists and feels that his Lord is also there, so it is dualism. &ldquo;I don&#146;t want to become sugar, I want to taste sugar. If I become sugar, how will I enjoy the taste of it?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Cini hate ca&#x301;ine re man,<br>Cini khete bha&#x301;laba&#x301;si.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Citation"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->&ndash;Ramprasad<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Thus there must be some sense of duality. This sense of duality, though very slight, is the last word in most of the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava schools of philosophy and in most of the religions of the world. There are some Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava schools which insist that the last word is &ldquo;Lord, only You exist.&rdquo; This state of realization &ndash; &ldquo;Only You exist&rdquo; &ndash; is called kaevalya. In Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava scriptures, not much mention is made of kaevalya (though it is not altogether non-existent), for sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi is generally considered to be the highest stage. This stage of realization was attained through Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, and also through Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but in a different way. Generally speaking, the realization is similar in the cases both of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but for Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the realizations of sa&#x301;miipya, sa&#x301;yujya, sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya, and sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi came through madhura bha&#x301;va [sweetness], pleasing ideation and intimacy at every stage, through joy and overflowing bliss. In the case of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the realization came through struggle, through privation and hardship. Unlike Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the sa&#x301;lokya stage does not inspire the hearts of His devotees by playing beautiful music on His flute. On the contrary, His directives to His devotees are: &ldquo;Do your worldly duties, build a stable society upon a sound economy, fight against injustice, and build a secure base for both individuals and the collectivity. Be pragmatic and remain united against all evil forces. Unite the different groups in society upon a common platform.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->You all know that it was Lord Shiva who first taught human beings how to live a systematic and harmonious life and how to oppose the fissiparous tendencies resulting from animal propensities. This was considered enough during Shiva&#146;s time, but during Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time there was greater social consciousness. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a wanted to arouse a strong urge in people&#146;s minds to fight against evil forces. Although Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not provide any socio-economic-political theory, He made people conscious in the social, economic and cultural spheres, and advanced society by providing inspiration in His own unique way. That is, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a helped the people to advance by expanding their social consciousness. That is why those who had received schooling from Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi jumped to the stage of sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi right from the lowermost stage of sa&#x301;lokya. They did not rise gradually to successively higher stages through joy and sweet blissful experiences, but advanced to the highest stage all at once. But this sudden expansion involved labour, toil and struggle. It entailed great risk and demanded uncompromising fighting spirit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In the case of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the devotee developed a unique spiritual consciousness. The one thought that filled a devotee&#146;s mind was, &ldquo;I want to go to Parama Purus&#x301;a,&rdquo; and that journey passed through madhura bha&#x301;va. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s teachings were quite different. He said, &ldquo;Well, you want to advance. That&#146;s all right, but others must come with you. You must all come together.&rdquo; This approach certainly impairs madhura bha&#x301;va to some extent because it involves an element of roughness. If we are to use an analogy, we can compare a very sweet thick-skinned mango to Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. You can easily peel away the skin and relish the sweet juicy fruit to your heart&#146;s content &ndash; no trouble, only happiness. If someone asks you how sweet it is, you cannot express your delight in words and you illustrate the sweetness through gestures. But Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a may be compared to a firm, ripe bel [wood apple] with a hard shell. You have to take some trouble to break the shell, and while breaking it you have to be careful not to let the fruit fall to the ground and smash into pieces. The pulp is no doubt very good for the stomach, perhaps even better than a mango, but it is not so nice to eat. It is not as juicy as a mango. If Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a can be likened to high quality cakes like gokulapiit&#x301;ha&#x301; or pa&#x301;t&#x301;i sa&#x301;pt&#x301;a&#x301;, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a may be likened to sweets made of boiled, condensed sugar cane juice.<!-- /block --></p>

Arjuna had to pass through enormous difficulties, sufferings and rigorous training. When he developed a psychic crisis on the battlefield, he was given severe psychic blows before he came to his senses. He then recognized Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a clearly and perfectly, and his life became fruitful.<!-- /block --></p>

In the case of Arjuna, in the initial stages there were soft murmurings, but in the final stage there was the ear-shattering noise of Pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cajanya [the name of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s conch] resulting in Arjuna&#146;s final, supreme realization. However, things were different with Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. His flute produced different notes at different times. When devotees achieve some spiritual progress through madhura bha&#x301;va, they hear a sound similar to a cricket sound. If you meditate in a lonely place with deep concentration you will hear the sound of crickets. Of course the crickets become silent after a while, whereas the Cosmic sound never stops its continuous refrain. This is the first stage of the flute sound of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. There are other sounds at other stages such as the roaring of seas, the rumbling of clouds and, finally, at the stage of sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi, the pluta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> sound of the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, continuing its eternal flow without any break or pause. But while hearing the sound of the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, sa&#x301;dhakas hear within it the sound of the flute. With their physical ears they hear it.<!-- /block --></p>
