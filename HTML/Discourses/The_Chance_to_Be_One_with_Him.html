<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There are so many numerals. And numerals are innumerable in number. So why for Parama Purus&#x301;a should we use the word &ldquo;one&rdquo;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Any numeral &ndash; &ldquo;one&rdquo;, &ldquo;two&rdquo;, &ldquo;three&rdquo;, &ldquo;four&rdquo;, any numeral, even &ldquo;infinity&rdquo; &ndash; all numerals are different kinds of projections of the mind. And those projections are sometimes introversive and sometimes extroversive. So why should we use the word &ldquo;one&rdquo; for Him?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Actually we cannot use any numeral for Him. If we use any numeral it comes within the jurisdiction of vocabulary. It comes within the bondage of vocabulary whether it is &ldquo;one&rdquo; or &ldquo;two&rdquo; or &ldquo;ten&rdquo; or &ldquo;thirteen&rdquo;. But the numeral &ldquo;one&rdquo; is used. Why?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When the mind gets pinnacled, when the mind gets apexed, comes to a particular point, that is, comes to one point only, under such circumstances Jiivas, created beings, get the chance to be one with Him. That is why the numeral &ldquo;one&rdquo; is used; there is no alternative for you but to use the numeral &ldquo;one&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now this Universe of ours is a positive introversive projection, not a refraction, of the Supreme Entity. It is within His ectoplasmic structure. And hence everything is within Him, nothing without. Now for Him the root verb and also adjective &ldquo;Div&rdquo; is used in most of the old languages of the world, in Latin and Sam&#x301;skrta and Vedic. &ldquo;Div&rdquo; means &ldquo;vibrating entity&rdquo;, all-vibrating entity,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->all-vibrating potentiality. Now whatever things we see, whatever things we here, are all waves of different lengths. Everything is wavy, a creation of waves, an infinite number of waves &ndash; in the sphere of lights, in the sphere of acoustics. We may or may not be able to hear those sounds, but the sounds are there. We may or may not be able to see so many lights, but the lights are there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now each and every expression of wave is vibrational, vibrated; and each and every wave creates something, and each and every wave is emanated from the Supreme Nucleus. These waves are called &ldquo;Div&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Deva&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dieu&rdquo; (the adjective is &ldquo;Divine&rdquo;), and from this &ldquo;Div&rdquo; comes the word &ldquo;Deva&rdquo;. &ldquo;Deva&rdquo; means &ldquo;god&rdquo;. Small &ldquo;g&rdquo;, not big &ldquo;G&rdquo;. But the Controlling Entity of all these gods (small &ldquo;g&rdquo; gods) is the Supreme God, Maha&#x301;deva. Hence the Supreme Hub, the Supreme Father, Parama Pita&#x301;, is Maha&#x301;deva; not Deva, but Maha&#x301;deva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->He is great &ndash; He is very great &ndash; but is He only great? He is big, but He is also at the same time smaller than an atom, smaller than an electron. And that is why He is all-pervasive. That is, he has an easy access into the ectoplasmic stuff of each and every expressed entity. He knows everything, He is omniscient, because He resides within your mind, and the things that you think or that you speak internally are all soliloquies, are then and there tape-recorded by Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->He knows everything, because He is within the mind. He is covert, he lies covert within; not &ldquo;coverted&rdquo; but &ldquo;covert&rdquo;. &ldquo;Coverted&rdquo; will be used if it is done by somebody else. But He is not to be replaced or assailed by any second entity. By nature He lies covert.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now you know there is butter in milk, but if you look like this, is there any butter? No, you won&#146;t see any. To get the butter or cream, what do you have to do? You have to churn it. After churning you get the butter that remained covert in the milk. Butter remained covert in the milk, but to get it you have to churn it. There is oil in sesame, but to get oil you have to press it, otherwise you won&#146;t see any oil. There is a subterranean flow of water everywhere, but to get the water you have to dig the earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->And there is the potentiality of frictional heat in each and every object of the world. But for this you have to apply the process of friction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Similarly, Parama Purus&#x301;a is within him, within you, within everybody, within each and every entity animate or inanimate, but for that, to get Him, to enjoy Him, to be one with Him, to see Him, to witness His glories, what are you to do? You are to churn your mind. And what is churning, how are you to churn the mind? He is the butter of your mind; you are to churn it. He is within your mind as butter is within milk, and you are to churn Him. How to churn Him? By doing Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you are to keep the mind in a composed form, in a state of composure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Or you see, you are doing Japa, saying &ldquo;Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;Ram, Ram, Ram &ndash; I will have to go to Birmingham from London &ndash; Ram, Ram, Ram.&rdquo; What then are you doing? Your mind is in London or Birmingham, and again &ldquo;Ram, Ram, Ram.&rdquo; That won&#146;t do. There are three or four projections of your mind at the same time, one &ldquo;Ram, Ram,&rdquo; another London, another Birmingham, another Liverpool. It is not pointed. I told you that when the mind gets apexed, becomes one, then one will enjoy Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->But doing it in this way you won&#146;t enjoy Him. Your mind wants to be one-pointed. So your mind must be in the form &ndash; in the state &ndash; of composure while doing your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and in order to bring the mind to a state of composure you are to do &ndash; what?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->You are to do Kiirtana. During Kiirtana what happens? The mind gets lifted, exalted, and as a result you will enjoy a particular nature of peace. And if you start your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; just after doing Kiirtana, you will enjoy bliss. So Kiirtana is a necessity, is an indispensable necessity for proper Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->And what is Kiirtana? You are teaching your mind, you are teaching your ear, what you are saying with your vocal cord. What is that? To take only His name, and not so many names &ndash; London, Liverpool, Birmingham, Santiago. And there lies the speciality of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. What is the meaning of Kiirtana? &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; Na&#x301;ma Kevalam&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;&rdquo; means &ldquo;the Dearest One&rdquo;. Only the name of the Dearest One, only the name of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and not so many names &ndash; Helsinki or London or Santiago or Georgetown.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now Parama Purus&#x301;a lies covert within your very &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. There is &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling in each and every living being. &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; &ldquo;I exist.&rdquo; This type of &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is present in each and every living entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->And He is the central point of that &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling of each and every entity. He is the purest &ldquo;I&rdquo; of your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. He is your great &ldquo;I&rdquo;, and Mr. XYZ-ABC is your small &ldquo;I&rdquo;. While you are doing Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; on the Supreme Entity you are doing Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; on your great &ldquo;I&rdquo;. And the greatest &ldquo;I&rdquo; is Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; means the Dearest One.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Now, you see that many people are under the impression that there is a Satan. No, there is no Satan. The Singular Entity, Parama Purus&#x301;a, plays with the universe with the help of His two forces, we may say two cardinal forces or two vital forces, and they are the demi-causal matrix. These two forces are the demi-causal matrix, and one force, the centripetal one, is known as &ldquo;Vidya&#x301;&rdquo;, and the centrifugal one is known as &ldquo;Avidya&#x301;&rdquo;. This Avidya&#x301; is Satan. Satan is not an independent entity, and it can never challenge the authority of Parama Purus&#x301;a. You take shelter, you try to ensconce yourself within the Supreme Entity; there will be no Satan before you; no Satan can challenge your authority. No Satan can challenge the authority of a devotee. Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Entity within you, will always help you, He will always help you. It is His duty to help you. So you are never alone, you are never helpless. And you are always with the Supreme Entity. You are the strongest personality of the entire universe. Don&#146;t be affected, don&#146;t be assaulted, by any complex &ndash; inferiority, superiority, defeatist, or any complex. You hail from the noblest family of the universe. Parama Purus&#x301;a is your Father.<!-- /block --></p>
