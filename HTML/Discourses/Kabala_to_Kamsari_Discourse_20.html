<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ka &ndash; meaning &ldquo;water&rdquo; or &ldquo;head&rdquo;. Ka + bal + ac = kabala. The word&#146;s etymological meaning is &ldquo;one whose power is in water&rdquo; or &ldquo;one who is invigorated in water&rdquo;; or &ldquo;one whose power is in the head&rdquo; or &ldquo;one whose head invigorates&rdquo;. Colloquially, kabala means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->1) Mouthful; that is, as much as can be kept in the mouth at one time is a mouthful [gra&#x301;s]. You have perhaps seen in the almanac that an eclipse is sometimes full [pu&#x301;rn&#x301;agra&#x301;s] and sometimes partial [ardhagra&#x301;s]. It is said that in this eclipse Ra&#x301;hu has completely swallowed it, and in that eclipse Ra&#x301;hu has partially swallowed it. What happens is that there is an eclipse whenever the moon or the sun is found in one portion of the umbra (in the original umbra) and ketu stands in exactly the seventh sign and concerning degree away from that umbra (&ldquo;in whichever month, in whichever sign of the zodiac/in the seventh stands the moon/if there is a full moon on that day/ra&#x301;hu is sure to come devouring&rdquo;) The type of eclipse &ndash; whether complete or partial &ndash; is fixed according to which kala&#x301; of the sun or moon falls under that umbra. In the annular eclipse of the sun, the sun is considered to fall completely within the original umbra according to mathematical analysis. When the sun or moon passes through that portion of the umbra, it is thought that the sun or moon has come out from the severed portion of the beheaded Ra&#x301;hu.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So now you have understood what the actual meaning of the word gra&#x301;s is. This word gra&#x301;s is derived by adding the suffix ghain&#x32D; to gran&#146;s (grasi). Ka means &ldquo;head&rdquo;. Ra&#x301;hu has swallowed the head-planet; thus we say that the sun or moon has fallen in the kabala of ra&#x301;hu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->2) If someone falls within the range of any wicked animal or demon we say &ndash; &ldquo;he has fallen in the tiger&#146;s kabala&rdquo; or &ldquo;they have fallen into the demon&#146;s kabala.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->3) The third meaning of kabala is &ldquo;to keep both cheeks distended by filling the mouth with water&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->4) Another meaning of kabala is &ldquo;to gargle with the help of the tongue or throat cavity&rdquo;, that is, instead of saying tini ga&#x301;rgl karchen [he is gargling], proper Bengali will be tini kabala karchen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->5) Ka means &ldquo;water&rdquo;. One whose strength is in ka, that is, one whose strength diminishes as they ascend onto dry land is also kabala in the etymological sense. In this case, the colloquial meaning of kabala is bele ma&#x301;ch [sand fish].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Kabalika&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There are three feminine forms of the word kabala: kabalii, kabala&#x301; and kabalika&#x301;. The etymological meaning of the word kabalika&#x301; is &ldquo;that which helps in exerting energy&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which saves one from another&#146;s energetic blow&rdquo;. Colloquially kabalika&#x301; means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->1) Imagine that you have prepared a shada in a wok [kar&#x301;a&#x301;i]<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (raw or cooked vegetables are called shada)Now the wok has to be taken down from the stove. You don&#146;t have any tongs, or even if you do the wok is so hot that it will still be difficult to take it down even with the help of the tongs. In this case you will use the two handles of the wok to take it off the stove, but if you grab the two handles with your bare hands then you will get blisters on your hands from the striking of the energy of the handles &ndash; from the effect of the heat. In that case, in order to save your hands from the effect of the fire or the heat, you will certainly protect your hands with a towel or cloth or ga&#x301;mcha&#x301; or non-conductor of heat before grabbing the handles and taking down the wok. This non-conductor of heat we call kabalika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->2) You are harvesting potatoes in a field. You are digging on this and that side of the partitions separating the fields. You feel pleasure pulling up the new potatoes but a little while later it fades because you get big blisters on your hands. You will certainly wrap some kind of cloth over your hands to protect your hands or fingers from those blisters. This is also kabalika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->3) Any kind of implement or tool which protects your hands or fingers from blisters or suffering is also called kabalika&#x301;.  Thus, in this sense, the handle [ba&#x301;nt&#x301;] of a knife or chopping knife or hammer is called kabalika&#x301; (ba&#x301;nt&#x301; comes from ban&#x301;t&#x301;ika and bant&#x301;i comes from ban&#x301;t&#x301;ika&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->4) In ancient times a kind of cotton and cloth pad was used by warriors to protect their hands or fingers from blisters caused by rubbing while using a sword. This pad was called kabalika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->5) That sheath that was used or is used to protect a sword from moisture in the air is called kabalika&#x301; (it was kept in it so that it would not rust).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->6) Someone has a carbuncle in some part of their body. The doctor performs surgery on it. Afterwards, of course, he will not leave the operated part open; he will certainly cover it to protect it from external influences. This covering or bandage is also called kabalika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->7) Living beings take birth over and over again in order to undergo the fruits of their actions, and over and over again they are devoured by death. The reactions in potentiality or reactive momenta that one imbibes by their original actions remain with them. Those reactive momenta draw them back again and again. These reactions in potentiality which are the cause of the next life are called sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra or pra&#x301;rabdha. The bondage of this pra&#x301;rabdha is also called kabalika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Kavara<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Previously it was accepted that the verbal roots br and vr were pronounced differently and had separate meanings, however today many people confuse the two. The meaning of the verbal root br is &ldquo;to show honour&rdquo;, &ldquo;to receive with excellence&rdquo;, &ldquo;to welcome&rdquo;. We get the word bara from this verbal root br. Bara means &ldquo;excellent&rdquo;. Although predominantly the a&#x301;tmanepadii verb form barayate is used, the parasmaepadii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is also used. The words bara, baran&#x301;a, barendra, ba&#x301;rendra come from this root.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root vr is &ldquo;to be engaged in work&rdquo;, &ldquo;to cover&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be covered&rdquo;. If we take the word ka to mean &ldquo;water&rdquo;, then the etymological meaning of the word kavara is &ldquo;that which keeps water covered&rdquo;. If we take the word ka to mean &ldquo;head&rdquo;, then the etymological meaning of the word kavara is &ldquo;that which keeps the head covered&rdquo;. There are many colloquial meanings of the word kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->1) Many times, when it is not possible to tie the hair into braids, or for those who are unwilling to tie their hair in braids, or for those who for one reason or another are not permitted to make braids, the hair is usually twisted somewhat and tied behind the head. To tie in this way we call jhunt&#x301;i ba&#x301;ndha&#x301; in Bengali. If this jhunt&#x301;i is tied on top of the head we call it opar-jhunt&#x301;i [upper jhunt&#x301;i]. Whether this jhunt&#x301;i is tied at the back or on the top, it is called kavara in refined Bengali [and Sanskrit]. In order to tie this kavara there is no need of any ka&#x301;in&#x32D;cana&#x301; (long hairpin) or ka&#x301;can (a ribbon for tying the hair).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->2) A cap is a covering for the head, so if we take ka to mean &ldquo;head&rdquo; then kavara also refers to &ldquo;cap&rdquo; or &ldquo;headdress&rdquo;. If we say &ldquo;headdress&rdquo; it means &ldquo;cap&rdquo;, &ldquo;turban&rdquo;, &ldquo;crown&rdquo; &ndash; all of these.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->3) Often the hair becomes tangled for want of care. It also becomes tangled if it is not combed properly (Kankatika&#x301;: kankatika&#x301; &rarr; kankaia&#x301; &rarr; ka&#x301;nkai. Cirun&#x301;ii is still called ka&#x301;nkai in Rarhi Bengali. In this sense a split [cera&#x301;] object is cirun&#x301;ii. Cirun&#x301;ii is native Bengali. Ka&#x301;nkai is a Sanskrit-derivative.) There are those who twist and tangle their hair to get oohs and aahs for this show of their own disinterestedness. If the hair remains twisted and tangled for a long time it ends up becoming matted hair.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Whether bound or loose, the word kavara can be used for all kinds of matted hair.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->4) If different things are combined in a physical mixture or chemical compound where it becomes difficult to separate one from the other (for example, sugar and sand), then this kind of mixture or compound is called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->5) When a new metal is produced as a result of mixing or intermingling or compounding two or more metals together (such as bell-metal, brass, guinea-gold or gold alloy, bronze, Kha&#x301;gr&#x301;a bell-metal), then that new metal is also called kavara or kavaradha&#x301;tu. To turn this kavara metal back into its original metals is extremely difficult. Most often, then, ornaments of guinea-gold are turned into alloyed gold. High quality, bejewelled ornaments do not carry as much value for their gold as they do as ornaments. Such type of gold is usually turned into alloyed gold.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->6) There are a few such plants which have a predominance of salty sap, for example, nune sha&#x301;k (in Sanskrit lonii). We also call them kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->7) The salt that is obtained from such plants is also called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->8) Those mineral salts that we find in the water of certain places (such as Bakreshvara, Siita&#x301;kun&#x301;d&#x301;a) and in other materials is also called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->9) The thick portion of the leaves (what the people call pet&#x301;o in spoken Bengali) attached to that middle portion of the bole of the banana tree which we call t&#x301;hor&#x301; in spoken Bengali is also called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->10) Those fruits which are used as food are collectively known as kavara. The trees of those fruits are also called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->11) The word kavara is also used for a fruit garden or orchard; however in this case the suffix t&#x301;a&#x301; is added to the root word, that is, when we use the word kavara for orchard then we use it in its feminine form, or kavara&#x301; (like the word lata&#x301;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->12) Asafoetida is called kavara because it acts as a medicine for head ailments when taken in moderation.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The asafoetida tree is also called kavara. Keep in mind that asafoetida [him&#146;] and hiun&#x32D;gul  are not the same thing. Asafoetida is a spice that grows mostly in the northwest frontier of India and in Pakistan. However if it is planted in the soil of Bengal it can also grow well in Bengal. Hiun&#x32D;gul means &ldquo;vermilion&rdquo;. You are aware that there is also a river in the western part of our Birbhum District which goes by the name of Hiun&#x32D;gula&#x301; (Him&#x301;lo). The colour of the water of this river is a little reddish so our forefathers named it in this way. The Hiun&#x32D;gula&#x301; is a tributary of the Ajay River.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->13) The leaves of the asafoetida tree are also called kavara, but in this case the word is feminine in gender, that is, one should say kavara&#x301; rather than kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->14) You know that certain aquatic weeds keep the water covered in such a way that from a distance the water can&#146;t be seen. It appears to be a patch of greenery. This is especially true if there are large aquatic weeds in the water like water hyacinth. Although it is a bit off the subject, I will point out that the water hyacinth is not originally from Bengal or India. During British rule, Mr. Lee, the Divisional Commissioner of Dhaka, once went to South America. His wife, Mrs. Lee, felt some attraction when she saw its purple flowers on top of its large green leaves, and when she returned to Bengal she brought it with her and planted it in the lotus pond near their government quarters in Dhaka. In a very short time the water hyacinth spread throughout Dhaka District and thereafter throughout Bengal, and nowadays it has spread throughout almost all of India. Its leaves are quite large, puffed up somewhat like a kacuri [a deep-fried, puffed bread], so the people of Bengal gave that aquatic plant the name kacuri pa&#x301;na&#x301;. Another meaning of the word kavara is this water hyacinth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->15) A bun (jur&#x301;a&#x301; in north India and Hindi) adorns the head, thus a bun is also called kavara, but on account of its loveliness the word is considered to be feminine, but in this case the feminine iip is added rather than t&#x301;a&#x301; making kavarii rather than kavara&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Tumi alake kusuma na&#x301; dio,<br>Shudhu shithila kavarii ba&#x301;ndhio<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->[Don&#146;t put a flower in your tress; simply tie it loosely in a bun]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->16) In the Vedic age there was the customary practice of pulling out grey hair with the help of pincers, so pincers used to be called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->17) Foodstuffs are kept covered to keep out dust, flies and so on, and to protect them from cats and other animals or birds. Such a lid is also called kavara, but in this case the feminine diminutive form of kavara is used, that is, a lid is called kavarika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->18) If something is affixed tightly to something else, such as a diamond-set ring, a pearl-studded necklace or pearl-studded earring, then the word kavara is also used in this sense of inlaying or insetting. For example mukta&#x301;-kavara aunguriiyaka [pearl-studded ring], hiiraka-kavara man&#x301;iha&#x301;ra [diamond-studded necklace], padmara&#x301;ga-kavara karn&#x301;apat&#x301;t&#x301;a [ruby-inlaid gold-earring], and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->19) If a metal is coated with something else, or enamelled, or gilded, or plated, then this is also called kavara. For example, we can call a gold-plated wristlet a svarn&#x301;akavara hastalaohika.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->20) The word kavara is also used for all those small aquatic weeds [pa&#x301;na&#x301;] which cover water. (That which stays in water (pa&#x301;nii) is called pa&#x301;na&#x301;, &ldquo;aquatic weeds&rdquo;. Again, that which is drunk (pa&#x301;n kara&#x301;) is also called pa&#x301;na&#x301;; pa&#x301;na&#x301; means sarvat [a sweet drink made from syrup], for example, bel pa&#x301;na&#x301;.) However, in this case kavarika&#x301; will be used as the feminine diminutive form. Da&#x301;mapa&#x301;na&#x301;, t&#x301;opa&#x301; pa&#x301;na&#x301;, pa&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; pa&#x301;na&#x301; &ndash; for all of these the single Bengali word is kavarika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->21) That round fruit whose juice is sweet and sour, and which is originally from Bokhara we call a&#x301;lubokhara&#x301; in ordinary Bengali. We have been familiar with this a&#x301;lubokhra&#x301; fruit for a very long time. Its Sanskrit, as well as refined Bengali, name is kavarika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Although the word kabr was equally common in ancient times in both Iran and Arabia, the word is Arabic in origin. Kabr means &ldquo;to bury underground&rdquo; or &ldquo;to inter&rdquo;. This grave or tomb is known as mrtsama&#x301;dhi in refined Bengali [and Sanskrit]. That place in which someone is buried [kabr deoya&#x301;] is called kabrga&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Kavi<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Ku + i = kavi. The etymological meaning of the word is &ldquo;one who sees the expressed world, or ku, with the affection felt for one&#146;s child&rdquo;, that is, one who desires the welfare of the world of living beings. The colloquial meanings of the word kavi are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->1) Tattvadras&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; [seer of tattva]. The word tattva means &ldquo;the bha&#x301;va [essence or existence] of the essential root entity hidden within every entity&rdquo;. Tattvadras&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;one who sees tattva through supreme knowledge&rdquo;. It is the old, original meaning of the word kavi [poet]. If there is no inner sight then there is no kavi. A metred composition about cigarettes and grog and snack food cannot be called poetry, and its composer is not considered, and cannot be considered to be a kavi. From this point of view, those past messengers of human civilization, those Vedic sages who came from age to age to supply inspiration for human beings to move along the path of consciousness, those great souls who have taken birth in different countries and at different times, are called kavi &ndash; in English, &ldquo;seer&rdquo;. The word kavi used to be used with this meaning in the old Vedic language. From the mouth of a Vedic sage has come:<!-- /block --></p>

Get proper teaching from a worthy seer because this path of shreya [virtue] must be trod with the greatest caution. Bear in mind that one will have to move with understanding because the path is as if it were strewn with sharp razors.&rdquo; Kavi means a tattvadras&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; sage, not a cigarette-grog-snack food merchant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->2) The second meaning of the word kavi is &ldquo;one who, inspired by the thought of welfare, searches for the original cause in different spheres&rdquo;. In this case, kavi does not merely mean &ldquo;philosopher&rdquo;; that philosopher is a kavi who has the thought of welfare hidden within them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->3) Another meaning of the word kavi is &ldquo;highly educated person&rdquo;. However, this highly educated person will be called kavi if it is seen that they possess the thought of welfare for the world of living beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->4) Another meaning of the word kavi is &ldquo;wise or learned persons who have dedicated themselves to the service of living beings&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->5) In modern times kavi refers to a writer of poetry. However, the fundamental strain is the thought of welfare; thus one who writes poetry but is not inspired by the thought of welfare cannot be called kavi according to the prevalent meaning.<!-- /block --></p>

For this reason, it is called the &ldquo;evening star&rdquo;. It is a planet, not a star, but in spoken Bengali it is mistakenly called a star. This same planet is called shukata&#x301;ra&#x301; at the end of the night (shukra &rarr; shukka &rarr; shuka). Because the human mind is gratified on account of its colourful radiance, one name of this shukata&#x301;ra&#x301; is also kavi. In our childhood in Bihar we used to sit in a small village and sing: A&#x301;dhii la&#x301;lii a&#x301;dhelii nilla&#x301;/jara&#x301; saphedii jara&#x301; sa&#x301; ka&#x301;la&#x301; [Half is red, half is blue, some part is white, the other part is black.].

Certain branches and subbranches of this Asura community still exist today in India in small numbers in the Gondowana region, especially in the Palamu-Sarguja areas. The Asuras had many qualities, many merits, but they had no one to lead them properly. Shukracharya was the name of a learned and wise man who came forward to help these neglected people despite the abuse that was heaped on his head. Kavi also refers to this Shukracharya. He introduced many kinds of battle tactics and composed many rules and regulations to build a nice society. During the time of the Deva-Asura war, he saved the Asuras from destruction through proper counsel. He also pursued scientific knowledge. According to many people he was the first person to make distilled wine.

Within creation is hidden the seed of preservation as well as the thought of nourishing. Within this preservation and nourishing lies the potential of annihilation. After annihilation, the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra-bound living being is created anew within the thoughtwaves of the Great, and the Cosmic imagination, the Cosmic will, moves ahead maintaining a link with this creation. Thus the future prospects of that flow remain merged with this creation right from the outset through otaprota yoga. In the Puranic language, the name that has been given to the director of this creation is Brahma&#x301;. The flow of mobility emanates from Him for the welfare of the flow of the living being.

Shameless people, shouting like a crow, often say such things that courteous people would not say out of modesty. I am not talking about drunkards. Thus, whether one is in normal condition or drunk, a shameless person is called ka&#x301;ka. The word beha&#x301;ya&#x301; [shameless] is of Farsi origin.

For this reason, out of appreciation, respect or necessity, there are thirty-one words for yajin&#x32D;ad&#x301;umbar. Ka&#x301;ka also means yajin&#x32D;ad&#x301;umbar.<!-- /block --></p>

In addition to being good for colic, pun&#x32D;i&#146;s many qualities have been spoken about in the old scriptures.

The fact that women have been attracted to beautiful dress since ancient times is not at all blameworthy, but anything in excess is. Whatever the case may be, in ancient times girls used to have a variety of vanity bags and they used to be called ka&#x301;ka. The word is neuter in gender, thus one must say ka&#x301;kam&#x301; rather than ka&#x301;ka.

If we say ka&#x301;kaphala then its meaning becomes &ldquo;neem-fruit fruit&rdquo; which is laughable. If one says, ka&#x301;ka nimphala kha&#x301;cche [the crow is eating neem-fruit], it becomes ka&#x301;kah ka&#x301;kam&#x301; bhaks&#x301;ayati in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>

Its feminine form is ka&#x301;karu&#x301;ha&#x301;. Ka&#x301;karu&#x301;ha&#x301; means &ldquo;orchid&rdquo;. The kind of plant that takes shelter on another plant and draws sustenance (chiefly water with salts) from that plant with the help of its own roots, which grows, flowers and in certain cases gives fruit also, that kind of plant is called &ldquo;orchid&rdquo; (not &ldquo;parasite&rdquo;). In Sanskrit it is ka&#x301;karu&#x301;ha&#x301;; in Rarhi Bengali it is called lat&#x301;ka&#x301; because it hangs [lat&#x301;ke] from another plant. In the Chatisgarhi language, this orchid is called kaova&#x301;jor&#x301;ii. A parasite is called benda&#x301; (parabhrta [fostered by a stranger]) by some people).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph -->The principal difference between parasite and orchid is that while the parasite is within the shelter of the host plant it procures its vital energy from it and as a result the parasite&#146;s host may lose its life-force. The orchid, on the other hand, takes primarily the liquid portion; most of the rest of its sustenance it gathers from the environment. Thus the growth of the orchid does not cause the host plant so much harm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="136"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=136 type=paragraph -->The parasite does not have its own roots. It draws vital juices directly from the host plant. The orchid has its own roots and with the help of those roots it draws vital juices. Since the parasite does not have its own roots, if it is pulled from the host it dies, but the orchid does not die if it is pulled from the host. If it is bound to another plant, a brick, some wood, or a stone, and if meanwhile a little water is given, then it survives and blooms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=137 type=paragraph -->Compared to ordinary flowers, the orchid&#146;s flower is often much longer lived. On the Bangaon-Calcutta road I once pulled an orchid from a shishu tree and brought it to my Calcutta garden. The plant is still healthy. Its number has increased and it has flowered several times. A single flower remains in full bloom for twenty to twenty-one days at a stretch; it almost seems like a paper flower. I have given the name vaun&#x32D;gaduhita&#x301; to this specific variety of orchid. In Rarhi Bengali it is called lat&#x301;ka&#x301; because although it isn&#146;t part of the tree, it hangs from the tree. Although spices are not part of the food, they &ldquo;hang&rdquo; from vegetables and other foods, both in the physical sense and in the olfactory sense as well. Thus, in ancient Rarh spices were called lat&#x301;kan. Still in certain parts of Rarh a cooking-spice shop is called a lat&#x301;kan shop.<!-- /block --></p>

Out of great respect, people have used the adjective d&#x301;ogra&#x301; for the extremely courageous and straightforward people of Jammu, and their Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta-descended language has been given the name D&#x301;ogrii.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="144"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=144 type=paragraph -->We had now started from this Jammu. Up until the pre-Pathan era, Jammu was an independent kingdom. In olden times Sanskrit, and after that, Dogri, were its local languages. Dogri&#146;s script is a central Indian form of Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script. In ancient India, after the demise of both the Bra&#x301;hmii and Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;hii scripts, three different scripts sprang up in three different parts of India: (1) The Kut&#x301;ila&#x301; script in Allahabad and east of there; (2) Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; to the northwest of Allahabad; and (3) Na&#x301;rada&#x301; or Na&#x301;grii in the southwest. Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; means &ldquo;Sarasvatii&rdquo;, the goddess of knowledge. The Brahmans of this region are known as Sa&#x301;rasvata Brahmans &ndash; they are called this for their erudition. These Sa&#x301;rasvata Brahmans used to live principally in southern Russia, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Jammu and the Saptanada Kingdom [Punjab]. The Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script was prevalent in this territory. Just as there were three branches of Sa&#x301;rasvata Brahmans &ndash; Kashmir Sa&#x301;rasvata, Dogri Sa&#x301;rasvata and Saptanada (Punjabi) Sa&#x301;rasvata &ndash; there were also three branches of Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script &ndash; Kashmiri Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;, central Indian or Dogri Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;, and southern Indian or Punjabi Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;.

During the time of Akbar, Jammu and Kashmir were under the sovereignty of the Mughal court, but in name only. Kashmir, along with Jammu and Afghanistan, fell under the control of the Punjabi chief, Ranjit Singh. After the last Sikh war, that is, after the fall of Queen Jhindan when Punjab came under British control, the British did not take upon themselves the burden of ruling all of Afghanistan. Rather they kept some part of Afghanistan in their own hands for military reasons. That portion they joined to India and gave it the name Northwest Frontier Territory with its capital at Peshawar (its old name was Purus&#x301;apura). The major portion of Afghanistan, however, they returned to the local Muslim Kings of that time; for example, they returned the kingdom of Mahiishu&#x301;r to the descendants of the former king of that region.<!-- /block --></p>

One interesting thing I noticed is that the birds would not approach the edges of those mountain peaks around us that were covered in snow because they had left their own countries and come here in order to escape contact with the snow as well as the snowstorms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="164"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=164 type=paragraph -->These birds remain here for the winter; they build their nests, lay their eggs and wait for them to hatch, and then teach their young how to fly and how to gather food. Thereafter, when the winter ends and the warm spring breezes begin to blow, they return home along with their young that they have taught to fly. Although they don&#146;t have to face any botheration of passport and visa, they often fall into deep trouble as they travel while trying to protect themselves from the cruel clutches of human beings. Many meet an untimely death due to a cruel bullet or fall injured to the ground. Is this their fate! Is there no way to avoid this devilry! Is there no way that a little benevolence can awaken in the human mind! Does mankind&#146;s Neohumanism teach this!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="165"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=165 type=paragraph -->We continued on. We still had far to go, crossing over the border of many former native kingdoms. Nearly the entire journey that we were making this day was through a former kingdom. The king of Jammu-Kashmir was Hari Singh, the successor of its first Dogra king, Golap Singh. His son, in turn, Karna Singh, was not able to become king. Officially he got the government post as Sadr-i-riya&#x301;sat. The remaining parts thereafter were smaller or larger kingdoms. Our destination, Bilaspur, was also a middle-sized native kingdom. But Bilaspur was still quite far away &ndash; hanaoj Bila&#x301;spura du&#x301;r ast. We continued on and on. It was like the lines: Pathik a&#x301;mi pathei ba&#x301;sa&#x301; / A&#x301;ma&#x301;r jeman ja&#x301;oya&#x301; temani a&#x301;sa&#x301; [&ldquo;I am a traveller and the path is my home / It makes no difference whether I come or go&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="166"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=166 type=paragraph -->After going a little ways I suddenly noticed a change. Now there was an apple orchard beside us. This place was well above sea-level, but because there were apple orchards on both sides of us we couldn&#146;t tell how high we were. Here and there were some ciir and pha&#x301;r varieties of trees standing in the apple fields. In some trees I saw some rare birds-of-paradise. They rarely come into contact with people so they are not afraid of them. They don&#146;t know what cruel creatures human beings are. Seeing us, they were not afraid, rather they stared at us eagerly. Their simplicity made me feel uneasy and ashamed at the same time. I felt ashamed thinking that they don&#146;t realize how cruel we human beings are, how complex we are from the mental point of view, and how crooked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="167"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=167 type=paragraph -->After we passed by the apple orchards we came to yet another forest of towering trees. These trees were somewhat similar to oak trees. I noticed that numerous varieties of orchids (ka&#x301;karu&#x301;ha&#x301;) were hanging in the trees. Some of their flowers were in bloom while others were about to bloom. Some of their buds were counting the moments, waiting for the arrival of spring. By judging the amount of warmth in the climate they had guessed that Holi [spring festival] was not far away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="168"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=168 type=paragraph -->I noticed that most of the orchids here bloomed in the months of Pha&#x301;lgun-Caetra.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn12"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn12">12</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> It also appeared that there were a small number of orchid varieties that bloomed in the months of August-September. Some of the orchids looked identical to the orchids that grow uncared-for in the trees alongside the Burdwan-Guskara Road. I have seen these varieties of orchids in Birbhum on the way from Ma&#x301;mud Bazaar to Masha&#x301;njor&#x301;, and in areas near the Jonha&#x301; waterfall (Gaotamdha&#x301;ra&#x301;) on the Jhalda-Ranchi Road. I realized that they didn&#146;t depend on the climate so much, so long as there wasn&#146;t snowfall.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="169"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=169 type=paragraph -->To the left of us, that is, to the north, at a good distance away was the kingdom of Kinnaur, renowned both in history and in the Puranas. This Kinnaur was situated in the northern extremity of India in the Sadashiva mountain range. Some people may not be aware that the Himalayas, stretching from the west until the eastern horizon, are divided north and south into two parts. The Sanskrit name of the part of the Himalayas that touch the northern plains of India is Shivaliun&#x32D;ga Parvatama&#x301;la&#x301; (Shivalic Range). This part is high, but not so high. There is cultivation wherever there are green forested areas in the valleys lying between two mountains, cutting into the mountains with either step-farming or terracing. This Shivalic range is covered with snow in the wintertime, and its highest peaks remained snowcovered all year long. The fossils of prehistoric animals can be found in this part.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="170"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=170 type=paragraph -->At one time the Himalayas were submerged in the bosom of the sea. Northern India was also then at the bottom of the sea. To the south, only Gondawanaland was above sea level. Approximately three million years ago the Himalayas rose up from the depths as a result of an earthquake. The skeletons of some of those animals who used to wander in these parts of the earth three million years ago can be found packed underneath the rocks in the Shivalic range. In later times when the hippopotamus and giraffe were living here, they used to live in these Lower Himalayas. Some of their fossils have also been found in the Lower Himalayas, and more are bound to be discovered in the future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="171"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=171 type=paragraph -->The Sadashiva range (Upper Himalayas) run west to east, directly parallel to the Lower Himalayas. We find this mountain range in Kashmir, Laddak, the northern part of Himachal Pradesh, Simla, Kinnaur, toward the north of Garhwal-Kumayun, the north of Nepal, northern Sikkim and Bhutan, and in southern Tibet. This part of the Himalayas is really quite high. The snow remains all year long but in winter it is really heavy. The highest Himalayan peaks are located in this part. The driest, coldest and most elevated area of the Upper Himalayas is Laddak and Kinnaur. During winter nights the temperature can fall below minus one-hundred degrees. While heating water it freezes and turns to ice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="172"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=172 type=paragraph -->In most parts of this barren mountain land there are snowstorms nearly twelve months of the year. There is virtually no green forest, and hardly any cultivation. I have seen a little barley being grown here in the summertime. People&#146;s primary livelihood is raising livestock. The Indian cow cannot survive here; there are Yaks. Although the ancient land of Kinnaur was some ways from where we were it was not altogether that far. In olden days the people of this region were famed for their beauty, and to some extent they still are. Although their noses are slightly sloping, it does not detract from their loveliness. Seeing their beauty, the people of those days use to think and say that they were not people but angels. Era&#x301; ki nara?

<a name="173"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=173 type=paragraph -->The language of the people of Kinnaur is a southwestern dialect of Tibetan, just as Laddaki is a western dialect of Tibetan. The script of the Kinnauri language is also t&#x301;egrii or t&#x301;egra&#x301; (In Sanskrit, trigun&#x301;ii or trigun&#x301;a&#x301; script). Although the common religion of the Kinnauri people is the Lamabad branch of Mahayana Buddhism, it is clearly influenced by the A&#x301;rs&#x301;a doctrine.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn13"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn13">13</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Over the last two thousand years, Ars&#x301;a-ism and Kinnaur&#146;s Mahayana Buddhism (centring around Avalokiteshvara) have coexisted peacefully because Buddhism has avoided clash. The common people revere both the Buddhist grottoes and the A&#x301;rs&#x301;a temples. During hours of worship, the Buddhist lamas place offerings of ground barley, roasted barley powder, etc. before the gods, and these return to the people as prasa&#x301;d [holy remains of the offerings which are then eaten]. In the Hindu [A&#x301;rs&#x301;a] temples the priests place offerings of fruits and vegetables. In the same house one person may be Hindu and another Buddhist, however those who wish to become renunciants generally adopt lamaism and cloister themselves in the Buddhist grottoes. Very few local people become Hindu renunciants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="174"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=174 type=paragraph -->In olden times the number of men in Kinnaur was much greater, by comparison, than the number of women, thus the practice of polygamy was current among women out of social necessity. Some traces of that may still remain today. Some people may consider this strange, but there is nothing to be astonished at, or to think odd. People build their social structure by effecting a suitable harmony between individual and collective necessity, so however this practice of Kinnaur may appear to others, it was perfectly natural.<!-- /block --></p>

It&#146;s a troubling situation for them if they are ever forced to feed any guest apple bread; then there is no end to their shame. They will beg that guest&#146;s forgiveness over and over again.

He also composed some Mahayana scriptures in Sanskrit. He went to Laddak but he didn&#146;t go to Kinnaur. Still, Buddhism was subsequently introduced into Kinnaur from Laddak. Buddhism was first propagated in the original territory of Tibet (whose name was then Kimpurus&#x301;avars&#x301;a) by the royal prince of Udayan, Padmasambhava. What we now call Garhwal-Kumayun was known as the kingdom of Udayan in olden times. The palms of the hands and the soles of the feet of the royal prince were bright red so he was given the name Padmasambhava. Due to his influence Tibet accepted Mahayana Buddhism. The religion of Tibet before that was Bonpa or Bonpa-ism. King Sa&#x301;ungt-sen-ga&#x301;mpo, a follower of the Bonpa religion, had two wives. One was the royal Chinese princess, Den Jing, and the other was Trikuti, the daughter of the Nepali King at the time, Am&#x301;shuvarman&#x301;a, who was a follower of Mahayana Buddhism. The influence of these two queens was considerable in the kingdom of Tibet. The king was inspired by them to accept the Buddhist religion.<!-- /block --></p>

Taxila was famous for its philosophical thinking and for its spiritual community. Nalanda was successful in all spheres, and spiritually inspired. The chancellor of this Nalanda University was Dharmapa&#x301;la Diipaun&#x32D;kar. Dharmapa&#x301;la Diipaun&#x32D;kar came from Vikraman&#x301;ipur (its modern name is Vikrampur).

<a name="212"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=212 type=paragraph -->Thus I have said that India&#146;s, as well as Bengal&#146;s relationship with Tibet has always been cordial. No, no, no, it is not sufficient to say cordial &ndash; very cordial. In the middle of the Mughal era we see this cordiality carried over in the letters exchanged between the Maharaja of Coochbihar and the King of Tibet &ndash; in them runs the melody of this same heartfelt sincerity. The letters exchanged between the two of them were in Bengali. The king of Tibet (the then Dalai Lama) was bound to India by ties of affection. In the British administration as well, there were no great obstacles to intercourse between India and Tibet. Indian pilgrims used to go to Mount Kailash and Manas Sarowar without any difficulty. Monks and renunciants used to sit and light the sacrificial fires on both sides of the Himalayas. The closest sea to Tibet was the Bay of Bengal and Calcutta was Tibet&#146;s seaport. Tibet used to export primarily wool, animal skins, precious stones, and medicinal ingredients, while Tibet used to import manufactured commodities and small amounts of foodstuffs. Several of Tibet&#146;s post-offices were under the supervision of Bengal&#146;s Postmaster-General.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="247"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=247 type=paragraph -->It was a long time ago. I was in Sirmaor&#146;s capital then, Na&#x301;ha&#x301;n. Na&#x301;ha&#x301;n is a small city, but I liked it very much. The kingdom of Sirmaor was at one time quite huge &ndash; nearly half of the present-day Himachal Pradesh was in Sirmaor. Moreover, Garhwal-Kumayunr was once included within Sirmaor. Part of neighbouring Tibet was also within the borders of Sirmaor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="248"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=248 type=paragraph -->With the passage of time, many small and large kingdoms fell. A large part of present-day Himachal Pradesh left Sirmaor. In accordance with a verbal agreement between the Panchen Lama and the king of Sirmaor, part of Sirmaor came under the rule of the Dalai Lama. Nepal&#146;s Gorkha king took possession of Garhwal-Kumayun. Sirmaor became much smaller area-wise. Among all those native kingdoms who were assembled to make the present-day Himachal Pradesh, Sirmaor was not altogether insignificant as far as area goes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="249"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=249 type=paragraph -->The language of Sirmaor is Sirmaori (both language and script). It arose from a mixture of Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta and Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta. Sirmaori is closely related to the Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;ri language of Simla.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="250"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=250 type=paragraph -->Sirmaori has its own script as well, but nowadays it is disappearing. If this situation continues Sirmaori script will soon vanish behind the curtain of oblivion, just as Burma&#146;s Sa&#x301;n-Ka&#x301;cin script has vanished. At one time these Sa&#x301;n-Ka&#x301;cins were close relatives of the Bengali Kukii community and their script was also Bengali script. However, in subsequent times they were ruined by northern Burma&#146;s sub-script, but the Kukii script was unaffected. Sirmaori script is in that same situation. Archaeologists should make efforts to see that this script survives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="251"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=251 type=paragraph -->I got to thinking about that pre-Pathan era. At that time the influence of Shankaracharya over Sirmaor was quite high. The kings were making ongoing efforts with greater and lesser success to build a &ldquo;learned society&rdquo;; the relationship between Sirmaor and Bengal dates from that time. Garhwal-Kumayun was still a part of Sirmaor. Yes, Garhwal-Kumayun also left Sirmaor&#146;s control during Nepali rule. Afterwards, of course, when Nepal was defeated by General Octorloney,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn20"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn20">20</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Garhwal-Kumayun went back to the British in accordance with the treaty of Sugaolii (Champaran District). The British kept Garhwal-Kumayunr in their own hands, rather than return it to Sirmaor, and included it within the then United Province of Agra and Oudh (UP). Garhwal-Kumayun was lost to Sirmaor from then on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="252"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=252 type=paragraph -->Let us return then to the subject at hand. The kings of Sirmaor brought some pundits from Bengal and Maharastra and settled them in their own kingdom (in Garhwal and Kumayun) with offers of rent-free land grants. The descendants of these pundits are still there today. They differ from the local Yoshi Brahmans in their manners, behaviours, ways of thinking. Among the sixteen branches of Brahmans in those areas, twelve branches have come from Bengal and four are from Maharastra, that is, they belong to the Maharastran Citpa&#x301;van branch. Those whose forefathers came from Bengal continue to use such surnames as Bhat&#x301;t&#x301;a, Upa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya, Bahugun&#x301;a&#x301;, and so forth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="253"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=253 type=paragraph -->Maharastra&#146;s Citpa&#x301;van Brahmans are mostly vegetarian &ndash; they don&#146;t eat meat or fish but they don&#146;t have so much aversion to onions. The Bengali Brahmans don&#146;t have any distaste for meat but they do for onions. Those who eat meat, or used to eat meat, used to cook their meat without onions. When they came to this mountainous region, however, the Bengali and Maharastri Brahmans came into close contact with one another. From the point of view of spiritual ideologies, there have been five acknowledged Tantras since ancient times &ndash; Shaeva, Sha&#x301;kta, Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya, Saora, and Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava. Shaeva Tantra was equally present in this mountain region and its nearby areas. It was a little stronger in the mountains because this area is called &ldquo;Shiva&#146;s Field&rdquo;. The name of the mountains is also the Shivalic Range. Shiva used to remain mostly in this area, also in the Mount Kailash region.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="254"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=254 type=paragraph -->Earlier I mentioned that until the time of the Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, Mount Kailash and Manas Sarowar were part of Bharatakhan&#x301;d&#x301;a. But from the Sha&#x301;kta and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra point of view, we see that the successors of the Brahmans who came from Bengal principally accepted Sha&#x301;kta Tantra. And the successors of the Maharastra Citpa&#x301;van Brahman community chiefly followed Ga&#x301;n&#x301;patya Tantra. The influence of Sha&#x301;kta Tantra over the common people was greater, by comparison, than that of Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra. The Yoshii Brahmans are close to Sha&#x301;kta Tantra. For related reasons, Shiva and Shiva temples are pre-eminent in this region, but in important places Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, as well, is not neglected.<!-- /block --></p>

Fearful of crows, the owl hides itself in the dark crevices of trees during the day. Crows cannot see at night, so if an owl sees a crow at night it attacks it. But since crows have more strength in their beaks than owls they save themselves somehow. Thus, it is seen that it is the crow&#146;s young that are generally killed by owls. If an owl is not overly hungry it will not eat crow-meat. Since the crow&#146;s meat is bad-tasting, no bird will eat it apart from the vulture.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)   According to Indian mythology, at the time of an eclipse the demon Ra&#x301;hu swallows the sun or moon. The story goes like this: Once the gods and the demons undertook a project to churn the ocean. During the churning many precious valuables rose up from the sea-bed. Among these was sudha&#x301; or amrta (nectar). The demons claimed half of it but the gods became afraid that if the demons drank their share of the nectar they would become immortal and thus remain a perpetual source of trouble for the gods. So they postponed the division of the nectar and in the meantime they approached Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and implored him to help them get rid of the demons. Thereafter Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u assumed the form of a beautiful woman and began distributing the nectar among the gods and the demons. The gods drank the nectar  but the demons were too busy staring at the woman. Only one demon drank the nectar but Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u slit his throat before it got to his stomach. The severed head of this demon became known as Ra&#x301;hu and the trunk as Ketu. &ndash;Trans.</p>
