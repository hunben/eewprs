<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Yesterday morning I gave a short discourse regarding the roles of two rudimentally belligerent forces &ndash; virtue and vice &ndash; both of which work within and without microcosmic structures. And I also said that whenever we think something or do something regarding speed, in whatever plane it may take place, we should remember two fundamental points. The first is that movement is never in a straight line, it is always of a systaltic order, always of a pulsative order. And the second is that according to a variation in phase, the velocity and acceleration of speed, in particular, vary. No wherever there is an existence, inanimate or animate, there must be speed &ndash; this speed is a natural law.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In each and every structure there is the vidya&#x301; force and the avidya&#x301; force; and where the vidya&#x301; force wins, the resultant is life, and where the vidya&#x301; force is defeated, the resultant is death. Now in this human structure, controlled by a developed microcosm, there are two belligerent forces &ndash; one is vidya&#x301; and the other is avidya&#x301;. Vidya&#x301; elevates humanity. It aids the progress from the fundamental negativity towards the fundamental positivity. The fundamental negativity is the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, and the fundamental positivity is the controlling point of the pineal gland.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The central idea of the Giita&#x301; is also this. I said that in the first sloka of the Giita&#x301;, a question was placed before Sain&#x32D;jaya by Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra regarding the nature of the mind, regarding how the mind is placed between those two belligerent forces, the Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avas and the Kaoravas. Here the Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avas are the force of virtue and the Kaoravas the force of vice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now who is Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra? &ldquo;Dhrta&rdquo; means &ldquo;holder&rdquo; and &ldquo;ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra&rdquo; means &ldquo;structure&rdquo;. &ldquo;Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra&rdquo; means &ldquo;the entity that holds the structure of human beings&rdquo;. Now, as you know, mind without the help of conscience (viveka) is always a blind force. So here &ldquo;Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra uva&#x301;ca&rdquo; means the blind mind says, the blind mental force places the question before Sain&#x32D;jaya, the conscience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of &ldquo;Sain&#x32D;jaya&rdquo;? &ldquo;Sam&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;ji&rdquo; + &ldquo;al&rdquo; = &ldquo;sain&#x32D;jaya&rdquo;. Sain&#x32D;jaya is the conscience, viveka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Mind is a blind force. You know Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra was blind. He could not see, because his mind was blind. He asked:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;O Sain&#x32D;jaya, Partheya, Dharmaks&#x301;etre, Kuruks&#x301;etre, asmin Dharmaks&#x301;etra, asmin Kuruks&#x301;etre samaveta&#x301;h yuyutsavah &ndash; yudha&#x301;rtham samaveta&#x301;h mamapaks&#x301;iiya&#x301;h, tatha&#x301; Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;u paks&#x301;iiya&#x301;h kim akurvata.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Dhrtarastra, the blind mind, says &ldquo;Dharmaks&#x301;etre&rdquo;. What is Dharmaks&#x301;etra? &ldquo;Dhr&rdquo; + &ldquo;man&rdquo; = &ldquo;dharma&rdquo;. &ldquo;Dharma&rdquo; means the wonts, the properties, that differentiate one entity from another. This dharma is expressed, is manifested, through physical structures. &ldquo;Dharmaks&#x301;etra&rdquo; means &ldquo;this body&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And what is the meaning of &ldquo;Kuruks&#x301;etra&rdquo;? Kuruks&#x301;etra is not a small town in the State of Hariya&#x301;na&#x301;. Kuruks&#x301;etra is this entire universe. &ldquo;Kuru&rdquo; means &ldquo;do&rdquo;, &ldquo;do&rdquo; in the imperative mood. (in Sam&#x301;skrta it is called anujin&#x32D;a.) &ldquo;Kuru&rdquo; &ndash; second person imperative mood. And Ks&#x301;etra means &ldquo;field&rdquo; &ndash; the field that always says, &ldquo;Go human being, do something, do something.&rdquo; You are here to do something, this human body is to be used for doing something noble, doing something great. This feeling, that is, this universe is Kuruks&#x301;etra; and this body is Dharmaks&#x301;etra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In this Kuruks&#x301;etra, in this physical world, and in this Dharmaks&#x301;etra, in this physical body, &ldquo;Samaveta&#x301;h yuyutsavah&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;they assembled for a fight&rdquo;, for a grand fight. Who assembled? Those two rudimentally belligerent forces. Who are those two rudimentally belligerent forces? The movement towards crudeness and the movement towards subtleness, towards spirituality. These are the two fighting forces. &ldquo;Dharmaks&#x301;etre Kuruks&#x301;etre samaveta&#x301;h yuyutsavah&rdquo; &ndash; they assembled for a fight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ma&#x301;maka&#x301;h&rdquo; means &ldquo;my party&rdquo;. Whose party? The party of Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra. Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra says, &ldquo;Ma&#x301;maka&#x301;h&rdquo;, i.e., &ldquo;my party&rdquo;. Who are the parties of Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra? As you have already been told, &ldquo;Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra&rdquo; means &ldquo;blind mind&rdquo;, mind that cannot see without the help of conscience. &ldquo;Ma&#x301;maka&#x301;h&rdquo;. Who are the parties, who are the supporters of Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra. Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rasya Shataputra&#x301;h? Who are those Shataputra&#x301;h, who are those hundred sons?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The blind mind, any mind, functions in ten directions; pu&#x301;rva, pashcima, uttara, daks&#x301;in&#x301;a, u&#x301;rddha, adhah &ndash; the six lateral directions, known as &ldquo;pradisha&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta; and Iisha&#x301;na, Vayu, Agni and Naerta the four corners, called &ldquo;anudisha&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta. So there are ten directions, six plus four. And the blind mind functions in all ten directions with the help of all ten indriyas. Ten times ten equals one hundred; so the blind mind, Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra, has one hundred sons. Those pa&#x301;piis, those depraving elements, had a fight against the Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In Sam&#x301;skrta, &ldquo;Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;&rdquo; means &ldquo;self-knowledge&rdquo;. Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; is the supreme knowledge, Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; is the sublime spiritual knowledge. And the seeker of knowledge, who wants to acquire knowledge, is &ldquo;pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;u&rdquo;. Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;u &ndash; the movement from the crude to the subtle &ndash; is divided into five phases. The crudest is the realm of physicality, the solid level. Then the aquatic level, then the luminous level, then the gaseous, and finally the ethereal; after which the spirit of the microcosm goes beyond the scope of any physical periphery, and enters into the realm of spirituality. So this passing through five phases is the five Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The lowermost is ks&#x301;ititattva, i.e., Sahadeva. &ldquo;Sahadeva&rdquo; means &ldquo;abode&rdquo;, the abode for human habitation. Then the next one up is Nakula. &ldquo;Kulam&#x301; na&#x301;sti yasya&rdquo; &ndash; i.e., jalam, apatattva, the aquatic phase. Then Arjuna, i.e., energy kriya&#x301; shakti, fire the luminous phase, the luminous structure. Then gaseous, i.e., va&#x301;yuputra, bhiima: &ldquo;pavananandana bhiima.&rdquo; And finally the ethereal level &ndash; Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hiira. &ldquo;Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hiira&rdquo; means he who remains unaffected unassailed, properly balanced, and never loses his physical equipoise and mental equilibrium. &ldquo;Yudhi&rdquo; means &ldquo;in war&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sthiira&rdquo; means &ldquo;poised&rdquo;. &ldquo;Who remains unassailed in all the fights of the world&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->These are the five phases through which spiritual aspirants will have to pass and they will have to fight against those one hundred depraving elements who are the agents of the blind mind, Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra. &ldquo;Ma&#x301;maka&#x301;h Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avashcaeva kim akurvata Sain&#x32D;jaya&rdquo;. This fight between virtue and vice, is continuing and will continue forever. There cannot be any peaceful coexistence between good and bad, virtue and vice. One will have to go away, one will have to be expelled by the other. So you are all spiritual aspirants; you must remember that yours is a never-ending fight against all sorts of meanness, all sorts of crudeness, all sorts of depraving elements. You must not forget this fact.<!-- /block --></p>
