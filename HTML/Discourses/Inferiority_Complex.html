<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Rama&#146;s coronation ceremony was drawing to an end. The kings and dignitaries, the friends and relatives, had bid farewell to Rama and were returning to their distant lands. The monkeys also sought Rama&#146;s permission to begin their long journey to Kiskindhya&#x301;. Rama whispered in Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#146;s ear, &ldquo;These monkeys have done a lot for us. How can we repay them?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Perhaps you could grant them a special boon,&rdquo; Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; suggested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I could grant them a boon to be reborn as humans in their next life,&rdquo; said Rama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That&#146;s a generous offer,&rdquo; mused Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha, &ldquo;but they have such a deep inferiority complex that I doubt if they&#146;ll accept.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Let&#146;s see,&rdquo; said Rama, turning to address the monkeys. &ldquo;Brother monkeys, you have served me well. Today I wish to grant you the boon that you be reborn as humans in Kali Yuga.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The monkeys were hesitant. After a short deliberation they replied, &ldquo;Your Majesty, we thank you for your generous offer. However, the world of humans is too formal and artificial for us. We would suffer terribly in such an artificial world. Thank you, Your Majesty, but we don&#146;t desire a human form.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But as humans you can also lead honest unsophisticated lives. You can easily avoid unnecessary complications,&rdquo; Rama said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;We&#146;ve heard humans pretend to be hungry even when their stomachs are full. They say, &lsquo;Oh, we haven&#146;t eaten yet because we weren&#146;t hungry.&rsquo; Sometimes they don&#146;t touch water for many days, and say, &lsquo;We just had a bath even though we are suffering from the flu&rsquo;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But you don&#146;t have to tell lies,&rdquo; said Rama. &ldquo;You&#146;ll clearly tell people whether you are hungry or not, or whether you have bathed or not.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The monkeys continued, &ldquo;Humans keep filing law suits against each other. We don&#146;t understand the complexities of a court case. What shall we do, Your Majesty? Even after swearing an oath in court humans continue to tell lies. We couldn&#146;t possibly do that.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But you&#146;ll only file a case for a just cause,&rdquo; persisted Rama. &ldquo;You won&#146;t implicate innocent people, nor will you tell lies after swearing an oath.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The monkeys fell into deep thought. Rama glanced at Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha, who said, &ldquo;Didn&#146;t I tell you this would happen, Your Majesty?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->After a while the monkeys asked, &ldquo;Your Majesty, if we become humans, what will happen to our beloved tail?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That&#146;s nothing to be worried about,&rdquo; said Rama. &ldquo;In place of your monkey tail we&#146;ll give you a pigtail at the back of your head. The whole world will be enchanted by its beauty as it swings across your necks.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The monkeys were still hesitant. &ldquo;See, I told you so,&rdquo; said Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Finally the monkeys said, &ldquo;Your Majesty, we like your offer of a pigtail, but there is still a major problem. We really don&#146;t want clean-shaven, handsome faces; we prefer to keep our own charcoal-coloured faces.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Rama was lost for words. &ldquo;This is what I meant by inferiority complex, Your Majesty,&rdquo; whispered Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Well, what a terrible thing,&rdquo; said Rama. &ldquo;Humans must protect themselves from this inferiority complex.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I couldn&#146;t agree with you more,&rdquo; said Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha.<!-- /block --></p>
