<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->When people are guided by &ndash; not guided by, controlled by &ndash; dogmas, their dynamism is lost, so they become lifeless. They are worse than dead bodies. So you boys and you girls, you should know that you must never allow any dogma to control you, to make you drift away from your nucleus. Never allow your radius to increase. Always try to decrease your radius. Always try to come in closer and closer proximity to the nucleus of this universe. You may ask, &ldquo;Baba, what is dogma?&rdquo; You should remember, you are all educated boys and girls. Dogma is a psychic structure &ndash; all ideas are psychic structures &ndash; but there must be some flexibility regarding its boundary line.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->I think some of you have come in contact with our Prout theory. I think you have gone through it. The fifth fundamental principle of Prout says that the style of utilization should vary according to changes in time, space and person. Didn&#146;t I say this? That is, there is &ndash; there lies &ndash; scope for flexibility because the human mind won&#146;t tolerate anything rigid. It wants movement, but not only movement, it wants accelerated movement. But what is dogma? Dogma is also an idea, but with rigidity of the boundary line. Dogma won&#146;t allow you to go beyond its periphery of that boundary line. That is, dogma goes against the fundamental spirit of the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
