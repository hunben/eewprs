Although they are two for the sake of argument, they cannot be separated from the one paper entity. Removal of one side of the paper jeopardizes the existence of the other. So is the relation of Purus&#x301;a [Consciousness] and Prakrti [Operative Principle] in the Cosmic Entity. None of them can stand without the other. That is why it is said that they are an inalienable concomitance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Although as a philosophical word, shiva or purus&#x301;a is extensively used, in common parlance the word a&#x301;tma&#x301; [&ldquo;soul&rdquo; or &ldquo;self&rdquo;] is more extensively used in the same sense. Shiva means &ldquo;witnessing consciousness&rdquo;. So does purus&#x301;a &ndash; Pure shete yah sah purus&#x301;ah, that is, &ldquo;The witness-ship that lies quiescent in every entity is the purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; And a&#x301;tman means &ldquo;that which is omni-telepathic&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The physical sense of the body is telepathized on the mental plate. In other words, the physical sense is awakened in the mental plate due to the reflection that follows the impact of the crude physical waves on the mental plate. Similarly, the sense of every crude object is awakened in the mental plate as soon as the reflection takes place following the impact of the waves of the objects on the mental plate. Identical mental waves hit the soul entity, causing the reflection of those mental waves, and this awakens in the unit a sense of its indivisibility from the soul. If, in the language of philosophy, mental waves, that is, thought, be called thought-waves, then the reflection of the mental waves on the soul-plate will have to be termed telepathic waves. And so in reference to the soul-plate, we may say that it is telepathic to the mind. All mundane objects, crude, subtle or causal, consist in mental waves or thought-waves, and so in the fullest accord with reasoning and logic, we may call the Soul omni-telepathic. It is because of this omni-telepathic A&#x301;tman that the existences of all mundane objects, visible or invisible, large or small, find their factual substantiation and recognition. Had there been no A&#x301;tman, the existence of everything would have been in jeopardy.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Purport: Every object has a material cause and an efficient cause. Over and above these there is also a conjunctive agency linking the upa&#x301;da&#x301;na ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a [material cause] with the nimitta ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a [efficient or instrumental cause]. The determination of the firmness or laxity of the relation of the material cause with the efficient cause depends on the degree of conjunctive functions. In the process of creation, Purus&#x301;a is the material factor, and Prakrti is the linking force consummating the relation between the material and the efficient causes. As the efficient cause, Purus&#x301;a is the primary factor, and Prakrti is the secondary one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a is the all-pervading entity, and so no one else except Him can be the material cause. Prakrti, not being all-pervading, is sheltered in Purus&#x301;a. In the body of Purus&#x301;a, Prakrti can only work as much as She is given opportunity to by Purus&#x301;a. And so, in the science of creation, Purus&#x301;a alone as the doer entity is the chief efficient or instrumental cause; and since Prakrti has been posing as the doer with the authority given to Her by Purus&#x301;a, She is the subordinate efficient cause. The distortions or expressions which are taking place in the material cause through the efficient cause and which we call worldly manifestations, are effected by the three gun&#x301;as [attributes or binding principles: sattva, rajah and tamah] of Prakrti. This accounts for Prakrti being the linking force between the efficient cause and the material cause. So the firmness or feebleness of the object-body fully depends upon the degree of the influence of Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The role of Purus&#x301;a is foremost in all the spheres. Prakrti only acts to whatever extent Purus&#x301;a has authorized or authorizes Her to act. In the process of evolution, Purus&#x301;a gives Prakrti the authority to work, and She goes on working. The subtle Purus&#x301;a goes on attaining crudity gradually due to the bondage of the three gun&#x301;as of Prakrti. In the ultimate state of His crudity, Purus&#x301;a slowly and gradually keeps shrivelling up the opportunity and liberty of Prakrti previously given to Her, and thus the crudified Purus&#x301;a, gradually regaining His subtlety, returns to His own ultimate characteristic state. The flow of manifestations of the Purus&#x301;adeha [Cognitive Body] under the binding influence of Prakrti is what we call sain&#x32D;cara [extroversion from the subtle to the crude], while the gradual process of liberation that results in the Purus&#x301;adeha due to progressive looseness of the bondage is what we call pratisain&#x32D;cara [introversion from the crude to the subtle]. It is now abundantly clear that even though Prakrti is free to make honest use of Her acquired power, the attainment or non-attainment of this power depends on Purus&#x301;a, or Citishakti [Cognitive Principle], and so we have to say, Prakrti is but the characteristic of Purus&#x301;a Himself &ndash; Shaktih Sa&#x301; Shivasya Shaktih.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Purport: The existence of any entity is known by the process of its activity, thought or witness-ship, of which witness-ship belongs to Purus&#x301;a and the other two substantiating factors primarily belong to Prakrti; and so the fact of Prakrti being the causal entity of the stream of action and thought will be recognized only when She completely identifies herself with objectivity. This appropriation of objectivity by Prakrti depends on Her ever-increasing (sain&#x32D;cara) or -decreasing (pratisain&#x32D;cara) influence on Purus&#x301;a. Prakrti&#146;s manifestation lies in the sain&#x32D;cara and pratisain&#x32D;cara processes. In all these manifestations of Prakrti, Purus&#x301;a exists not only as the material cause, but as the witness as well, in all states and conditions.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Purport: The trivalent Prakrti has been apparently crudifying the original Purus&#x301;a through Her own binding forces &ndash; this is one of the processes of Her activity. Her other process being that by gradually relaxing the influence of Her three attributes on the crude object, She regains the characteristic of Purus&#x301;a, thus putting an end to Her binding operation. The first-named process of Prakrti is centrifugal and the other one is centripetal. The Brahma Cakra, or Srs&#x301;t&#x301;i Cakra [Cosmic Cycle], is manifested through the combination of these very centrifugal and centripetal actions. The nucleus of this Cosmic Cycle is indeed the svabha&#x301;va [characteristic bearing] of Purus&#x301;a. The material cause of the entire Brahma Cakra is Purus&#x301;a, or Shiva, and we shall call this nucleus Paramashiva or Purus&#x301;ottama.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[Sain&#x32D;cara (in the Cosmic Cycle) is the gradual extroversial movement under the increasing influence of the gun&#x301;as (binding principles).]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Purport: The object-ward movement or expression of Purus&#x301;a from the nucleus of the Brahma Cakra under the influence of Prakrti is called pravrtti (extroversial phase). As the result of the initial impact of Prakrti on the witnessing Purus&#x301;ottama, there awakens in Him the sense of existence, which in the language of philosophy is called the Mahattattva [Existential &ldquo;I&rdquo;], and the operative force concerned, whereby this Mahattattva comes into being, is called sattvagun&#x301;a (the sentient principle) of Prakrti. (Gun&#x301;a means &ldquo;binding principle&rdquo;.) The second impact of the operative force of Prakrti results in the emergence of the sense of doership or authorship. This changed expression of Purus&#x301;a is called the Aham&#x301;tattva (Doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;), and the operative force concerned is called rajogun&#x301;a (the mutative principle) of Prakrti. Finally, through the greater impact of the operative force of Prakrti in the wake of Her successive attacks, comes the crudest objectivity or complete objectivation of Purus&#x301;a (the crudest objective counterpart of the subjective Cosmos). This condition of Purus&#x301;a is called citta (mind-stuff). The operative force concerned, whereby such objectivation takes place, is called tamogun&#x301;a (the static principle) of Prakrti. That is to say, with the onset of pravrtti [desire and attachment], sain&#x32D;cara issues right from one and the same Purus&#x301;a through the gradual process of the gun&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Purport: The excess of vrtti [desire] is pravrtti [attachment or the accelerated momentum of desire]. The recessive or waning momentum of vrtti is nivrtti [detachment or the loss of desire in the introversial phase]. During the centrifugal movement, desire finds its fullest expression in Purus&#x301;a under the static influence of Prakrti. The citta entity that comes into play in the body of Purus&#x301;a under the static influence of Prakrti, when accepted by the jiiva&#x301;tman [the individual soul or the subjective part of the microcosm] as something perceivable or knowable, appears as the five gross physical elements, ten indriyas [organs] and five tanma&#x301;tras [sensible and super-sensible inferences or generic essences]. When the attributional flow reaches its finality, then starts the shedding of the gun&#x301;as &ndash; that is to say, Purus&#x301;a then keeps contracting the power of Prakrti. The result is that Prakrti, attracted by Purus&#x301;a, gets drawn to Purus&#x301;ottama. Consequently again, the five gross physical elements gradually get metamorphosed into body, vital energy and mind of the unit. Finally the unit mind merges into Purus&#x301;ottama as the result of shedding of the binding principles. It is because of the merger of the unit mind into its primal cause that the ultimate state of pratisain&#x32D;cara is a non-attributive one. This may be called the dissolution of the individual life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->[Purus&#x301;a is the substantiator, the ultimate witness; (the actional faculty of) Prakrti is the act of witnessing (and that which is witnessed).]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Purport: Acting is seeing, witnessing is drk [substantiation]. In the absence of the latter, seeing remains unsubstantiated. Thinking, speaking, moving, accepting &ndash; these fall in the category of action. The witness-ship that vouches for the existence of these activities, that substantive bearing, is Purus&#x301;a, and the expression of activity that takes place under His witness-ship is charged with the gun&#x301;as of Prakrti. If we call the expression of the material waves actional faculty, its apparent witness will be the citta entity. If the citta-ic expression be termed actional faculty, then its apparent witness will be the Aham&#x301;tattva (or Ego). If the expression or manifestation of the Ego be called actional faculty, then its apparent witness will be the Mahattattva [sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness]. If we call the sense of &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness actional faculty, then its witness-ship, that is, &ldquo;I-know-I-am&rdquo;-ness, will be acceptable as the ultimate witness. This &ldquo;I know&rdquo; is not the apparent witness of anybody or anything, it is the absolute witness of everything in all conditions. Hence candidly this bearing alone falls in the category of drk [ultimate cognition]. This in truth is the attributed consciousness of Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->[As the gun&#x301;as increase their bondage, they express themselves fully in the emergence of the fundamental factors.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Purport: Gun&#x301;a means &ldquo;binding principle&rdquo;. The stronger the bondage upon anything, the cruder the thing becomes. When in Her freedom acquired from Purus&#x301;a, Prakrti binds Purus&#x301;a, the conscious Purus&#x301;a gets metamorphosed into Mahattattva, Aham&#x301;tattva, citta, etc., under the ever-increasing binding factors, and then as the result of the gradually greater and still greater bondage of tamogun&#x301;a there come into being as per degrees of crudification, the ethereal, the aerial, the luminous, the liquid and (ultimately) the solid factors. Even in the latter there are degrees of bondage. On account of the firmness of bondage, the inter-atomic and inter-molecular distances go on decreasing, as the result of which the internal frictions in the material body go on increasing. The external pressure of attributional bondage and the internal frictions compel greater and greater attributional expressions in the bodies of objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Here one should bear in mind that &ldquo;attributional expression&rdquo; does not mean the excess of attributional capabilities, but that of the attributional manifestations as well as the attributional diversities. The a&#x301;ka&#x301;shatattva [ethereal factor] has the sound- carrying attribute. If, suppose, we fix its measure at one hundred, in that case, when the a&#x301;ka&#x301;shatattva gets metamorphosed into the va&#x301;yutattva [aerial factor] on account of greater static bondage, the attribute of touch is also expressed therein along with the sound-carrying attribute, but the attributional capacity remains what it is &ndash; unenhanced. The sound-carrying attribute wanes in the va&#x301;yutattva as compared to the a&#x301;ka&#x301;shatattva, but, all the same, the combined measure of the sonic and the tactual attributes still remains at one hundred.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Purport: If, even after the transformation of the object body into ks&#x301;ititattva [the solid factor], the onslaught of the binding principle continues unabated, the equipoise of the elements gets lost and jad&#x301;asphot&#x301;a [explosion of matter] takes place. As a result of this explosion ks&#x301;ititattva, due to its excessive internal friction, gets pulverized into subtler elements such as the ap [liquid], tejas [luminous], marut [aerial] and vyoma [ethereal] factors, completely or partially, that is to say, its movement undergoes the process of negative sain&#x32D;cara. Nevertheless, the resultant subtler elements after the explosion, of course, retake the same old path of sain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The ethereal element of the Cosmic Mind gets gradually cruder and cruder as per degrees of the ever-increasing flow of the gun&#x301;as, that is, from a&#x301;ka&#x301;sha, or vyoma, to marut, from marut to tejas, from tejas to ap, and from ap to ks&#x301;iti. The more the progress of these metamorphoses, the more varied the attributional diversities noticeable in the material bodies, and their dimensions also get shrunk and diminished. The dimensional contraction means the increase of internal frictions, and this happens due to the excess or magnitude of the external attributional flow. Due to these excessive internal frictions, explosions take place in the material bodies and they get pulverized into subtler elements. These explosions owing to hyper-attributional pressure occur only when the degree of the tension of the solid element becomes abnormally high as compared to other elements. In the absence of any wide disparities (either too high or too low) in the tensional relations of the elements, living organisms come into being instead of explosion.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->Purport: When after continued spiritual practice the mahattattva, that is, the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, gets metamorphosed into the Macrocosmic &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, the citta of the microcosmic mind merges in the  aham and the  aham merges in the mahat. When the object merges in its cause, that merger is called pralaya or pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha [utter destruction]. Since the citta of the  Macrocosm grows out of the Macrocosmic Aham, and the Macrocosmic Aham out of the Macrocosmic Mahat, when in pratisain&#x32D;cara&#146;s introversial movement the [unit] citta merges in the aham and the aham in the mahat, to call it pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha is quite logical and reasonable. The state of utter destruction of the citta and the aham and the state of all-pervasiveness of the mahat constitute sagun&#x301;a&#x301;sthiti [the state of transcendentality], or savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi [the trance of determinate absorption].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->Purport: In the state of wakefulness all three stages of the mind, namely, conscious, subconscious and unconscious, remain active, but the subtler condition is inconspicuous due to the activeness of the cruder condition. While dreaming, the crude or conscious mind remains dormant, the subconscious and the unconscious minds remain active. During sleep, only the unconscious mind remains active. The opinion that the state of sleep is the state of the sense of vacuity is unacceptable to a subtle philosophical judgement, because at that time the works of both the conscious and the subconscious minds are done by the unconscious mind. The real state of vacuity is verily the state of utter destruction of the mind, and so even savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi is not a state of vacuity. Only the state of nirvikalpa is the state of vacuity. In this state of absolute vacuity, the spiritual waves of exhilaration that fill the unit entity still continue to flow and trail on for some time even after that state of vacuity, that is, after the mind returns due to unserved sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [the consequential reactive momenta of one&#146;s past deeds]. These very trailing waves of exhilaration and joyous exuberance keep reminding the &ldquo;mindful&rdquo; sa&#x301;dhaka [intuitional practitioner] that his or her &ldquo;mindless&rdquo; state had been one of absolute bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
