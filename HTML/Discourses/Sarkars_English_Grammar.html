<p class=chapter_title>PARTS OF SPEECH</p>

<p>Usually eight parts of speech are recognized in
English grammar. They are:  noun, pronoun, adjective,
verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction and interjection.</p>

<p><b>Noun:</b> A  noun  is usually defined as the name of an object,
or a person, or a country; or [as the] subjective [part] of a sentence.</p>

<p class=example><i>Joseph</i> is eating.<br />
The <i>peacock</i> is dancing.<br />
<i>India</i> is a big country.<br />
The mighty <i>Himalayas</i> are in the north of India.<br />
The <i>Indus</i> is a big river.<br />
The <i>Punjab</i> is a land of five rivers.<br />
The <i>rose</i> is a beautiful flower.<br />
The <i>magnolia</i> is a sweet-smelling flower.<br />
<i>Baikal</i> is a lake.<br />
<i>Bengali</i> is a language.<br />
The <i>Bengalees</i> are an ancient people.</p>

<p><b>Pronoun:</b> A pronoun  is a part of speech used in lieu
of an original noun to avoid boring repetition. </p>

<p class=example>Mohan lives in Calcutta, but today <i>he</i> is in Dacca.</p>

<p><b>Adjective:</b> An adjective is a part of speech that qualifies
a noun or a noun-equivalent. </p>

<p class=example>He is a <i>good</i> boy.<br />
Poppy seed is an <i>indispensable</i> item in a West Bengal dish. </p>

<p><b>Verb:</b> A verb is a part of speech that denotes an action,
that associates the subject with the predicate. </p>

<p class=example>Jadu <i>is singing</i> Rabindra Sangita.</p>

<p><b>Adverb:</b> An adverb is a part of speech that modifies a verb.</p>

<p class=example>He is running <i>fast</i>.</p>

<p>Here <i>fast</i> is an adverb modifying the verb <i>is running</i>.</p>

<p><b>Preposition:</b> A preposition is a part of speech which
grants position to an object or an action. </p>

<p class=example>put <i>on</i> (wear)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; put <i>off</i> (extinguish)</p>

<p><b>Conjunction:</b> A conjunction is a part of speech that
maintains a link amongst different ideas in both compound
and complex sentences. </p>

<p class=example>He went to Calcutta,
<i>and</i> there he visited the zoological garden.</p>

<p><i>And</i> is the connecting link between the two sentences:
"He went to Calcutta." "There he visited the zoological garden."</p>

<p><b>Interjection:</b> An interjection is a part of speech that
expresses a mental idea through an affirmative or negative word. </p>

<p class=example><i>Oh!&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello!&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas!</i></p>

<p><b>Pro-verb:</b> In the list of the above-mentioned eight
parts of speech, the pro-verb is not included.
But it will be better if the pro-verb is treated
as a separate part of speech. </p>

<p class=example>I shall never kill an innocent bird as Dickie <i>does</i>.</p>

<p>Here <i>does</i> is a pro-verb, because it has been used in
lieu of the verb <i>kill</i>. Just as a pronoun is a part
of speech used in place of a noun, a pro-verb is a
part of speech which substitutes for the original verb.</p>

<p><b>Verbal Noun:</b> A noun denotes the name and existential
form of an entitative idea. When an action takes place
in such a way that it comes within the scope of a
special name and existential form of an entitative
idea, it is regarded as a verbal noun.</p>

<p class=example><i>Running</i> is a good exercise.<br>
<i>Walking</i> in the morning is good for the health.</p>

<p><b>Verbal Adjective:</b> When a verb qualifies a noun or a
noun-equivalent, it is called a verbal adjective. </p>

<p class=example>A <i>running</i> panorama is more interesting
than a stagnant picture.</p>

<p>Here <i>running</i> is a verbal adjective, qualifying the
noun <i>panorama</i>. [The equivalent word] in Bengali
[would be considered] an adjective. In such cases
generally the suffix -<i>shatr</i> (<span
class=Bengali>&#x09B6;&#x09A4;&#x09CD;&#x09B0;</span>) or the
suffix -<i>sha&#x301;nac</i> (<span
class=Bengali>&#x09B6;&#x09BE;&#x09A8;&#x099A;</span>)
is used in Sanskrit,
and the suffix -<i>anta</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;</span>) is used in
Bengali: for example, <i>calanta</i> (<span
class=Bengali>&#x099A;&#x09B2;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;</span>),
<i>ghumanta</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x0998;&#x09C1;&#x09AE;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;</span>).
(<a name=t1.1 href=#1.1><sup>1</sup></a>)
</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b></p>

<p>The word <i>syntax</i>(<a name=t1.2 href=#1.2><sup>2</sup></a>)
 denotes the particular style of composition
according to grammatical rules. That is, syntax means how
and where the different parts of speech (noun, pronoun,
adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction,
interjection) are to be used in a sentence.</p>

<p class=footnotes_begin><hr width=45% size=1 color=gray align=left>

<p class=footnote>(<a name=1.1 href=#t1.1>1</a>)
The above sections on Verbal Noun and Verbal Adjective
are taken from the section on "Kriya&#x301;" ("Verb") in the
author's <i>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</i> ("A Collection of Words")
<i>Part 10</i>, 1987. Accompanying them is the following
definition of <i>gerund</i> (which departs from conventional
definitions): "When a verb qualifies another verb,
or a noun, or a noun-equivalent, and has  a special
idea behind it, it is called a <i>gerund</i>. But [the
equivalent form] is treated as an adjective in Bengali,
and has the suffix -<i>d&#x301;a</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09A1;</span>).
Example of gerund: 'Listen to the gurgling sound
of the swift-flowing river.'" &ndash;Eds.</p>

<p class=footnote>(<a name=1.2 href=#t1.2>2</a>)
There is great confusion among scholars about the
origin of the word <i>syntax</i>. Some say that the word is
of Latin origin, others are of the opinion that it
is of Greek origin, some maintain that it is of
Ottoman Turkish origin, while, according to others,
it is of mixed Semitic and Greek origin.</p>

<p class=chapter_title>ARTICLES</p>

<p>An article is a word generally used before a noun
or a noun-equivalent. Generally three kinds of articles
are recognized in English grammar:
(1) definite, (2) indefinite (general) and (3) numeral.
Some hold the opinion that an article is a kind of
adjective, but not everyone agrees with this definition.</p>

<p><b>Definite article:</b> <i>The, that, those</i> may be
treated as definite articles.</p>

<p><b>Indefinite (general) article:</b></p>

<p class=example><i>One</i> who knows French may easily learn Spanish.
To learn Bengali <i>one</i> does not have go to Calcutta; <i>one</i> can
learn it just as well in Benares. </p>

<p>Here <i>one</i> is an indefinite article. It does not indicate any
particular person, but refers to people in general.</p>

<p><b>Numeral article:</b></p>

<p class=example><i>Seven hundred</i> Bengalee youths under the leadership of
Prince Vijaya Sinha went to Lanka in 534 B.C.</p>

<p>Here <i>Seven hundred (700)</i> is a numeral article.</p>

<!-- block a=3 type=chapter -->

<p class=chapter_title>CASE</p>

<p>Generally, the following are the recognized cases in English grammar:

<p><b>Nominative case:</b> <i>Ram</i> is going.<br>
<p><b>Objective case:</b> He gave <i>food</i> to a beggar.<br>
<p><b>Instrumental case:</b> Jadu cut the vegetables <i>with a knife</i>.<br>
<p><b>Dative case:</b> My uncle brought a nice pen <i>for me</i>. <br>
<p><b>Ablative case:</b> Ripe mangoes were hanging <i>from the tree</i>.<br>
<p><b>Possessive case:</b> Aurangzeb was the third son <i>of Emperor Shahjahan</i>. <br>
<p><b>Containing, or locative, case:</b> Fishes live <i>in water</i>. <br>
<p><b>Vocative case, or case of address:</b> <i>O my Lord!</i> Give me strength to serve humanity.<br>

<p><b>All the cases in one [Bengali] rhyme</b>:

<p class=chapter_title>VOICE</p>

<p>While expressing an idea, we may use two
kinds of voice: the active voice and the passive voice.

<p>When, in an expression, the subject predominates
the idea, the expression is known as <i>active voice</i>;
and when the object of the verbal form predominates
[i.e., the object becomes the subject], it is called
<i>passive voice</i>.

<p>(It may be remembered in this connection that
in the Bengali language there are three voices:
the active voice, the passive voice, and the subjunctive voice.)

<p>"Rama <i>killed</i> Ravana": Here the fact is expressed in the active voice.

<p>"Ravana <i>was killed</i> by Rama." Here the killing [of Ravana]
was done by Rama, and is in the passive voice.

<p class=chapter_title>SPEECH</p>

<p>When the language of a person is represented
as it is or as it was or as it would have been,
it is called direct speech. When the speech of a
person is not directly expressed, but expressed
in the language of a person conveying that speech,
it is called indirect speech.

<p><b>Direct:</b>

<p>Ram said that Shyam had told him,
&ldquo;I shall visit Anandanagar tomorrow.&rdquo;

<p><b>Indirect:</b>

<p>Ram said that Shyam had told him that he would
visit Anandanagar the next (following) day.

<p class=chapter_title>MOOD</p>

<p>Generally four kinds of mood are recognized in English grammar.
They are (1) imperative mood, (2) indicative mood,
(3) infinitive mood, and (4) subjunctive mood.

<p><b>Imperative mood:</b> There is a little difference
between the imperative and [the Bengali] <i>vidhiliun&#x32D;</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09AC;&#x09BF;&#x09A7;&#x09BF;&#x09B2;&#x09BF;&#x0999;</span>
<sup><a name=t10.1 href=#10.1>1</a></sup>).
While the imperative mood denotes order or request or
persuasion, the <i>vidhiliun&#x32D;</i> denotes desirability.
While the imperative comes within the range of the
present and the future tenses, the <i>vidhiliun&#x32D;</i> comes within
the scope of the past and future tenses.

<p><b>Future <i>vidhiliun&#x32D;</i>:</b>

<p class=example>You should do.

<p><b>Past <i>vidhiliun&#x32D;</i>:</b>

<p class=example>You should have done.

<p><b>Present imperative:</b>

<p class=example>Do it.

<p>There is no separate form for the future imperative.
The present imperative form is used in both cases.
In certain languages there is a separate form for the
future imperative. In the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii dialect of the
Bengali language there are separate forms for the
present imperative and future imperatives:
<i>kha&#x301;n</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x0996;&#X09be;&#x09A8;</span> ["eat"] &ndash; present imperative),
<i>kha&#x301;ben</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x0996;&#X09be;&#x09AC;&#x09C7;&#x09A8;</span>
["eat"] &ndash; future indicative<sup><a name=t10.2 href=#10.2>2</a></sup>),
<i>kheyen</i> (<span class=Bengali>
&#x0996;&#x09C7;&#x09DF;&#x09C7;&#x09A8;</span> ["eat"] &ndash; future imperative).

<p><b>Indicative mood:</b> In the indicative mood almost all the tenses are used.

<p><b>Infinitive mood:</b> The infinitive mood is a sort of verbal noun &ndash;
<i>to set, to be, to go</i>, etc.

<p><b>Subjunctive Mood:</b>

<p class=example>Had I been in Calcutta I would have visited
the zoological garden there.

<p>In such a case, we show the correlation between two
past verbal expressions: "Had I been in Calcutta."
"I would have visited the zoological garden there."

<p class=chapter_title>USE OF PREPOSITIONS</p>

<p><b>On, upon, above:</b> [Taking the original senses of the words,]
<i>on</i> is to be used where there is a tactual relationship
between two objects, for example, "The glass is <i>on</i> the table."
But when there is no tactual relationship (the upper object
maintains a gap in relation to the lower),
<i>upon (up + on = on + on = upon)</i><sup><a
name=t12.1 href=#12.1>1</a></sup> is used: for example,
"The ceiling is <i>upon</i> the table."


<p>[Taking the original senses,] upon and above are almost
synonymous, but in practical use <i>upon</i> is primarily used
in the case of material objects and <i>above</i> is used in the
case of immaterial objects, for example, "The ceiling
is <i>upon</i> one's head," but, "He is <i>above</i> all prejudice."

<p><i>To look upon</i> means "to consider or treat":

<p class=example>He <i>looks upon</i> him as his elder brother.
(I.e., he maintains a relationship with him as
with an elder brother).

<p><b>In, on, to:</b>

<p class=example>The Punjab is <i>in</i> the west of India.
<br>Pakistan is <i>on</i> the west of India.
<br>Iran is <i>to</i> the west of India.

<p>The Punjab is in the west and is within Indian territory.
So we should say <i>in the west</i>. In the second sentence,
Pakistan is on the west &ndash; it is outside Indian territory
but touching the Indian border. In this case, <i>on the
west</i> should be used. In the third case, Iran is to the
west of India. Iran does not touch the border of India &ndash;
there is no common border &ndash; so here <i>to the west</i> should be used.

<p><b>In, into, unto:</b> In old English, <i>into</i> was
used in the sense of coming inside from outside, and <i>in</i>
was used when something was already inside.

<p>He is entering <i>into</i> the room. (He is going into
the room from outside, crossing the threshold.)

<p>But if we say, "He is <i>in</i> the room," it means
that he is already inside the room.

<p>In modern English <i>into</i> is fast becoming extinct.

<p>About 1200 years ago in old English, the preposition
<i>unto</i> had three kinds of use: <i>towards, to</i> and <i>from</i>.
Now it use is almost restricted to Biblical language.

<p><b>Between, among, amongst:</b> When a matter concerns
two persons or two objects, the preposition <i>between</i>
should be used, but when the parties concerned are more
than two in number, <i>among</i> or <i>amongst</i> should be used.

<p class=example>There was a tug-of-war <i>between</i> Ram and Shyam.
<br>They were discussing <i>among/amongst</i> themselves.

<p><b>Between, in between:</b> <i>Between</i> means <i>in the two</i>.
"Bengal is <i>between</i> Assam and Bihar." <i>In between</i> is a
common error. <i>In between</i> means <i>in in the two</i>, in which
case there lies the defect of duality.

<p class=footnotes_begin><hr width=45% size=1 color=gray align=left>

<p class=footnote>(<a name=12.1 href=#t12.1>1</a>)
The original implication of adding <i>up</i> to <i>on</i> was
to double the sense of elevation &ndash; so that the tactual
relationship would be lost and a gap would be introduced. &ndash;Eds.

<p>[The words <i>eighty</i> and <i>eighteen</i>,
though correctly pronounced
as they are spelt, are sometimes mispronounced
"eight-ty" and "eight-teen".]

<p>Use: The <i>s</i> in <i>use</i> will be pronounced like <i>s</i> when
the word is a noun, and like <i>z</i> when the word is a verb.

<p><b>French and English pronunciation:</b> In French, the definite
article <i>the</i> is <i>le</i> in the masculine gender, <i>la</i> in the feminine gender,
and <i>les</i> in plural. But the pronunciation of <i>la</i>, <i>le</i> and <i>les</i> is changed
while in diphthong with other words. In such cases the system of
spelling becomes the primary factor; for instance, <i>the men</i> will be,
in French, <i>les hommes</i>  (pronounced "lez-omme" instead of "les-omme").

<p>The English word <i>knife</i> has come from the French word <i>kanif</i>.
In this case the letter <i>k</i> remains mute. But as the word
originally comes from French, the system of  retaining the
<i>k</i> in spelling is followed. In French the <i>k</i> is pronounced.

<p>The first <i>h</i> in a French word remains mute; for example,
the English <i>hotel</i> is pronounced "otel" in French, and
the English <i>hospital</i> is pronounced "aupital" in French.
In the case of the word <i>honour</i>, the French pronunciation
has been accepted [in English]. Even uneducated French
people follow this [as their] natural system of pronunciation.

<p><b>A historian</b> / <b>an historian:</b>
When the first <i>h</i> remains
mute in words of French origin, such as <i>honour</i>, <i>hour</i>, <i>heir</i>,
<i>history</i>, <i>hospital</i>, and <i>hotel</i>, the article <i>an</i> must be used
before the noun. [And when the <i>h</i> is pronounced, either <i>a</i>
or <i>an</i> may be used.] In old English, <i>an historian</i> was correct;
in modern English, both <i>a historian</i> and <i>an historian</i> are correct.

<p><b>Of</b> / <b>off:</b> <i>Of</i>, as in &ldquo;Bank <i>of</i>
India,&ldquo; is pronounced &ldquo;ov&ldquo;
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0985;&#x09AC;&#x09CD;</span>),
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09AC;&#x09BE;&#x0999;&#x09CD;&#x0995;&#x09CD;
&#x0985;&#x09AC;&#x09CD; &#x0987;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A1;&#x09BF;&#x09AF;</span>).
<i>Off</i> is pronounced &rdquo;of&ldquo;
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0985;&#x09AB;&#x09CD;</span>).
<i>Of</i> means <span class=Bengali>&#x09B0;</span>,<sup><a
 name=t13.3 href=#13.3>3</a></sup>
<i>off</i> means "far"
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09A6;&#x09C2;&#x09B0;&#x09C7;</span>).


<p><b>Tug of war:</b>
<i>Tug of war</i> is pronounced "tug-ah-far"
(<span class=Bengali>&#x099F;&#x0997;-&#x0986;-&#x09AB;&#x09BE;&#x09B0;</span>).

<p><b>Is:</b> <i>Is</i> is pronounced "iz"[, not "ij"]
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0987;&#x099C;&#x09BC;</span>), not
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0987;&#x099C;</span>), for example,
"He <i>is</i> ("iz") a good boy."

<p><b>Pronunciation of <i>d</i> [as <i>d</i> and as <i>j</i>] in English:</b>
The English language follows two main schools
of intonation: Anglo-Saxon and Norman.
According to Anglo-Saxon intonation,
English <i>d</i> [in the middle of a word] is pronounced "j".
According to Norman intonation, English <i>d</i> is
pronounced "d", as in dog. Both these schools of
pronunciation are equally correct. For instance:

</TABLE>

<p><b>Pronunciation of <i>g</i> as "g" or "j",
and <i>c</i> as "s" or "k", in English:</b> Sometimes if <i>g</i> is
followed by <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>  or <i>y</i>,
it is pronounced "j" (<i>general, gist</i>).
Elsewhere it is pronounced "g" (as in <i>get, give</i>).
The word <i>jail</i> has two recognized spellings: <i>jail</i> and <i>gaol</i>.
In the latter case it is an exception to the rule because
even though <i>g</i> is not followed by <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>,
or <i>y</i> (it is followed by <i>a</i>),
even then it is pronounced "j".

<p>In the case of <i>c</i>, if it is followed
by <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, or <i>y</i>,
it is pronounced like "s", but elsewhere it is pronounced like "k".

<p>For example, <i>cat</i>, but <i>cinema</i>,
<i>centre</i>, <i>concede</i>, <i>cycle</i>, etc.
In French, <i>c</i> with cedilla [¸] will be pronounced like
"s", as in <i>garçon</i> ("boy").

<p><b>Anglo-Saxon vs. Norman pronunciation:</b> Many people are
inclined to criticize the English language, saying that
it does not follow any particular system of pronunciation.
This is completely incorrect. Why is <i>but</i> pronounced in
one way and <i>put</i> in another way? There is a clear and
consistent rule for this. <i>But</i> is a word of Anglo-Saxon
origin, and here u is a short <i>u</i> sound pronounced as in
<i>under</i>, <i>unfair</i>, etc.;
whereas <i>put</i> is a word of Norman origin.

<p><b>Double <i>u</i> in English and double <i>v</i> in French:</b> In the
English language, to prolong the pronunciation of <i>u</i>,
two <i>u</i>'s were used and that has become the letter <i>w</i>.
In original French, there was no use for this letter.
But in order to properly write [some] words of non-French
origin, French-speaking people initially used double-<i>v</i>.
The French people gave the letter the name <i>double-v</i>
(pronunc. <i>dublve</i>, (<span
class=Bengali>&#x09A6;&#x09C1;&#x09AC;&#x09CD;</span><span
class=bengali>&#x09B2;&#x09AC;&#x09C7;</span>).

<p><b>Pronunciation of <i>a</i> in English and French:</b> In English
the letter <i>a</i> has twenty-one kinds of pronunciation,
but in French it has only one pronunciation &ndash; like
the Bengali <i>a&#x301;</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x0986;</span>), as in <i>Paris</i>.

<p><b>A rule regarding French consonants:</b> In the French
word <i>Paris</i> the last <i>s</i> remains mute because according
to the French rule, all consonants except
<i>c</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>r</i>,
remain mute at the end of a word. To pronounce
them fully, a vowel should be added at the end of
the word. Many people wrongly spell the French word
<i>madame</i> as <i>madam</i> in English.
But if <i>madam</i> is written
in French, the pronunciation will be <i>ma&#x301;da&#x301;n&#x32D;</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09AE;&#x09BE;&#x09A6;&#x09BE;&#x0981;</span>).
To keep the pronunciation of
the last letter intact, you will have to write the
letter <i>e</i> at the end of the word. In French, <i>mon</i> is
used for <i>my</i> in the masculine, <i>ma</i> for <i>my</i> in the
feminine, and <i>mes</i> for <i>my</i> in the plural. So the
plural of <i>madame</i> will be <i>mesdames</i>. Many people
wrongly pronounce this as "mes dames" (<i>mes d&#x301;ems,</i>
<span class=Bengali>
&#x09AE;&#x09C7;&#x09B8;&#x09CD;-</span><span
class=Bengali>&#x09A1;&#x09C7;&#x09AE;&#x09B8;</span>).

<p><b>Sanskrit <i>f</i></b>: The letter <i>f</i> is used in
Arabic, Persian, Latin, English and French, but there is
no such pronunciation in Sanskrit. In Sanskrit there is
<i>ph</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AB;</span>),
but no <i>f</i>. Thus to spell words such as <i>Fazal</i> [a name],
<i>Finnish</i>, <i>fain</i>, <i>kanif</i>, and <i>fraternal</i>
in the Sanskrit [alphabet] is impossible.
Hence I am in favour of putting one dot under
the letter <span class=Bengali>&#x09AB;</span>
in Sanskrit [<span class=Bengali>&#x09AB;&#x09BC;</span>]
to indicate the letter <i>f</i>.

<p><b>Pronunciation of <i>r</i>:</b> When <i>r</i> is the
last letter of a syllable (but that syllable is not the
last syllable), and is followed by a consonant, it is
not pronounced. The time that should have been allotted
for <i>r</i> is given to its preceding vowel, for example,
"forty" &rarr; "fau-au-ty",
"fourteen" &rarr; "fo-o-teen",
"party" &rarr; "pah-ah-ty".

<p>If <i>r</i> is the [last] letter of the last syllable,
and if it is followed by another word starting with a
consonant, then it also remains mute. For example,
"Fo<i>r t</i>hem, I had to start fo<i>r C</i>alcutta"
(here the <i>r</i>'s are mute); "He has come fo<i>r y</i>ou"
(here the <i>r</i> is pronounced because although <i>y</i> is
a consonant, it is pronounced like a vowel).
"The Damoda<i>r i</i>s a big <i>ri</i>ve<i>r</i>" &ndash; here all three
<i>r</i>'s are to be pronounced.

<p><b>Pronunciation of <i>ch</i>:</b> <i>Ch</i> is pronounced sometimes as "ch"
(<span class=Bengali>&#x099A;</span>),
as in <i>chalk</i>, <i>chair</i>, <i>chess</i>;
sometimes as "q" [<span class=Bengali>&#x0995;</span>
sound],  as in <i>monarch</i>, <i>patriarch</i>, <i>matriarch</i>, etc.;
and sometimes as "sh" [ <span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;</span> ],
as in <i>branch</i>, etc.

<p>In the case of words of French origin, <i>ch</i>
is always pronounced "sh", for example, Pondichery
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09AA;&#x0981;&#x09A6;&#x09C0;&#x09B8;&#x09C7;&#x09B0;&#x09C0;</span>),
Chandernagore (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;&#x0981;&#x09A6;&#x09B0;&#x09A8;&#x0997;&#x09B0;</span>),
<i>chauffeur</i>, <i>chevrolet</i>.
If <i>n</i> is followed by <i>ch</i> in a particular syllable,
then <i>ch</i> is pronounced "sh", for example, <i>branch</i>, <i>inchcape</i>;
but when <i>ch</i> follows <i>n</i> in a different syllable,
then it is pronounced "ch", as in <i>charm</i>:
for example, <i>enchanting</i>, <i>Ranchi</i>.

<p>When <i>ch</i> in Latin-derived words is not followed
by a consonant, it is pronounced "q", as in
<i>monarch</i>, <i>patriarch</i>, etc.

<p class=chapter_title>SOME RULES OF SPELLING</p>

<p><b>Double consonant after light vowel:</b>
If a consonant is preceded by a light vowel, that is, <i>a</i> or <i>o</i>,
the consonant becomes doubled.<a name=t14.1 href=#14.1><sup>1</sup></a>

<p class=table><TABLE width=70%>

	<TR><TD>o + cident</TD><TD>= occident</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<p>But <i>re</i> + <i>quire</i> = <i>require</i>.
Here there is one <i>q</i>, because <i>e</i> in <i>re</i>-
is not a light vowel.

<p><b><i>i</i> before <i>e</i>:</b> In English where the two vowels
<i>i</i> and <i>e</i> come side by side, as a general
rule <i>i</i> comes first and <i>e</i> succeeds <i>i</i>.<a
name=t14.2 href=#14.2><sup>2</sup></a>
Because the pronunciation of <i>i</i> is longer and more
emphatic than that of <i>e</i>, <i>i</i> [when it is the only vowel
in a syllable] is always pronounced as in <i>kid</i>.
But the pronunciation of <i>e</i> varies; it may be as in <i>met</i>,
<i>mete</i>, <i>berth</i>, etc.
So in most cases <i>i</i> precedes <i>e</i>,
but there are some exceptions: for instance,
the verb[-root] <i>ceive</i> and its noun-form <i>ceipt</i>
(e.g., <i>receive</i>, <i>conceive</i>, <i>perceive</i>, <i>receipt</i>);
and also <i>leisure</i> (short rest), <i>counterfeit</i> (base), etc.

<p><b>Benefited or Benefitted?</b>
If the last consonant of a verb is preceded by a
single vowel, and that verb is converted into a
participle, then the consonant is doubled,
for example, <i>fit</i> &rarr; <i>fitted</i>.
But <i>benefited</i> is an exception.

<p><b>The suffix <i>-ful</i>:</b> In ordinary circumstances, the English
word <i>full</i> is spelt with two <i>l</i>'s, but if it is a conjunct
word, it is spelt -<i>ful</i>, for example, <i>beautiful</i>, <i>handful</i>.
If the importance of the pronunciation of <i>l</i> is reduced,
one <i>l</i> is dropped. This should be considered as a rule,
rather than an exception.

<p><i>Patriarchal:</i> Where the social order is handed down from
father to son, as in <i>patriarchal order of society</i>.

is not <i>matrimony</i>. <i>Matrimony</i> means "marriage"
(e.g., <i>matrimonial relations</i>).

<p><i>Patrilateral:</i> It means "related to father's side".

<p><i>Patricidal:</i> The old Latin verb <i>cide</i> means "to kill". Thus:

<p><b>Far, farther, further:</b> <i>Far</i> means "distant".
<i>Farther</i> means "more distant", it is the comparative
degree of <i>far</i>. <i>Further</i> means "more afront" ["more ahead"].

<i>Voracity</i> means "overeating", "gluttony".

<p><b>Observation and observance:</b>
<i>Observation</i> is a noun form of the verb <i>to
observe</i>, meaning "to watch" or "to scrutinize".
<i>Observance</i> means "ceremony".

<p class=example>He was kept under strict observation.

<p><b>School:</b> It means "to remould". It comes from
the French word <i>école</i>.

<p>In modern English, <i>duty</i> in the sense of
"what should be done" may also be used in
the plural form.

<p><b>Mercenary and missionary:</b>

<p><i>Mercenary</i>: In old Latin, <i>mercene</i> meant

hired soldiers".

<p><i>Missionary</i>: <i>Missionary</i> means a
"person who works for a noble cause". The word
<i>missionary</i> is derived from the root verb <i>mit</i>.

<p>Note: As per the rule, if the suffix -<i>ion</i>
is added to a verb ending in a consonant other than -<i>t</i>,

<p><b>Vernacular and colloquial:</b> <i>Vernacular</i> means "the
undeveloped language of local uncultured people
or backward people". So it is a somewhat derogatory word.

<p><i>Colloquial</i> means "spoken". <i>Colloquial</i> language
means "spoken language". Those whose natural
tongue or "kitchen language" is not English,
do not usually learn colloquial English, which
does not come within the framework of written
English. For example, we write <i>will not</i>, but
in colloquial English we say <i>won't</i>.
Again, in written English we write <i>do
not</i>, but in colloquial English, we say <i>don't</i>.

<p><b>Doldrums and pell-mell:</b> <i>Doldrums</i> means
a "state where not a single object is functioning
properly". Suppose three persons are producing
music to different tunes simultaneously.
That is the state of the doldrums.
<i>Pell-mell</i> means "a state where things
are not in proper order".

<p class=exaxmple>While inspecting the office, I found the
records and registers in <i>pell-mell</i> order.

<p><b>Old, antique, ancient:</b>
<i>Old</i> means "time-honoured".
<i>Antique</i> means "time-honoured, but not desirable".
Its noun form is <i>antiquity</i>. <i>Ancient</i> means
"time-honoured, and also desirable and respectable". 

<p class=example><i>Old</i> man, <i>old</i> system, <i>old</i> English.
<br><i>Antique</i> habits.
<br>Sanskrit is an <i>ancient</i> language.

<p><b>Little progress, a little progress,
the little progress:</b> <i>Little progress</i>
means "no progress", for example,
"The patient has made <i>little progress</i>,"
meaning "the patient has made no progress." <i>A
 little progress</i> means "some progress".
 <i>The little progress</i> means "the progress"
 particularized, but negative.<sup><a name=t15.1 href=#15.1>1</a></sup>
 
<p><b>Many and many a:</b> <i>Many</i> means (1)
"more than two", (2) "not easy to count"
(just like the word <i>score</i>, which has
two meanings: "twenty" and "many").
<i>Many a</i> is plural in use, but the
[associated] verb is used in the singular. 

<p class=example><i>Many</i> boys are going to school.

<p class=example>There's <i>many</i> a slip
betwixt the cup and the lip.

<p class=example><i>Many a</i> youth and <i>many a</i> maid,<br>
Dancing 'neath the greenwood shade.

<p><b>Corporal and corporeal:</b> <i>Corporal</i> is the
Latin adjective for "body".  In English
the adjective is "bodily." <i>Corporeal</i>
is also an adjective for "body", but
it denotes something not within physical inference.

<p class=example>The difficulty is one of <i>corporal</i> nature.
<br>The cuckoo is not a <i>corporeal</i> bird,
it is a heavenly entity.<sup><a name=t15.2 href=#15.2>2</a></sup>

<p><b>Aquatic and aqueous:</b> <i>Aquatic</i> is a Latin
adjective  for <i>aqua</i> ("water").
<i>Aqueous</i> is also a Latin adjective for
<i>aqua</i> ("water"), used in the sense of
"having the characteristics of <i>aqua</i>".

<p class=example>A fish is an <i>aquatic</i> animal.
<br>A thorough laboratory test should be
done through <i>aqueous</i> experiment.

<p><b>Marine and maritime:</b> <i>Marine</i> is a Latin
adjective for "sea". <i>Maritime</i> is also a
Latin adjective for "sea", but it is
used when the sea does not come within
the scope of inference.  

<p class=example>He is a student of the <i>Marine</i> Engineering College.
<br>South Bengal has a <i>maritime</i> climate.

<p><b>Financial, economic, pecuniary, fiscal,
monetary, exchequer:</b> <i>Financial</i>: "concerning
money matters". <i>Economic</i>: "concerning money
matters so far as receipt and expenditure
are concerned". <i>Pecuniary</i>: "concerning
money matters so far as the capacity to
spend is concerned". <i>Fiscal</i>: "concerning
money matters so far as the financial
matters of government are concerned".
<i>Monetary</i>: "concerning money matters"
(t&#x301;a&#x301;ka&#x301;paysa&#x301;, <span
class=Bengali>&#x099F;&#X09BE;&#x0995;&#x09BE;&#x09AA;&#x09DF;&#x09B8;&#x09BE;</span><sup><a
name=t15.3 href=#15.3>3</a></sup>).
<i>Exchequer</i>: "concerning the government treasury".

<p><b>Native:</b> Its etymological meaning is
"indigenous". But the British colonizers
disdainfully called the local Indians and
Africans "natives", and thus it acquired
a derogatory meaning.

<p><b>Use and usage:</b> <i>Use</i> means "utilization in vogue".
<i>Usage</i>: When a system is followed for a long
period, it is called <i>usage</i>.

<p class=example>The chewing of betel is not in <i>use</i> in Iran now.
<p>The <i>usage</i> of applying vermilion dates from
the Austric period.

<p><b>One another and each other:</b> When something
regarding more than two parties is concerned,
we are to use <i>one another</i>.When the same
concerns two parties, we are to use <i>each other</i>.

<p class=example>Ram, Shyam and Jadu are fighting with <i>one another</i>.
<br>Ram and Shyam are feeding <i>each other</i>.

<p><b>Punishment, atonement and disciplinary
action:</b> <i>Punishment:</i> When someone does
something wrong or commits a crime, he
or she gets punishment from the court of law.
<i>Atonement</i>: When someone does something wrong
from a moral or ethical viewpoint, he or
she receives self-punishment. One word for
"self-punishment", of Latin derivation,
is <i>atonement</i>. <i>Disciplinary action:</i> When
someone gets punishment for unsatisfactory
organizational outturn, it is called
<i>disciplinary action</i>.

<p><b>Childish and childlike:</b> <i>Childish</i> means
"like a child" in a derogatory (negative)
sense, for example, <i>childish behaviour</i>.
<i>Childlike</i> means "like a child" in the
positive sense, for example, <i>childlike
simplicity</i>.

<p><b>Rural and rustic:</b> <i>Rural</i> means "pertaining
to the countryside or village". It is used
in a positive sense. <i>Rustic</i> is used in a
negative sense. For instance, we say <i>rural
banks</i>, but <i>rustic persons</i>. The Bengali term
for <i>rural</i> is <i>gra&#x301;mya</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0997;&#x09CD;&#x09B0;&#x09BE;&#x09AE;&#x09CD;&#x09AF;</span>), and
for <i>rustic</i>, <i>gen&#x32D;yo</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0997;&#x09C7;&#x0981;&#x09DF;&#x09CB;</span>).

<p><b>Appreciation and depreciation:</b> <i>Appreciation</i>
[taking the word in its original sense] means
"giving recognition or the proper price or
the announced price". [It came to mean "an
increase in price" as well.]  <i>Depreciation</i>:
When a negative [movement in ] price is
announced, it is <i>depreciation</i>.
<i>Depreciation</i> is the opposite of
<i>appreciation</i>.

<p><b>Irregular account/balance and inefficient account/balance:</b>
<i>Irregular account/balance:</i> When an amount is
spent in an irregular way and recorded on an
irregular form, it is called an <i>irregular account</i>.
Suppose Rs. 100 is to be spent, but the amount
spent is Rs. 120. Then the amount of Rs. 20
is an <i>irregular balance</i>. This expenditure
should not have been made, since one had no
authority to do so.

<p>Expenditure which should not have taken place
is called <i>irregular expenditure</i>.

<p><i>Inefficient account/balance:</i> A balance in the
account which cannot be closed in a recognized
way with the sanction of competent authorities
is called an <i>inefficient account/balance</i>.
For a proper closure of such a balance an
order for write-off is to be obtained from
the higher authorities. 

<p><b>Abound with and abound in:</b> Regarding a container,
<i>abound in</i> and <i>abound with</i> may both be used;
whereas regarding the contained, only <i>abound in</i> may be used.

<p class=example>Snakes <i>abound in</i> Thailand.
<br>Thailand <i>abounds in</i> / <i>abounds with</i> snakes.

<p><b>Historical truth and universal truth:</b> <i>Historical
truth</i> means a fact recorded in history, either
in black and white or as a part of common
people's parley, for example, "
Bengal is famous for mulberry silk." 
This fact is recorded in history, but in future
Bengal may or may not remain famous for mulberry
silk. <i>Universal truth</i> means a truth that remains
unassailed by historical changes, for example,
"Honesty is the best policy."

<p><b>Bring and fetch:</b> There is a basic difference
in use between <i>bring</i> and <i>fetch</i>. Suppose
someone is standing at a distance. If one asks
that person to bring water, the verb <i>bring</i> should
be used. But when someone is standing nearby and
one asks that person to go and bring water, then
the verb <i>fetch</i> should be used. As such, the verb
<i>fetch</i> means to "go and bring". In India, in many
cases, there is confusion between <i>bring</i> and <i>fetch</i>.
Students hardly learn the correct use of <i>fetch</i>.
Teachers should pay a little more attention
to the proper use of <i>fetch</i>.

<p><b>Compare with and compare to:</b> When the comparison
shows similarity amongst different objects,
the preposition <i>with</i> is used after <i>compare</i>.
When dissimilarity is shown amongst different
entities, that is, when contrast is shown,
the preposition <i>to</i> is used after <i>compare</i>.

<p class=example>A human may be <i>compared with</i>
a tailless ape.  
<br>The Vindhya Mountains cannot be <i>compared
to</i> Lake Sharashanka.

<p>Here the Vindhya Mountains have been contrasted
with Lake Sharashanka.

<p><b>Tumbler and glass:</b> Is it correct to say,
"Bring me a glass of water"? The answer is no:
<i>tumbler</i> is the proper word for a "glass".
When a tumbler is made of glass, it is called
a <i>glass tumbler</i>. Thus when we say,
"Bring me a glass of water," it is wrong.
We should say, "Bring me a <i>tumbler</i> of water."
In old English, <i>tumbler</i> was always used in
this sense, but in modern English, <i>glass</i> is
fast replacing the word <i>tumbler</i>.

<p><b>You and thou:</b> About six hundred years ago the
word <i>thou</i> was used in place of <i>you</i> (singular)
in English. But it is no longer used.
Now the word <i>you</i> (coming from the French
word <i>vous</i>) is used in place of <i>thou</i> (coming
from the French word <i>tu</i>). As in French <i>tu</i> is
fast being replaced by <i>vous</i>, in modern English,
<i>thou</i> has become almost obsolete, and now it
is restricted to addressing God only.

<p>The second-person singular verbal form
(<i>thou hast</i>) was made by adding one -<i>t</i> after
the verb concerned[, in old English].
The -<i>th</i> added after the verb [to form the
third-person singular] was [also] the usage
of old English: for example, <i>seeth</i>, <i>goeth</i>.

<p><b>Quarter and quarters:</b> <i>Quarter</i> means one-fourth.
<i>Quarters</i> means a specified locality.
Nowadays the word <i>quarter</i> is also used to
denote a specified abode in a singular sense.
It is used in the sense of "residential quarters".

<p><b>Author and writer:</b> <i>Author</i> means "one who writes
books". We should not use the word <i>writer</i> in
the sense of "author". <i>Writer</i> means "clerk".
<i>Writers' Building</i><sup><a name=t15.4 href=#15.4>4</a></sup>
 means "a building of clerks".

<p><b>Marketing and shopping:</b> When someone goes to
a market for the purpose of selling, he or she
goes for <i>marketing</i>. When someone goes to place
for the purpose of purchasing, he or she goes for <i>shopping</i>.

<p><b>Taught and touched:</b> In old English, there
were two verbs: <i>touch</i> and <i>toutch</i>. <i>Touch</i> was
used where tactuality was involved, and <i>toutch</i>
was used in the sense of imparting knowledge
(its past-tense form was <i>toutched</i>). As the
words were very similar in pronunciation, and
there was a great possibility of confusion
[between] their present-tense forms [on the
one hand, and their past-tense forms on the other],
the verb toutch was changed into <i>teach</i> in the
present, and <i>taught</i> in the past.

<p><b>No other alternative: correct or incorrect?</b>
"There is <i>no other alternative</i>": This is
grammatically incorrect, as <i>alternative</i> means
"other way"; so <i>other alternative</i> means
"other other way", which suffers from the
defect of duality. The correct sentence
should be, "There is <i>no alternative</i>" or
"There is no <i>other way</i>."

<p><b>Put on and put off:</b> To <i>put on</i> means
"to start the work". To <i>put off</i> means to
"end the work" or "to extinguish". 

<p class=example><i>Put on</i> your shoes.
<br><i>Put off</i> your shirt.
<br><i>Put off</i> the light.

<p><b>Spare and spareable:</b>
<i>Spare</i> means "extra, additional".
Some people wrongly use the word <i>spareable</i> for <i>spare</i>.
<i>Spare</i> is both an adjective and a verb. One should
say "a <i>spare</i> pencil" and not "a <i>spareable</i> pencil".

<p><b>Similar and identical:</b> <i>Similar</i> means
"almost the same", whereas <i>identical</i>
means "exactly the same".

<p><b>Trinity and trio:</b> <i>Trio</i> means "a collection
of three different entities or objects"
whereas <i>trinity</i> means "one entity expressed
in three forms".

<p><b>Popular and populous:</b> <i>Popular</i> means "liked
very much by people".  <i>Populous</i> means "thickly peopled",
that is, "inhabited by a large number of people". 

<p class=example>C.R. Das was a <i>popular</i> leader.
<br>Tokyo is a <i>populous</i> city. (It means Tokyo
is  a thickly-peopled city &ndash; here <i>peopled</i>
is a rare verbal use of the word "people".)

<p><b>Industrious and industrial:</b> <i>Industrious</i>
 means "hard-working".  <i>Industrial</i> means
"of or belonging to industry".

<p class=example>Tom is a very <i>industrious</i> student.
<br>The country's <i>industrial</i> production
increased by 18% this year.

<p><b>Farm and firm:</b>
<i>Farm</i> is a place of agricultural
activity, whereas <i>firm</i> is a place of
industrial or commercial activity.

<p><b>Cannibal and carnivorous:</b> <i>Cannibal</i> means a
"human eating a human's flesh"; <i>carnivorous</i>
means "any living being living on flesh or meat".

<p><b>Wood and woods:</b> <i>Wood</i> means "any firewood".
<i>Woods</i> means "forest".

<p><b>Effect and effects:</b> <i>Effect</i> means "result".
<i>Effects</i> means "personal bag and baggage".

<p><b>Enquire and inquire:</b> Both have the same meaning,
but <i>inquire</i> was formerly used more than <i>enquire</i>;
the latter has acquired greater popularity
in recent times.

<p><b>Unsatisfactory and dissatisfactory:</b>
<i>Unsatisfactory</i> means "not satisfactory";
<i>dissatisfactory</i> means "that which was satisfactory
but is now removed from the sphere of satisfaction".<sup><a
name=t15.5 href=#15.5>5</a></sup>

<p><b>Contiguity and continuity:</b> Both words mean
"extension". <i>Contiguity</i> is used in the case
of land and <i>continuity</i> is used in the case of ideas.

<p class=example>Calcutta is in territorial <i>contiguity</i> with
Diamond Harbour.
<br>While concluding his speech on microvitum,
he added a few sentiences in <i>continuity</i> to
his original speech.

<p><b>Rudimental and fundamental:</b> <i>Rudimental</i> is the
adjective form of root, and <i>fundamental</i> is the
adjective form of <i>fundament</i> and of <i>fundamentum</i>.
<i>Fundament</i> means "base"; <i>fundamental</i> means "basic".

<p class=example>There is a <i>fundamental</i> difference between Prout and Marxism.
<br>He has no <i>rudimental</i> knowledge of spirituality.

<p><b>The three R's:</b>
<br>Q. What is the meaning of <b>the three R's</b>?
<br>A. <i>R</i>eading, '<i>r</i>iting and '<i>r</i>ithmetic.

<p class=chapter_title>STRUCTURAL FORMULA:<br>
SUFFIX AND PREFIX</p>

<p>There are certain ideas which activize verbs,
and there are also certain faculties which
modify verbs. The first one is called the
<i>activating idea,</i> and the second one is
called the <i>activated faculty</i>. In the case
of the first, the verb remains separate (
the verb is separate from the activating idea),
and in the case of the second the verb is
joined (the activated faculty is joined
to the verb).<sup><a name=t19.1 href=#19.1>1</a></sup>
Now the activating idea is called the prefix
("that which is fixed before" &ndash; <i>pre</i> means "before"),
and the activated faculty is called the <i>suffix</i>
("that which is fixed afterwards").


<p>In all the classical and organized languages
of the world there is a universal system of
creating new words with the help of prefix,
root verb and suffix, sometimes with only
the root verb and the suffix.

<p><b>Suffix</b>

<p>The word <i>suffix</i> is derived <i>sub</i> + <i>fix</i>.
<i>Sub</i> means "below" or "following" or "under":

	<TR><TD>marine</TD><TD><I>sub</I>marine</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<p><i>Suffix</i> means "that which comes after" &ndash;
after the root verb. For instance,
-<i>ion</i>, -<i>al</i>, -<i>ty</i>, etc.

<p class=example>donat<i>ion</i>, opt<i>ion</i>, recept<i>ion</i>
<br>withdraw<i>al</i>, renew<i>al</i>, reviv<i>al</i>, surviv<i>al</i>
<br>puri<i>ty</i>, hones<i>ty</i>, safe<i>ty</i>, securi<i>ty</i>

<p>In Sanskrit a suffix is called <i>pratyaya</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09AA;&#x09CD;&#x09B0;&#x09A4;&#x09CD;&#x09AF;&#x09DF;</span>),
which [literally] means "faith".
(A synonymous Sanskrit term is <i>vishva&#x301;sa,</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09AC;&#x09BF;&#x09B6;&#x09CD;&#x09AC;&#x09BE;&#x09B8;</span>)<sup><a
name=t19.2 href=#19.2>2</a></sup>
There are approximately
722 suffixes in Sanskrit. Some instances:
<i>tva&#x301;c</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09A4;&#x09CD;&#x09AC;&#x099A;&#x09CD;</span>),
<i>lyap</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B2;&#x09CD;&#x09AF;&#x09AA;&#x09CD;</span>),
<i>lyu&#x301;t</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B2;&#x09CD;&#x09AF;&#x09C1;&#x099F;&#x09CD; </span>),
<i>ghain&#x32D;</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x0998;&#x099E;&#x09CD;</span>),
<i>kta</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x0995;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;</span>), etc.

<p>In Sanskrit, <i>sic</i> or <i>sin&#x32D;c</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;&#x09BF;&#x099A;&#x09CD;</span>
or <span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;&#x09BF;&#x099E;&#x09CD;&#x099A;&#x09CD;</span>)
means to <i>water</i>, to <i>irrigate</i>, to <i>sprinkle</i>.
Now if the noun-suffix -<i>lyut&#x301;</i> is added to the
verb <i>sic</i>, we get the word <i>secana</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;&#x09C7;&#x099A;&#x09A8;</span>
 &ndash; <i>sic</i> + <i>lyut&#x301;</i>).
Similarly if another noun-suffix, -<i>ghain&#x32D;</i>, is
added to <i>sic</i>, we get <i>seka</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;&#x09C7;&#x0995;</span>)
or
seca (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;&#x09C7;&#x099A;</span>)
(as in <i>abhis&#x301;eka,</i> <span class=Bengali>&#x0985;&#x09AD;&#x09BF;&#x09B7;&#x09C7;&#x0995;</span>,
or <i>jalaseca,</i>
<span class=Bengali>&#x099C;&#x09B2;&#x09B7;&#x09C7;&#x099A;</span>).
If the suffix -<i>kta</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0995;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;</span>)
is added to the verb <i>sic</i> we get <i>sikta</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;&#x09BF;&#x0995;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;</span>
 &ndash; "irrigated", "watered", "sprinkled").

<p class=example><i>Ni</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09A8;&#x09BF;</span>)
 &ndash; <i>sic</i> + <i>kta</i> = <i>nis&#x301;ikta</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09A8;&#x09BF;&#x09B7;&#x09BF;&#x0995;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;</span>),
<i>nisikta</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09A8;&#x09BF;&#x09B8;&#x09BF;&#x0995;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;</span>).
(This means "infused".)
<i>Upa</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x0989;&#x09AA;</span>)
 &ndash; <i>sic</i> + <i>lyut&#x301;</i> = <i>upasecana</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0989;&#x09AA;&#x09B8;&#x09C7;&#x099A;&#x09A8;</span>).
This has two meanings: "sprinkling" and "clarified butter".
<i>Pari</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AA;&#x09B0;&#x09BF;</span>)
 &ndash; <i>sic</i> + <i>kta</i> = <i>parisikta</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09AA;&#x09B0;&#x09BF;&#x09B8;&#x09BF;&#x0995;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;</span>).
This means "well-irrigated".

<p>Every object in this creation has vibration,
form and  colour. Now a particular colour, say,
white, emanating from an object produces a kind
of vibration in the mind somewhat like
<i>dhav-dhav-dhav,</i> and thus the Sanskrit verb
<i>dhav</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09A7;&#x09AC;</span>)
is created. Now with the addition of suffixes,
we get new words: <i>dhav</i> + <i>ac</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0985;&#x099A;&#x09CD;</span>) + <i>la&#x301;</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09B2;&#x09BE;</span>) + <i>d&#x301;a</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09A1;</span>) = <i>dhavala</i> ("white").
Similarly, the red colour produces in the mind
a kind of vibration somewhat like <i>t&#x301;ak-t&#x301;ak-t&#x301;ak</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x099F;&#x0995;</span>-<span class=Bengali>&#x099F;&#x0995;</span>-<span class=Bengali>&#x099F;&#x0995;</span>), and thus we get the word
<i>t&#x301;akt&#x301;ake la&#x301;l</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x099F;&#x0995;&#x099F;&#x0995;&#x09C7; &#x09B2;&#x09BE;&#x09B2;</span>).
The verbal perception becomes a word.

<p>The moon creates a soothing feeling in the mind,
and its verbal perception is called <i>cand</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x099A;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A6;</span>),
and the  verbal form concerned
is <i>candati</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x099A;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A6;&#x09A4;&#x09BF;</span>
 &ndash; "soothing").
Similarly, the verbal perception [associated with]
moving at higher altitudes is called <i>ind</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0987;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A6;&#x09CD;</span>)
and the verbal form concerned is <i>indati</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0987;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A6;&#x09A4;&#x09BF;</span>),
<i>indatah</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x0987;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A6;&#x09A4;&#x0983;</span>),
<i>indanti</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x0987;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A6;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;&#x09BF;</span>).<sup><a
name=t19.3 href=#19.3>3</a></sup>

Thus we get the words <i>candra</i>
(<i>cand</i> + <i>rak,</i> <span class=Bengali>&#x09B0;&#x0995;</span>),
<i>indra</i> (<i>ind</i> + <i>rak</i>).
<i>Indra</i> means "lofty", <i>indra</i> means "great",
<i>indra</i> means "very tall and high", and hence
it also means the <i>shal</i> tree, <i>indra</i> also means
a chief or a king. That is why in mythology,
the king of the gods is called "Devara'ja Indra".
<i>Ind</i> + <i>un</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x0989;&#x09A8;</span>)
 = <i>Indu</i>; <i>Indu</i> means the moon,
 "the one that moves at higher altitudes".


<p><b>Prefix</b>

The word <i>prefix</i> is derived <i>pre</i> + <i>fix</i>.
<i>Pre</i> means "before". <i>Prefix</i> means "the idea which
comes before the root [word]". In Sanskrit a <i>prefix</i>
is called an <i>upasarga</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0989;&#x09AA;&#x09B8;&#x09B0;&#x09CD;&#x0997;</span>).<sup><a
name=t19.4 href=#19.4>4</a></sup>
In Sanskrit there is a fixed number of twenty prefixes:
<i>pra</i>, <i>para&#x301;</i>, <i>apa</i>, <i>sam</i>, <i>anu</i>, <i>ava</i>,
<i>nir</i>, <i>dur</i>, <i>abhi</i>, <i>vi</i>, <i>adhi</i>, <i>su</i>, <i>ut</i>,
<i>ati</i>, <i>ni</i>, <i>prati</i>, <i>pari</i>, <i>upa</i>, <i>a&#x301;un</i>.
English also has a good number of prefixes.

<p>Now, many words can be formed adding prefixes
to root verbs. Some instances [in the case of
the Latin <i>ceive</i>]:

<p><b>Receive</b>: <i>Ceive</i> is a Latin root verb.
<i>Ceive</i> means "to exchange, to get something in return".
Now if the verb <i>ceive</i> is preceded by the prefix <i>re</i>-,
we get the word <i>receive</i> which means to "get" (e.g.,
"I <i>received</i> your letter dated . . .") Its noun form is <i>receipt</i>.

<p><b>Deceive</b>: Similarly, if <i>ceive</i> is preceded by the
prefix <i>de</i>-, we get the word <i>deceive</i> which means
to "take away by cheating". Its noun <i>form</i> is
<i>deceit</i> (opposite form of <i>receipt</i>).

<p><b>Conceive</b>: <i>Conceive</i>
means to "accept something
in the mind, form an idea in the mind".
Its noun form is <i>concept</i>. It has another meaning
also: to [come to] be in a family way [<i>conceive</i> a child].
Its noun form is <i>conception</i>.

<p><b>Perceive</b>: The verb <i>perceive</i> means to "subjectivize
something objective". This process of subjectivization
of something objective is done with the help of
five sensory organs as also the afferent or sensory
nerves. Its noun form is <i>perception</i>.

<p>In this connection one should pay particular
attention to the spelling of words having the
vowels <i>i</i> and <i>e</i>. The general usage of spelling
in such cases is that <i>i</i> precedes <i>e</i>, that is,
<i>e</i> comes after <i>i</i>, because the pronunciation of <i>i</i>
is more emphatic than that of <i>e</i>.<sup><a
name=t19.5 href=#19.5>5</a></sup>
For instance:
<i>chief</i>, <i>thief</i>, <i>brief</i>,
<i>friend</i>, <i>tied</i>, <i>tried</i>, <i>fried</i>.
But there are a few exceptions also in this regard,
such as the verb <i>ceive</i> and its noun form <i>ceipt</i>:
<i>receive</i>, <i>deceive</i>, <i>perceive</i>, <i>conceive</i>, and their
noun forms; and also some words such as <i>seizure</i>,
<i>leisure</i>,<sup><a name=t19.6 href=#19.6>6</a></sup>
<i>counterfeit</i>.<sup><a name=t19.7 href=#19.7>7</a></sup>


<p>[An instance with another English root verb:]

<p><b>Infuse</b>: To <i>fuse</i> means "to mix together, to blend".
When the verb <i>fuse</i> is prefixed by <i>in</i>-, we get the
word <i>infuse</i>. <i>Likewise</i>, <i>refuse</i>,
<i>confuse</i>, <i>profuse</i>,
<i>suffuse</i>, <i>defuse</i>, etc.

<p>[An instance in Sanskrit:]

<p>The root verb <i>bha</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AD;</span>) means
"to illumine", "to enlighten".
<i>Bha&#x301;</i> + <i>kta</i> = <i>bha&#x301;ta</i>,
which means "enlightened, illumined".
If the Sanskrit prefix <i>pra</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09AA;&#x09CD;&#x09B0;</span>)
comes before <i>bha&#x301;ta</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AD;&#x09BE;&#x09A4;</span>),
we get the word <i>prabha&#x301;ta</i>, which means
"enlightened in a proper way or in a progressive way".

<p><b>Further Use of Suffixes and Prefixes</b>

<p><b>Dislocate:</b> In English [through the use
of suffixes and prefixes] we get a large number
of verbs from noun-words. For instance, there
is a Latin root word <i>locus</i>. <i>Locus</i> means "place".
When someone or something is removed or transferred
from one place to another, we say "He/she/it has
been <i>dislocated</i>," that is, the location arrangement
has been deranged. <i>Local train</i>
means a train which has been plying within a
fixed or restricted periphery.

<p><b>Embodiment</b>: In the Anglo-Saxon tongue, there
was a word <i>board</i> [meaning "border"].
It was pronounced "boad" (<i>r</i> remained mute).
<i>Board</i> was finally transmuted [as it was pronounced]
into <i>boad</i> (in Latin, <i>corpor</i><sup><a
name=t19.8 href=#19.8>8</a></sup>); and "the object
concerning <i>boad</i>" is <i>body</i>. <i>Body</i> means "something
having borders or boundary lines".
When something abstract in relation to the
physical is concerned, the prefix <i>em</i>- or <i>en</i>-
is added, and the result is <i>embodiment</i>.
It means "assuming the characteristics of something".
 
<p>In the case of an abstract idea, we sometimes
use the word <i>personified</i>. For instance, when we
want to explain the glamour of purity, we say,
"He is purity <i>personified</i>." That is, the purity
has the status of a person. Likewise we say,
"He is honesty <i>personified</i>," "He is knowledge
<i>personified</i>," "He is bliss <i>personified</i>."
In all such cases we can also say, "He is an
<i>embodiment</i> of honesty," "He is an <i>embodiment</i>
of knowledge," "He is an <i>embodiment</i> of bliss,"
etc.<sup><a name=t19.9 href=#19.9>9</a></sup>

<p><b>Enriched:</b> When someone becomes the owner of
something or becomes rich by possessing something
we say <i>enriched</i>. For instance, "The literary
works of Rabindranath Tagore <i>enriched</i> the Bengali language." Likewise:

<p>T<b>he prefixes <i>a</i>- and <i>o</i>- before causatives:</b>
In the case of [root words, especially] causatives,
prefixed by <i>a</i> or <i>o</i>, the succeeding consonant
is doubled.<sup><a href=#19.B name=t19.B>*</a></sup>
 For instance:

<p class=table><TABLE width=70%>
<TR><TD>grand</TD><TD>aggrandize (to make something grand)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>count</TD><TD>account (to make or render reckoning, as of funds received and paid out)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>[credit]</TD><TD>accredit (to ascribe or attribute credit)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>cult</TD><TD>occult [that which is earned though cult]</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<p>But if it is not a light vowel (<i>a</i> or <i>o</i>),
the succeeding consonant is not doubled.
For example, <i>semble</i> after <i>a</i>- becomes <i>assemble</i>;
<i>semble</i> after <i>re</i>- becomes <i>resemble</i> (one <i>s</i>).

<p class=chapter_title>THE ORIGIN OF A FEW WORDS<sup><a
href=#20.1 name=t20.1>1</a></sup></p>

<p><b>God:</b> God is a combination of three letters:
<i>g</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>d</i>. <i>G</i> stands for "generator", <i>o</i> for
"operator" and <i>d</i> for "destructor"<sup>
<a href=#20.2 name=t20.2>2</a></sup>

<p><b>Jeep:</b> Originally this vehicle was called
a <i>general-purpose car</i> (<i>G.P. car</i> for short).
Later on it became a <i>G.P.,</i> and finally became known as a <i>jeep</i>.

<p><i>OK</i>: Once there was a major battle
on American soil. Most of the soldiers were
Spanish-speaking. Not being well-acquainted
with English, in expressing that they were
in good condition they wrote <i>oll korrect</i> instead
of <i>all correct</i>. <i>OK</i> is the shortened form of <b>oll korrect</b>.

<p><b>News:</b> News is a combination of four letters:
<i>n,e,w,</i> and <i>s</i>: signifying "that which
comes from four directions &ndash; north, east, west and south".

<p><b>Lichi and peach:</b> The lichi and the peach
were originally Chinese wild fruits. More palatable
varieties were developed by the Chinese horticulturalists,
Mr. Li Chi and Mr. Pee Si, after whom the fruits were named.

<p><b>Owl and mango:</b> A certain English gentleman
called Mr. Ricecurry came to India as an employee of
the East India Company. He and his wife were responsible
for the adoption of a number of words into the English vocabulary.

<p>It is said that one night Mrs. Ricecurry heard the
hooting of owls for the first time. Somewhat distressed,
she exclaimed, "How horrible! How horrible!"
a number of times and then asked her maidservant,
"Was that the growl of a Royal Bengal tiger?"
"No, madame," she replied, "that was the hooting
of an <i>ullu</i>." [<i>Ullu</i> is the Urdu word for "owl".]
This word was mispronounced by Mrs. Ricecurry
and found its way into the English language as <i>owl</i>.

<p>One day a mango seller passed by the Ricecurry
residence. Mrs. Ricecurry could not resist the
temptation of buying the juicy fruit.
She immediately called her [servant] and said,
"Man, go! Go and call the fruit-seller!"
The [servant] thought that his mistress was
calling the fruit itself <i>mango</i>, and whenever
the fruit-seller would come by would himself
shout, "Mango! Mango!" Since then <i>mango</i> has
been the recognized English [term for] the
juicy Indian fruit.<sup><a href=#20.3 name=t20.3>3</a></sup>

In some cases, the illustrative origin. &ndash;Eds.

<p class=footnote>(<a name=20.2 href=#t20.2>2</a>)
The Supreme  Entity is composed of three forces:
the force that creates, or <i>generates,</i> the expressed
universe out of the unexpressed Supreme Consciousness;
the force that preserves and <i>operates</i> the universe;
and the force that "<i>destroys</i>" the finite entities
of the universe, i.e., that dissolves them back
into formless consciousness. These three forces
are often personified for figurative purposes. &ndash;Eds.

<p class=footnote>(<a name=20.3 href=#t20.3>3</a>)
The above passages on <i>owl</i> and <i>mango</i> are
taken from "Pravacan 6" ("Speech 6") of
the author's  <i>Varn&#x301;a Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i> ("The Science of Letters"),
1984. In that book the author prefaced these
accounts with the remark, "Many people think
that the English word <i>mango</i> came from the
Tamil <i>ma&#x301;nga&#x301;</i>. But that is not the case.
In the Tagalog language of the Philippines
a mango is also called <i>ma&#x301;nga&#x301;</i>, but that
does not mean that the English <i>mango</i>
came from that word. The Philippines
had no influence on the English language." &ndash;Eds.

<p class=chapter_title>GENERAL KNOWLEDGE ON COMPOSITION<sup><a
href=#21.1 name=t21.1>1</a></sup></p>

<p><b>Passage</b>: Burdwan is an ancient city of Bengal.
It is a district headquarters and university city.
It is on the River Damodara. There is a road-bridge
over the river named Krs&#x301;ak Setu
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0995;&#x09C3;&#x09B7;&#x0995;
&#x09B8;&#x09C7;&#x09A4;&#x09C1;</span>).
(<i>Krs&#x301;aka</i> [farmer] is grammatically incorrect.
It should be <i>kars&#x301;aka,</i>
<span class=Bengali>&#x0995;&#x09B0;&#x09CD;&#x09B7;&#x0995;</span>)

<p>There are five sub-divisions in Burdwan District.
Many great persons were born in this district.

<p><b>General Knowledge:</b> <i>Burdwan</i> comes from the Sanskrit
word <i>Vardhama&#x301;na</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09AC;&#x09B0;&#x09CD;&#x09A7;&#x09AE;&#x09BE;&#x09A8;</span>).
It is a prehistoric town,
in fact, the oldest town in the world, and at the same
time the capital of the oldest land of civilization
&ndash; Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.

<p><b>Capital</b>: <i>Capital</i> means "concerning the <i>capita,</i> or head".
Burdwan is as important as the head for the land of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.

<p><b>Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h:</b> The land was known as
<i>Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09B0;&#x09BE;&#x09DD;</span>)
because of its laterite, or red, soil.<sup><a
href=#21.2 name=t21.2>2</a></sup>

<p><b>Burdwan</b>: Burdwan is a city, as its population
is more than one hundred thousand. Its original
name was A&#x301;stikanagar
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0986;&#x09B8;&#x09CD;&#x09A4;&#x09BF;&#x0995;&#x09A8;&#x0997;&#x09B0;</span>),
which means "a town that pays respect to God and credence to Providence".
Later on the name became Atthinagara in the Pra&#x301;krta language.
Vardhama&#x301;na Maha&#x301;viira, the propounder of the Jainistic cult,
came to Burdwan and preached his gospels for a period of
seven years. Thereafter the name of the city was
changed to Vardhama&#x301;na.

<p>The land of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is a part of Bengal.
"Bengal" is also a time-honoured name. 

<p>Burdwan is a district [as well as a city within the district].
In the pre-Pathan period, a district was known as a bhukti
(a bhukti is just like a county in Britain).
In the Pathan and Mughal periods, the word <i>zilla</i> was
substituted for the word <i>bhukti</i>. In the British period,
a <i>zilla</i> became known in English as a "district".
There are five sub-divisions in Burdwan District.<sup><a
href=#21.3 name=t21.3>3</a></sup>


<p>Burdwan is situated on the north bank of the River Damodara.
The Damodara is the biggest river in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. It comes from
the Ramgarh Hills, and its confluence with the Ganga [Ganges]
is on the border between Howrah and 24 Parganas Districts.
(<i>Da&#x301;ma</i> (<span class=Bengali>&#x09A6;&#x09BE;&#x09AE;</span>)
means "fire". <i>Udara</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0989;&#x09A6;&#x09B0;</span>)
means "belly".
<i>Da&#x301;modara</i> means "where fire is burning in belly").
The bed of the Damodara is rich in coal deposits.
That is why such a name has been given to the river.

<p><b>Krs&#x301;aka:</b> The word
<i>krs&#x301;aka</i> is grammatically incorrect because,
if the suffix <i>-n&#x301;ak</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09A3;&#x0995;&#x09CD;</span>)
or the suffix <i>-kan</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0995;&#x09A8;&#x09CD;</span>)
is added to the root verb <i>krs&#x301;</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0995;&#x09C3;&#x09B7;&#x09CD;</span>),
the derivatory word should be <i>kars&#x301;aka,</i>
as in <i>a&#x301;kars&#x301;aka</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x0986;&#x0995;&#x09B0;&#x09CD;&#x09B7;&#x0995;</span>),
<i>vikars&#x301;aka</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09AC;&#x09BF;&#x0995;&#x09B0;&#x09CD;&#x09B7;&#x0995;</span>),
<i>sam&#x301;kars&#x301;aka</i>
(<span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;&#x0982;&#x0995;&#x09B0;&#x09CD;&#x09B7;&#x0995;</span>),
 etc.

<p>As the land is an ancient one, many great personalities were born there.
The names of some of those personalities are given below:

<p><b>Maqbul</b><sup><a href=#22.1 name=t22.1>1</a></sup>


<p>Maqbul is a very well-behaved boy. His qualities
have not got any comparison. He prepares his lessons attentively.
No student stands on a par with him in studies. His father
cultivates paddy and jute. He assists his father in farming.
Once he came to Calcutta from Chandpur with his maternal uncle.
Coming to Calcutta he ate jackfruit pickle and <i>rasama&#x301;la&#x301;i</i>
[a sweet]. He was very happy to see Calcutta Zoo.
There he drew pictures of many birds and animals. All
admired his behaviour. All the people of the town felt proud
of him. Everyone expects that he will render service to the
world when he grows up.

<p><b>The Perils of Intoxication</b><sup><a
href=#22.2 name=t22.2>2</a></sup>


<p>A person who loses his or her senses due to excessive
drink and starts shouting, or talking incoherently; or
starts imagining that his or her cot is flying in the
air; or starts thinking that, seated on a throne, he or
she is eating <i>pa&#x301;t&#x301;isa&#x301;pt&#x301;a&#x301;</i>,<sup><a
href=#22.3 name=t22.3>3</a></sup> [meanwhile] wallowing
in the filth of a drain; is called <i>kosha&#x301;takin</i>
[or "drunkard"]. There are many popular tales about
this type of drunkard.


<p align=center>***************</p>

Once a few drunkards were sauntering along the
road towards Krishnanagar railway station from
Gori at midnight. Some policemen appeared all
of a sudden. The drunkards, after deliberating
how to escape, stood in a line along the drain beside the road. 

<p>The policemen came up and shook them, asking,
"Why are you loitering here so late at night?" 

They replied, "Why are you disturbing us, young men?
We are innocent creatures. Are you blind? Can't you see,
we are lampposts! We never meddle in anyone's affairs.
Can't you see the lights shining above our heads?" (
The drunkards were holding torches over their heads.)

<p align=center>***************</p>

<p>Once several drunkards were ambling along the
road, mumbling all the while. A few policemen
appeared. The drunkards muttered among themselves,
"If we talk here the police will think we are drunkards . . .
if we discuss <i>nuchi, puri, rasagolla&#x301; and sandesha</i> [sweets],
they will think that we are returning from a feast.
If we keep silent, they will conclude that we're
going to practise meditation in the cave of a hill.
So we'd better keep quiet. If we discuss <i>nuchi,
puri,</i> and so on, the police may ask, 'Where was
the feast you attended?' It'll be rather difficult
for us to reply to this question. So it's advisable
to keep silent. If we say we're going to meditate
in the cave, the police, out of reverence for us,
may spare us undisturbed."

<p>So all of them remained silent. After a short
while however, Rambabu, drunkard number one,
said loudly, "Hey, hush! Keep quiet."

<p>Then drunkard number two said more loudly,
"Hey, shhh! No talk."

<p>Then drunkard number three raised his voice and
shouted still more loudly, "Hey, hush! No shouting."

<p>Drunkard number four raised his voice still higher
and bellowed in a gruff voice, "Hey, hush! Don't talk."

<p>And finally with the sound of "Keep quiet," "No talk",
"No shouting", the noise was almost like that of a fish market.
Hearing this commotion the police came running to the spot.
What happened thereafter we don't know &ndash;
that only the drunkards can say!

<p align=center>***************</p>

<p>I heard that once a few drunkards were returning home
at midnight after enjoying a nocturnal drink. One of
them fell into a well. The rest of them got quite worried.
They became inwardly restless to render some social service,
following the noble example of Occidental people. They held
one round of deliberation among themselves.

<p>"Here is indeed a golden opportunity for social service,"
 they said. "Last year we had a slight opportunity to
 do some social service at Svarup-ganjaghat on the occasion
 of Churamani Yoga. While availing the opportunity we
 suffered from a severe lumbar pain which is still persisting."

<p>How it happened was that once [these] five drunkards
went to attend the relief camp at Svarupganjaghat.
But as ill luck would have it, not a single person
was drown[ing] in the river whom they could rescue.
There was not the least scope for social service.
Not a single child was missing, so they did not get
any scope to announce over the microphone,
"Gobar (Cow-Dung) Babu, your son, Bhondar (Sea Lion)
is now in our camp. Please come and take him."

<p>Now they were desperate to do something. They noticed
a seven-year-old girl facing the ghat and eating a
potato chop.<sup><a href=#22.4 name=t22.4>4</a></sup>
They went to the girl and asked her, "Little girl,
why are you standing here alone, staring at the ghat?
Are you lost?"

<p>"Lost! I'm not lost," she replied.

<p>The drunkards said, "Oh yes, you are certainly lost."

<p>"Look sirs, I am eating a freshly-fried potato chop.
If you want to eat some, give me money and I will
purchase a few pieces for you also," said the little girl.

<p>They said, "No, no, we don't eat potato chops by
themselves. We eat potato chops as an appetizer before
and after a drink. We wouldn't relish a plain chop brought by you."

<p>"My little girl, where are your golden bangles?
Are they lost? Have they been stolen?" one of them asked her.

<p>The girl replied, "I never had any bangles on my wrists."

<p>"Then where is your nosering?" they asked.

<p>"My nose was never pierced. How can I wear a
nosering?" replied the girl.

<p>They said, "Then we are convinced that you are
really lost."

<p>The girl looked towards the ghat and started
shrieking, "Auntie dear, auntie dear, come quick.
These strangers are speaking all sorts of nonsense to me."

<p>Her paternal aunt had just finished her bath,
and, having placed a folded wet towel on her head,
was bargaining for a feather duster in front of a
broom shop. The shouting of her niece caught her
attention. She immediately picked up a coconut
broom and started rushing to where her niece was
standing, shouting all the while, "Who are you
wretches, trying to kidnap my dear niece?
I am Jagadamba the
Bamni,<sup><a href=#22.5 name=t22.5>5</a></sup>
of Amghata Village. Who in the world . . .
in India . . . in Nadia District does not know me!
All the sinners, all the wretches, and all the
cunning fellows prostrate before me when they
see me in public, but in private they call me
all kinds of names &ndash; louse, shark, and so on.
Today either you will be finished or I'll
be finished. I'll give you such a thorough
thrashing that you will forget the names of
fourteen times two equal to fifty-two
generations of your ancestors. I'll clean
all the poison from your brains."


<p>Then the aunt began to thrash them mercilessly
with the broom &ndash; <i>sapa&#x301;sap-jhapa&#x301;jhap-dama&#x301;dam</i>
came the sound. After receiving a good
drubbing they took to their heels.

<p>These same people, after a long time,
became overjoyed to see [the] drunkard
falling into a well at night. Finally,
they thought, they had been given an
opportunity to do some social service.
They felt inwardly restless to utilize
the opportunity for a humanitarian cause.

<p>"Let's hold a press conference today,"
one of them suggested.

<p>"No, let's first issue a press release today,"
another said. "Let's first rescue him from the
well and then we can conveniently hold a big
press conference."

<p>The third one proposed, "First ascertain
whether he is dead or still alive. It'll be
better if he is dead."

<p>All of them agreed. "That's right, that's right.
It is the best proposal. Even a learned judge
would admit that," they said.

<p>Then all of them gathered around the well and
announced, "Hello, Bhonda, we are here to rescue you.
First tell us whether you are alive or dead.
If you are dead, we'll immediately go to your
house and convey the news to your family, and we
will hoist you up with the help of the ropes and
carry your dead body to the cremation ground.
If you say that you are still alive we'll inform
the hospital authorities. They will send an
ambulance within a short span of two or three
days and take you to the hospital."

<p>In this way the drunkards continued their clamour.
In the freezing night they made the heavy air warm
and roared, "Tell us, you wretch, if you are dead
or alive. We'll utilize this opportunity for social service."

para-précis and letter-précis.

<p><b>Para-précis:</b> A para-précis is the condensed substantial
form of many paragraphs and cantos. The entire <i>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a,</i>
with seven cantos, may be written like this in a single paragraph:

<p class=example>Raja Dasharatha was the king of
Ayodhya in North India. He had three queens &ndash;
Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra &ndash; and four sons &ndash;
Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana and Shatrughna.
Dasharatha, being goaded by the evil advice of
the second queen Kaikeyi, sent Rama into exile
in the forest for fourteen years.
Rama's devoted wife, Sita, and his affectionate
brother, Lakshmana,  accompanied him.
One day during the short absence of Rama and Lakshmana,
Ravana, the King of Lanka, kidnapped Sita from
their cottage in the forest. After a long fight
between Rama and Ravana, Ravana was defeated
and killed by Rama. Rama came back to Ayodhya
with Sita and Lakshmana. Dasharatha had died during
the absence of Rama. Thus, just after Rama's
return to Ayodhya, he was coronated.

<p><b>Letter-précis:</b> A letter-précis is the gist
form of a long correspondence. For instance, in letter
No. 1, Praviira wrote to Suviira that he would be
going to Calcutta and not Lucknow during the summer
vacation. In letter No.2, Suviira requested
[that Praviira, instead of] going to Lucknow,
come to Digha, where the sea beach is of a
super-excellent standard. In response to Suviira's
letter, Praviira wrote in letter No. 3 that he
wanted to visit Bakkhali. Finally, Suviira wrote in
letter No. 4 that yes, he [Praviira] might come to
Bakkhali, and said that he (Suviira) would also remain
present there. The letter-précis should be as follows:

<p class=example>After a long correspondence between
Praviira and Suviira, they finally decided to visit
Bakkhali together during the summer vacation.

<p>The Latinic group of languages has three branches:
Continental Latin, Occido-Demi-Latin and
Oriento-Demi-Latin. From Continental Latin
evolved German, Czech, Hungarian, Polish
and Flemish. From Occido-Demi-Latin evolved
two languages, Spanish and Portuguese,
and a demi-language, Basque.
(Basque can be called a half-language,
or demi-language, because Basque is a
mixture of the Spanish and the French languages.<sup><a
href=#A.1 name=tA.1>1</a></sup>)
From Oriento-Demi-Latin evolved two
languages: French and Italian.


<p>In the Occido-Demi-Latin group, all the
prefixes of the Latin language have
been retained.

<p>There are two pairs of languages in the
world which can be said to be the closest
to one another: Spanish and Portuguese,
and Bengali and Oriya. The first two
[sub-]branches of the [Occido-Demi-]Latin
language are prevalent in South America;
that is why South America is also known
as Latin America. 

<p>The modern English language evolved about 1100
years ago. 2000 years ago old English<sup><a
href=#A.2 name=tA.2>2</a></sup> was a mixture
of the Britons' and Angles' tongues. But
modern English is a mixture of Anglo-Saxon
and Norman. Saxon is of Scandinavian origin,
and Norman is of French origin. There are
two styles of pronunciation side by side
 &ndash; the Anglo-Saxon style and the Norman style.

<p>About 2000 years ago English did
not have its own script. The present
script is Roman script with a little
modification. The origin of Roman
script is Greek script, and the origin
of Greek script is Old Hebrew (Semitic) script.
Semitic script is written from right
to left, but Roman script is written
from left to right.

Though many consider it to be unrelated
to other languages. &ndash;Eds.

<p class=footnote>(<a name=A.2 href=#tA.2>2</a>)
This is not the "Old English" of
scholarly terminology. "Old English"
as used by scholars would include the
first centuries of what the author
calls "modern English" (i.e., would
include two centuries of Norman
influence before the Norman conquest). &ndash;Eds.
