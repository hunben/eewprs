Only the person at fault &ndash; not any other member of his/her family &ndash; will be penalized. As soon as one&#146;s defect is rectified, the punishment should be withdrawn. If the person undergoing atonement inspires ten people onto the path of spirituality, the defect will be considered expiated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->If there is any allegation against the conduct of any Ananda Margi, it must be brought to the notice of the a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;; and in the a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;&#146;s absence, to the notice of the other a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301; who has taken the responsibility of further guiding the accused Margi regarding spiritual practices. If the second a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301; is not easily available, the matter should be brought to the notice of the upabhukti pramukha or the general bhukti pradha&#x301;na<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> concerned. Then, within a week, these persons will form a tribunal consisting only of a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s to investigate the matter. If the allegation is proved true, the tribunal will decide the proper punishment for the accused. If the accused so desires, he/she can, with the permission of the members of the tribunal, appeal against the judgement of the tribunal to the general bhukti pradha&#x301;na. The bhukti pradha&#x301;na will then form another tribunal consisting of a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s. If even then the accused is not satisfied with the judgement of the tribunal constituted by the bhukti pradha&#x301;na, he/she may, with the permission of the members of the second tribunal, appeal to the general secretary of the Sam&#x301;gha. In that case, the decision taken by the general secretary or by the tribunal appointed by the general secretary will be taken to be final.<!-- /block --></p>

The secretary will then constitute a tribunal, and, if the allegations are proved true, the tribunal will decide the punishment.<!-- /block --></p>
