<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The word Bhakti (devotion) means worshiping. For worshiping, both the person who worships and the person who is worshiped must be present. Hence as long as there remains a difference between the devotee and God, there is the opportunity and necessity of Bhakti-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word &ldquo;Para&#x301;nurakti&rdquo; should be considered. Rakti denotes Raga or attachment. Anurakti means maintaining attachment with or being attracted by a particular entity after having understood its meaning. Anurakti is of two kinds. The Anurakti for the Supreme Brahma or Infinite Cosmic Consciousness is Para&#x301;nurakti. The Anurakti for Brahma under the sway of Prakrti or the Anurakti for the crude manifestations is termed Apara&#x301;nurakti. God is an object for Para&#x301;nurakti. When the aspirant considers the Supreme Brahma to be his or her own, it is termed Bhajana&#x301; or Bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The two varieties of Anurakti exist only on account of the introverting or extroversial actions of the mind; that is extroversion denotes Apara&#x301;nurakti, while introversion denotes Para&#x301;nurakti. The externalizing forces subordinate a person to the sense organs and render him or her crude. Such a person is divested of his or her spiritual force. Para&#x301;nurakti on the other hand releases a person from the grips of the Indriyas and through sublime meditations establishes him or her in the finer sublimated senses, in the infinite blessedness beyond the bounds of the Universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now the question arises as to whether Bhakti is natural or unnatural for the living beings. All the things we see in the manifested Universe, whether they be conscious or crude, have attraction for one another. This attraction is the Dharma of the created Universe and as a consequence the continuity of the thought projections of the Cosmic Mind is maintained. Therefore, I say that attraction is natural for everything. It is due to the attractions for one another amongst myriads of heavenly bodies oscillating in the infinite space that balance is maintained in the firmament. In every planet or sub-planet, there is the effort for self-preservation. People run and assemble at a place which yields good water, good fruits and fertile lands, because they find adequate materials for self-preservation. The bee flies around the flowers in quest of honey for the sake of preserving its existence. Every entity runs more towards that which is more lasting and secure and which will provide it with greater and longer safety. People run after money because they believe that they can maintain their lives under the shelter of money, that money alone can save them. They do not know that money can provide neither a permanent stability nor securely founded shelter. During the span of one&#146;s life money will come and go several times. At times its glamour will dazzle our eyes and at other times the lack of money will make one cry from hunger. Not only money, but all finite objects have this characteristic. One uses finite objects with the intention of enjoying only one of their portions, then sooner or later the residue will be reached. That which is finite cannot permanently remain the object of your enjoyment or your permanent resort. The existence of all these things is dependent on other things &ndash; bounded by the limits of time, place and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In philosophical terms the attraction for finite objects is called A&#x301;sakti and the attraction for the infinite is Bhakti. Ra&#x301;ga or Rakti means both the attraction for the infinite and attraction for the finite objects. &ldquo;Sakasmae parampremaru&#x301;pa&#x301;,&rdquo; that is, Bhakti is the symbol of love and this love is dedicated towards Iishvara, signified by the letter &ldquo;ka&rdquo;. In the vedic language the letter &ldquo;Ka&rdquo; means God. God is indescribable. God is the nucleus of the Universe and is supreme love personified.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. Where a change in Purus&#x301;a occurs on account of the influence of Prakrti, the mind comes into being. The senses and organs are the recipients and the vehicles of the workings of the mind; so the mind is the worldly knower or subject of all worldly acts. The mind is the object of the untainted knowing Purus&#x301;a, and Purus&#x301;a is its subject or knowing self. When the mind as an object merges into Purus&#x301;a as the subject, distinction between the object and the subject ceases to exist. This is the supreme state of the aspirant. However when the mind is guided by Avidya&#x301;, that is, when it a seeks enjoyment in the finite objects, then, that externalized energy of the mind is ultimately identified with the crude object. This is so whether this object is a creation of the mind itself or is taken from the crude quinquelemental world.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Pure Bhakti cannot be based on finite objects since the very existence of finite objects is derived from extroverted feelings. Nevertheless, I painfully observe that many people confine their love and devotion to finite objects and as a result they do not attain the pervasiveness which love confers. They do not realize that every tiny atom of this vast universe is a creative manifestation of Cosmic Consciousness &ndash; God&#146;s grand expression. They spend millions on the installation of idols and do not relent on seeing the afflictions of suffering humanity. They don&#146;t hesitate when killing in cold blood a young goat for the so-called satiation of a goddess.<!-- /block --></p>

The name and form of objects undergo changes with the change in time and place. The child changes into a youth, the youth into an old person, and the old person into a dead person. Wise people take every object of the world as the expression of one and single Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and are not be affected by pain or pleasure when they witness changes in the name and form of any particular object. Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u to them remains Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and they lose nothing.<!-- /block --></p>

An aspirant is called Ta&#x301;masika when instead of being drawn to the Ra&#x301;jasika or Sattvagun&#x301;ii splendors, he or her practices Bhakti after having immersed their Tamogun&#x301;ii existence in the static force.<!-- /block --></p>

Emancipate me from the cycle of Karmas&rdquo; and those who pursue their practice as their duty or for the fear that people may decry them if they do not do so, are classed as Sa&#x301;ttvika Sa&#x301;dhakas. They are Sa&#x301;ttvika Sa&#x301;dhakas, in as much as they do not seek attainment of the Supreme. However, this Sa&#x301;ttvika Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is not a superior degree of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or the Supreme Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, because none of the above control the energies of the aspirant and direct them towards the adored, the Supreme Brahma. The aim of the aspirant is channelized in a different direction and he or she carries on with an inferior object. All the three such Bhaktas &ndash; Sa&#x301;ttvika, Ra&#x301;jasika and Ta&#x301;masika are Gaon&#x301;ii or inferior Bhakti. Where there is no object other than the Supreme Brahma, it is called Mukhya Bhakti. In Mukhya&#x301; Bhakti There the aspirant is free from the three gun&#x301;as. He or she is absorbed in spiritual practices to Nirgun&#x301;a Bhakti. In general then, Bhakti can be classified into many groups according to the object in view.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph --><b>Nirgun&#x301;a Bhakti</b>: Here the aspirants have no other object.

I do not know. I love Him just because I like to love Him. Should I not love? He is the life of my life the soul of my soul&rdquo;. This type of Bhakti is Nirgun&#x301;a Bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph --><b>Vaedhii Bhakti</b>: Where there is no undivided Bhakti for the Lord and the object is only to give a show to others.

Such devotions practised within the bounds of externalized usage and rituals is called Vaedhii Bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph --><b>Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra Bhakti</b>: If the Sa&#x301;ttvika Sa&#x301;dhaka does not forget the adored even after realization of his or her object, then gradually the Supreme knowledge shines forth within his or her mind. This attainment is known by the name of Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; Bhakti. This Bhakti also may be classed as Nirgun&#x301;a Bhakti, but due to the dormant vanity for wealth or knowledge, the supreme state is not attained. This is also called Pradha&#x301;nibhuta Bhakti. Pradha&#x301;nibhuta is the highest stage of Gaonii or inferior Bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>

This is the culmination of Bhakti, it is the highest pitch of Bhakti. If there is undivided knowledge with the object, then there exists one and only one entity, and that is why it is called Kevala&#x301; Bhakti. Kevala&#x301; Bhakti is not attained by baths, exercises or austerity. Those who have not been blessed with the Divine Grace, even to a small extent, cannot have any realization about it.<!-- /block --></p>

This aspect is known as Mahim Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na in the scriptures. In the presence of Mahim Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na the devotee feels shy in merging in the Supreme Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

They have no time developing any distinction between the adored and the adorer or the infinite and the finite. The aspirant does not consider himself or herself to be the adorer of Rama but rather the personification of Rama.

This is the zenith of Ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika. They do not like to become sugar, rather they love to taste it and say that if they get transformed into sugar, then how would they realize the taste of sugar.

<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Bha&#x301;va is that whereby the Citta or mind-stuff becomes purged and is chiefly dominated by Sattvagun&#x301;a. Where all the ten directions become brilliant with the rays of the sun of love and the taste or anurakti for the Lord gets enlightened, then the Citta develops oneness with Him. As a result of this Bha&#x301;va, human beings direct their natural attractive tendencies towards the adored. The adored, however is not outside them, but is the life of their life, the mind of their mind and the life master of their entire existence. When this feeling of devotion for the adored awakens the introversion of one&#146;s tendencies, then one becomes absorbed in this Bha&#x301;va. One attains the state of realizing the self. In Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava philosophy this running into one&#146;s own self is known as Hla&#x301;dinii Shakti because in this path there is a progressive refulgence of the light of mellifluous realizations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->When there is fear or feeling of crude propensities in the mind, there cannot be pure Anurakti or Bhakti. Devotion generated through fear is no Bhakti at all, rather it is but a lamentable state of mental crudeness. Some pray to the Lord for fear of hell and some for fear of torture and retribution in the next life. They hunger for emancipation from these fears. This betrays a lack of knowledge of the truth and you should not give encouragement to this inferiority complex. Those who accept or know the Lord as their own self have no reason to entertain any fear of Him. This fearless movement towards the Lord is termed Love.<!-- /block --></p>

The attachment for a finite thing is an expression of extroverted energy, whereas the attraction for the Infinite is an expression of the introverted energy. That is why these two can never co-exist. Therefore the aspirant has to skillfully to transform passion into love. Do you love your son? No, no you don&#146;t love your son. You love Brahma in the form of your son. By loving your son as a son, you cannot love the Lord. Where there is the feeling of son, there is no Lord and where there is the Lord, there is no son.
