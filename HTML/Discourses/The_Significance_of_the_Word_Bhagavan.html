<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->We have been discussing the Giita&#x301;. In order to delve into the essential import of the Giita&#x301;, it was necessary [in previous discourses] to start with an introduction. About the Giita&#x301; it has been said, Ya&#x301; Bhagavata&#x301; giita&#x301; sa&#x301; Giita&#x301; [&ldquo;That which has been sung by Bhagava&#x301;n, the Lord, is the Giita&#x301;&rdquo;]. Here the question of &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; arises. We have already examined some of the meanings of &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. Moreover, it has also been shown that all those different meanings of the term converge at one point.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->However, the word has other [than etymological] meanings also. For example, the terms bhagava&#x301;n and &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; are identical in meaning: they are equivalent terms. What then is the meaning of bhagava&#x301;n?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Bha + Ga + Suffix<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit there are certain words which we use in a short form but which have profound meanings. The word bhagava&#x301;n has two primary meanings. One of them is bha, which means bheti bha&#x301;syate sarva&#x301;n loka&#x301;n [&ldquo;that which illumines all the strata&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->What does loka mean here? In Bengali, lok means a man, a person; when we say Ekjan lok ya&#x301;cche, it means &ldquo;A ma&#x301;nus&#x301;a [person] is going.&rdquo; (In Marathi also the word ma&#x301;nus&#x301;a occurs, while in Assamese it is ma&#x301;nuh.) But in Sanskrit, loka has a different connotation; it stands for &ldquo;layer&rdquo; or &ldquo;stratum&rdquo;. So the sapta [seven] loka means seven layers of manifestation. These seven layers cover the entire continuum from Brahma&#x301; to the crudest matter &ndash; A&#x301;brahmastamba.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->(Here the term &ldquo;Brahma&rdquo; does not stand for Brahma the Absolute, the Supreme Being. It is Brahma&#x301; which the term &ldquo;Brahma&rdquo; denotes here. &ldquo;Brahma&#x301;&rdquo; means &ldquo;the Creator&rdquo;. In the case of indeclinable words and adjectives the a&#x301; is omitted, giving place to simple a. For example, we don&#146;t call a tree having many [bahu] branches [sha&#x301;kha&#x301;] a bahusha&#x301;kha&#x301;, but bahusha&#x301;kha. The a&#x301; is dropped. Thus here the word &ldquo;Brahma&rdquo; is not Brahma the Absolute but Brahma&#x301;. We say A&#x301;brahmastamba &ndash; &ldquo;From Brahma&#x301; the Creator to a blade of grass,&rdquo; everything is permeated by Brahma.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now, this Brahma&#x301; the Creator is not a separate entity. Brahma + a = &ldquo;Brahma&#x301;&rdquo;. A means &ldquo;creator&rdquo;. You are making a doll out of a lump of clay, you are creating something &ndash; the acoustic root of this very act of creation is a. When Brahma is engaged in the act of creation, the a is added to Brahma and we get &ldquo;Brahma&#x301;&rdquo;. In other words, when the Supreme Entity Brahma is creating anything, He is Brahma&#x301;. (Take for instance Rambabu. He is a school teacher. Rambabu and the teacher are not two different beings. When Rambabu is in school with a cane in his hand, people call him a teacher. The two are not separate beings.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Every entity in creation, from the subtlest stage to the crudest stage, is alive. Everything is vibrant with life. But why is everything alive, what fills everything with life? It is the sheer joy of living. If there were no joy, no delight, in living, no one would have lived. They would have left this world, by one means or other. Why then are they here? Because they get joy in living here. Else they would not have stayed on. Bha&#x301;syate sarva&#x301;n&#x301; loka&#x301;niti &ndash; &ldquo;The seven lokas shine with His light,&rdquo; reflect the brilliance of His effulgent being; and His glory makes everything sparkle with joy. Delighted with that luminosity, the hearts of all are dancing in joy. They want to live, to dance, to work, to see, to achieve, and to reach Parama Brahma in order to merge in Him with joy. To live like this &ndash; this very way of living &ndash; is a&#x301;nanda [bliss]. The world has its being only because of this a&#x301;nanda. And if this a&#x301;nanda had not been there, the world also would not have existed at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Na va&#x301; are patyuh ka&#x301;ma&#x301;ya patih priyo bhavati;<br>A&#x301;tmanastu ka&#x301;ma&#x301;ya patih priyo bhavati.<br>Na va&#x301; are puttrasya ka&#x301;ma&#x301;ya puttrah priyo bhavati;<br>A&#x301;tmanastu ka&#x301;ma&#x301;y puttrah priyo bhavati.<br>Na va&#x301; are sarvasya ka&#x301;ma&#x301;ya sarvam&#x301; priyam&#x301; bhavati;<br>A&#x301;tmanastu ka&#x301;ma&#x301;ya sarvam&#x301; priyam&#x301; bhavati.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why is my husband so dear? Because of the pleasure that he gives me. My husband is dear to me not because he is my husband as such. Why do I love my son? Because I get pleasure in loving him. My son is dear to me not because he is my son as such. And regarding the world, nothing in the world is loved for its own sake, but for the pleasure I derive from loving it.&rdquo; Similarly, why do people want to live? Because they find pleasure in living, not because of any inherent attraction of the world. When they no longer find any joy in the world, then they no longer want to live. They want to leave the world. People often think, &ldquo;I&#146;d like to leave all this&rdquo; &ndash; meaning that they are no longer finding in the world any joy in living. This is the psychology of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Thus the meaning of bha is bheti bha&#x301;syate loka&#x301;n &ndash; &ldquo;that which has infused the joy of living throughout the seven lokas, as a result of which everybody&#146;s heart and mind has become illuminated&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->And ga means Gacchati yasmin, a&#x301;gacchati yasma&#x301;t [&ldquo;One who comes also goes&rdquo;]. Hence ga is used to denote that from which everything in the world comes, and into which everything in the world ultimately dissolves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->By conjoining bha and ga we get the word bhaga. Bhaga + the suffix matup in the first person singular form gives bhagava&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Bhaga<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Bhaga stands for six different attributes collected together &ndash; a synthesis of six attributes. One of these attributes is aeshvarya, which means &ldquo;occult power&rdquo;. (In Latin, if we wish to say &ldquo;originating from cult&rdquo;, the letter &ldquo;o&rdquo; is placed before &ldquo;cult&rdquo; as a prefix; and according to the rules of English grammar, &ldquo;o&rdquo; being a light vowel, the consonant coming immediately after gets doubled. In the word &ldquo;requisition&rdquo; we find &ldquo;req&rdquo;, but in the word &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; we find that a &ldquo;c&rdquo; has been added after the &ldquo;a&rdquo;. In the same way, what a person gets in return for &ldquo;cult&rdquo;, the wealth he gets in return for cult and as a result of his devotion to ideals, is called &ldquo;occult power&rdquo;, which in Sanskrit is expressed by the term aeshvarya.) The presence of all the different kinds of aeshvarya in a person is indeed one of the attributes of bhaga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The second attribute is prata&#x301;pa (administration), that is, the person has sha&#x301;sana [capacity to rule]. Everyone obeys the person, either out of fear or out of love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The scriptures say that everything in the universe obeys the Supreme Entity. But why do they obey? Well, there is no other way but to do so. It is out of fear of Him that the wind is blowing. If there were no such fear, the wind might think of taking a little rest. In Sanskrit, one of the names for the wind is anil. Nil means &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, &ldquo;static&rdquo; &ndash; that which is stuck in a particular position without movement &ndash; and anil means just the opposite. The Supreme Entity has prata&#x301;pa. Bhiis&#x301;a&#x301;hasma&#x301;d va&#x301;yuh pavate &ndash; &ldquo;Out of fear of Him does the wind blow&rdquo; &ndash; with the feeling that its movements are constantly watched from behind by a pair of eyes. Bhiisodeti su&#x301;ryah &ndash; &ldquo;Out of fear of Him does the sun rise on time.&rdquo; Not even a slight deviation is allowed. There is no scope for thinking &ldquo;Today is Sunday, let me get up a little late.&rdquo; It must rise at the right time. Bhiisa&#x301;hasma&#x301;dagniscandrashca &ndash; &ldquo;Out of fear of Him, Agni [fire-god], Indra [king of gods], Candra [moon-god], Varun&#x301;a [water-god], all are going on with their allotted duties.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The fire-god is performing its duty of burning; else the Supreme Entity will be displeased.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The word indra has different meanings, one of which is &ldquo;big&rdquo;, &ldquo;superior&rdquo;. Another meaning is &ldquo;the sha&#x301;l tree&rdquo;. That is a kind of very tall tree. In Sanskrit the sha&#x301;l tree is also called indra. It grows in plenty in the district of Bankura, and there is a particular place named Indrapur or Indpur, which means &ldquo;the land of big sha&#x301;l trees&rdquo;. Similarly, big ku&#x301;pas [wells] are called indraku&#x301;pa. In Pra&#x301;krta, it is indra-u-a; and in old Bengali it is indar-u-a, which in modern Bengali has come to be inda&#x301;ra&#x301;. The same word in the rural dialect of Bihar has taken the form of ina&#x301;ra&#x301;. All these variations have come out of the orginal indraku&#x301;pa. Another meaning of indra is &ldquo;energy&rdquo; &ndash; light energy, sound energy, electrical energy, etc. If we know the nature of these energies, we can put them to work. Even these energies follow a course of regularity in their duties. In fact, such regularity is obligatory or binding on them. They cannot do otherwise, because of fear of the Supreme Entity. Even death cannot go against the law. Mrtyur dha&#x301;vati pain&#x32D;camah &ndash; it must appear before one at the scheduled time. Each and everyone has to face death, as directed by the Supreme Entity Itself. That is why the Supreme Entity is called bhiisan&#x301;a &ndash; &ldquo;the terrible&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Thus the first attribute of bhaga is aeshvarya, occult power, and the second is prata&#x301;pa, commanding authority (in pure Bengali it is da&#x301;pat and in Sanskrit prata&#x301;pa).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Now we come to the third attribute &ndash; yasha. When the good qualities of a person are publicly acclaimed, that is yasha. (When those qualities are praised in rhythm, that is yashokiirtana, which should be sung not in a short and subdued way, but in a long and protracted tone, so that others may hear. Kiirtana is not something to be sung mentally.) Yasha, again, is of two types &ndash; positive and negative. If you are loud in speaking ill of others, that also is yasha, a negative yasha. So the third attribute of bhaga is this yasha, which, as we have seen, can be either positive or negative. It has been seen that whenever the Divine Entity has descended on the earth, one group of human beings has stood in its favour, while an opposite group has opposed it. Kansa was against Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a; Ravana was against Rama. (It is rather strange &ndash; either philosophically or politically &ndash; that the initial letter of each party is the same as the initial letter of the opposite party.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->There is a story in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Once Hanuman had managed to sneak into the private room of Ravana in the guise of a Brahman. His plan was to steal Ravana&#146;s death-dealing weapon, the mrtyuva&#x301;n&#x301;a. Seeing him, the ladies of Ravana&#146;s family said, &ldquo;O revered one, please tell us, who will win the battle being fought between Rama and Ravana?&rdquo; In reply, Hanuman, while jumping to escape, said: &ldquo;Well, the winner&#146;s name starts with the syllable ra&#x301;.&rdquo; The ladies took that to mean Ravana. But the name of his opponent also began with ra&#x301;. Similarly, yasha can mean either positive yasha or negative yasha. Whenever the world is at the threshold of a great ideal, such situations will occur. The entire intellectuality, the entire world opinion, will be polarized. When polarization does not take place, and all movements are centred round the equator, that should be looked at as something very common, not at all as anything of importance, but a mere cosmetic make-up. That is not gold, nor is it silver. It is simply a piece of tinsel coated with gold or silver. But when you see that polarization has become complete, you should know that something big is going to happen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The fourth attribute is shrii. The word shrii is a combination of sha, ra and ii. Sha is the acoustic root of rajogun&#x301;a [the mutative principle]. Sha helps to make a person active, and helps the person&#146;s energy, intelligence and learning to become manifested. Whatever one does, one does with the help of sha, through the expression of rajogun&#x301;a. In the absence of rajogun&#x301;a, one cannot perform any action despite the potentiality one might be possessing. One will simply be an idiot of idiots &ndash; a burden on society. There are people who have intelligence, learning and energy, but who are like decrepit bulls, good for nothing. Again, there are people you will come across who are so lethargic and dilatory that they cannot accomplish even in days a piece of work that could normally be done in a few hours. They are practically worthless. They lack sha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Next is ra, which is the acoustic root of energy. We have spoken earlier about energy. In Sanskrit, indra means energy &ndash; for example, light, sound, electricity. Where sha, that is, the rajogun&#x301;ii vrtti [propensity], and ra, that is, energy, are both present, success is assured. Many may have a mind to do something, but do not have the requisite capability to do so. The desire is there, but no effective skill. Obviously, ra is absent here. Where both sha and ra are present we get shra, and adding the feminine uniis&#x301;a gives shrii. It is the legacy of India to prefix shrii to one&#146;s name, because everybody wants it. Shrii means &ldquo;charm&rdquo; or &ldquo;fascination&rdquo;. You must have seen objects that instantly draw your attention. That means the particular object has an attractive force within it. There are some people who are not particularly learned or intelligent; nor are they adept at public speaking; but they are very good conversationalists. People gather round them eagerly to enjoy their pleasantries. That too is a kind of shrii. There are people who are not conversant with the intricacies of music, but they sing so melodiously that others rush to listen to them. That is the person&#146;s musical shrii. Hence that singer may be honoured with the title giita&#x301;shrii. One who possesses this quality of shrii, this charm, this fascinating faculty, is said to have the fourth quality of bhaga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The fifth attribute is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. What is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na? You read a book and retain in memory what is there in the book. That is not jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. The real meaning of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is the subjectivization of objectivity. Today you read and tomorrow you forget. Those among you who have passed the MA examination, if asked to undergo the same examination right now, will not be successful, simply because you have forgotten everything, like food that has been digested without a trace. That indicates that that was not the real jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Real jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na &ndash; genuine knowledge &ndash; implies what has been learned in the past is retained even today and, when needed, can be reproduced as it was. But if there is distortion, if what was learned is not retained, that is not jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. What remains permanently is the real jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Bookish knowledge, or knowledge obtained through hearsay, has no sound basis; it is constantly changing. That is not knowledge. But those elements of the information which are beneficial, and were acquired for the permanent welfare of people, are called vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [science]. Knowledge about the Supreme Entity is also called science, because that also is conducive to human well-being. That is why our scriptures have this to say about real knowledge:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam&#x301; vidurjin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na&#x301;nyanya&#x301;ni ya&#x301;nitu;<br>Ta&#x301;ni jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na&#x301;vabha&#x301;sa&#x301;ni sa&#x301;rasyanaeva bodhana&#x301;t.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->[Self-knowledge is the real knowledge &ndash; all other  knowledge is a mere shadow of knowledge; and will not lead to realization of the truth.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->To know one&#146;s own self, or self-knowledge, alone is true knowledge. Self-realization, that is, where the subjectivity and the objectivity coincide &ndash; there we say it is knowledge. There we have reached the pinnacle of knowledge. This is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The sixth attribute is vaera&#x301;gya [renunciation]. Vi &ndash; ran&#x301;j + ghain&#x32D; = vira&#x301;ga. Ran&#x301;j means &ldquo;to colour&rdquo;. Adding lyut&#x301; to the root ran&#x301;j we get rain&#x32D;jana [dyeing], and adding the suffix s&#x301;ak to ran&#x301;j we get rajaka, that is, one who colours clothes with rain&#x32D;jak (ran&#x301;j + n&#x301;ak [dye]). Hence a rajak is one who dyes clothes. The root verb vi-ran&#x301;j, on the other hand, means &ldquo;to  remove colour&rdquo;. Thus vira&#x301;ga is that which removes colour. And vaera&#x301;gya is the abstract-noun form of vira&#x301;ga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Whatever things the people of this world are running after, whatever they think of or see, they focus on the colours. They see them, think of them. But what they perceive is the outer colouring of the objects. Say there is a black fruit hanging high up in the tree. Its very colour tells you it is a ja&#x301;m.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> When we see the colour, we get attracted. But a being who lives in the world but is not attracted by anything of the world &ndash; whose mind is unaffected by the colours of the world &ndash; is a vaera&#x301;gii; and that mental bha&#x301;va [stance] is vaera&#x301;gya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Now, these six attributes combined are what is known as bhaga. And one who has this bhaga is bhagava&#x301;n. Bhaga + matup = bhagava&#x301;n. [This bhaga is the second of] the two meanings of bhaga, as I have explained to you.<!-- /block --></p>
