In order to feel His existence, one is to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, one is to practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Because He lies coverted within your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling.<!-- /block --></p>

Tiles&#x301;u taelam&#x301; [&ldquo;Like oil in sesame seeds&rdquo;]. Similarly, by churning your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, you will get two factors: the essence, that is, Parama Purus&#x301;a, and the wastage, that is, that depraved mind of yours.<!-- /block --></p>

In Sanskrit there are three popular words for ghee &ndash; sarpi, ghrtam and upasecanam. Now, there is ghee in curd, but you cannot see it, you cannot get it. If you want to separate ghee from curd, you will have to churn it. Similarly, if you want to separate the cognitive faculty from your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, you will have to churn it.

In Sanskrit, visha&#x301;la means &ldquo;big, very big, very very big, but that comes within the scope of measurement&rdquo;. The mighty Himalayas &ndash; they are very big but you can measure them. &ldquo;Eighteen hundred miles&rdquo; &ndash; you may say like this. That is, the Himalayas are very big, but they come within the scope of measurement. When a very big entity comes within the scope of measurement, we say it is visha&#x301;la. And when a very big entity does not come within the scope of measurement, we say it is brhat. Brhat and visha&#x301;la. Our country of India is visha&#x301;la, not brhat. Now, in the entire universe the only brhat entity is Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Purus&#x301;a, and there is no other brhat entity. He is brhat. Brhattva&#x301;d Brahma, brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d Brahma &ndash; &ldquo;He is called Brahma because He is brhat; He is called Brahma because He makes others brhat.&rdquo; When the sa&#x301;dhaka becomes one with Him, he also becomes brhat. That is, He has the faculty of making others brhat. This faculty of making others brhat, enlarging others, is called brm&#x301;han in Sanskrit. He is called Brahma because He is brhat and because He has the faculty of brm&#x301;han. Brhattva&#x301;d Brahma, brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Divya. Divya means &ldquo;divine&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Acintyaru&#x301;pam. Acintya means &ldquo;not coming within the periphery of the mind&rdquo;. Entities coming within the scope of the three fundamental relative factors &ndash; time, space and person &ndash; temporal factor, spatial factor and personal factor &ndash; come within the scope of the mind also. And any entity not coming within the scope of time, space and person, not coming within the scope of causality, within the scope of cause-and-effect theory, does not come within the scope of the mind either. And that is why in this shloka it has been said, acintya &ndash; that is, &ldquo;not coming within the compass of the mind&rdquo;. Brhacca taddivyam acintyaru&#x301;pam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->But is He brhat only?

Well, He is not only little; He is very, very little. &ldquo;He is smaller than an iota, smaller than an ion.&rdquo; He is very, very little. Suks&#x301;ma&#x301;cca suks&#x301;mataram&#x301; vibha&#x301;ti. Now, the subtlest entity is called suks&#x301;ma in Sanskrit. And suks&#x301;matara means &ldquo;subtler than the subtlest&rdquo;. Suks&#x301;ma&#x301;cca suks&#x301;mataram&#x301; vibha&#x301;ti &ndash; &ldquo;He is subtler than the subtlest object of this expressed universe.&rdquo; Now you see, in the case of a very big entity, in the case of a brhat entity, that object cannot come within the scope of your mind because it is beyond the scope of time, space and person. And also in the case of a suks&#x301;matara entity, that is, a subtler-than-the-subtlest entity, the entity does not come within the scope of your mind. You cannot see an atom with ordinary eyes, and suks&#x301;matara is smaller than an atom, smaller than an electron. Suks&#x301;ma&#x301;cca suks&#x301;mataram&#x301; vibha&#x301;ti &ndash; that is, in that case &ldquo;He is the Effulgent Entity.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

In Sanskrit, the word du&#x301;ra is used when the distance comes within the scope of measurement. So many kilometres, so many miles. But when the distance does not come within the scope of measurement, we say sudu&#x301;ra. Now here the rs&#x301;i says: &ldquo;A sa&#x301;dhaka, a spiritual aspirant, a man &ndash; if a man thinks that &lsquo;He is at a distance from me,&rsquo; then He is not du&#x301;ra but sudu&#x301;ra for me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

He need not go to so many tiirthas [places of pilgrimage]. He need not cry for Him loudly. Because He is the nearest point. He can hear your mental language. So those who want to enjoy His proximity, what are they to do, what should they do?
