<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;The Cosmological Order&rdquo;. In this universe of Macropsychic conation, everywhere there is a system. There is an order, there is a rational expression. All the structures, all the frameworks, are guided by a law; and the name of that law is &ldquo;nature&rdquo;. The name of the working faculty is Prakrti, and the Supreme Entity controlling the functional expression of Prakrti is Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In each and every structure there is one controlling entity, and that controlling entity is the para portion of that structure; and the remaining portion of that structure, that is, the portion controlled by the para portion, is called apara. In an atom, the para, that is, the controlling portion, is the nucleus. And electrons are moving around that nucleus. In the case of an atom, the moving entities, the controlled entities, are the apara entities, and the [nucleus], the controlling entity, is the para entity.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In this mundane structure, this ethereal structure, the para portion, the controlling portion, is the earth, and the controlled portion, the apara portion, is the moon moving around the earth. The apara is dependent on the para. Again, in our solar system, the para portion is the sun, and so many planets with their respective satellites are moving around the sun &ndash; they are the apara. Here also the vital stage lies with the sun. The heat, the warmth, the vitality, everything, these planets acquired from the para, from the sun. In the case of this solar system, death of the sun would mean death of the planets, the thermal death of this solar system. And similarly, for the entire universe, for this entire Cosmic world, the para portion is Parama Purus&#x301;a, is Purus&#x301;ottama, and all the &ldquo;planetary systems&rdquo;, all the jiivas, are moving around that para as satellites, getting the vitality, getting everything of the earth, from that supreme para, from that nucleus. He is the Hub. He is the Nave of this Cosmological order. This Cosmological order is known as Brahma Cakra in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now as you know, in each and every structure the apara moves around the para, and this movement around the para, this movement around the nave of the structure, is affected by two forces. One is the centre-seeking force, or centripetal force, and the other is the centrifugal force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the case of the nucleus of the Cosmological order, the para, the nucleus, is called Purus&#x301;ottama, and so many animate and inanimate objects are moving around Him. So here also, two forces are acting. One force is centre-seeking, centripetal &ndash; goading, rather, helping the movement of the jiiva towards the centre, towards Purus&#x301;ottama. And the other &ndash; the force that drifts the jiiva away from Purus&#x301;ottama &ndash; increases the length of the jiiva&#146;s radius; and that is the centrifugal. And so far as this Cosmological order is concerned, the centripetal, or centre-seeking, force is called vidya&#x301;; and the centrifugal force is called avidya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You know, the function and the existence of each and every entity in this universe has a certain influence on all other entities. The life, the movement, the thought-waves, of an ordinary ant affect you. Even the thought-waves of an ordinary ant affect your destiny. Nobody is alone in this universe. And this mutual attraction amongst all the entities of the world maintains the balance of the universe. If even an ordinary ant dies a premature death, the balance of the universe will be disturbed. So nobody, no entity, no human being, nothing in this universe, is meaningless. Each and every entity [in] this universe is valuable because it helps in maintaining the balance of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now this vidya&#x301;, that is, this centre-seeking, centripetal, force, helping the jiiva in its movement towards the Supreme, towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, has two [effects] on living bodies and living minds. These effects of vidya&#x301; on the human mind &ndash; two in number, as I said &ndash; are samvit shakti and hla&#x301;dinii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And the two influences of the centrifugal force on the human mind are viks&#x301;epa shakti and a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, what is the effect of viks&#x301;epa shakti? When someone is fully under the control of viks&#x301;epa shakti, that person thinks that if he or she goes away, moves away, keeps himself aloof and away from the centre, then the centre will not be in a position to control his or her destiny. And by this force a person is [often] misguided. The person thinks that running away, moving away, from the Supreme, will [keep] him or her from undergoing the [reactions] to his or her actions. This is viks&#x301;epa shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And the other influence of this centrifugal force on [a person] is a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. Such persons think that if they keep themselves engaged in worldly [actions], and if they do not ideate on God, then God also will not think about them. God will also forget them. And thus they will not have to suffer the consequences of their past actions. This is called a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. A&#x301;varan&#x301;a means &ldquo;to cover&rdquo;. That is, one tries to cover oneself, one&#146;s mind and body, so that God will not be able to see them. It is another folly. But those are the two expressions, two influences, of the centrifugal force, that is, avidya&#x301; shakti, on the human mind. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->And the other force is vidya&#x301; shakti, the centripetal [force. It also has two expressions &ndash;] one is samvit and the other is hla&#x301;dinii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->What is samvit? Someone who is simply eating, drinking and sleeping, living like an ordinary animal, [all of a sudden thinks] that he or she should do something. [One is a] human being, one shouldn&#146;t waste one&#146;s valuable time, one&#146;s valuable life. One should do something, one is to do something. Each and every life, each and every human life, is nothing but a mission. Human life is nothing but an ideological flow. Life is a mission. The person thinks like this. This feeling in the human mind is created by the samvit shakti of vidya&#x301;. &ldquo;I should do something.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now after this feeling [is aroused] in the mind &ndash; &ldquo;I should do something&rdquo; &ndash; then what happens? The person tries to [think] how to do something.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> How to move towards the Nucleus? How to become one with [that Entity]? This desire, this longing, for the Great is aroused in the person&#146;s mind. And the next moment what happens? By the grace of the Supreme the person gets the path. And he or she starts moving towards the Supreme in an accelerated speed. This movement is called hla&#x301;dinii shakti. Hla&#x301;d means [the entity that gives] pleasure. This shakti gives pleasure to the aspirant, that&#146;s why it is called hla&#x301;dinii shakti. So [we see] how this Cosmological order is composed: first, in the centre, is Purus&#x301;ottama, the Hub, Parama Purus&#x301;a; and there are so many animated and inanimated objects moving around that Nucleus; and this movement is affected by two forces, vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301;. Vidya&#x301; has two effects, samvit and hla&#x301;dinii, and avidya&#x301; has viks&#x301;epa and a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So what are these entities moving around the nucleus? Actually, as planets are mostly creations of the controlling stars &ndash; in our solar system the sun is the controlling star &ndash; similarly those animate and inanimate objects moving around the &ldquo;sun&rdquo; of this Cosmological order, moving around Purus&#x301;ottama,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> are just like planets of Purus&#x301;ottama. They are the jiivas. Now in this order, just as in the solar system we see satellites moving around the planets, and planets moving around the sun, [there are entities that move around Purus&#x301;ottama, while the jiivas are controlled by those entities.] In the case of this Cosmological order, there are several guiding faculties. Actually they are working like planets, and jiivas are working like satellites. So these &ldquo;planets&rdquo;, rather these controlling faculties, moving around Purus&#x301;ottama, are called devas. Devas are moving around Purus&#x301;ottama &ndash; and that&#146;s why Purus&#x301;ottama is called Maha&#x301;deva. And jiivas are being directly controlled by the devas, and finally by Purus&#x301;ottama, Maha&#x301;deva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->So what are these devas? Devas are emanated waves, emanated waves of the Supreme Hub. So many waves, carrying so many ideas,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  are emanated from the controlling hub. And these faculties are called devas, and these devas [control] the actional side of all living beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Dyotate kriid&#x301;ate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divi;<br>Tasma&#x301;t deva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->[The vibrational manifestations emanating from the Supreme Nucleus are known as devata&#x301;s, and these devata&#x301;s address that Supreme Nucleus as &ldquo;Deva&rdquo;. He with His powers vibrates the entire universe, makes the entire universe dance; and He by dint of His occult and supra-occult powers brings everything back onto His lap.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;These devas, these waves, these vibrational expressions, actually control all the universal phenomena.&rdquo; Now, these are the devas. Now, so far as human psychic structure is concerned, the  psychic structure<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is a collective expression of a certain number of devas. In the human body there are several glands and sub-glands, and the hormones secreted from different glands and sub-glands create waves, different types of waves, in the human body; and these waves are carried by, are re-vibrated by, so many nerves, nerve fibres, nerve cells. So in the human body the number of devas is more than the total number of nerve fibres and nerve cells. They are so many in number within a small human body &ndash; because the human body is controlled, is vibrated, by so many propensities, so many faculties, so many qualifications, so many attributions. So the entire Cosmological order is being vibrated by so many devas. And that&#146;s why regarding the Controlling Faculty, Maha&#x301;deva, it has been said, Sarvadyotana&#x301;tmaka akhan&#x301;d&#x301;a cidaekarasah [&ldquo;Supreme Consciousness exists in the form of an unbroken flow of cognition, the supreme source of all kinds of emanative vibrations&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->He is an all-vibrating, infinite ocean of divine nectar. Sarvadyotana&#x301;tmaka akhan&#x301;d&#x301;a cidaekarasah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Raso vae sah &ndash; &ldquo;He is the Cosmic elixir personified.&rdquo; Now the controlling entity<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is the controlling deity &ndash; He creates, He controls, all the vibrations of those devas. He is the Controlling Entity, He is the Sham&#x301;kara. Sham means &ldquo;to control&rdquo;. He who controls the entire universe is &ldquo;Sham&#x301;kara&rdquo;. He is Parama Purus&#x301;a, He is Maha&#x301;deva, He is Sham&#x301;kara also. And He is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a also, because He is attracting each and every unit towards Himself. But there is no difference amongst Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Maha&#x301;deva and Sham&#x301;kara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Now, this entire Cosmological order is an ocean, an infinite ocean, of divine nectar. And the so many vibrations created in this universe, so many waves, are different devas. And the life of an individual moves &ndash; goes up and down &ndash; just like a boat in the sea, according to the length of the wave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->This  rhythmic expression of the divine nectar, of the divine wave, has an acoustic counterpart also. It is not only moving, it is not only dancing, it is singing also. And these movements, these vibrations, these waves,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> are being controlled by the divine flute of the controlling entity, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. This movement, these dances, are a creation of that supreme controller, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, according to the rhythm created, according to the rhythm emanated, from His divine flute. And He is in the centre of this ocean of divine nectar. And the ocean, this ks&#x301;iirasamudra [ocean of ks&#x301;iira, a sweet milk preparation], is the sudha&#x301;rasam [flow of divine nectar]. So He is dancing in the centre playing on this divine flute, and all the jiivas are dancing according to His desire. One will have to dance according to that Cosmic rhythm. One may or may not like it, but one will have to dance. This liila&#x301; of Parama Purus&#x301;a, who is the controlling entity standing in the middle of this divine ocean, is known as His ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Liila&#x301; means ra&#x301;sasamudra [ocean of bliss], [His] ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;. Each and every living entity will have to take active part in this ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Now you see, all these waves have their original source in the Nave of the universe. That is the first stage. These vibrations are called the basic stage or basic expression. The basic expression is just near, [in] close proximity to, the Controlling Entity. Then the next one is the primordial expression. It is almost a straight line.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Shuddhasattvavishes&#x301;a&#x301;d&#x301;va&#x301; premasu&#x301;rya&#x301;m&#x301;shusa&#x301;myabha&#x301;k;<br>Rucibhishcittama&#x301;srn&#x301;ya krdasao bha&#x301;va ucyate.<!-- /block --></p>

The jiivas, according to their spiritual status, according to their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, according to the intensity of their longing for the Great, are in different positions, and attached to different waves.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn10"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn10">10</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  And what is your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;?
