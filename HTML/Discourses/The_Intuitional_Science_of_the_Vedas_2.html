<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Vedas are the unique manifestation of human intellect. The etymological meaning of the word &ldquo;Veda&rdquo; is knowledge. This knowledge is of two types. One type is subject to time, space, and person, and the other is the realization of the self, independent of all subjections. The former is called Relative Knowledge or Apara&#x301;jin&#x301;a&#x301;na, because it is related to objects, and the latter, spiritual Knowledge or para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Here the word, Veda, is of course used in the sense of spiritual knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Last Shra&#x301;van&#x301;ii Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301; I told you some thing from the Shukla-Yajurveda. Today I will tell you something from the Atharva Veda. Learned persons say that there is nothing important in the Atharva Veda. It is only a collection of mantras or incantations about ghosts and spirits, composed by people in prehistoric times. It is up to you to judge the veracity of the opinion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->One day, Vaedarbhi, the son of Bhrgu, asked the learned sage Pippala&#x301;da, &ldquo;My Lord what is Intuitional Science (Brahmavijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na)? What is the relation between Brahma and the world? Please tell me something about them.&rdquo; The sage replied:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ara&#x301;iva rathana&#x301;bhao pra&#x301;n&#x301;e sarvam&#x301; pratis&#x301;t&#x301;itam<br>Rco yaju&#x301;m&#x301;si sa&#x301;ma&#x301;ni yajin&#x32D;ahks&#x301;atram&#x301; Brahma ca.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Just as the spokes are attracted to the hub of a wheel, similarly every object in this universe is Brahma-centric and thus has kept up its individual existence. The nucleus of the Cosmic System is the source of all entities from the highest of created being down to the lowest insect. Rk. (Incantations), Yaju (invocations), Sa&#x301;ma (songs) or the individuals engaged in Viprocita or Ksa&#x301;trocita service (i.e. service befitting a Brahmin or a Ks&#x301;atriya) &ndash; all are dependent on Brahma, the source of their existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Praja&#x301;patishcarasi garbhe tvameva pratija&#x301;yase<br>Tubhyam&#x301; Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a praja&#x301;stiima&#x301; balim&#x301; haranti yah pra&#x301;n&#x301;aeh pratitis&#x301;t&#x301;hasi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word, Praja&#x301;, means evolved objects. Brahma is of course Praja&#x301;pati or the Lord of evolved objects for He is the controller of all of them. Praja&#x301;pati-brahma&#x301; moves about in the womb as the embryo and when it is born, the event, in fact, should actually be called the reflex birth of Brahma instead of His birth, because all created entities are merely manifestations of Brahma Himself. For instance, there is only one moon, but its reflection falling in the countless footprints of cows (Gos&#x301;pada) appears as countless moons. No new moons are created. The same moon is being reflected in several receptacles. Similarly one Brahma is manifesting Himself over an infinite number of units in countless mental receptacles. Brahma is Absolute Bliss. That is why the units or microcosms are always racing with the help of their sensory and motor organs towards their inner selves, i.e. towards the attainment of happiness. So it is said that knowingly or unknowingly the units are moving towards Him to attain Him, filled with inspiration from Him. (Several times in the Atharva Veda the word, &ldquo;Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;, has been used to mean Purus&#x301;a and the word, &ldquo;Rayi&rdquo; to mean Prakrti).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Deva&#x301;na&#x301;masi bahn&#x301;itamah pitrn&#x301;am&#x301; prathama svadha<br>Rs&#x301;iin&#x301;a&#x301;in&#x32D;caritam&#x301; satyamatharva&#x301;ungirasa&#x301;masi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Here the word, Deva, means the carrier of sensations, i.e., organs and nerves. Through the organs and nerves the body expresses a sensation or feeling and that is why they are called Devas or gods of the microcosmic body. But these organs and nervous systems are completely dependent on the spine for their existence and functions. Sensation is transmitted along the spine and that is why without a spine the unit would be a motionless, inert, fleshy mass. The above Shloka declares that, what spine is to the unit, Brahma is to the universe. Without Brahma the universe would be utterly destroyed, the seed of the imagination would be completely obliterated. According to an ancient custom, the death rites in honor of the deceased used to be performed by using Svadha&#x301; mantra (i.e., an invocation chanted while offering a sacrifice to the spirits of the dead). That is why, it is said that Brahma, as the first and foremost point in order of succession, is as important to all mundane objects as the first recipient of obsequial oblations is to the subsequent ones. To the sages He is as sacred as the vow of truthfulness. By Rs&#x301;is or sages I mean those who have hastened the advancement of human civilization by inventing or discovering things through their Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practices. Such sages make the base of their lives on truth; without truthfulness intellectual expansion towards the Supreme is not possible. Let us here discuss the meaning of the word, Truth. People generally use four words, Satya, Tothya, Samyak and Rta synonymously or in an identical sense. But in reality there is a great difference in their meanings. The English equivalents of Tathya, Samyak and Rta are &ldquo;Fact&rdquo;, &ldquo;Correct&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; respectively. But in other languages &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; (Truth) has no equivalent. The Philosophical meaning of the word &ldquo;Satya&rdquo;, is unchangeable, i.e., that which has no distortion, that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person. Human life progresses through different stages &ndash; from childhood to adolescence, from adolescence to youth, youth to old age and old age to senility. It is through these changes that people progress. That is why human life or its receptacle, the body, is not Satya&#x301; or Truth. There is yet another philosophical meaning of the word, &ldquo;Satya&rdquo;, which is Citsvaru&#x301;pa (the Supreme consciousness) or Purus&#x301;a. In the field of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice the meaning of &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; is &ldquo;Parahit&#x301;artham&#x301; va&#x301;unmanaso yatha&#x301;rthatvam&#x301; satyam&rdquo; i.e., Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others. No matter what meaning of &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; we accept, a benevolent sage has got to be truthful. The creation of one who has not learnt to regard the blissful, unchangeable Entity as the ultimate goal is no creation &ndash; is a veritable negation of creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The great sage, Mahars&#x301;i Atharva&#x301;, who lived in ancient times, while he was practicing Brahma-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, was the first to gain intuitional knowledge by the grace of Brahma. He taught that knowledge to Mahars&#x301;i Aun&#x32D;gira&#x301;, who taught it to Satyava&#x301;ha. Satya&#x301;vaha in turn taught A&#x301;un&#x32D;girasa. So the sage says, Brahma, the source of all existing entities, is as important to them as Atharva&#x301;, the expounder of intuitional science, is to Aun&#x32D;girasa and his other students.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The word Indra means great or a king. Brahma is the controller of the vital force which keeps the organisms alive; we call Him Indra, when He controls our lives and our energies through His expressions.  We call Him Rudra or the God of thunder, when He, as our friend, saves us from the jaws of calamities through His affectionate and tender touch. He exists everywhere; He is present about us sometimes as a sound, sometimes as a thought or emotion and sometimes as a crude individual entity. There is not a place in the universe where He is not manifest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->What we take for a void is also full of Him. He is even in places where the intellect cannot reach, from where the imagination bounds back thwarted and baffled.<!-- /block --></p>

Take for instance, the backbone of the nervous system, the Svadha&#x301; of departed ancestors, the satya of the sages or Indra, Rudra, the sun &ndash; are all these separate entities? No, all is He, all is He, all is He. The person whose apparent name is Dhruvajyotih, whom a son calls &ldquo;father&rdquo; for he sees in him a father-like manifestation, a father calls &ldquo;Dheva&rdquo;, for he sees in him a son-like manifestation, a school boy, &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;, for he sees in him a teacher-like manifestation, and a tongawalla, &ldquo;Hey, Topee&rdquo;, for he sees the Topee (cap) as the all-important thing, in reality, are these addresses such as &ldquo;father&rdquo;, &ldquo;sir&rdquo; or &ldquo;hey topee&rdquo;, so many different persons? Actually, they are the result of looking at one Dhruvajyotih from different angles of vision.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Yada&#x301;tvamabhivarasasyathema&#x301; pra&#x301;n&#x301;a te praja&#x301;h<br>A&#x301;nandaru&#x301;pastis&#x301;t&#x301;hanti ka&#x301;mayannam&#x301; bhavisydiiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->There is nothing inanimate or insentient in this world; everything is animate and sentient. In some places consciousness is condensed and in other places it is uncondensed. Where consciousness is condensed, we say &ldquo;animate&rdquo; or &ldquo;sentient&rdquo;, and where it is uncondensed, i.e., where the influence of Prakrti is more predominant, we say, &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; or &ldquo;insentient&rdquo;. The difference between this so-called sentience and insentience is that the so-called sentient, due to its consciousness being condensed, is capable of controlling itself, but due to the uncondensed state of consciousness the so-called inert or insentient is entirely dependent on the wishes of Prakrti, i.e., it is compelled to behave according to the thought-process of the Macrocosmic Mind. This may stimulate a question in our minds. If the so-called inert object is subject to the wishes of the Cosmic Mind, then the Cosmic Grace must necessarily have to be on it only. If the sentient is capable of thought by itself, why should Brahma think for it at all? There is hardly any ground for Brahmic mercy to be showered upon it. The world is crude, and that is why He has kindly regulated its course of movements, so that it may not be smashed to smithereens by the impact of a comet. But to a sentient person He has allowed discretion to take poison or nectar. Is this consciousness then a curse to the living? No. To Him &ldquo;animate&rdquo; and &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; make no difference. He has no partiality for one or the other. The insentient do not work by themselves, and so they are not vulnerable to punishment or eligible for reward for vices or virtues, but the sentient attain the good or bad consequences of their acts&#8230; they experience pleasure and pain. Let one suffer or enjoy according to one&#146;s deed. He stands by His duties, why shouldn&#146;t He? With the birth of a child He provides milk in the mother&#146;s breasts, affection from the father and love from friends. Aren&#146;t these His mercies? After the scorching summer of the month of Vaesha&#x301;jha come the showers of the rainy season. These merciful showers are also His. From such changes rocks, iron or gold do not perceive pain or pleasure. It is living beings who endure or enjoy them. It is through these showers for their enjoyment that various things grow, and through them they all feel and enjoy the self-same Bliss Absolute, which Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. And so He has not only forgotten you, rather He gives you compassion and mercy for no compulsive reason &ndash; much more mercy perhaps than you even deserve.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Bra&#x301;tyastvam&#x301; Pra&#x301;n&#x301;aeka rs&#x301;iratta vishvasya satpatih<br>Vayama&#x301;dyasya da&#x301;ta&#x301;rah pita&#x301;tvam&#x301; ma&#x301;tarishvanah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The word, &ldquo;Bra&#x301;tya,&rdquo; means &ldquo;fallen&rdquo;. According to the social code if a Brahmin does not follow the principles worthy of a Brahmin, he/she will fall into the category of the Bra&#x301;tya. Similarly if a Ks&#x301;atriya or a Vaeshya does not act according to his Varn&#x301;a (color), he will be categorized as Bra&#x301;tya. The question of being Bra&#x301;tya or fallen does not arise in the case of a shu&#x301;dra, for all apostates are known as Shudras. Bra&#x301;tya Brahmin, Bra&#x301;tya Ks&#x301;atriya and Bra&#x301;tya Vaeshya, due to their acts being inconsistent with their respective Varn&#x301;as, are regarded as meaner than the Shu&#x301;dras who belong to the Varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama (Institution of social order). Here Brahma has been called Bra&#x301;tya, for He is above all the Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or prejudices of this social system, Varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama. No Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra can bind Him. All Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra-bound powers bow to His Glory. The Ajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na Bodhinii Tantra also says, &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->So long as there are Varn&#x301;a prejudices (caste-disparity, financial disparity, regional disparity, educational or other disparities) in human beings they can never realize or feel the non-distinctive, incessant flow of the Cosmic Essence, the integral Brahma &ndash; never, never can they do so. As long as they keep this caste-vanity as the trademarks, they will keep themselves enslaved to scriptural injunctions, because they regard one or the other Varn&#x301;a as the chief prop or mainstay of their mind. When a person through this spiritual and mental development or through their merger in the Supreme Being, identifies himself with Brahma who is above the Varn&#x301;as, they attain a position above scriptural injunctions whereupon to be bereft of Varn&#x301;a or color is the real Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->There is a reference in the Vedas to a sacred fire called &ldquo;Ekars&#x301;i.&rdquo; This fire used to be preserved with meticulous care. That is why the people in general held this Ekars&#x301;i fire in great esteem and paid greater respects to it than they did to any other fire. Now imagine, on one hand the Supreme Entity has been called Bra&#x301;tya or fallen, and on the other He has been revered as Ekars&#x301;i. Being beyond the confines of all Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or prejudices or consequential momenta, He remains unconfinable to or by any attribute, and the purity or Ekars&#x301;i, being considered the highest at the top of society, also remains immeasurable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->This Brahma is also the devourer or destroyer of all objects of the universe, for this universe is being conceived and lost in His mind-stuff. That is to say, just as He is continually creating His mentally conceived world in His Brahma&#x301;bha&#x301;va (or creative mood) on the one hand, similarly He is continually devouring it mercilessly as the Sam&#x301;harta&#x301; or Destroyer on the other. All objects, all entities of the world are His pabulum, His food and some day they all have got to offer their respective structures as oblations to Him. That is why it is said that the units are the givers of His food. What are they giving Him? They are giving away to Him their sense of ego &ndash; their pain-laden identities of petty selfishness.<!-- /block --></p>

This absolute consciousness manifests itself only in the innermost recess of a Sa&#x301;dhaka. A Sa&#x301;dhaka gets opportunity for Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for the realization of Brahma as long as the five vayus like Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, Apa&#x301;na etc., are active in his or her physical body. But generally such an opportunity only rarely comes to the lot of human beings, for the minds of most people, being extrovertive, run after external objects due to the propulsion of the senses. So when a human being&#146;s mind gets purified through Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, he or she becomes free from their sensual influences, and then alone do they realize within themselves the super-effulgence of the Supreme Being.  The self-realizer is one who sees the Supreme Soul in his or her soul.<!-- /block --></p>

The object takes exactly the same form in accordance with his or her desire. Hence he or she does not have to run unnecessarily about the external world in search of any object. He or she is all-satisfied and fully contented.
