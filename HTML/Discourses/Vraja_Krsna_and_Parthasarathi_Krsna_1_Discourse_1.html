<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s role is divided into two main parts &ndash; one is Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a; and the other is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king of Mathura. The natures and jurisdictions of the duties of the two aspects were different, hence the roles also were different. People in general could not become as easily intimate or familiar with the king Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; as they could be with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of Vrindavana. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was a sweet personality, and that sweetness was mixed with spirituality; whereas Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king was a tough personality, but that toughness was also mixed with spirituality. In both roles Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a set a unique example before the Indian people as well as the entire world, and the necessity to hold that example up before others is not yet over. Although the first part of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s life was that of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, instead of first discussing Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, I wish to discuss first Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king &ndash; Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->I have already said many things about Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. I gave a series of discourses on the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in Ranchi stretching over a long period. But the main theme there was the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata, and not Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. In this series of discourses, however, I propose to focus more upon Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a as the central figure. The context of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata will come up only incidentally, because it does not cover the whole life of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata cannot stand if we remove Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a from it; while if we wish to remove the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata and retain Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a will stand a bit diminished, though He will stand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Let us come first to the context of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king. He came to Mathura after leaving Gokula and Vrindavana.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Although valour, intrepidity and all such virtues had been much evident in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a during His early career in Gokula and Vrindavana, the element of sweetness was the most predominant quality in Him. To attract and draw people closer to Him by playing sweet and melodious tunes on His flute, to establish sweet relations of love and affection with all, and, in case of necessity, to take up arms in the interests of His favourite friends and followers &ndash; these were the deeds He used to do. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s devotees felt that He was their own. They would say, &ldquo;He is one of us. Of course, He is a great hero, far superior to us in all respects, but still He is ours.&rdquo; But that same Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a who did so much for His devotees, remaining so close to them in prosperity and adversity, found that that role did not permit Him to render maximum service to the human society that was being unbearably persecuted, humiliated and neglected. Therefore He gave up that role and assumed the role of a king. And that role started with the annihilation of Kansa.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of the term kam&#x301;sa? It means &ldquo;an entity that endangers the existence of others, that impedes their all-round progress and welfare&rdquo;. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, on the other hand, means &ldquo;an entity who leads others towards fulfilment&rdquo;. So the Entity who leads others towards perfect attainment, who cannot tolerate destructive ideas or destructive elements, was destined to annihilate Kansa and remove the thorns of sin from the physical, psychic and spiritual planes. This is dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Those forces, those demoniacal forces which are the main obstacles on the path of social progress, must be removed. Mercy or compassion may intervene, requesting, &ldquo;No, don&#146;t do that,&rdquo; but the circumstances compel it; and for this, an element of toughness is indispensable. This was not possible in the sweet and loving atmosphere of Vraja; the environment of Kuruks&#x301;etra was the proper place for that purpose.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Regarding the main role of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, I have already mentioned that although the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata does not cover all aspects of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s life and personality, it is nevertheless a fact that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s main role [i.e., that which the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata does cover] was that of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->First I shall analyse the origin of the word &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rtha&rdquo;. &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rtha&rdquo; is derived from &ldquo;Prtha&#x301;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prthu&rdquo;. Prtha&#x301; is the name of a particular kingdom, a kingdom where the princess Kunti lived. The word &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rtha&rdquo; is derived &ldquo;Prtha&#x301;&rdquo; + suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;a (imparting the sense of &ldquo;progeny&rdquo;, or &ldquo;offspring&rdquo;). That is, &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rtha&rdquo; means a son of Kunti (as does also &ldquo;Kaonteya&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In ancient India, before the arrival of the Aryans, the matriarchal system of inheritance as well as the matrilineal order of society was in vogue among the Austric and Dravidian communities. The people of those prehistoric times used to identify themselves in terms of their mother&#146;s lineage, and as such used to take on the name of their mother, grandmother or great-grandmother. If one was asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; one would have to give one&#146;s mother&#146;s, grandmother&#146;s or great-grandmother&#146;s name. Along with this matrilineal order, the matriarchal system of social inheritance, whereby the daughters would inherit the property from their mothers, was also in vogue. Two thousand years ago, the mother&#146;s name was considered the most important factor in naming a child. For instance, Lord Buddha&#146;s two main disciples were Sa&#x301;riputta and Maha&#x301;maggallan Arhan. &ldquo;Sa&#x301;riputta&rdquo; means &ldquo;the son of Sa&#x301;ri&rdquo;. His mother&#146;s full name (these people were all from Magadha, incidentally) was Ru&#x301;pasa&#x301;ri; and thus the son&#146;s name became &ldquo;Sa&#x301;riputra&rdquo; in old Sanskrit. In Pra&#x301;krta, it was changed to &ldquo;Sa&#x301;riputta&rdquo;, just as the Sanskrit word &ldquo;Ra&#x301;japutra&rdquo; became changed to &ldquo;Ra&#x301;japutta&rdquo; in Pra&#x301;krta (and &ldquo;Rajput&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rout&rdquo; [common surnames] in modern languages). And in the second case, the mother&#146;s name was Maha&#x301;maodgalii in Sanskrit, which became &ldquo;Maha&#x301;maggali&rdquo; in Pali. Her son was thus known as &ldquo;Maha&#x301;maggallan&rdquo; Arhan.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Here is another example: Once a merchant promised, as per the direction of Buddha, that he would build the new capital city of Magadha near the confluence of the Ganges and the Sone Rivers. The name of that merchant was Pa&#x301;t&#x301;aliputra,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> because his mother&#146;s name was Pa&#x301;t&#x301;ali. This demonstrates that ancient Indian society followed the matrilineal order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Thus Arjuna<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> was popularly known as Pa&#x301;rtha [&ldquo;the son of Prtha&#x301;&rdquo;]; he was also called Kaonteya [&ldquo;the son of Kunti&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->And what was the role of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? The role of a sa&#x301;rathi. Now let me explain what sa&#x301;rathi means. Sa&#x301;rathi means one who looks upon a chariot as one&#146;s own child. You may have come across some car drivers who take meticulous care of their motor cars. &ldquo;Hey, don&#146;t touch the paint job&#8230; don&#146;t jump in like that&#8230; don&#146;t sit down so hard&#8230; my car will be damaged&#8230; Hey, no, my car can&#146;t carry six or seven people, it will be damaged&#8230;&rdquo; They go to great lengths to ensure that their cars are not scratched or damaged in any way. In fact, they treat them as if they were their own children. One who similarly looks upon a ratha [chariot] as one&#146;s own child is called a sa&#x301;rathi. Rathena saha saratha [&ldquo;The one associated with a chariot is a charioteer&rdquo;]. Saratha + i suffix (imparting the sense of &ldquo;child&rdquo;) = sa&#x301;rathi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The sa&#x301;rathi of the chariot of Pa&#x301;rtha (i.e., of Arjuna) was none other than Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Himself [hence &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a assumed the role of sa&#x301;rathi. The sha&#x301;stras [scriptures] say that the sa&#x301;rathi plays a very significant role in physical fight, in spiritual fight, in all-round fight. It is said in the Yajurveda:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; rathinam&#x301; viddhi shariiram&#x301; rathameva tu;<br>Buddhintu sa&#x301;rathim&#x301; viddhi manah pragrahameva ca.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->[Know the a&#x301;tman, the soul, as the occupant of the chariot; the human body as the chariot; the buddhi, or intellect, as the charioteer; and the mind as the reins.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; rathinam&#x301; viddhi. There is a chariot. The a&#x301;tma&#x301; [self] is likened to the person seated in the chariot. That person is the master.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Shariiram&#x301; rathameva tu. The physical body is likened to a chariot (and is sometimes also compared to a temple). A chariot has to be kept neat and clean and fit to move. A temple is also to be kept neat and clean, jhakjhake taktake [clean and shiny], because it is the nucleus of all activities. And with a chariot as nucleus, one can move. Hence Shariiram dharmamandiram [&ldquo;The human body is the temple of God&rdquo;]. The human body has to be kept neat and clean. Cleanliness is a fundamental principle of every sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual aspirant].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->How should you maintain your body? In Bengali it is said, jhakjhake taktake. In Sanskrit tak means &ldquo;sparkling white, dazzlingly clean&rdquo;; hence the word taktake in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There is a fruit which, when eaten, removes all diseases from the body. Hr + nini = hari, &ldquo;that which steals&rdquo;, and taki means &ldquo;that which cleans and enhances the glow of the skin&rdquo;: hence the fruit is called haritaki [myrobalan].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Haritakih manus&#x301;ya&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; ma&#x301;teva hitaka&#x301;rin&#x301;ii;<br>Kada&#x301;cit kupyate ma&#x301;ta&#x301; nodarstha&#x301; haritakih.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->[Myrobalan is benevolent like a mother. A mother sometimes gets angry, but not myrobalan when it is eaten.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Both a chariot and a human body have to be kept neat and clean. Buddhintu sa&#x301;rathim&#x301; viddhi. The buddhi that leads humanity, the pinnacled intellect that brings spiritual aspirants in close contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a [Supreme Consciousness], is compared to the sa&#x301;rathi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Manah pragrahameva ca. While driving a chariot, the charioteer needs a rein (la&#x301;ga&#x301;m in popular Bengali). The mana [mind] is likened to the rein.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Human existence is a composite of four factors: the unit self, the body, the intellect (which exercises control over your mind) and finally Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; the Supreme Controller of your unit existence. You must advance while developing each of the four &ndash; you cannot afford to loosen your hold on or neglect any one of the four. If one deviates a little from the right path, one may earn a lot of wealth, but one will surely invite one&#146;s ruination as the occupant of the chariot-like body. Your chariot-like physical frame will be shattered, your rein-like mind will be loosened and snapped beyond repair, and your sa&#x301;rathi<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> will be viru&#x301;pa [temporarily angry with you] and vimukha [turn His back on you]. One can bear it if He becomes viru&#x301;pa, but not if He becomes vimukha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->There is a clear distinction between viru&#x301;pa [displeased] and vimukha [permanently angry]. Let me illustrate. Suppose someone asks me a question that irritates me and I am displeased with that questioner. I may burst out, &ldquo;You stupid fool. I won&#146;t answer your silly question.&rdquo; This is an example of viru&#x301;pata&#x301;. After some time I may cool down, and will of course regain my usual composure. Then supposing the person says, &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;, please forgive me, who will help me if you don&#146;t?&rdquo; I may say, &ldquo;Tell me what you want.&rdquo; The previous displeasure is gone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->But vimukhata&#x301; is different: &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;, let me say just one word to you &ndash; just one word, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no talk. I won&#146;t listen to you at all,&rdquo; I may say. It means I have turned my face away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Similarly, if your Charioteer is ever displeased with you for your mistakes, He will guide you back to the right path (after all, you are only human); but if He is permanently angry it will be highly painful, unbearably painful. You may happen to make your sa&#x301;rathi, Parama Purus&#x301;a, displeased due to your inadvertence, but you must never make Him permanently angry with you.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata literally means &ldquo;Great  India&rdquo;. Hence Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata became the name both for the campaign led by Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to unify India, and for the epic composition about that campaign. Both the campaign and the narration of the epic begin at a point when Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is already a king &ndash; Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi.<br> After the author of the present book had spoken in Ranchi in 1968 on the two topics (the campaign and the epic), those speeches  were collected in the book Discourses on the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  Mathura was at that time the capital of the kingdom  of Shurasena, and Gokula and Vrindavana were villages within the kingdom.  Mathura was and still is an important city. The Gokula and Vrindavana  of that time fall within what is now the larger town of Vrindavana.  All lie in the modern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)   The cousin of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. He imprisoned King Ugrasena  (Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s grandfather), usurped the throne, and, out of  fear arising from a prophecy, imprisoned his cousin Devaki and her husband Vasudeva, killing each  of their children as they were born. Two of the children, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a  and his brother Balarama, escaped destruction. Kansa spent years trying  to find and assassinate the young Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)  &ldquo;Vraja&rdquo; was a term for Gokula and Vrindavana  (for further discussion of the term, see p. 47). Kuruks&#x301;etra  was the battlefield of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata war. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)  The city that the merchant built was also named Pataliputra, and is now a well-known part of modern-day Patna, capital of the Indian  state of Bihar. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn6">6</a></b>)  Arjuna was the greatest warrior of that era and the  closest friend and disciple of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. During the war  of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a agreed to be Arjuna&#146;s  charioteer. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn7">7</a></b>)  Buddhintu sa&#x301;rathim&#x301; viddhi. In the shloka  the sa&#x301;rathi represents the buddhi, the discriminating  faculty, or pinnacled intellect. But since it is the buddhi  that brings spiritual aspirants in close contact with Parama  Purus&#x301;a, the sa&#x301;rathi ultimately comes to represent  Parama Purus&#x301;a. &ndash;Eds.</p>
