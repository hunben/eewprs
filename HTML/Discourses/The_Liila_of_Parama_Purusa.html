<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the beginning, Parama Purus&#x301;a was one. Eko&#146;ham&#x301; bahusyam &ndash; &ldquo;I am one and I will be many.&rdquo; In the course of the centrifugal movement of the Cosmic Cycle, we find the emergence of five fundamental factors; and in pratisain&#x32D;cara<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> we find the creation of innumerable living entities with their respective bodies, minds, lives, consciousnesses, etc. Thus arose the kaleidoscopic creation with Parama Purus&#x301;a as the Supreme Progenitor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This vast universe is the manifestation of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. The unit body, mind, etc., depend on His sweet will. The sun, the moon, the human kingdom, in fact, the entire natural world is dependent on Him for its very existence and unfoldment. The final ownership of everything, manifest or unmanifest, lies with Him. He can put any object into any position He likes. For example, He can change an adult into a tender child, a male into a female, or a man into an animal. Nothing is difficult for Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Demonstration<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; gave a practical demonstration on this point at the Lucknow airport in front of numerous sa&#x301;dhakas (spiritual aspirants). He pointed to a sa&#x301;dhaka and said that he (the sa&#x301;dhaka) might be converted into a child, an animal, or a female. In the presence of all, He transformed him within minutes first into a child, then into a female, and lastly into a goat. Parama Purus&#x301;a can effect such changes by touch or gestures or even by mental processes. With the help of a little stick, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; touched the body of a sa&#x301;dhaka and removed the vrttis (propensities) of hatred, shame, and fear, and the sa&#x301;dhaka felt himself to be a small child. He was so simple, like a child, that he could even go out naked and move about throughout the town of Lucknow. Then he was changed into a female. His physical gestures were much akin to those of ladies. Next he was converted into a goat, which stood on all fours. He began to rub his head against Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;&#146;s body. He totally lost human sense, even his capacity for human hearing. He was unable to follow the language Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; was using to make others understand.]<!-- /block --></p>
