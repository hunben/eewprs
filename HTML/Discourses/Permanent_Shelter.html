<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In this world of objectivity, everything comes within the territory of time, place and person; and it is the wont of every created being, and especially of human beings, to search for a shelter. And a shelter of permanent nature is extremely necessary for these floating microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What will be the best shelter? Everything that comes within the jurisdiction of temporal, spatial and personal factors is moving, is of transient nature. So nothing in this world can be your permanent shelter. If you want permanent shelter, you will have to go beyond the jurisdiction of this expressed world of three fundamental relative factors, and such a transcendent factor is <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. Hence <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is your only shelter. There cannot be any second shelter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Once I said, He is the only Desideratum and there should not be any plural for &ldquo;Desideratum&rdquo;. That is, &ldquo;desiderata&rdquo; should never be used, because He is a singular Entity, and He is the goal. So the path of spirituality is the path of wise men.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And each and every human being moves within boundaries of perfection. Human progress is nothing but a movement from imperfection to perfection. It is the natural wont of the human mind that whatever is its object, it is converted into that object. And when that Supreme Entity becomes your object, you will take the form of the Supreme Entity. You will be one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And one thing I told you in a <i>maha&#x301;cakra</i> &ndash; you should not think that <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is your object and you are the subject, because He is the Supreme centre of all objectivities. He cannot be your object; you are His object. Each and every entity in this Universe is His object. He cannot be your object. While doing sadhana, while doing your meditation, you should always think, remember, that whatever you are doing, He is seeing. That is, you are the object, He is the subject. He sees whatever you do. He sees whatever you think.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->To think is to speak within the mind. Whatever you think, whatever you speak within your mind, is then and there tape-recorded by Him. So nothing remains secret. So while doing your meditation and other forms of sadhana, you should always remember that He is your Supreme Subject and you are His object. He sees whatever you do, and this is the final secret. What should I say? This is the greatest secret of the Universe, and this secret no longer remains a secret because all of you know it.<!-- /block --></p>
