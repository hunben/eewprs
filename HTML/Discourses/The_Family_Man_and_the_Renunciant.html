<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Once there was a great king who by his benevolent rule had gained such affectionate respect that he was called Janaka, which means &ldquo;father.&rdquo; A certain yogi who had been receiving instructions from his guru, was told that for the completion of his lessons he should go to learn from King Janaka. The yogi was dismayed that he, a monk, a renunciate, should be directed for spiritual guidance to a mere family man, and a king at that! Yet, in due respect to his guru, he went to King Janaka who was reclining upon his throne, chewing betel nut. That yogi was quite relieved when King Janaka requested him to rest for some hours before coming for his consultation. Shortly thereafter, having just completed his bath, and having hung out his underwear to dry, the yogi noticed that the capital city was being besieged from all sides, that fire was leaping from building to building outside the castle. Concerned that his underwear might be scorched, the yogi hurriedly went to save it. While grabbing for it he happened to observe King Janaka standing on his roof. Having given the command to his servants and soldiers to save the town, the king was now standing calmly on the rooftop, not deviating even slightly from his mental composure. In utter amazement the yogi realized that before him was a true spiritualist &ndash; a king who had less attachment for his kingdom than the yogi for his underwear. From that moment on, he accepted King Janaka as his second guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You see, as far as spiritual elevation is concerned, there is no difference between the householder or family man, and the renunciate. It is really a question of sincerity in spiritual practice. But the task of the family man is more difficult: he has to serve both his small family and his Universal Family. For the renunciate there is only the Universal Family to serve, but the family man must always maintain a balance between his small family and his large Family. He cannot neglect either one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->But I must add, that for him in whom the spirit of dedication to the Universal Family has arisen, the path of renunciation alone is suitable. A family man cannot serve the Universal Family 100 percent; he must attend as well to his small family. To dedicate oneself completely to the service of the Universal Family, one must follow the life of a renunciate.<!-- /block --></p>
