<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Question &ndash; What are the psychological defects of materialism?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Answer &ndash; The characteristic (Dharma) of the mind is to seek the infinite. The mind attains this goal by concentrating on a particular ideation. As material objects are finite, those who accept them as the aim of life eventually feel frustrated. They fail to attain bliss because neither wealth nor material objects can be enjoyed infinitely. Moreover, those who make material objects their aim in life find their self-interests in conflict with those of other people. They try to deprive others, to protect their own endless greed for wealth and material objects. There will have to be a continuous pressure on the minds of these people to keep them away from material objects. People cannot tolerate such imposition and, on becoming disgruntled, take the path of revolution or counter-revolution against those who pressurize them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Materialism functions by imposing social pressure on people to enjoy material objects; and accepts that as the only mode of operation. Thus, in materialistic countries or societies, people look at one another with suspicion and act according to the information given by the intelligence agencies. In absence of spiritual ideas, firmness of morality cannot be established. The apparent morality in a materialistic society is nothing but an immoral alliance to protect self-interests.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Without spiritual ideals true morality based on universal love cannot be awakened. Unless God is accepted as the creator of all, human fraternity is impossible since God&#146;s authority as the universal father is denied. Only spiritual ideals and spiritual desires can lead humanity onto the path of well-being. Universalism, cosmic ideation and cosmic bliss, unlike the material objects composed of the five fundamental factors, are not limited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Therefore, humanity should be inspired to move on the path of spirituality, or else nothing worthwhile will be achieved. Those who don&#146;t accept this spiritual ideology will have to be kept under some social or external pressure to check the greed of usurping others&#146; property. Proper education will also have to be imparted. However, it should be borne in mind that merely exerting circumstantial pressure is not enough. This pressure-tactic will no longer be necessary once the ideology is accepted. Those who believe in spiritual ideals, but don&#146;t believe in the policy of exerting external pressure, in other words, the application of physical force, will find it utterly impossible to achieve their goals. In this world there are many people who ignore pious appeals. On such people social or other types of pressure will have to be imposed. No problem will ever be solved if one waits indefinitely for their consciousness to be awakened. Like materialism, spirituality based on non-violence will be of no benefit to humanity. The words of non-violence may sound noble, and quite appealing, but on the solid ground of reality have no value whatsoever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Question &ndash; Is a social classification based on profession appropriate?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Answer &ndash; Nothing in this universe is valueless. In the age of undeveloped science, when industries were essentially cottage industries, families used to work in the same profession for generations. Children and grandchildren used to practice the same profession for many years, and as a result of their endeavours, progressed well. Therefore, classifying families on the basis of profession was not improper in those days.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->However, the world of today has changed substantially and professions are not necessarily inherited. Due to the rapid expansion of technology, the system of hereditary profession is not easily maintained. Thus, social classification on the basis of profession is meaningless today. Apart from that, even during the age when social classification was justifiable, there was no necessity for social divisions on the basis of caste.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Question &ndash; Can a singular economic theory be adopted for all countries, at all times and for all strata of society?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Answer &ndash; No. Social ideals and systems should be formulated after considering the time, space and person as well as the all-round progress of the society. It may be that something which is quite useful for a particular time, space and person is totally worthless for a different time, space and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Society is not a static entity, but a dynamic one. The ideology which was formulated in relevance to a particular time, space and person and which was once considered beneficial, becomes backward and outdated with the change in time, space and person. As the society progresses it is considered as an anachronism in the later period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Be it Marxism, or any other socioeconomic theory, one cannot cling to it blindly because each theory is optimum only for a particular time, space and person. Short-sighted people, after observing the effectiveness of a theory in a particular context, begin to believe in its eternal effectiveness. This is certainly an illusion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Question &ndash; There is no other alternative except A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga to sustain human beings in their joint endeavours. Why?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Answer &ndash; A united human society is the prerequisite for the development of civilization. The collective desire for survival ensures society&#146;s meaningful existence. The society is a dynamic entity and its survival indicates its inherent dynamism. When a group of people bound by the ties of a common ideology move together along a particular path, inviting fellow humans to join them to share their common joys and sorrows, theirs is a real movement; they are destined to be successful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In this universe of rapid temporal, spatial and personal change, no specific economic, political, or religious structure can be the permanent aim of humanity. This is because theories are born in a particular temporal, spatial and economic context. People can move along the path of eternal progress only (1), by accepting the Cosmic Entity, who is beyond time, space and person, as the aim of life, and (2), by continuing to do all their worldly actions while moving along that path towards Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga is that path of progress, and that is why A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga is the only alternative for the preservation of human existence and civilization. The external rituals, the so-called Dharmas, are not Dharma but mere religion. They are subject to change depending on time, space and person. By manifesting distinctions within themselves and outside themselves (such as the differences between Vija&#x301;tiya Bheda, Svaja&#x301;tiya Bheda and Svaja&#x301;ta), religions, like other relative factors, have invited the repression of humanity by creating dogmas, bloodshed and similar evils. Thus religion cannot bring peace to humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
