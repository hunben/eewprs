<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The usual name of the Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da school of philosophy is Uttara Miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301; Darshana. It was originally propounded by Va&#x301;dara&#x301;yan&#x301;a Vya&#x301;sa, yet it was developed by Shankaracharya, and more than ninety percent of it was influenced by Shankaracharya&#146;s Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da [the Doctrine of Illusion]. Needless to say, Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da and Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da emerged long after the advent of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There is no scope to discuss Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da or Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da in great detail here, nor is it necessary to do so. Its chief contention is Brahma satyam&#x301; jaganmithya&#x301; jiivah Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah &ndash; &ldquo;Brahma alone is real; the jagat [the creation] is false or illusory; all jiivas are nothing except Brahma.&rdquo; Later I will explain what is really meant by the term Brahma, and what is meant by &ldquo;Brahma alone is real.&rdquo; I will also explain how they interpret the concepts of jagat and mithya&#x301;. But just now I will discuss jiivah Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah &ndash; &ldquo;all jiivas are nothing except Brahma.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Jiivas are finite entities, handicapped by microcosmic limitations, suffering from numerous imperfections and weaknesses. People err all the time on account of their ingrained psycho-spiritual weaknesses. They often commit errors unknowingly and then realize that they have acted improperly and feel repentant. Sometimes they do not repent at all and sometimes they do not even realize their mistakes, what to speak of repent. These are the inherent imperfections, the ingrained weaknesses, of the microcosm. No right-minded person can deny this. Had all the microcosms been Brahma, such digressions would never have been made. Thus the contention that all jiivas are Brahma is a glaring defect of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da in the practical sphere. If, even after seeing this serious flaw in their philosophy, they still contend that the philosophy is true, does it not amount to hypocrisy?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->If after realizing the ingrained defects of the microcosm someone argues that they are not actually defects in practice, but only appear to be so due to the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, then the question arises, what is this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;? Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is explained as aghat&#x301;ana ghat&#x301;ana pat&#x301;iiyasii Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; [&ldquo;the dexterous hand of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; that can even create things impossible to create&rdquo;]. Advaetava&#x301;da [non-dualism] contends that in reality nothing happens, but Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; works in such a dexterous way that it seems as if something is happening. She who is very dexterous in this business of making what is not happening seem that it is happening, is known as Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Suppose, for example, that Calcutta is non-existent, but due to the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; appears to exist. If Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; can make something appear, then where did this something come from? The city of Calcutta must have come from either something or nothing. If it appeared out of nothing, then that nothing must have a negative existence; and if it appeared out of something then that something must have a positive existence. Whether it is positive or negative in character, it is, after all, existence. If everything except Brahma is false then this existence is also false. So it logically follows that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has built the city of Calcutta out of false materials. The whole thing seems impractical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now, if one contends that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has built something out of false materials then one must admit the existence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. By admitting the existence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; in this way one recognizes the existence of two entities: Brahma and the miracle-creating Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Brahma exists along with the dexterous Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; which makes nothing appear as something &ndash; non-existent Calcutta as existent Calcutta. So how many entities are there? Two. Then is this advaetava&#x301;da [non-dualism, monism] or is it dvaetava&#x301;da [dualism]? Monism surrenders to dualism and thereby digs its own grave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->To avoid the stigma of self-contradiction, the proponents of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da go one step further and declare that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is mithya&#x301; svabha&#x301;va&#x301;; that is, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; also is unreal. It is the folly of madmen to claim on the one hand that whatever we perceive is the creation of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and on the other hand that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; Herself is unreal. Hence Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is full of contradictions from beginning to end. This sort of error is called prama&#x301;da in Sanskrit: error in the beginning, error in the middle and error in the end. The entire advaetava&#x301;da is prama&#x301;dagrasta [full of errors].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Jiiva Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah. It is as if Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; was trying to convince the jiivas, &ldquo;You are jiivas with bodies of flesh and blood, but living in a non-existent Calcutta, and those physical bodies are also unreal. You think you are jiivas, but actually you are Brahma.&rdquo; They claim that you are unreal because you have been created by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, but in the next breath they claim that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; Herself is unreal. Thus the entire philosophy is self-contradictory in nature. When one tells a lie, one is forced to concoct hundreds of additional lies to protect oneself from the stigma of falsehood. In exactly the same way, the proponents of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da have had to concoct one lie after another to protect their untenable position.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Once a certain maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a who happened to be an orthodox Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;din was walking along the road in Kashi [adjacent to Varanasi]. The popular saying goes that Kashi is famous for four things, for s&#x301;a&#x301;nr&#x301;, ra&#x301;nr&#x301;, sinr&#x301;i, sannya&#x301;sii &ndash; the bulls which throng the streets; the many widows; the stairs which one has to climb up or down every few metres; and the thousands of itinerant monks &ndash; and that in Kashi one should carefully avoid these four things. Anyway, one morning a wild bull suddenly started to charge that maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a, so he ran away as fast as his legs could carry him. A logician who happened to be standing nearby asked the maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a, &ldquo;Well sir, if you say that this world is unreal, then the bull is also unreal, so why are you running in fear?&rdquo; That maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a would not accept any defeat in logic and replied, &ldquo;My running away is also unreal.&rdquo; This is the way things went on for many centuries.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Though not so relevant, it would be good to mention one thing here. In those days, Baoddha [Buddhistic] Shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da was the dominant school of thought. It was a kind of nihilism. This philosophical doctrine had left the people cynical and brought them to the brink of disaster. In order to eliminate Shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da by any means, the word Brahma was used in place of the word Shu&#x301;nya. This was not the Brahma as understood by genuine spiritualists, rather, it was merely an equivalent of the term Shu&#x301;nya. It was nothing more than that, and this has been stated in clear terms. Shankaracharya said, Yatha&#x301; shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;dina&#x301;m&#x301; Shu&#x301;nyam&#x301; Brahma Brahmavida&#x301;m&#x301;statha&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;The Brahmava&#x301;dins use the term Brahma in the same way as the nihilistic Shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;dins use the term Shu&#x301;nya.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->To use the term Brahma in this way is acceptable neither to a philosopher nor to a devotee. If advaetava&#x301;da contends that this manifested universe has emanated from the One and will return to the One, that this plurality has evolved from the Supreme Singularity &ndash; Ekam&#x301; Sad vipra&#x301;h bahudha&#x301; yad vadanti [&ldquo;The Supreme Entity is one, but intellectuals explain It in various ways&rdquo;] &ndash; and if they present thousands of similar arguments, then their contention will not stand in jeopardy. But if, while trying to justify the existence of this kind of Brahma (the Shu&#x301;nya of nihilism) they deny the existence of any other entity or idea operating in the psychic, physical or psycho-spiritual spheres, then it is unmitigated foolishness. Regarding this, Jayanta Bhatta, the famous scholar and courtier of the Kashmiri king, Shankar Varma, said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Yadi ta&#x301;vat advaetasiddheh prama&#x301;n&#x301;am asti, tarhi tadeva dvitiiyamiti na&#x301;dvaetam atha na&#x301;sti prama&#x301;n&#x301;am. Netara&#x301;n&#x301; advaetam apra&#x301;ma&#x301;n&#x301;ika&#x301;ya&#x301; siddherabha&#x301;va&#x301;diti mantra&#x301;rtha<br>va&#x301;dottha vikalpamu&#x301;lam advaetava&#x301;dam&#x301; parihrtya tasma&#x301;d upeyata&#x301;mes&#x301;a pada&#x301;rthabhedah pratyaks&#x301;a liun&#x32D;ga&#x301;gama&#x301;gamyama&#x301;nah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The first part of his observation is quite correct. The fallibility of advaetava&#x301;da has been clearly shown. Only the portion upeyata&#x301;mes&#x301;a pada&#x301;rthabhedah is debatable. The fallibility of advaetava&#x301;da and its uselessness in the field of dharma are bound to be accepted by all. Advaetava&#x301;da can be compared to unalloyed gold which itself is of no practical use. The scholar argues, &ldquo;If you contend that there are prama&#x301;n&#x301;as [proofs] in support of advaetava&#x301;da, then you are obviously supporting dvaetava&#x301;da [dualism]. Advaetava&#x301;da on the one hand, and its supporting logic on the other hand, are two entities, and so it is dualism. If you say &lsquo;No, my advaetava&#x301;da is not based on any valid logic, it is only advaetava&#x301;da,&rsquo; then I will not accept advaetava&#x301;da! Without proof I will not accept it.&rdquo; That is why Jayanta Bhatta declares that advaetava&#x301;da is based upon jugglery of words and philosophical rigmarole and as such does not deserve to be accepted. He asserts in his defense, upeyata&#x301;mes&#x301;a pada&#x301;rthabhedah; that is, people should acquire knowledge according to its three valid sources (direct perception, inference and authority) as propounded by Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya or Nya&#x301;ya philosophy. However, one should not base one&#146;s deductions on Nya&#x301;ya philosophy, which contends that the jiivas and Parama Purus&#x301;a continue to remain separate entities, that the Supreme Entity does not attract the jiivas towards Himself nor do the jiivas attract the Supreme entity towards themselves. This is opposed to the fundamental principles of science. According to science, every entity attracts every other entity, sometimes knowingly, sometimes unknowingly. That Entity whose irresistible attraction frees the jiivas from bondage is Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Let us now turn to Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a (as I mentioned earlier that we would). Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is not the Brahma of advaetava&#x301;da. Neither is He any worldly entity; He is an entity beyond the world. And jiivah Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah. In fact, Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is none other than Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. This is something which can be readily demonstrated. I told you a little while ago that every entity attracts every other entity. Due to this force of mutual attraction, the stars, planets, meteors, and nebulae continue to move in their respective paths. In the event of the slightest weakening of this force the whole cosmological order would lose its balance and fall like a meteor. Just as planets continue to move around the sun in their respective orbits due to the force of attraction, in exactly the same way, all created beings move round Parama Purus&#x301;a, my beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, knowingly or unknowingly. Some love Him consciously, others unconsciously. Some love Him while thinking &ldquo;I don&#146;t love;&rdquo; some sincerely believe in Him and love Him passionately, yet nonetheless continue to argue about Him because they want to find more and more justification for their love of Him. Even those who say &ldquo;I don&#146;t love Him&rdquo; have love for Him, but their love is a negative love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->There are devotees who long to hear the name Ra&#x301;dheshya&#x301;ma [a name of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a] over and over again. So if anyone says &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dheshya&#x301;ma,&rdquo; they pretend to be extremely angry. Seeing how irritated they have become, the utterer of &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dheshya&#x301;ma&rdquo; takes delight in repeating it again and again. The devotees are also delighted for they get a chance to hear the Lord&#146;s name spoken so many times. This is why they so cleverly feign anger.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There is a story in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Sita was surrounded by a number of ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asiis<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> who were guarding her in the Ashoka forest. Ravana, being obsessed with the annihilation of Rama, his arch-enemy, repeated Rama&#146;s name over and over again, saying that he should be defeated in battle. To repeat Rama&#146;s name was actually his inner desire. But he had instructed Sita&#146;s ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii attendants to tell her not to take the name of Rama. However, by telling Sita, &ldquo;Sita, Rama&#146;s name is not to be uttered,&rdquo; they were also unwittingly repeating the name of the Lord: Sita-Rama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->All human beings love Parama Purus&#x301;a, some consciously, some unconsciously. A healthy person who delivers fiery lectures on atheism during a symposium quickly apologizes to the Lord when he starts getting heart palpitations. &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, You know how deeply I love You,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I only said those things to help the theists to find more points in favour of God.&rdquo; Then and there the palpitation stops and he says, &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, this shows that You love me whether I speak for theism or not. In the future, I&#146;ll criticize You more, just to save my prestige among my friends, but I&#146;ll beg Your forgiveness before doing so.&rdquo; Similarly, there are many leaders today who accept money from the capitalists to get their work done, but tell the people, &ldquo;We hate the capitalists, we hate the capitalists.&rdquo; But behind the scenes they tell the capitalists, &ldquo;We are just telling the people these things. It will be to our mutual benefit.&rdquo; The atheist psychology functions like this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->All created beings in the universe move around Parama Purus&#x301;a for their very survival, otherwise their existence would be jeopardized. The centripetal and centrifugal forces can never coexist. So the contention of Vedanta philosophy (Vedanta is another name for Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da), jiivah Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah [&ldquo;all jiivas are nothing except Brahma&rdquo;] is downright falsehood. In reality, the jiivas are moving around Him. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the shelter of the jiivas, and the jiivas are sheltered in Him. When devotion is aroused in the jiivas, that is, when the centripetal force becomes predominant, the jiivas rush towards the Nucleus, decreasing their radius with every surge in devotion. The closer one comes to Parama Purus&#x301;a, the more the devotees feel that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is not a man, but a bha&#x301;va [devotional sentiment born out of psycho-spiritual parallelism] personified. The more one advances on the spiritual path, the more one realizes that Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is not only a bha&#x301;va, but is the life of one&#146;s life. As one advances even further one realizes, &ldquo;He is not only the life of my life; I have no existence apart from Him. My existence depends upon His existence alone. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a exists and due to this, I exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So we find that Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da is a defective, illogical and impractical philosophy. When human beings realize that their hearts can be illuminated by the spiritual effulgence of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a they turn away from the arid desert of philosophical rigmarole. Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da is like last week&#146;s newspaper &ndash; it carries no importance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, resplendent in His own glory, has been illuminating the minds of all jiivas of the universe, and thereafter attracting them to Himself. This is a never-ending process. It started in beginninglessness and will merge into endlessness. Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da shines for a few days in the world of logic, but is subsequently extinguished in the folds of darkness. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, however, will continue to exist as the source and nucleus of the endless creation, and at the same time will continue to draw all unto Him by the force of His irresistible charm and universal love. Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da came into existence as a school of philosophy only recently, just 1500 years ago. But Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a existed even before philosophy emerged, long before human beings were born on the soil of the earth, and will remain in future. He will still remain when not even a single microcosm remains alive on this planet. He is eternal and infinite. He is established in His own matchless glory; He is the embodiment of effulgence; He is vast. Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da concedes defeat to Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a even more ignobly than does Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. It cannot approach the greatness of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Moreover, it has not the least capacity to taste the sweetness of His great personality.<!-- /block --></p>
