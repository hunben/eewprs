<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[The first topic involved five things, namely, the conscious mind, the subconscious mind, the unconscious mind, cerebral memory and extra-cerebral memory. Physical actions such as seeing, smelling, hearing, etc., are within the scope of the conscious mind. Functions such as recollection and thinking fall within the field of the subconscious mind.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Cerebral memory is achieved by the subconscious mind with the help of the nerve-cells and the nerve-fibres. This is the first prong in the three-pronged activity of the subconscious mind, [the other two being extra-cerebral] memory and revelation. This first prong, cerebral memory, covers recollection only of the things belonging to the present life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The second prong is extra-cerebral memory, which is the recollection of matters of previous lives. The subconscious mind achieves this independently of the nerve-cells and nerve-fibres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The third prong deals with the sudden flashes of profound knowledge called revelations. These flashes originate from the unconscious mind and are received from there and transmitted to the conscious mind by the subconscious mind with the aid of the nerve-cells and the nerve-fibres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[The second item dealt with the subject of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (mental reactive momenta) as they exhibit themselves in colours. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; touched various persons and also various parts of the body of the same persons. From the reactions uttered by those so touched he demonstrated the following truths:] <ol> <li>Different persons have different lights at one and the same time. <li>The same person has different lights at different times. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[The conclusion was that, although there is a certain definite proportion in which pain&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tas (five fundamental factors) exist in the body, the proportion changes slightly at different times, depending upon the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras ruling at a given moment, and the lights change accordingly.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sitting in viira&#x301;sana [hero posture] and gazing at the tip of the nose, one will see some colour or other. The mind has to be kept away from the tip of the nose. What colours are seen in this posture will determine whether the faculties are in an aptitude for physical or mental or spiritual activity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If the colour is golden-yellow or earth-yellow, then ks&#x301;ititattva [solid factor] dominates, and if the colour is watery white, then apatattva [liquid factor] dominates. Both these colours are good for physical activities. When the red colour appears there is a domination of tejastattva [luminous factor], and the time is good for physical activity and, to some extent, for mental activity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->If the colour is blue or green, then maruttattva [aerial factor] is in preponderance and the time is opportune for mental activity and also for spiritual activity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->With the light showing is snow-white or a mixture of colours, the time is ideally suitable for spiritual activity, such as sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and there is a dominance of a&#x301;ka&#x301;shatattva [ethereal factor].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->[While dealing with the unconscious mind and the extra-cerebral memory, a question was posed by Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; whether they could be equated on the ground that both are beyond the subconscious. The answer as given by an avadhu&#x301;ta and amplified by Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; himself was that the two could not be equated. First, the extra-cerebral memory remembers only the past lives, whereas the unconscious mind knows all about the present and the future as well as the past. Secondly, while nerve-fibres and nerve[-cells] come into play when the subconscious mind receives flashes of the knowledge from the unconscious, there is no dependence upon these cells and fibres when the extra-cerebral memory is concerned.]<!-- /block --></p>
