<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Niiti and Dharma.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Niiti<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is niiti? Ks&#x301;ema&#x301;rthe nayanam ityarthe niiti. The word niiti has been derived from the root verb nii and the suffix ktin. It means &ldquo;that which has the capability to lead&rdquo;. But &ldquo;to lead&rdquo; to where?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The definition is Ks&#x301;ema&#x301;rthe nayanam ityarthe niiti. Nayana means &ldquo;to lead&rdquo; &ndash; as for instance the organ of the body which leads people toward external objects [the eye] is called nayana &ndash; and niiti is that which leads a unit being towards ks&#x301;ema.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And what is ks&#x301;ema?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There are a number of  words that seem to have the same meaning as ks&#x301;ema. But there is some subtle difference among the various words. For instance, there is a word hita whose colloquial meaning is &ldquo;good&rdquo;, but which actually means the desire for physical, mental and spiritual progress. But since no real progress is feasible in either the physical or the intellectual realm, the word hita has no meaning. Another word is shubha. It is used for progress in the intellectual and spiritual realms, but since there cannot be any progress in the intellectual realm, this term also becomes meaningless. And as regards spiritual progress, there are two words, kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a and ks&#x301;ema. Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;mastu  means &ldquo;Let there be spiritual progress&rdquo; &ndash; and ks&#x301;ema means the same as kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So, Ks&#x301;ema&#x301;rthe nayanam ityarthe niiti &ndash; that is, &ldquo;That which leads you in a particular direction for your ks&#x301;ema is called niiti.&rdquo; That which teaches you how to thieve, how to rob, and how to take bribes, is not niiti, for there is no intention of ks&#x301;ema there. This is the definition of niiti as in the scriptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In common speech niiti means simply &ldquo;that which leads&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the entity which possesses the capability of leading&rdquo;. So in common speech we can use terms such as kuniiti, durniiti, suniiti, satniiti, ran&#x301;aniiti, etc. But in a spiritual [context] the words suniiti [niiti conducive to welfare] and kuniiti [niiti conducive to harm] cannot be used, since the word niiti means only Ks&#x301;ema&#x301;rthe nayanam ityarthe; that is to say, since niiti [is automatically conducive to welfare and] can never be harmful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;morality&rdquo; is generally used as the English synonym for niiti (niiti as scripturally defined). Morality is that effort or idea which keeps a person away from sin &ndash; sin being that which is not prescribed in the Bible. Niiti is different from morality. There is no exact synonym for niiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;pa and Pun&#x301;ya<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Another thing to bear in mind is that &ldquo;sin&rdquo; in the English language is not the pa&#x301;pa of Sanskrit. As already said, &ldquo;sin&rdquo; means to go against that prescribed in the Bible. But pa&#x301;pa is explained in the phrase Paropaka&#x301;rah pun&#x301;ya&#x301;ya pa&#x301;pa&#x301;ya parapiid&#x301;anam &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Any action by one individual which leads to the development of others is pun&#x301;ya [virtuous deeds], and any action which does the opposite is pa&#x301;pa.&rdquo; Bhagava&#x301;n Shankaracharya has said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Tyaja durjanasam&#x301;sargam&#x301; bhaja sa&#x301;dhusama&#x301;gamam;<br>Kuru pun&#x301;yamahora&#x301;tram&#x301; smara nityamanityata&#x301;m.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[Avoid association with the wicked and associate with the virtuous. Do good twenty-four hours a day, and remember the eternal.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Tyaja durjanasam&#x301;sargam &ndash; avoid association with the durjana (wicked). Who are durjana? Those who bring about the spiritual degeneration of others are durjana. But durjana is also a relative term. A particular individual may be wicked for one person (i.e., the cause of that person&#146;s degeneration), yet may not be wicked for another person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In a unit there are both righteousness and unrighteousness. Suppose that in one person the righteousness is twenty percent and the unrighteousness is fifteen percent &ndash; the resultant five percent will be righteousness. But if in another person the righteousness be ten percent and the unrighteousness two percent, then the resultant eight percent will be that person&#146;s righteousness &ndash; which means that that person turns out to be a greater moralist, though he or she is possessed of only ten percent righteousness. What counts is the [resultant quantity] of righteousness, not the righteousness in itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now suppose that in Mr. X [the resultant] unrighteousness is fifteen percent, and in Mr. Y it is ten percent. If a third man possessing less than ten percent resultant righteousness comes in contact with them, he will become degenerated. But if in this man the righteousness is twenty-five percent, he cannot become unrighteous in contact with X and Y, on the contrary he will make those two righteous. Therefore one person cannot be durjana for all other persons. A person may be durjana for those who possess less of righteousness than he or she does of unrighteousness, but the same person cannot be durjana for those who possess more of righteousness than he or she does of unrighteousness &ndash; rather the latter persons will make the former person good.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->If, when making an effort to reform a person, your righteousness is not much more than the unrighteousness in that person, you should take with you a few other moralists when you go to reform the person. The collective righteousness will gain in strength, and it will have its impact on the person, and the person will be reformed. The person could be reformed not by the influence of one good person but by that of an assemblage of good people. So, Tyaja durjanasam&#x301;sargam&#x301; bhaja sa&#x301;dhusama&#x301;gamam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->And what is the meaning of the word sa&#x301;dhu [in the shloka]? Really sa&#x301;dhu means &ldquo;those by whose contact others become good&rdquo;. One does not become a sa&#x301;dhu simply by wearing saffron dress. Those who have the capability of leading others towards sa&#x301;dhuta&#x301; [saintliness] are alone sa&#x301;dhus. One may be a sa&#x301;dhu even wearing a suit. So, &ldquo;One should associate with sa&#x301;dhus.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Then, Kuru pun&#x301;yamahora&#x301;tram &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Do pun&#x301;ya  to others all day long and all night long.&rdquo; What is pun&#x301;ya? Paropaka&#x301;rah pun&#x301;ya&#x301;ya [&ldquo;Any action by one person which leads to the development of others is pun&#x301;ya&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The real service is the service that you render to others for their spiritual upliftment, and that is known as viprocita seva&#x301;. But other services such as shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301; [physical service], vaeshyocita seva&#x301; [economic service] and ks&#x301;atriyocita seva&#x301; [martial service] help you in rendering viprocita seva&#x301; to others. When someone is dying of some ailment you cannot preach spiritual gospels to the person, rather you should help that person with medicines and physical services. Then when the person gets well you should teach something spiritual to him or her. Then the person will have been permanently benefited. Hence, Kuru pun&#x301;yamahora&#x301;tram.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->What is the ahora&#x301;tra? The ahora&#x301;tra means the time stretching from one sunrise to the next. The time from one sunrise to the sunset is called a dinama&#x301;na, and the time from that sunset to the next sunrise is called a ra&#x301;trima&#x301;na. The dinama&#x301;na combined with the ra&#x301;trima&#x301;na is called the ahora&#x301;tra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The European system of time measurement starts from twelve in the night, whereas the Indian system starts from sunrise. In the Indian system the date changes with the rise of the sun.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->So do pun&#x301;ya, ahora&#x301;tra &ndash; all day long and all night long. Here someone may ask how it is possible to do pun&#x301;ya while sleeping. Let me explain it to you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Among all pun&#x301;ya karmas [virtuous actions], the best is the performance of praca&#x301;ra [spiritual propagation]. (Praca&#x301;ra can be done only by those who themselves are spiritual aspirants.) Doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and rendering social service are also pun&#x301;ya karmas. But for ordinary people who work in [government] offices or in businesses (not very spiritual activities), what is the way out? Even while working in the world, they should take their worldly work to be the work of the Lord. The worldly work as well will then become a pun&#x301;ya karma. If they keep their minds engaged in the thought of the Supreme, they will not be able to do anything wrong. The feeling of rendering service to others will remain in their minds. And what about during sleep? Before sleeping take His name &ndash; sleep too will become a pun&#x301;ya karma.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> That is why it is said, Kuru pun&#x301;yamahora&#x301;tram.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Then, Smara nityamanityata&#x301;m. Nityam means &ldquo;always&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Remember always the transitory nature of things.&rdquo; [Anityata&#x301;m means &ldquo;the ephemeral&rdquo;, &ldquo;the transitory&rdquo;.]  That which was in the past, is in the present and will continue to be in the future is nitya. If even one of these three aspects of time be absent, the thing is not nitya. For example, that which is in the present and will continue to be in the future, but was not in the past, is not nitya, but anitya. From among beginning, middle and end, if even one is not there, then that is not nitya. A thing which was born will die one day; that which is unborn will not die. That which comes within the scope of the spatial, temporal and personal factors will alone be born and die, but that which is beyond these three and is the base of them all will neither be born nor die. And that alone is nitya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->This [physical universe] is anitya because it was born. It will die one day. That which is in the universe is anitya, and that which contains the universe is nitya. Hence this world is transitory. It was born one day and it will surely die.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->A person who keeps this always in mind, [using] the discerning nitya&#x301;nitya faculty [nitya&#x301;nitya viveka], will not commit any wrong deed. Since the time of yore sa&#x301;dhakas have liked cremation grounds for their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, because the final end of the human body is most vividly manifested there. So one will tend not to perform any work improperly, and one&#146;s mind will not be attached to crudity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Niiti has a very close association with dharma. What is dharma? That which sustains the jiiva is dharma. And the practical side of dharma is expressed in the words A&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t dharmah, that is, &ldquo;Dharma is the assemblage of all your conduct&rdquo; &ndash; the way you eat, the way you speak, the way you perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. If your conduct is good, dharma is with you; if your conduct is not good, dharma is not with you. And if dharma is not with you, what comes about is your sarvana&#x301;sha, or sarva&#x301;tmaka vina&#x301;sha &ndash; that is, your physical, mental, and spiritual ruin. Now you may say that your a&#x301;tman cannot be ruined. That is correct, but your a&#x301;tman will not remain in the form of a&#x301;tman. It will become crudified.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In the first stage of dharma, the greatest helping factor is niiti. In other words, the function of niiti is to help dharma, to help dharma&#x301;caran&#x301;a [practice of dharma]. Therefore niiti plays a vital role in the life of a sa&#x301;dhaka. But niiti is not the culminating point of life, it is simply a starting point. In order to enter a house one has to pass through the gate, and this passing through the gate is niiti. But one has not gotten into the house simply by passing through the gate; to get in, one has to knock on the door. The entering into the house after knocking on the door is dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Just to be a moralist is not enough, it only provides one with a passport to enter the house. As said above, A&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t dharmah [&ldquo;Dharma is the assemblage of all your conduct&rdquo;], and the first phase of your conduct is niiti. Therefore those who are bereft of niiti cannot be dharmic, and those who are dharmic cannot go against niiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Now the question crops up whether niiti is a relative factor or an absolute factor. Niiti is not cent percent relative, but it is not absolute, either, because niiti does not have any direct relation with Parama&#x301;tman &ndash; it cannot by its own force help one attain Him. Niiti is a happy blending of relative and absolute.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The final goal of dharma is Parama&#x301;tman, so for a dharma sa&#x301;dhaka there can be no other end. Those sa&#x301;dhakas who think that through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; they will acquire occult powers, are wrong. Or, they may attain supernatural powers, but those powers will not help them to attain Parama&#x301;tman. Those powers will not satisfy human longings, because even those powers are something worldly. That which we call supernatural is not really so, &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; is rather loose terminology; any power or object which has come within the bondages of the world is not supernatural, but natural. Those who think that sitting in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; they can obtain an&#x301;ima&#x301;, laghima&#x301;, mahima&#x301;, pra&#x301;pti, praka&#x301;mya, etc. [names of occult powers], are in delusion. They are simply wasting their valuable time. A devoted sa&#x301;dhaka never aspires for these things. Even if Parama&#x301;tman comes to such a sa&#x301;dhaka and says, &ldquo;My child, take all these powers,&rdquo; the sa&#x301;dhaka will reply, &ldquo;Parama&#x301;tman, keep those powers for Yourself. I don&#146;t need them. I want You, and You alone. I long for You and not for Your powers.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->A mother tries to coax and cajole her crying son, and offers him some toys to divert his attention, so that she can work in the kitchen. The child stops crying and forgets his mother for the time being. But if he is a bit naughty, he will again resume his effort to reach the breast of his mother. He will throw away the toys and cry for Mother only. And the mother ultimately has to come and take the child on her lap. A devoted sa&#x301;dhaka is like this child. He or she will say, &ldquo;O Father, this world that I see all around is a plethora of toys. This world took its birth at a certain time, so it will also come to an end at some time or other. This world has not been given permanently to anybody.&rdquo; If God is asked whether He has given this world-toy to anybody forever, He will not be able to answer, for He does not give things forever. He gives with the right hand and takes away with the left.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Lord Buddha has said, Konuha&#x301;sa kiimananda nittam pajjalite sate. This means that Parama&#x301;tman has given you a rope, one end of which you are holding, and on the other end of which He has lit a fire. Sooner or later the fire will burn all of the rope and your hand as well. Hence one should not ask anything from Parama&#x301;tman.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Niiti and Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->In niiti there is a happy blending of the relative and the absolute. So niiti is based on certain mundane and supra-mundane principles. Dharma, on the other hand, is a&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a [conduct] &ndash; A&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t dharmah. It is, therefore, something practical. It is a cult. It is not a theory but a desire, a will to do something.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->But the question arises, what to do. As regards niiti, one can deliver some speech, say something on Yama and Niyama, and that too can be understood. But as regards dharma, one has to actually do something. So what to do and what not to do? What are people&#146;s dos and don&#146;ts?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->In the case of niiti, indeed, there are certain dos and don&#146;ts. In Sanskrit these dos are called vidhi, and the don&#146;ts are called nis&#x301;edha. The collection of dos and don&#146;ts is niiti. But as regards dharma there are no don&#146;ts, everything is do; that is, everything is a conduct which has to be performed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->For example, &ldquo;Serve the patient,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&#146;t steal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak the truth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&#146;t tell a lie&rdquo; &ndash; such a combination of [observances and restrictions] is niiti. Dharma, on the other hand, is a&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a, not ana&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a &ndash; that is, it is only &ldquo;do this,&rdquo; &ldquo;do that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for Parama&#x301;tman like this,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sing bhajans like this,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma like this,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do nya&#x301;sa [a kind of breath-control] like this&rdquo; &ndash; there is only vidhi and no nis&#x301;edha. This is the fundamental difference between dharma and niiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->So in dharma there are only dos. Now common people will naturally ask, What is it that we are to do?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Shrutayo vibhinna&#x301;h smrtayo vibhinna&#x301;h<br>Naekamuniryasya matam&#x301; na&#x301;bhinnam;<br>Dharmasya tattvam&#x301; nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;ya&#x301;m&#x301;<br>Maha&#x301;jano yena gatah sa pantha&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->[The scriptures differ, the social codes differ; each sage has a different opinion. The essence of dharma lies deep in the mind; the realized one follows the true path.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Shrutayo vibhinna&#x301;h &ndash; Among the different Vedas and sha&#x301;stras there are mutual differences. There are differences even between the mantras of the Rgveda and those of the Yajurveda. In the one it says pitrasva and in the other pitrasta&#x301;m. The one says sarvatomukha and the other says vishvatomukha. So the Rgveda and the Yajurveda are not identical. They have differences wide and deep. So what should common people do? Which should they accept? Similar is the case with niiti. One person will say that sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; must be done facing the east, and another will say facing the north &ndash; will say that instead of facing the sun while meditating, one should face the polestar. Yet another person will say that sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; should be done facing the west [from India], that is, facing Mecca. Only poor south has not received anybody&#146;s sanction. But really Parama&#x301;tman is in all the directions. Do not all these directions belong to Parama&#x301;tman? How could Parama&#x301;tman be only in the east and not in the west? But niitiva&#x301;diis (exponents of principles of niiti) will quarrel among themselves. As said earlier, there is something relative in niiti.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Es&#x301;o ha deva pradisho&#146;nu sarva&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;The Singular Entity, Parama&#x301;tman, has manifested Himself in the form of pradisha and anudisha.&rdquo; Six of the ten directions &ndash; north, south, east, west, up, and down &ndash; are known as pradisha, and the remaining four &ndash; northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest &ndash; are known as anudisha. So this one Parama&#x301;tman appears in the form of the six pradisha and the four anudisha. Which directions will you accept and which reject? If you speak in favour of the east, it means you are speaking against the west &ndash; and haven&#146;t you then gone against the Lord manifested in the form of the west? So it is very difficult to talk about this. Dharmic people will not say anything about this. They will say,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->So we see that there are differences of opinion even in the shrutis &ndash; shrutayo vibhinna&#x301;h. The smrtis also differ. What is a smrti? That which controls the worldly life of a person is called smrti, and that which controls the spiritual life of that person is called shruti. Shruti means dharmasha&#x301;stra (spiritual code), and smrti means sama&#x301;jasha&#x301;stra (social code). In ancient times there were the Parashar Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;, the Na&#x301;rada Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;, and the Manu Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;; and today you will find the Hindu Code. All of these are smrtisha&#x301;stra. Smrtisha&#x301;stra is more relative than shrutisha&#x301;stra, for society changes with the change of time. But there are differences among the shrutis also, and, Naekamuniryasya matam&#x301; nabhinnam &ndash; &ldquo;There is no muni [saintly intellectual] who does not differ from other munis.&rdquo; Some munis will say to offer pin&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; [oblations] in a particular way, and some in some other way. (But actually, not all of these people are [even] real munis. Only &ldquo;those who have merged their minds&rdquo; in Parama&#x301;tman are real munis &ndash; Munih dugdhaba&#x301;lakah munih sam&#x301;liinama&#x301;nasah.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->A modern person might ask whether it is really possible to merge one&#146;s mind in this way. It is a difficult task, but since dharma consists in doing something in practical terms, one should make the effort. But with the sha&#x301;stras and munis differing so widely, what are common people to do?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Dharmasya tattvam&#x301; nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;ya&#x301;m;<br>Maha&#x301;jano yena gatah sah pantha&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->[The essence of dharma is hidden in your own &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling; the path pursued by practical saints is the real path.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The essence of dharma is hidden in the guha&#x301;.&rdquo; The term guha&#x301; in Sanskrit has two meanings. The first is &ldquo;cave&rdquo;. So does the shloka mean that Parama&#x301;tman is concealed in a cave in some mountain; does it mean that to realize Him one will have to leave the world and go to the wilderness? No, it would not be wise to leave the world, to leave off service to humanity, and go to the Himalayas to attain Parama&#x301;tman. This world itself is Parama&#x301;tman&#146;s &ndash; where will you go if you leave it? In the world one may believe that one will be unable to concentrate their mind because of the din and bustle; but in a cave in the Himalayas, one will start thinking that one was unable to get sweet fruit in a particular jungle, and that hence tomorrow one would have to go get ripe plums in a different jungle two or three miles away. Either in the world or in the wilderness one will not necessarily be free. If Parama&#x301;tman does not want you to know Him, then you will not be able to attain Him in either place; whereas if He wishes you to attain Him, you can get Him here and now. What He sees is your aspiration for Him. Remember that at every step of your life He is testing you to see whether or not you have been able to arouse love for Him in your mind. He is testing you as to whether you want Him or want worldly objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->There should be oneness in thought and speech. If there is some difference between the two, one will not be able to arouse love for Him. Suppose that in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one says that one requires only Parama&#x301;tman. If then, when before the Lord, that person prays for the cure of his or her asthma, that will not serve the purpose.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->The other meaning of guha&#x301; is &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Dharmasya tattvam&#x301; nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;ya&#x301;m&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;The essence of dharma, that is, Parama&#x301;tman, is hidden in your own &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness.&rdquo; Is it essential for you to go to the Himalayas in search of that which is hidden in your own &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness? Do you require the help of a mirror to see the wristwatch on your wrist? No, and neither for Parama&#x301;tman, who is hidden in your &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness, do you need go to the Himalayas. Live in the world and put forth your entire self for the service of society, and then you must attain Parama&#x301;tman. Parama&#x301;tman is hidden in you, and He is witnessing all your activities, physical or mental, and seeing whether you aspire for Him or for worldly objects. So what will sa&#x301;dhakas do? Maha&#x301;jano yena gatah sa pantha&#x301;h. The cover of &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness is to be removed [from Parama&#x301;tman, the essence of dharma] &ndash; those who try to remove it are maha&#x301;janas, practical people, practical sa&#x301;dhakas. And whatever these practical sa&#x301;dhakas have done and are doing, you have to follow. This cannot be brought about with niiti. This is entirely a spiritual cult. You are sa&#x301;dhakas, you have to follow the maha&#x301;janas, and achieve your end by removing the cover of your &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness. You will find that your goal is hidden in your own &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->Hence niiti will help you, but only through dharma  sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; will you be able to attain Parama&#x301;tman. That is why it has been said, A&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t dharmah &ndash; &ldquo;Conduct is the principal factor in dharma.&rdquo; Be a sada&#x301;ca&#x301;rii, a person of good conduct, and you will surely attain Parama&#x301;tman. What to speak of getting Him in the future &ndash; you have already got Him, you simply are not able to see Him.<!-- /block --></p>
