<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Non-attributional Entity is infinite, and the Attributional Entity is also infinite. And when this latter Infinite Entity is taken away from the formed Infinite Entity, the remainder is also infinite. So it is very difficult to use any article of speech for Him. But even so, that existential Entity is known as the singular Entity &ndash; &ldquo;Ekah devah sarvabhutesu gu&#x301;r&#x301;ha.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Why do we say that, when we know, common sense knows, and philosophers also say, that the Supreme Entity is infinite? Why, even then, do we say &ldquo;One&rdquo;? We know He is infinite, even then we say He is One &ndash; why? Because we find no other, no second, infinite entity; that is why we say He is a singular Entity. Although infinite, He is One, because of the absence of any second entity. So we find no alternative but to say that He is One.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And where does that singular Entity lie, and what is the nature of the singular Entity? Since the singular Entity is One, His stance remains unchallenged forever, but what sort of entity is He, or is It? He is deva. What is deva? The word comes from the root &ldquo;div&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;the Supreme vibrational entity&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Supreme vibratory entity&rdquo; &ndash; that which vibrates everything. He Himself is vibration personified, and He by His nature vibrates everything. He is the Supreme motivation. Wherever there is vibration, it is deva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->But He is not an ordinary deva. He is the collection of all vibrations, so He is Maha&#x301;deva. He is the Controller of all our vibrations, that&#146;s why He is Maha&#x301;deva. There may be innumerable devas, but Maha&#x301;deva is the one singular Entity who controls all devas, all vibrations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sarvabhutes&#x301;u gu&#x301;d&#x301;hah&rdquo; &ndash; He lies covered in each and every expressed entity. He lies coverted in each and every manifestation. Those manifestations may or may not come within the scope of the sensory and motor organs. Now, you may say, does He lie covert in each and every expressed entity, and doesn&#146;t He remain beyond the expressed entities? To the latter the answer is no. He is both within and without. He is within and without the entities, so He is the Controller of all actions. He is Karma&#x301;dhyaks&#x301;a. He is Sarvavya&#x301;pii, all-pervading &ndash; &ldquo;Sarvavya&#x301;pii sarvabodhantara&#x301;tma&#x301;&rdquo;. He is within each and every expressed entity, and also He is without each and every expressed entity, because He is Sarvavya&#x301;pii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sarvabhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ntara&#x301;tma&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; He is all-pervading, all-pervasive. He is beyond the scope of this expressed universe, although He functions within the expressed universe also. So when one is to become one with Him, one will have to go beyond the periphery of all these expressions and manifestations. One will have to place one&#146;s mind above the jurisdiction of this phenomenal world.<!-- /block --></p>
