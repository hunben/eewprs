<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know there is nothing disorderly in this Universe. Everything moves as per certain rules. In this solar system of ours the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving around the sun. In this ethereal system the earth is the nucleus, the moon is moving around it. Similarly, in the atomic system also there is the nucleus and electrons moving around the nucleus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In our Cosmic order <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is the Nucleus, and so many animate and inanimate objects are moving around Him, knowingly or unknowingly. In the case of human beings, they are moving, they are dancing, knowingly. And in the case of other animals, and other less-developed living beings, and also in the case of inanimate objects, they are also moving, they are also dancing, but unknowingly, unconsciously.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Even in the case of human beings, when they move around <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> one person moves, one person dances, unknowingly, another person knowingly. Those who are dancing, those who are moving, knowingly, always try to lessen the length of their radii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Each and every individual has its own radius, and a spiritual aspirant &ndash; what a spiritual aspirant does &ndash; he always tries to lessen the length of the radius. Moving like this, [demonstrates with hands], having a particular radius. Those who move unknowingly &ndash; the radius remains unchanged, or even, due to their mean propensities, may increase like this [demonstrates].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And in the case of spiritual aspirants, what happens? Coming nearer, coming nearer, coming closer &ndash; and when a person comes into the closest proximity he becomes one with the Nucleus, and that becoming one with the Nucleus is the stage of salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now so many entities, so many individuals, are moving around Him, and they are associated with so many physical structures &ndash; long, short, white, black, learned, illiterate &ndash; so many structures - but the common goal is the Nucleus, <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. There is no shyness, no hatred, no complex, because that Nucleus is the bigger &ldquo;I&rdquo; of everybody; that Nucleus is the Supreme Progenitor of everybody. Now each and every entity has its own <i>sam&#x301;skara</i>. <i>Sam&#x301;skara</i> means &ldquo;reactive momenta&rdquo;. The action you did the reaction to which you have not undergone &ndash; such an action not satisfied by the reaction is known as what? In the plural, &ldquo;reactive momenta&rdquo;. And beings are to move according to their reactive momenta or <i>sam&#x301;skara</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now this movement around the Nucleus is life, rather, human life. Everybody moves, but in the case of humans, the movement is knowingly. We are moving around <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. The human being knows; other animals do not know; and there lies the fundamental difference between a man and an animal. So if, after getting a human structure, a human mind and an objectivated human soul, anybody does not move knowingly, he or she is worse than an animal, because an animal lacks in the developed mind. It cannot understand or practise spirituality, which a man can do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now wherever a few spiritual aspirants assemble, whenever there is a gathering of a few spiritual aspirants, I said they should not waste their time in idle gossiping, they should utilize their time in <i>kiirtana,</i> because when the <i>kiirtana</i> is done a spiritual environment is created then and there, and as soon as the spiritual environment is created, the Supreme Nucleus, <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> will then and there shift His headquarters to among those aspirants; because the centre of the Nucleus is above the periphery of time, space and person. He may shift it anywhere, wherever, whenever, so desired by Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now what is His Grace? The moving entity becomes one with the Nucleus, how? It depends on His Grace. It does not depend on human logic, or human intellect; it depends on His Grace. What is His Grace? Mr. A may say, &ldquo;Why am I not enjoying His Grace?&rdquo; Mr. B may say, &ldquo;I am enjoying His Grace.&rdquo; But what&#146;s the fact? The Grace is everywhere, but you know, just like rainfall &ndash; when it rains what happens? If you have an umbrella above your head you will not be drenched. And if you remove the umbrella you will be drenched. So in the case of Divine Grace, it is like rainfall, but there is an umbrella of vanity upon your head, that&#146;s why you are not drenched. Remove the umbrella of vanity and you will be drenched; then you will enjoy His Grace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And that is the secret, and when you are enjoying the Grace, what will happen? The radius will be shortened, and in this very life you will become one with your Goal, your Nucleus. This Nucleus knows no artificial barrier, nor isms, countries or philosophies. This Nucleus knows that the moving entities are My children &ndash; they want to come and sit on My lap.<!-- /block --></p>
