<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Everything in this universe comes within certain limitations. When the Non-Attributional Principle descended to the level of the attributional world, then it also came within the scope of limitations &ndash; within the scope of staticity. All our hopes and aspirations, all our desires and longings, function within certain limitations, but the periphery is not small: the periphery is very vast, almost of infinite character. Human existence or human entities also function within this vast periphery under certain limitations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The progress of the human society must be maintained in a proper balance between the past heritage &ndash; and by past heritage I do not mean dogma, I mean the flow emanating from the past &ndash; the hopes and aspirations of the present, and the possibilities and potentialities of the future. Past heritage&#8230; present hopes and aspirations&#8230; future possibilities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->So we are to unite the entire humanity not only of this land of India or Asia or the globe, but of the entire universe. We must not support any sort of imperialism, any rule of one group over another. If there is any ism, any exploitation of one group of humans over another, the peace and tranquillity of the social order is sure to be disturbed. So in the socioeconomic arena, in the spiritual arena, in cultural life &ndash; in all the different arenas, spheres and strata of life &ndash; we should be very vigilant, extremely vigilant, not to allow any sort of imperialism to invade our psycho-spiritual world by coming through the back door.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->For the entire world a linking language is necessary, and at present English is that linking language. In the future English may be replaced by any other lingua franca or lingua matrix, but just at present English serves the purpose. We must not try to expel English from its present position; that is, we must not play the role of usurper.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As far as the past tradition or past heritage of India is concerned, it is stored within the vast scope of the Sam&#x301;skrta language &ndash; and our hopes and aspirations are also stored in this Sam&#x301;skrta language. The land of India has not been called Punjab or Bengal, it has been called &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo; which is a part of Jambudviipa. To forget this truth means the fragmentation of the entire country &ndash; physically, mentally and spiritually. We must not forget this essential truth. In the future also India&#146;s cultural life is to be tethered by the binding cord of Sam&#x301;skrta, so Sam&#x301;skrta should be encouraged. Sam&#x301;skrta must be encouraged, but it should not be imposed on anyone in the name of &ldquo;ra&#x301;stra bha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;&rdquo; or national language as is being done in the case of Hindi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->For a healthy social order, we must consider the society as a family. Suppose there is a family of five brothers: everything should be done with the clear consent and concurrence of all these five brothers, otherwise the one brother or two brothers who do not have a say regarding decisions and resolutions are sure to dissociate themselves from that family, and the joint structure of the family will be disturbed. India is a multi-national and multi-racial country, and everything regarding language must be done with the clear consent and concurrence of all, not by the brute suppression of the majority. We have to save our cultural life, we have to save our heritage, by linking the bright past to the brighter future with the golden cord of universalism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of &ldquo;sama&#x301;j&rdquo;? Sama&#x301;nam ejati is sama&#x301;j. &ldquo;To walk&rdquo; &ndash; sah calati. &ldquo;To walk while eating&rdquo; &ndash; sah carati. &ldquo;To walk while looking&rdquo; &ndash; sah gacchati. &ldquo;To follow&rdquo; &ndash; sa anugacchati. &ldquo;To walk while looking from side to side&rdquo; &ndash; sa at&#x301;ati. &ldquo;To walk while writing&rdquo; &ndash; sa pargat&#x301;ati. &ldquo;To walk calmly&rdquo; &ndash; sa ejati. Samanam ejati sama&#x301;ja. Sama&#x301;j or &ldquo;society&rdquo; means a group of people who are moving happily and peacefully. Sam&#x301;skrta is a very rich language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Regarding Parama Purus&#x301;a, in the Yajur Veda (as &ldquo;Ya&rdquo; in the Yajur Veda is the first letter in the word, it is pronounced &ldquo;ja&rdquo;, with the tongue touching the upper palate &ndash; a light &ldquo;ja&rdquo; sound. But when &ldquo;ya&rdquo; is not the first letter but is in the middle or end of a word, as in &ldquo;niyama&rdquo;, it is pronounced as &ldquo;ya&rdquo;) it is said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Tadejati tannaejati taddu&#x301;re tadvantike<br>Tadantarasya sarvasya tadu sarvasya&#x301;sya va&#x301;hyatah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->[The Supreme Entity moves; the Supreme Entity does not move. The Supreme Entity is far, far away; no, the Supreme Entity is the nearest entity.<br>He is the inside of everything; He is also the outside of everything.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Tadejati: He moves&#8230; He moves&#8230; He moves from the unknown starting point to the unknown culminating point. He moves. &ldquo;Sah&rdquo; means &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;sa&#x301;&rdquo; means &ldquo;she&rdquo;. Parama Purus&#x301;a is masculine, and Parama Prakrti is feminine. Feminine Parama Prakrti plus masculine Parama Purus&#x301;a equals Brahma, which is neuter. In the shloka it is said, Tad Brahma, not sah Brahma or sa&#x301; Brahma&#x301;. Not sa ejati or sa&#x301; ejati but tad ejati in neuter gender. That Brahma moves with peace, with tranquillity and composure, and while moving He sees everything. If He moves in hot haste it will be difficult for Him to see everything properly, so when He moves He moves like this &ndash; slowly and calmly, not double march. Tadejati.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Brhacca taddivyam acintyaru&#x301;pam, Suks&#x301;ma&#x301;eca suks&#x301;mataram&#x301; vibha&#x301;ti: Parama Purus&#x301;a is very great, very very great. When the greatness becomes immeasurable, unfathomable, it is called vira&#x301;t in Sam&#x301;skrta. Parama Purus&#x301;a is very great and very vast, but He is also very small, very very subtle, and that is why you cannot see Him. If you think that He is far, then He is very, very far away. The jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis or philosophers think that He is very far &ndash; so far that the distance is immeasurable. But the bhaktas or devotees say, &ldquo;He is near, so near that the distance is immeasurable.&rdquo; Those who have eyes to see, see that Parama Purus&#x301;a is in the core of their hearts; He is within the very existence of each and every entity, so there is no necessity of moving about in search of Him. He resides within the very &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling of everyone, and yet He surrounds everything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Sam&#x301;skrta is one of the classical languages of the world. The other classical languages of the world have their local words and local vocabulary. Written languages throughout the world can understand and incorporate many words from Sam&#x301;skrta. For example, in the book &ldquo;Prayojaner Paribha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;&rdquo; what is the word used for rocket? Pragama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->In the past the tie amongst the recognized tongues of the ancient world was Vedic. The later Vedic language was known as Sam&#x301;skrta. Sam&#x301;skrta was suited to the purpose of communication with the mass. The word &ldquo;Sam&#x301;skrta&rdquo; means reformed or repaired language. When Vedic came in contact with the general mass, the downtrodden mass, it became Sam&#x301;skrta. There are three types of Vedic pronunciation: Rg Vedic, Yajur Vedic and Artharva Vedic pronunciation. For example, Sam&#x301;skrta in Rg Vedic is &ldquo;Sam&#x301;skrta&rdquo;, in Yajur Vedic &ldquo;Samskrata&rdquo; and in Atharva Vedic &ldquo;Samskruta&rdquo;. Sam&#x301;skrta means later Vedic period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Languages which come from Sam&#x301;skrta, moving towards the east, include Persian, Pasto, Western Punjabi, Eastern Punjabi, Dogrii, Kashmirii, Sindhii, Gujaratii, Rajasthanii, Nagpuria, Chatisgharii, Oriya, Magahii, Bhojpurii, Hariya&#x301;navii, Bengali, Assamese, Burmese, Thai and Indonesian.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->What is the Latin noun for night? Nocturnal. It comes from the Latin noun &ldquo;noctum&rdquo; which means &ldquo;night&rdquo;. The Vedic word for night is also &ldquo;naktram&rdquo;. In Latin &ldquo;t&rdquo; is pronounced as dental &ldquo;t&rdquo;, never like &ldquo;t&#x301;&rdquo;. There are different pronunciations of &ldquo;t&rdquo;. In English there is &ldquo;tea&rdquo; and in French &ldquo;te&rdquo;. In languages of Latin origin as well as of Vedic origin &ldquo;t&rdquo; is always dental &ldquo;t&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Madhu naktamutas&#x301;aso<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->[Let our nights and days be sweet]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->There is a very close relationship between Vedic and all other classical languages of the world. If Vedic is properly nourished and encouraged it will encourage the unity of the world and a cordial relationship amongst human beings will develop. In Vedic the lady who measures the child is called &ldquo;ma&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; means to measure in Vedic. [[The Latin word is &ldquo;maternal&rdquo; and English &ldquo;mother&rdquo;.]] Paternal property means &ldquo;patrimony&rdquo;. However, maternal property is not &ldquo;matrimony&rdquo;, which means marriage, matrimonial alliance or a relationship due to marriage. The Vedic word for brother is &ldquo;bhratr&rdquo;, the English word is &ldquo;brother&rdquo; and the Persian or Iranian word is &ldquo;biradar&rdquo;. Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;hii was the original script of the Persian language. After Iran became Islamic, the script was modified to Arabic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Latin is the daughter of Vedic and so is Sam&#x301;skrta. If Sam&#x301;skrta is used human unity will be encouraged and human beings will move closer together. See how sweet the link is between Vedic, Sam&#x301;skrta and the other classical languages of the world? So you should encourage the study of Sam&#x301;skrta. It is our forefathers language; it is our cultural heritage. If a regional language is accepted by others as a link language it weakens the golden thread of unity which exists between one person and another, Indian and Indian, East Indian and West Indian and North Indian and South Indian. India is one and indivisible. If a particular regional language is encouraged and imposed as the national language of the whole country by the resolve of a brute majority it will lead to the balkanization of Indian nationhood. The land will be balkanized and this will weaken the entire country. India is not a nation &ndash; it is a multi-national and multi-lingual country. Let our well-knit order remain as it was and as it is. The structure and framework must not be disturbed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In India if you are not Hindi or English speaking you cannot speak in the national parliament and you cannot answer questions in competitive examinations. Is it desirable? No. Those who speak Hindi and English belong to a privileged class and the others are second grade citizens. All examinations should be on an equal basis &ndash; either in one&#146;s natural language or in Hindi or English.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->All Indian languages should be given equal position in the constitution. Let Sam&#x301;skrta be the national language, as this will provide equal opportunity to all. Sam&#x301;skrta is the mother of all Indian languages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->If people speak a particular language which is also the official language they will belong to the privileged class. In the British period English was imposed on India. This was an example of British imperialism. Do you feel it?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Parliament means an important talk. Why is it &ldquo;an MLA&rdquo; and &ldquo;an MP&rdquo;? &ldquo;An&rdquo; is used because &ldquo;m&rdquo; in member is silent and &ldquo;e&rdquo; is the first letter pronounced.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->We have to change the constitution to create equal opportunity for all, not placing anyone in a disadvantaged position. Second class citizens are half slaves or semi-slaves. Demi, semi and hemi are all Latin words which mean half. A demi-official letter is a personal but official letter. &ldquo;Semi-slave&rdquo;, not demi-slave or hemi-slave. Why? For the sake of alliteration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->We have to provide equal rights to all living languages of the land. Let Sam&#x301;skrta be the common language as it is the ancestral language of all India. If Sam&#x301;skrta is recognized as the link language amongst all linguistic groups, it will be to the advantage of all. Sam&#x301;skrta is the source of all vocabularies for all Indian languages. Whenever there is a shortage of a particular word, take a word from the Sam&#x301;skrtic stock. If you are forced to learn Hindi, as nowadays you are taught Hindi, is it desirable? Unless and until people get the chance to express themselves in their natural tongue they cannot enjoy their communication<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->For a healthy society, for a healthy social structure, these fundamental points should always be remembered. There have been certain lapses in our constitution which has accepted a particular regional language as the lingua franca of this vast multilingual country. Is it not the fact? And you should also always remember that there must not be any imperialism in the linguistic field, the cultural arena or the socioeconomic sphere. PROUT is based on this fundamental principle. Today or tomorrow the entire world will accept PROUT as the only panacea for all the world&#146;s mundane and supramundane ailments. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
