The mutual relationship is inseparable. To attempt to separate one from the other would jeopardize their existence. They are as intimately associated as milk and its whiteness, water and its fluidity and fire and its burning capacity. Some people believe that Prakrti and Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; are synonymous. Theoretically they are virtually the same, but in the practical sphere there is some difference between them. When the three principles of prakrti &ndash; sentient, mutative and static &ndash; are in perfect equilibrium and equipoise, Prakrti is said to be lying dormant in her primordial state there is no manifestation of creation. To described this state the term Prakrti is used. But when the three principles lose their equilibrium and equipoise, the attributive expression manifests. In this state, when prakrti is committed to start the creation, (of course within the limited sphere of the infinite body of Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Cognitive Principle). She is called Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, (the Supreme Creative Principle). The different living beings, the creepers, trees plants and animals, and this entire world of unique diversities that we witness around us, are all created by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. However, it is only with the express will and permission of Parama Purus&#x301;a that the vast creation occurs. In the field of creation, because of the diversity of the roles in the creation, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has various expressions:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>1) Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: When the Supreme Creative Principle continues Her creative role within and without the creation, the entity which maintains the external flow of dynamicity is called Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Because of the inexorable influence of this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the cosmic mind and the five fundamental factors from ether to sound are created. It&#146;s due to her influence that each and every atom and molecule constantly moves through different stages of metamorphosis and transmutation and is transformed into unit life and unit [[citta, aham&#x301;, mahat, etc.]]. It is due to Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;&#146;s influence that the animate and inanimate objects have all emerged. Without it, all the latent potentialities of the microcosm would have remained unmanifested. This quinquelemental universe was come into being. The created under her influence and its various expressions are the manifestations of the different forms of that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. In the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;na (a mythological text) it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><b>3) An&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: The creative principle which lies within every unit mind is called Anuma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Her influence causes unit beings to remain preoccupied with various colorful thoughts regarding the past, present and future. Some thought are materialized in the external world; others vanish as soon as they appear in the mind. It is also due to her influence that, many people move ahead fighting the formidable obstacles of life, allured by the future. The wealth and property, the name and fame that humans attain are also due to the influence of An&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301; on the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><b>4) Yogama&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: When the Supreme Operative Principle leads living beings towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, she is called Yogama&#x301;ya&#x301;. This universe is undergoing constant transformation in the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara and Pratisain&#x32D;cara. Due to the centrifugal force of the macrocosmic mind the five fundamental factors emerged, and due to centripetal force of the unit mind, life of the unit beings was created. The influence of Yogama&#x301;ya&#x301; is more clearly felt by the human mind. In her attempt to elevate the microcosm to the level of the macrocosm, She constantly attracts the unit mind along the path of attaining oneness with the macrocosmic mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>5) Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: The Supreme Creative Principle which leads unit beings from subtlety towards crudity is called Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. The extroversive phase of creation (Sain&#x32D;cara) is dominated by Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. She exerts her influence on human minds in two ways. In philosophical terms one is called viks&#x301;epii shakti, the other a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. When humans ideate on crude matter, their minds drift away from the macrocosm and their spiritual awareness fades. This is caused by the influence of viks&#x301;epii shakti. If one remains close to an object it does not necessarily mean that one will acquire precise knowledge about it. If an object is covered, for example, one cannot attain real knowledge about it even if it is close by. This is the effect of the a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti of avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. It is called &ldquo;a&#x301;varanii&rdquo; because it covers the original object. In darkness, one cannot properly recognize an object. At best one can form a vague idea about it. Due to the influence of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; one develops a non-integral view of the macrocosmic body. Due to the influence of avidya shakti in the flow of cosmic imagination the viks&#x301;epii and a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti become dominant in the extroversive phase [[of creation and in the introversive phase their influence gradually wanes.]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><b>6) Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: The Supreme Creative Principle that helps unit beings to move from the crude to the subtle is called Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Unit beings make steady progress towards the Supreme with help of the Vidya&#x301; force of Prakrti. At the last stage of the journey, Avidya&#x301; is completely non-existent &ndash; even the force of Vidya&#x301; vanishes. A sadhaka, in order to attain spiritual progress, require the help of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, but at the culminating stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya has no further value. A sa&#x301;dhaka performs sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to tear away the veil of darkness of the variegated world created by Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and to strive to established himself on the path of pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The two forces of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; are sam&#x301;vit shakti and hla&#x301;dinii shakti. The popular meaning of Sam&#x301;vit Shakti is &ldquo;awakeness&rdquo; &ndash; awakening from slumber. With the help of Sam&#x301;vit Shakti, unit beings become aware of their existence. They realize that they are the crown of creation, the most evolved beings whose goal is to attain the supreme rank and dispel the darkness of the a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya. Under Her benign influence one seeks greater proximity to the Supreme Entity, by surmounting the distance created by the influence of the viks&#x301;epii shakti of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya. When this Vidya&#x301;-dominated force firmly establishes itself in the mind of sa&#x301;dhakas and takes them nearer to Parama Purus&#x301;a, by fighting against viks&#x301;epii shakti it is called hla&#x301;dinii shakti. It helps the sa&#x301;dhakas overcome the bondages of pettiness and frailties along the path of synthesis, the path of blissful experiences which leads them towards the Supreme Entity. This force is known as shriira&#x301;dha to the Vais&#x301;n&#x301;avas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->All the Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;s except Anuma&#x301;ya&#x301; are collectively known as Vishvama&#x301;ya&#x301;. Between the Macrocosmic and the microcosmic stances there exists the deep, dark world of ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. It is due to this that unit beings are unable to form an exact idea about the quinquelemental world, even though it is lying before their eyes. This darkness forms a clear line of demarcation between the Macrocosmic and microcosmic stances. It is an illusion which brings distrust, disappointment and other frailties to unit minds, and causes unit beings to fumble and falter on their journey. That&#146;s why spiritual aspirants seeking emancipation become eager to attain liberation from the bondages of the all-powerful Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. But will Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; make way for unit beings out of fear? A reply to this earnest query of the devotees has been given by Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the Giita&#x301;,<!-- /block --></p>

Here lies the importance of Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; the practice of intuitional science &ndash; and the necessity of sharan&#x301;agati, total surrender to Parama Purus&#x301;a. The spirit of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to wage an all-round fight against Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, to overcome Her tenacious influence. This battle of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; can be carried out in one of three ways - Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or Madhyama&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

It is never attained by flattery. Powerful people are greatly appeased by the entreaties and flattery of cowards, and might grant certain concessions or favours, but would never grant complete freedom. Dominion status may be granted, but the attainment of complete independence remains a far cry away. Thus, in order to attain salvation, to establish the reign of complete independence, a spiritual aspirant will have to fight against Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

As a result they unknowingly invite  more darkness, more crudity, and gradually degenerate to the level of animality. That is why wise sa&#x301;dhakas do not accept the path of Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; as an ideal one.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The process which leads to enlightenment and the exhaustion of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras accumulated over many lives is diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. Usually there are two types of diiks&#x301;a&#x301; &ndash; vaedikii diiks&#x301;a (initiation according to the Vaedic system) and ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; (initiation according to the Tantric system). Vaedik diiks&#x301;a&#x301; inspires the seeker to adopt true dharma and tread the path of spirituality which leads to the attainment of the Supreme Entity. Many slokas of the Upanishads and other scriptures are utilized in vaediik diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. The imparting of proper spiritual training produces a spiritual awakening in the human mind, causing spiritual aspirants to seek that path which leads to the attainment of their is&#x301;ta or spiritual goal. A competent spiritual teacher then will impart the practical guidance to those aspirants. That spiritual direction is called ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. Tan ja&#x301;d&#x301;ya&#x301;ta ta&#x301;rayeh yastu sah tantrah parikiirthita. The practical process which leads to the freedom from dullness is called Tantra. The process of initiation according to the science of ta&#x301;ntra is called tantrik diiks&#x301;a&#x301; Strictly speaking vaedik diiks&#x301;a&#x301; is not real diiks&#x301;a&#x301;; at the most it may be called a process of purification. Only ta&#x301;ntrik diiks&#x301;a&#x301; deserves to be called diiks&#x301;a&#x301; because it includes the necessary factors required for diiks&#x301;a&#x301; such as diipanii, mantra caetanya, abhis&#x301;eka. If sa&#x301;dhakas learn the proper techniques of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; from a competent master and practice the same regularly and with utmost sincerity and devotion, they will move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a with firm steps. Their entire existence becomes illuminated with the effulgence of Supreme veracity, of divine realization. Such sa&#x301;dhakas no longer remain under the domination of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
