<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The main duty of the Ta&#x301;ttvikas is to make a propagation which aims at collective welfare.  Collective welfare is Shiva.  So the propagation of collective welfare is full of the greatness of Shivatva, and therefore, it is indispensable.  At the time of propagation, your views, nay, all your tendencies should be pointed towards Satya, because it is only through the propagation of Satya that collective welfare is possible.  Satya and Shiva are so interrelated that neither can stand, or be achieved without the other.  Satya is that through whose observance you will proceed towards Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a and ultimately you will be one with it in its entirety i.e. with Parama Purus&#x301;a whom the sages have given the name &ldquo;Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a-Sundaram.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Asatya is just its opposite.  Where there is no propagation of Satya people indulge in individual selfishness or group selfishness. The aim or object there is not enlivened with the idea of collective welfare.  The only object of the party concerned is how to establish oneself in this material world by means of the use of well-knit language and cunningness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->High ideals have been preached many times in many countries, no doubt, but to what extent has it help in establishing Satya?  Most of the preachers were expert (adept) in the art of preaching, there was no paucity of experienced hands in Praca&#x301;ra Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na still, after the expiry of the momentary charms, when people realized that they had not been served with what is Satya, they tried to wipe out their (the preachers) names from the pages of history with disregard and aversion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->You shall, therefore, preach only Satya.  Explain to them whatever you have done with reasons thereof.  Also, make it clear to them what you want to do and why you want to do.  The result of this highly useful (helpful) preaching is that the inferiority complex disappears from the mind of the common men.  they are encouraged when they see that a common man like themselves is inspired with such a high ideal. The second result of this is as follows.  The common result of this is as follows.  The common people are not generally aware of your usefully high ideas.  In every work, big or small, they cling to selfishness.  So, learning everything pure and high through your easy and simple language they will cooperate with you, with a mind free from wrong notions.  The third outcome of this is that they will be shorn off the wrong notions that may have crept into them by the propaganda made by the selfish persons with vested interests.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Win over their heart by propagating Satya but without abusing anyone.  When, they will feel the ideal of Satya and come to know of your untiring Karma Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, naturally, they will abandon their wrong notions about you; they will even start respecting you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Even in private life when a person behaves with you badly or uses harsh words, don&#146;t behave with him in the same manner.  You shall explain to him his duties gently.  In case, anyone has a wrong impression, you shall show him the right path without scolding (abusing) him.  Make it clear to him if possible with practical demonstration how harmful may be the effect of such habits.  But always keep this in mind that in such cases your behaviour must be like that of a friend, and never like that of an instructor.  Your only object will be to get your advice accepted by him.  the idea that he is fool and you are wise is not desirable in any party.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->You shall keep all the types of your [public-relations facilities] engaged in the propagation of Satya.  While preaching, you will always keep this in view that the person whom you are preaching has the ability to understand it in the way you are making it clear.  The following are the types of publicity machines: <ol> <li>Tattva Sabha&#x301; <li>Press <li>Proper approach <li>Utsava. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->1. Tattva Sabha&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Never do anything only to serve the interest of the party.  Whatever you do should be for the benefit of the mass, for the welfare of the people in general, and to achieve this object publish only those facts which deal with the ideal of the Marga.  Give the public opportunity to know the ideal of the Marga by publishing exactly what it is, in a weekly, monthly, or a periodical, writing articles, poems, stories, dramas, novels, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->2. Press<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->On a public platform speakers generally become eloquent in praising one&#146;s own party.  You, however, should not follow the same path.  While speaking, keep this in view that your listeners get interested in all the social, mental, economical, moral as well as spiritual practices with devotion through Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, Karma, and Bhakti.  Let not your preachings create division between man and man.  Always speak with the feeling of oneness with an eye to the welfare of the entire living beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->3. Proper Approach<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Explain to him in that particular way in which he can understand easily.  To him for whom Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301; is necessary, speak with a colour of Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301;.  Similarly speak with the feeling of Vaeshyocita, Ks&#x301;atriyocita or Viprocita seva&#x301; where it is necessary.  While speaking, a few more things have to be kept in mind.  Remember always that speaking is easy, but to speak something worth saying is not a joke.  Words shall have to be expressed, only after they have been weighed accurately.  You shall try to speak to him in the manner in which he feels quite homely.  for this Ta&#x301;ttvikas should learn as many languages as possible to deal with different persons through their own mother tongues.  People understand in the best way through their mother tongues.  So, however less spoken one&#146;s mother tongue may be, educative as well as Kalyan adharmi literature should certainly be written in that language, and taking into consideration the economic condition of the general public, fix the price of the book.  Deliver your speech in the local language in a meeting too, as far as practicable.  You should always remember that you have gone there to explain to the inhabitants what Satya is in an easy and simple language.  It is not your aim there to create style of literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->4. Utsava<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Man is a social animal.  So every human being likes utsava.  It is the desire of all that they will rejoice unitedly.  In Europe Puritanism failed in the end, only because the Puritans failed to care for the desires of the general public.  They preached their theory only to a handful of devotees of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Ananda Marga is for the general public.  So, considering the necessity of the general mass, proper importance has to be given to the Utsava in social life. Excitement in a Utsava is the greatest in the children, in the tender aged boys, in the youths and last of all in grown ups.  In the programmes of a Utsava, therefore, you shall think for the children first.  Their sweet stammering noises ensure the success of the Utsava.  But whatever arrangements you may make for the children, the youngsters, youths, or for the grown-ups, make that there is no dearth of discipline even to the minutest extent anywhere.  Let there be complete harmony.  If anyone is given punishment, let him bear it gladly, he must maintain the mirth unaffected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->A grown up man does not like that others should call him grown up.  An old man does not like that others should tell him old.  Do you know, why they do not like to be said so?  The adults or the aged are nearing death.  This means that one is drawing nearer death as one grow up and this is why one does not like to be told grown up or old.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Taking this for granted regarding human psychology, you shall arrange for two or three items in the programme for the old to enjoy, so that they may think at least for a short time that they are not old, they have sufficient energy still left in them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Take pains to see that all join in the Utsava.  Give full opportunity to all the artists to make a display of their talents in art.  Remember that taking food together is a special feature in a Utsava, without which half of the pleasure of a Utsava is marred.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Another way to give the public their due respect is to serve them properly.  While preaching with a shudrocita idea in view, it should particularly be kept in mind that during the service you will not enter into a propaganda work.  Very likely it may so happen that you may go on attending on him, but he does not pay any heed to your single utterance or you do not get any chance to put a word to him, but you need not be sorry for that, because (Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan) in human form has accepted, taking your service and this much is your gain.  Is it a less important gain?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The verbal comment on the speeches of others does not impress the people so much as the printed words of a book do, more so if those words are confirmed directly or indirectly by any religious scripture.<!-- /block --></p>
