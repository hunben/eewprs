<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->To a person of average intelligence, water and ice are two different entities, but one who knows a little of the truth knows that ice is only a crudified form of water. Similarly, where the average person sees a big difference between a pot and the potter, the knower of Brahma sees only oneness between them. Are the world and Brahma two different entities, or are they indivisible? Is the one true, and the other false? Is the difference that appears between the two the truth, or illusion? Such questions or ways of thinking never arise in the mind of a person with Cosmic outlook.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Whether the world and Brahma are two entities, or the one is not different from the other &ndash; such thoughts are wrong in themselves. The knower of Brahma feels that the world is indeed His own manifestation; he knows that all is He. Do you know how that difference looks from the Cosmic perspective? Not any bigger than the difference between &ldquo;person&rdquo; and &ldquo;human being&rdquo;, between &ldquo;sea&rdquo; and &ldquo;ocean&rdquo;. From a sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s [spiritual aspirant&#146;s] standpoint the distinction does not exist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Brahma is the lord of the evolved objects; He is the controller of every one of them. This very Lord moves in the womb as the [foetus] and when it is born, the event, in fact, should be called the birth of Brahma, because all creations are but manifestations of Brahma Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is one moon, but its reflections, falling in countless puddles of water, appear as countless moons. No new moon is born. The same moon is being reflected or is taking birth in many receptacles. Similarly the one and the same Brahma is being manifested as limitless unit entities in countless mental receptacles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The union of a sa&#x301;dhaka with Brahma has been expressed in an excellent [metaphor]. A river gives up its name and identity and completely merges in the sea; thereafter it cannot maintain its own existence, it is the sea. Similarly, a sa&#x301;dhaka, after merging himself or herself in Brahma, can no longer think of himself or herself except as Brahma. Seeing the Ganges River we can tell that it is the water of the Ganges. We can tell the water of the Yamuna River, or the water of the Sarasvati River. But once they merge in the sea, we cannot separate them, nor can we distinguish the one from the other. They all have lost their respective name-entities in the entity of the sea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When a knower of Truth merges in the Supreme Being, his or her petty sense of existence is lost, and, attaining unity with the Supreme Entity, the person becomes supreme himself or herself. Spiritual practice is the means for the expansion of the soul, not for its annihilation; so sama&#x301;dhi does not mean suicide but self-transcendence. One who has known Brahma becomes Brahma Itself, for the unit entity takes on the very form of its object of ideation. One who has Brahma as his or her object of ideation becomes Brahma Itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->If a salt doll goes to fathom the sea, it will certainly melt and become the sea itself. Similarly, if the knower of Brahma goes to fathom Brahma, he or she merges in the sea of Brahma and becomes Brahma Itself. Be constantly absorbed in the thought of Brahma and you too will become Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
