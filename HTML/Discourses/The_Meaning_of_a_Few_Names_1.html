<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Manomaya&#x301;nanda</b>: <I>Manomaya + a&#x301;nanda</I>. Where does the word <I>manomaya</I> come from? The word <I>manomaya</I> is derived by adding the suffix <I>mayat&#x301;</I> to the root of the word <I>manah</I>. The suffix <I>mayat&#x301;</I> is attached to indicate &ldquo;that from which something is formed.&rdquo; It is not a verbal affix (primary suffix) but rather a nominal affix (secondary suffix), that is, it is affixed to nominal root, not the root verb. <I>Manah</I> is a word. For example, <I>daya&#x301; +mayat&#x301; = daya&#x301;maya</I>, which means &ldquo;that which is formed of compassion&rdquo;. <I>Krpa&#x301;maya</I> means &ldquo;that which is formed of grace&rdquo;. <I>Svarn&#x301;amaya</I> means &ldquo;that which is formed of gold&rdquo;. <I>Mrn&#x301;maya</I> means &ldquo;that which is formed of earth&rdquo;. <I>Cinmaya</I> means &ldquo;that which is formed of consciousness&rdquo;. So <I>manomaya</I> means &ldquo;that which is formed of mind&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now a man has a body made of the five material factors. It has not been formed of mind, but that material body is operated by its mind. Mind is the director. So the body is not <I>manomaya</I>; it is material &ndash; <I>pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tamaya</I>. But what is the case with <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>? <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is not <I>pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tamaya</I> but rather <I>manomaya</I>. He has a mind and that mind is operated by <I>a&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> [consciousness]. Nothing takes place at all through any material body. If He ever came in a material body then that material body would have to remain within His mind. It cannot go outside Him, that is to say, in this case also He is <I>manomaya</I>, not <I>pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tamaya</I>. He has created that material body within His mind, so He is <I>manomaya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, whatever we see in this universe we call quinquelemental. Whatever we see in this material world is real to us in its quinquelemental form but to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> it is not. He thinks in this way. He thinks the palm tree, He thinks the mountain. To us these are all quinquelemental but to Him they are psychic, completely psychic. Hence <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is <I>manomaya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->This <I>manomaya</I> entity is called <I>manomaya</I> for yet another reason; this being that <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is present in every cavity of the human mind. In other words, there is no way I can hide anything from Him because He is all-pervading. He is present within everything. Everything has been created by his thought process. Your material body has also been created by His thought process, and He is within your mind. And this individual mind of yours, which is within your body as a result of clash and cohesion and also functions outside the body, has also been created by His mind. He is present within it and within your <I>a&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> as well. Hence He is <I>manomaya</I> both within your mind and outside it as well. There is no way for you to hide anything from him. &ldquo;Today I couldn&#146;t do this work, it should have been done last night. Today I won&#146;t go in front of Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; because who knows what will happen. If He says something in front of the others, I&#146;ll be cut to the quick. I won&#146;t go today; I&#146;ll go tomorrow.&rdquo; You have thought all these in your mind, but He who is <I>manomaya</I>, He hears everything. It is better not to think in this way. Such thoughts are not proper. Rather one should say: &ldquo;You know everything. Today I&#146;m a little scared, so I&#146;m not going.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This is <I>manomaya</I>. The bliss that one derives by ideating on that <I>manomaya Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> cannot be gotten anyplace else. The name of that bliss is <I>manomaya&#x301;nanda</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><b>Jagadbha&#x301;saka&#x301;nanda</b>: In Sanskrit the word <I>jagat</I> is derived by adding the suffix <I>kvip</I> to the root verb <I>gam</I>. How does the suffix <I>kvip</I> function? For example, <I>mayat&#x301;</I>, meaning &ldquo;that from which something is formed,&rdquo; <I></I>is affixed to the verbal root, not the nominal root. With the word <I>jagat</I>, the suffix <I>kvip</I> is attached to the verbal root <I>gam</I>. <I>Kvip</I> is attached to the verbal root, the root verb, not the nominal root. What does the root verb <I>gam</I> mean? Here the suffix was used in the sense of &ldquo;nature&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;to show the nature of&rdquo;. For example, adding the suffix <I>kvip</I> to the root verb <I>s&#x301;ad</I> prefixed by <I>upa</I> and <I>ni</I> yields <I>upanis&#x301;ad</I>. <I>Upa</I> means &ldquo;near&rdquo;; <I>ni</I> means &ldquo;deeply&rdquo;. That which brings a human being profoundly near to <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is <I>upanis&#x301;ad</I>. The suffix <I>kvip</I> has been used and meaning of it, is &ndash; &ldquo;To bring near is its nature.&rdquo; The root verb <I>gam</I> and the suffix <I>kvip</I> form the word <I>jagat</I>. <I>Gam</I> means &ldquo;to move&rdquo; and that whose nature is to move we call <I>jagat</I>. Therefore the suffix <I>kvip</I> has been used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Everything on this earth is moving. Movement is its nature, it is a sign of advancement. There is no way, no scope, for anyone to stop. It cannot happen. A dead body also cannot stop, because it is on this earth. The earth revolves, it moves continuously. Whatever has been created in this universe, whatever is begotten by the imagination of <I>manomaya</I>, is moving. It is <I>jagat</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The word <I>bha&#x301;saka</I> comes by adding the suffix <I>s&#x301;ak</I> or the suffix <I>n&#x301;ak</I> to the root verb <I>bha&#x301;s</I>. Let me say something about the suffixes <I>s&#x301;ak</I> and <I>n&#x301;ak</I>. In order to accomplish some work, there is often the need of two entities. One is a person and the other the object this person uses in order to do the work. Imagine that someone is making an earthen jar. Who is the maker of the jar? The person, of course, and the earth as well. The suffix <I>n&#x301;ak</I> is attached to the root of the earth. The suffix <I>s&#x301;ak</I> is attached to the root of the man who is making it, and the suffix <I>n&#x301;ak</I> is added to the root of the object or the element with whose help something is made.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Let us say, for example, that something is being dyed. For example, some cloth is being stained with a dye. Here there are two things. There is the person who is applying the dye, and there is the dye which has been bought in the market. The pigment is <I>rain&#x32D;jak </I>&ndash; <I>rain&#x32D;jak sa&#x301;va&#x301;n</I> [dying soap] &ndash; formed by adding the suffix <I>n&#x301;ak</I> to the root verb <I>ran&#x301;j</I>, and the man who is applying the dye we call <I>rajaka</I>, by adding the suffix <I>s&#x301;ak </I>to the root verb <I>ran&#x301;j</I>. In Bengali the word <I>rajaka</I> is used to mean <I>dhopa&#x301;</I> [washerman] because in the olden days the washermen used to dye clothes. The actual meaning of the word <I>rajaka</I> is &ldquo;a person who applies dye&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now the meaning of the root verb <I>bha&#x301;s</I> is &ldquo;to illuminate&rdquo;, &ldquo;to make radiant&rdquo;. He who has coloured the entire world &ndash; since it is coloured we are able to see it &ndash; he is <I>bha&#x301;saka</I>. So <I>jagadbha&#x301;saka</I> means we are able to see the universe. Why? Because He has made it shine, has made it radiant. Everything shines with His light, so He is <I>jagadbha&#x301;sa</I>. <I>Jagadbha&#x301;saka</I> and <I>jagadbha&#x301;sa</I> &ndash; both work &ndash; by adding the suffix <I>al</I>. One who knows this is a spiritual aspirant. He is that <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> who is <I>manomaya</I>. So one will ideate on Him, will meditate on Him, will repeat His <I>japa</I> [repetition of mantra], will come close to Him, will heed His instructions. And what is that bliss that one gets by being absorbed in the thought of Him? It is <I>jagadbha&#x301;saka&#x301;nanda</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><I>A</I> prefix, <I>nand</I> root verb + <I>al</I> suffix = <I>a&#x301;nanda</I>. This <I>a&#x301;nanda</I> gives a human being unlimited pleasure. No object gives a human being endless pleasure. For example, a <I>sandesh</I> [a type of milk sweet] gives pleasure as long as it is on the tongue, but once it is has been swallowed the <I>sandesh</I> comes to an end. But the type of pleasure we get from something that gives us endless pleasure is called <I>a&#x301;nanda</I>. The <I>a&#x301;nanda</I> or bliss that we get by ideating on <I>jagadbha&#x301;saka</I>, that pleasure which has no end, is <I>jagadbha&#x301;saka&#x301;nanda</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;aprema&#x301;nanda</b>: In Sanskrit the root verb <I>krs&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;to culture&rdquo;, &ldquo;to cultivate&rdquo;, &ldquo;to till the land&rdquo;. This root verb has another meaning as well: &ldquo;to pull&rdquo; or &ldquo;to attract&rdquo;. <I>A&#x301; &ndash; krs&#x301; + anat&#x301; = a&#x301;kars&#x301;an&#x301;a</I> [attraction]. Another meaning of the root verb <I>krs&#x301;</I> is the thought of &ldquo;I exist.&rdquo; Everyone thinks &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;. &ldquo;I am coming from New Barrackpore.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am going to the <I>ja&#x301;grti</I>.&rdquo; It is only after the thought of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; that a person thinks of anything else. This sense of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; is within everyone. Thinking of this &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;, this action, we call <I>krs&#x301;</I>. We don&#146;t think, &ldquo;I don&#146;t exist;&rdquo; we think &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now the word Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a <I></I>is derived by adding the suffix <I>na</I> to the root verb <I>krs&#x301;</I>. The word Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a <I></I>means &ldquo;he who attracts everyone, whether we know it or not&rdquo;. Knowingly or unknowingly, everything is being attracted, is being drawn towards him. That attraction is irresistible. It is no use saying that we won&#146;t be moved by that attraction. We will have to rush towards him because Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a <I></I>draws the mind and draws the legs also. If the feet say they won&#146;t go, the mind will say that it has to go. And if the mind says that it won&#146;t go, the feet will drag it in his direction, even if it does not want to come. Another meaning of the word Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a <I></I>is &ldquo;nucleus of the universe&rdquo;. Sitting at the very center he attracts or draws everything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The second meaning of the word Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a <I></I>is &ldquo;the colour black.&rdquo; Of all colours in this world, people&#146;s sight is first drawn to the colour black. In this sense the colour black is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, that is, it attracts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Every human being thinks &ldquo;I exist, I exist,&rdquo; but they can only think &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; when <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> gives them the mental force to think it. If He would not give them that mental force then the thought &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; would not be thought. Bricks, stones and wood do not think, are not able to think, &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;. But living beings think this, especially human beings. The name of the one who supplies the force behind this thought of &ldquo;I exist,&rdquo; that is, I exist because He exists, is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now the topic is <I>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;aprema</I>. Attraction is the law of nature, not repulsion. We may say that repulsion is negative attraction, but attraction is not negative repulsion. So attraction is the chief characteristic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Say, for instance, a person is attracted to <I>sandesh</I>. <I>Sandesh</I> is something limited, so we cannot call this attraction <I>prema</I> . That attraction is a kind of mental weakness. However, when that attraction rushes towards the unlimited, that is, rushes in the direction of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, then we call it <I>prema</I>. It means mental and physical propulsion for that universal nucleus. When we feel attracted towards that nucleus, that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a<I></I>, whether it be mentally or physically, to the extent that we cannot resist, even if we wanted to, then it is called <I>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;aprema</I>. I cannot resist drinking liquor so I rush towards the liquor store &ndash; this is a limited thing. We call it <I>a&#x301;sakti</I> [attachment, addiction]. <I>Pa&#x301;na&#x301;sakti, madya&#x301;sakti </I>[intemperance] &ndash; these are all <I>a&#x301;sakti</I>, not <I>prema</I>. The bliss that lies behind this willingly or unwillingly rushing towards the Supreme is called <I>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;aprema</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
