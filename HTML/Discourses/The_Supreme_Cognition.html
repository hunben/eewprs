<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Cosmic Operative Principle, or Cosmic Creative Principle, or Causal Matrix, is sheltered in the Transcendental Entity, the Supreme Cognition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;ra has three imports. One meaning of na&#x301;ra is niira, that is, water. Another meaning of na&#x301;ra is &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. The sage whose only duty was to preach the gospels of devotion was called &ldquo;Na&#x301;rada&rdquo;. Da means &ldquo;donor&rdquo;, &ldquo;giver&rdquo;, and na&#x301;ra means &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. And the third meaning of Na&#x301;ra is the Supreme Operative Principle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->And because the Supreme Operative Principle, or Na&#x301;ra, has been sheltered in the Transcendental Entity, the Supreme Cognition, the Supreme Cognition is called Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Na&#x301;ra + ayana [shelter] = Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, the Supreme Cognition is a non-attributed entity, and the faculty of attribution lies with the Operative Principle. Theoretically, when there was no expression, no manifestation, there were innumerable flows of different waves of this Supreme Operative Principle, but they could not create any geometrical figure. And when the first geometrical figure was created, in that first geometrical figure, in that Causal Matrix, there were so many waves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->But all those waves can be brought under three main categories according to wavelength. Where the waves are subtlest, that is, moving almost in the form of straight lines, that particular variety [of wave] is called the sentient principle. [And another variety of wave] comes within the scope of the mutative principle. And the crudest one, the static principle. So in that first figure, in that first geometrical figure, at the dawn of creation, there may be more than one line, but there were only three principles. And finally, as a result of their mutual inter-transmutation, there remained only three lines, that is, there remained only one triangle. And this is what is called the triangle of forces. Even within that triangle of forces there were inter-transmutations &ndash; sentient being converted into mutative, mutative into static, static into sentient&#8230; This process of inter-transmutation is called svaru&#x301;pa parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma in the sha&#x301;stras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->First you should know what sha&#x301;stra is. Sha&#x301;sana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah sha&#x301;strah parikiirtitah [&ldquo;That which liberates through discipline is called sha&#x301;stra, or scripture&rdquo;]. Sha&#x301;sana means [&ldquo;control&rdquo;]. That which controls your activities just to help you in your march towards the Supreme Entity is sha&#x301;stra. Tra means &ldquo;liberator&rdquo;. Sha&#x301;s means &ldquo;to control&rdquo;. So in the sha&#x301;stras, this inter-transmutation is called svaru&#x301;pa parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma. This first triangle of creation is, however, a theoretical creation. Here the Operative Principle does not create anything concrete. It was in the seed form of creation, and in that Operative Principle, the Cognitive Principle was also there. But It, the Cognitive Faculty, was not in an expressed form. In that triangle of forces, the Operative Principle is called Prakrti and not Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, because in that stage She was not able to create anything concrete. The Operative Principle in the triangle of forces is called Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti or Shiva&#x301;nii Shakti, and Its witnessing counterpart, the Cognition, is called Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now in the next phase, as a result of constant inter-transmutation, force was released from one of the vertices of the triangle, and when it came out, that starting point was the first point of creation. There Prakrti became fully attributed, and Purus&#x301;a is also attributed because of Its witnessing something attributed. You know, when energy is all of a sudden released, its movement is just like a straight line, and after that it acquires curvature due to clash and cohesion. So that released force moving just like a straight line is something attributed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Prakrti in the triangular form is called the Basic Principle. Then in this second form, moving in a straight line, [She may be termed Bhava&#x301;nii shakti,] and in Bhava&#x301;nii shakti the [succeeding] curvature always tries to follow the [preceding] curvature; that is, the succeeding curvature is just like, though not exactly the same as, the preceding curvature. Suppose one man is A. His son is B. B is just like A &ndash; B is also a man, not a goat. Then his son, C. C is just like B &ndash; he is also a man, not a dog. That is, the following curvature is to some extent like the preceding curvature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This process of following the preceding curvature is called sadrsha parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma in the sha&#x301;stras. Sadrsha means &ldquo;similar&rdquo;. You will see there is hardly any difference between B and C; C is following B. But there is a gulf of difference between A and Z. Suppose A was an australopithecine of the Pliocene Age, and Z is a man of this Cenozoic Age. This change is going on in the realm of the vibrational principle. In our philosophy, Bhaeravii shakti is called the primordial principle, and Bhava&#x301;nii shakti is called the vibrational principle. Now, here we are in the realm of  the vibrational principle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What is the role of the Cosmic Cognition? The Cosmic Cognition is beyond the scope of time, space and person, because these three fundamental relative factors are the creation of the Operative Principle, and the Operative Principle is sheltered by the Cognition. So the Cosmic Cognition is beyond the realm of the Operative Principle, and so beyond the realm of time, space and person. It is simply the witnessing factor. Whatever is being done in the arena of the Operational Principle is being witnessed by the Cognition. That is why the Cognition is called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na svaru&#x301;pa [&ldquo;of the nature of knowledge&rdquo;] in the sha&#x301;stras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now, what is human existence? This quinquelemental universe has been created in the extroversial phase within the realm of the vibrational principle. Wherever, in this quinquelemental universe, there is an adjustment of the five fundamental factors, there we find life. Life is a creation of proper balance or proper adjustment, proper equipoise, of the five fundamental factors. And when life is created, life, or the vital principle, the vital force, as the propelling energy, converts some portion of those quinquelemental factors into a subtler object. That subtler object is the ectoplasm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The human mind is a creation of physical factors. Ectoplasm is a creation of physical factors. The human mind is a creation of the human body. The quinquelemental universe is a creation of the Cosmic Mind, of the Macrocosm, but the microcosm, the unit mind, is a creation of  the quinquelemental factors. The human mind did not come directly from the Macrocosm; it came from matter. And matter is a creation of the Macrocosm. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now, after the creation of the ectoplasmic structure in living beings, the introversial phase starts. In this introversial phase, we get ego, we get intellect, we get intuition. And the best intuitional faculty, the best creation of intuitional stamina, is the process of cogitation. The cogitative mind tries to express all its experiences, but it fails to express its experiences properly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->You came in contact with fire. You said, &ldquo;Oof.&rdquo; This &ldquo;oof&rdquo; does not represent properly the feeling that you experienced when you came in contact with fire, but you tried to express your tactual experience by uttering the word &ldquo;oof&rdquo;. Do you follow? When you feel pleasure, you try to express your sensory feeling by uttering the word &ldquo;ah!&rdquo; But the &ldquo;ah!&rdquo; cannot fathom the depth of your pleasure. Similarly, &ldquo;oof&rdquo; cannot fathom the depth of your predicament. But it is the human wont to try to express one&#146;s sensory or psychic feelings. There lies the speciality of the microcosm. And there starts the intuitional practice of the microcosm; there starts sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Cognition, being beyond the arena of personal, temporal or spatial factors, does not come within the periphery of any acoustic expression. Even then, humans try to express It. The Supreme Cognition, Parama Purus&#x301;a, cannot be expressed, cannot have any acoustic expression. Even then, humans try to express It, just to satisfy themselves. Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; kabhii ucchis&#x301;t&#x301; nahiin hue haen. [&ldquo;Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; can never be brought within the scope of the mind&rdquo;]. The Vedic rs&#x301;i [sage] says regarding that Parama Purus&#x301;a, that Supreme Cognition:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Eko Devah sarvabhu&#x301;tes&#x301;u gu&#x301;d&#x301;hah sarvavya&#x301;pii sarvabhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ntara&#x301;tma&#x301;;<br>Karma&#x301;dhyaks&#x301;a sarvabhu&#x301;ta&#x301;dhiva&#x301;sah sa&#x301;ks&#x301;iicet kevalo nirgun&#x301;ashca.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->[That Supreme Singular Entity lies hidden in the innermost recesses of all created beings. He pervades everything; He is the innermost self of all beings. He presides over all actions and is the final shelter of all beings. He alone is Cognition in the form of Witnessing Entity, beyond all gun&#x301;as, or attributes.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Eko Devah [&ldquo;That Supreme Singular Entity&rdquo;]. Eka means &ldquo;one&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> When you say &ldquo;one&rdquo;, it is a particular psychic projection, is it not? When you say eka, it is a particular psychic projection, and when the word eka is used for a particular object, that object comes within the periphery of your psychic body. But He is beyond the scope of time, space and person. How can you use the word eka for Him? You cannot. Nor can you use the word aneka [&ldquo;not one&rdquo;, &ldquo;many&rdquo;] for Him, because aneka is another psychic projection. But even then the rs&#x301;i says eka. Because when the mind becomes eka, one comes in contact with Him. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->You know, in the human mind there are so many propensities. In the human [body] there are fifty main glands and sub-glands. Now the hormone created, secreted, by each and every gland or main sub-gland controls a particular propensity of the human mind. These hormones are called granthisudha&#x301; or granthirasa in Sanskrit. In the human mind there are fifty expressions, depending on the secretion of hormones from the fifty main glands and sub-glands. And you know, each and every propensity, when expressed, moves in a particular line with a particular wavelength. The wavelength of ghrn&#x301;a&#x301; [hatred] is quite different from that of lajja&#x301; [shame] or bhaya [fear].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Each and every propensity has got its peculiar wavelength, and wherever there is any vibrational expression there is sound and colour. So the fifty propensities are called fifty colours (&ldquo;colour&rdquo; is varn&#x301;a in Sanskrit). So these are fifty varn&#x301;as, and each and every propensity, each and every expression, has its sound also &ndash; acoustic expression also &ndash; so there are fifty sounds. Those fifty sounds, those fifty colours, are a, a&#x301;, i, ii, u, uu, and because they have their peculiar colours, they are called varn&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301;, &ldquo;a collection of colours&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->In the Tantric varn&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301;, the first letter is a. A represents the propensity of creation. Whenever you are going to create something, a particular wave is radiated from your mind, is emanated from your mind, and that emanated wave has a particular colour and a particular sound. The sound of the faculty of creation is a-a-a-a-a. First creation, then other things. Hence, a is the first letter of the Tantric varn&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301;. What is the first letter of the Gujarati varn&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301;? A. Very good. Have you understood why a comes first and not a&#x301;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->When these propensities are moving towards so many mundane and supramundane objects, your mind gets divided and subdivided due to your internal fissiparous tendencies. So what is your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? You are to withdraw those expressions, those fifty expressions, and bring them to a particular point, and guide that singular flow unto the Supreme Self. You can come in contact with Him only when these fifty expressions become one. Hence the rs&#x301;i says, Eko Devah. Hence the word eka has been used, and not aneka. Do you follow? Very good.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->You see, human cogitation tries to explain Him. But human language fails to express Him properly. It is just like mysticism. You know what mysticism is; mysticism is a never-ending endeavour to find a link between the finite and the infinite. It is a never-ending process. Similar is the case with these things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Then the rs&#x301;i says Deva. What is deva? The Supreme Cognition is the hub of this Cosmological order. In the case of an atom, there is a particular nucleus. That nucleus is the hub of that atom, in that smallest atomic system. Then again, in this ethereal system, the earth is the hub, the earth is the nave, and the moon is moving around the earth. It is the ethereal system. Then we come to a still bigger system &ndash; the solar system. Here the sun is the nave, and so many planets are moving around it. And then the biggest system, Brahma Cakra, the Cosmological order, the Cosmological system; there Parama Purus&#x301;a is the nucleus, the hub, the nave, and so many jiivas [unit beings] are moving around Him with their respective sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, their respective reactive momenta. Do you follow? Very good. The entire expressed universe, as I just said, is a mesh of vibrations of different wavelengths, and these vibrational expressions came out emanated from the Supreme Hub, Parama Purus&#x301;a. Each and every expression emanating from the Supreme Hub is certainly a divine expression, and each and every divine expression is called a deva. So these fifty letters are all devas. They are of divine expression, and that&#146;s why they are called ma&#x301;trka varn&#x301;a, that is, &ldquo;causal matrix&rdquo;: colour serving as the causal matrix, the ma&#x301;trka varn&#x301;a (&ldquo;mother of this universe&rdquo;) &ndash; these letters are mothers of this universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Deva. He is the supreme Deva &ndash; Eko Devah. He is the Deva of all devas, He is the Father of all fathers. He is not pita&#x301; [father], He is Parama Pita&#x301; [Supreme Father]. Just like the moon. The moon is the ma&#x301;ma&#x301; [maternal uncle] of everybody. Your ma&#x301;ma&#x301;, your father&#146;s ma&#x301;ma&#x301;, your father&#146;s father&#146;s ma&#x301;ma&#x301;; Chandama&#x301;ma&#x301; [Uncle Moon] is the ma&#x301;ma&#x301; for all. He is your ma&#x301;ma&#x301; and your maternal uncle&#146;s ma&#x301;ma&#x301; also. Because he is your maternal uncle&#146;s ma&#x301;ma&#x301;, he is not your maternal grandfather. He is also your maternal uncle. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->So, Eko Devah &ndash; &ldquo;He is the Supreme Deva.&rdquo; That is, He is Maha&#x301;deva, the Deva of all devas, the multiple of all the multiplicities of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Sarvabhu&#x301;tes&#x301;u gu&#x301;d&#x301;hah [&ldquo;hidden in the innermost recesses of all created beings&rdquo;]. Sarvabhu&#x301;ta: Bhu&#x301;ta means &ldquo;created beings&rdquo;. Bhu&#x301;ta means &ldquo;past&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;created&rdquo;. And sarvabhu&#x301;ta. What is sarva? What is the meaning of sarva in the Gujarati language? &ldquo;Everything&rdquo;. Yes, yes. But why &ldquo;everything&rdquo;? You should know. Just now I have said that wherever there is an expression, there is a colour, there is sound. That colour may or may not be visible. That sound may or may not be audible. For very long or very small wavelengths it is not audible. For very long or very short wavelengths it is not visible. Only from a particular wavelength to a particular wavelength does it come within the scope of audibility or visibility. So sarva means &ldquo;everything&rdquo;, and sarvabhu&#x301;ta means &ldquo;each and every created being&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->But why does the word sarva mean &ldquo;everything&rdquo;? In sarva there are three words, sa, ra and va. Sa means dantya sa [dental &ldquo;s&rdquo;]. Just now I said, for each and every entity there is a particular sound, a particular colour. Now the acoustic root, the sound, of the sentient principle, the first principle of creation, the first principle of the Operative Principle,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the first phase of the Operative Principle, is dantya sa. Dantya sa sattvagun&#x301; ka&#x301; biija mantra haen [&ldquo;Dantya sa is the biija mantra, the acoustic root, of sattvagun&#x301;a&rdquo;]. So when the sprout of creation came out from one of the vertices of that Shiva&#x301;nii Shakti, the triangle of forces, that starting point, the vertex, was in close contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence it was sentient by nature. So everything comes out from that particular point, from that fundamental positivity of creation, from that fundamental positivity of the universe. So the starting point for each and every object is sa. The sentient principle is the starting point, the fundamental positivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Then the letter ra. Ya,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  ra. Ra is the acoustic root of energy. When force functions within the scope of matter, that force is called energy. And the acoustic root of energy, that is, the sound wave, the sound of the wave, is ra. &ldquo;Created by the sentient sa, maintained by the energy ra.&rdquo; Everything is maintained by energy, the energy ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->And the third letter is va. Va represents the wont of a particular object, the characteristic of a particular object. Each and every object in this universe has its own peculiar characteristics. Fire burns, water drenches. This drenching or this burning are the particular characteristics of those items. Now the acoustic root of wont, acoustic root of property, acoustic root of characteristic, is va. Ya, ra, la, va.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->So &ldquo;created by the sentient sa, maintained by the energy ra, and also having its own peculiar property va&rdquo;: sa, ra, va. Now each and every object of this universe is controlled by these three letters, sa, ra and va. Hence Sa ra va sarva ucyate [&ldquo;Sa, ra, and va are called sarva, everything&rdquo;]. Because of the influence of these three letters, &ldquo;everything&rdquo; is sarva. Do you follow? Sarva means &ldquo;everything&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->So sarvabhu&#x301;tes&#x301;u gu&#x301;d&#x301;hah &ndash; &ldquo;that Supreme Cognition lies covert in each and every created being.&rdquo; Eko Devah &ndash; &ldquo;Human cogitation is trying to express Him.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Sarvavya&#x301;pii sarvabhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ntara&#x301;tma&#x301; [&ldquo;He pervades everything; He is the innermost self of all beings&rdquo;]. Sarvavya&#x301;pii: sarva you know; vya&#x301;pii means &ldquo;pervasive&rdquo;. That Supreme Entity is not only a covert entity, not only lies covert within each and every entity, but is all-pervasive. Each and every entity has got its individual cognition. There may or may not be any psychic expression, there may or may not be any mental expression, but there is a&#x301;tman [soul] in each and every entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Now, whatever is being done or has been done or was done by your physical body is known to your mental body; in that case, your mental body is the knowing counterpart of your physical actions. And similarly, what is known by your mind is witnessed by your a&#x301;tman; in that case, where the mental function is to know, there the witnessing counterpart is the a&#x301;tman. To know is the faculty of the mind. To witness is the faculty of the a&#x301;tman. Clear? The mind knows, and the a&#x301;tman witnesses that the mind has known. The mind is knowing. Do you follow? Suppose your son has passed his MA. He has learnt much. But you know about it. Know what? That &ldquo;my son has passed the MA examination&rdquo;. This witnessing is the faculty of the a&#x301;tman, and knowing is the faculty of the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->And whatever is witnessed by your individual a&#x301;tman, individual cognition, is also witnessed by the Supreme Cognition. So when your a&#x301;tman is the individual a&#x301;tman or jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; for you, then the A&#x301;tman of Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Antara&#x301;tman for you, inner A&#x301;tman for you. Sometimes we use the word &ldquo;inner voice&rdquo;. The inner voice [is] Parama&#x301;tman [the Supreme Soul], or the Antara&#x301;tma&#x301;. (This Antara&#x301;tma&#x301; is also called Pratyaga&#x301;tma&#x301; in Sanskrit. Pratiipa means opposite.

And another &ldquo;I&rdquo; is your big &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Parama&#x301;tman is your big &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Smaller &ldquo;I&rdquo;, bigger &ldquo;I&rdquo;. You know, so many entities have so many &ldquo;I&rdquo;s and so many &ldquo;my&rdquo;s. But that bigger &ldquo;I&rdquo; is a singular entity. All these persons, that is, all the expressed entities of this entire universe, have got only one &ldquo;I&rdquo;, one big &ldquo;I&rdquo; and that big &ldquo;I&rdquo; is Parama&#x301;tman. He is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; of all &ldquo;I&rdquo;s. You love your small &ldquo;I&rdquo; very much, and unknowingly you love that Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; more than you do yourself. Clear? You have nourished an unknown love for Parama&#x301;tman and a known love for the small &ldquo;I&rdquo;s. That love for Parama&#x301;tman is unknown. And when one gets diiks&#x301;a&#x301; [initiation] and does sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, that unknown love becomes known.<!-- /block --></p>

You do so many things, and you think that you have done them. &ldquo;I have donated so much. I have done this. I have done that.&rdquo; You say this. But wherefrom doth that energy come? It is not your individual energy. If you are not given food or water for a few days, what will happen? You will not have any energy. You cannot create any energy. Through food, physical energy is transmuted into your individual vital energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->You do something with the help of your intellect. But wherefrom doth the intellect come? From Him. He is the perennial source of all energies &ndash; physical or intellectual or spiritual. You are not the owner of any energy or any force or any other mundane or supramundane object. You are simply to serve with His energy, with His intellect, with His spirit.<!-- /block --></p>

You must not forget this fact, that you are simply a machine. You are not the machine-man. You should not have this sort of vanity. You should not say that you are the machine-man, that you have done this or you have done that. You should think that He has done His work, and He used this physical structure as His machine, as His medium. &ldquo;I am fortunate because He used my structure as His machine. He used my structure as His medium.&rdquo; So He is the karma&#x301;dhyaks&#x301;a. He is the adhyaks&#x301;a of karma.<!-- /block --></p>
