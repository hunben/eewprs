<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In society men are in an advantageous position. Due to economic dependence on men, a section of forsaken women is forced to take to the profession of prostitution. When women will enjoy economic independence and equal status in society this practice will cease to exist. Society will have to offer an honourable position to those women who will give up this nasty business and rectify their character. Prostitution is caused by socio-economic factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The dowry system is based on two factors: the economic predominance of either side in the society, and the disproportionate number of females or males in society. In Burma women were economically independent, so men had to pay a dowry at their wedding. In the Punjab the number of men was more than the number of women, hence there was no problem of the dowry system and widow marriage. This social injustice can be removed by allowing the economic independence to women and by encouraging inter-caste and international marriages. Such a movement is urgently required at present.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It has become a fashion today to cry for peace. But the preachers of peace propagate the gospel of peace and keep their powder dry. Will their vocal mission be successful? No, never. Peace is a relative term. It is the result of fight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When the static force becomes predominant there will be peace, which is termed tamogun&#x301;ii sha&#x301;nti [static peace]. When the sentient force dominates there will also be peace, which is called sa&#x301;ttvikii sha&#x301;nti [sentient peace]. This fight between the static and sentient forces will continue as long as the universe exists. There cannot be any absolute peace in the realm of relativity. Absolute peace may shower down in an individual&#146;s life, but not on the collective body. When individual animation is suspended in Cosmic animation, or when individual aspiration is suspended in Cosmic aspiration, the result is absolute peace. Absolute peace in the collective body means the suspension of the universe, which is an impossibility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Hence, to cry for peace [avoiding fight] is hypocrisy. The craze for peace may be accepted as a diplomatic policy, but it cannot be accepted as a principle. Fight is the essence of life, and peace can be restored only after fight.<!-- /block --></p>
