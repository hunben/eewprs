<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In those days of matrilineal order, people introduced the system of mother worship, and from that emerged the custom of can&#x301;d&#x301;ii pu&#x301;ja&#x301;, the worship of can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301; shakti, the power of the group-mother. In those days the leader of a clan would invariably be a woman, a clan-mother.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ya&#x301; devii sarvabhu&#x301;tes&#x301;u Matrru&#x301;pen&#x301;a sam&#x301;sthita&#x301;<br>Namastasyae namastasyae namastasyae namo namah.<br>Ya&#x301; devii sarvabhu&#x301;tes&#x301;u Shaktiru&#x301;pen&#x301;a sam&#x301;sthita&#x301;<br>Namastasyae namastasyae namastasyae namo namah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[I offer my deepest salutations to that goddess who is in all created beings in the form of the Universal Mother. I offer my deepest salutations to the goddess who is immanent in all created beings in the form of the Supreme Force.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Thus the people, being inspired by this idea, developed the system of mother worship in early stages of the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult, in the last phase of Post-Shiva Tantra. Alongside this developed the custom of kuma&#x301;rii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [virgin worship], just to please the future clan-mothers. So the custom of can&#x301;d&#x301;ii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; gave rise to the custom of virgin worship. One who is a maiden today will be a clan-mother in due course; so it was wise to please these clan-mothers-to-be by offering them something.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Thus we see that can&#x301;d&#x301;ii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; or kuma&#x301;rii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; was essentially a social affair, but in Post-Shiva Tantra and in the first phase of the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult, a religious tinge was added to it. This is how the worship of virgins originated. Now this system has almost disappeared.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The situation changed a great deal in subsequent periods. The matrilineal order was stopped, and the supremacy of gotrama&#x301;ta&#x301; came to an  end. Then came the age of the patriarchal system, and along with it the leadership of the clan vested in the gotrapita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The same tradition perpetuated itself even in the patriarchal system; that is, the head of the clan had to be kept in good humour with gifts and offerings. He enjoyed unlimited power, as the clan-mother did in the heyday of the matrilineal order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301; shakti is the can&#x301;d&#x301;a shakti, the great power exercised by the clan-mother. This can&#x301;d&#x301;ii shakti or can&#x301;d&#x301;a shakti reached its climax during the days of Post-Shiva Tantra and the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult. We shall say more about Puranic Sha&#x301;kta later. So you understand how the concept of can&#x301;d&#x301;ii originated.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Gan&#x301;es&#x301;a was the group-leader of prehistoric days. Some time after Post-Shiva Tantra, in the Puranic Age, a special cult, the Gan&#x301;apati Cult, arose centring around Gan&#x301;apati. You should remember that some five cults arose following the Puranic doctrine that had its origin some 1300 or 1400 years back: Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya&#x301;cara and Saora&#x301;ca&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Let us throw some light on Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Shiva Cult]. The main goal of human beings is Shivasama&#x301;dhi [final enlightenment]. Human beings should direct all their outer expressions of life towards the inner world, and finally merge in Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. This is the sum and substance of the Shiva Cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Yacched va&#x301;unmanasi pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;astad<br>Yacched jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani;<br>Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati niyacched<br>Tad yaccheccha&#x301;nta&#x301;tmani.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->This sha&#x301;nta&#x301;tma&#x301; [referred to in tad yaccheccha&#x301;nta&#x301;tmani of the shloka] means Shiva&#x301;tma&#x301; [Supreme Entity]; one who merges in the Supreme Entity attains Shivasama&#x301;dhi, which is the goal of every spiritual aspirant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Next is Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Shakti Cult]. According to Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, the static principle contained in ta&#x301;masikii shakti has to be merged in Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, or Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti (the acoustic root for Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti is sam&#x301;). And then the mutative principle has to be withdrawn from Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti and merged in Bhaeravii Shakti (the acoustic root of Bhaeravii Shakti is sham&#x301;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Bhaeravii Shakti means energy in action. All people want to come into contact with the mutative force. The acoustic root of energy is ram&#x301; and that for the mutative principle is sham&#x301;. People want energy supported by the mutative force so that they might enjoy name and fame. So they crave for sha + ra = shra (in the feminine gender, shrii, beauty.) Thus there was a custom in olden days for people to prefix their names with the word shrii. The old custom has fallen into some disuse: shrii is used less nowadays. But I hope that these days people will not become vishrii [ugly]!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Then the sentient forces [or principles] have to be withdrawn from Bhaeravii Shakti, and merged in Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti, or Maha&#x301;sarasvatii, the spiritual effulgence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->These are the successive phases of the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult. This cult begins with Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti, but Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; is not Ka&#x301;lii, the wife of Shiva, nor the Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti of Buddhist Tantra or Post-Shiva Tantra, nor Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; the Puranic goddess. Rather, this Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; is a philosophical term, the inner spirit of a system of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Next is Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u Cult].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Vista&#x301;rah sarvabhu&#x301;tasya Vis&#x301;n&#x301;orvishvamidam&#x301; jagat;<br>Dras&#x301;t&#x301;avyama&#x301;tmavattasma&#x301;dabhedena vicaks&#x301;an&#x301;aeh.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u pervades each and every thing of this universe, and because He is all-pervading, He is called &ldquo;Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u&rdquo;. And the inner spirit of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava&#x301;ca&#x301;ra is to realize this all-pervading Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Vis&#x301;n&#x301;uparistitah Vis&#x301;n&#x301;uh Vis&#x301;n&#x301;uh kha&#x301;dati Vis&#x301;n&#x301;ave;<br>Katham&#x301; hasasi re Vis&#x301;n&#x301;uh sarvam&#x301; Vis&#x301;n&#x301;umayam&#x301; jagat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->A devout Vaishnavite is seeing Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u in everything. Then he sits down to eat rice from a plate. He has a dog on his lap who partakes of food from the same plate. Another scholar who happens to discover that the Vaishnavite gentleman and his dog are eating from the same plate bursts into laughter. He asks how a devout Vaishnavite can eat food from the same plate as a dog. The Vaishnavite replies, &ldquo;Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u in the form of a dog is sitting on the lap of a man, another manifestation of the same Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u. Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u the man and Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u the dog are eating rice, another manifestation of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u. And why are you, another manifestation of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, laughing? Everything in this universe is Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u.&rdquo; This is the Puranic Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u Cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The fourth is Ga&#x301;na&#x301;patya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Gan&#x301;es&#x301;a or Gan&#x301;apati Cult]. When the ancient custom of group leadership &ndash; gan&#x301;a-pativa&#x301;da, vina&#x301;yakava&#x301;da or gan&#x301;es&#x301;ava&#x301;da &ndash; became converted into a cult during the Puranic Age, the idea was adopted that the group-leader was the leader of the universe. &ldquo;The Supreme Entity is the leader of our group. We will try to satisfy Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; With this sort of outlook, the Ga&#x301;na&#x301;patya Cult evolved during the Puranic Age. They are worshippers of gan&#x301;apati, the group-leader. This is the Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Last is the Saora [Sun] Cult. This cult was propagated by the Brahmans who came from Sha&#x301;kadviipa. Sha&#x301;kadviipa was the southern part of Russia, with its capital at Tashkent. The original Greek name of this area was Sacdonia. These Brahmans who migrated to India from Sacdonia did not recognize the Vedas or anything else; they were astrologers and teachers of a&#x301;yurveda. Since they cultivated the science of astrology and astronomy, they used to worship the sun-god, Su&#x301;rya. The word saora is derived from su&#x301;rya plus the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;a, giving the sense of &ldquo;offspring&rdquo;; saora means &ldquo;one who is the worshipper of the sun-god&rdquo;. When it developed into a full-fledged cult, the idea behind it was that the sun-god, who was the creator of this world, was also the creator of the solar system; that is, all the planets &ndash; earth, Mars, Mercury, etc. &ndash; have come from the sun. The sun is their father. Similarly, the father of this universe is the sun-like Parama Purus&#x301;a; so the sun is worshipped as the Supreme Progenitor of this universe. This is the inner essence of the Su&#x301;rya Cult, which was spread by the Sacdonian Brahmans. But it was not well accepted anywhere in India; it was only accepted to a moderate extent in some places.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->These were the five main cults of the Puranic Age. None of them became widely established. Some enjoyed a limited popularity, while some barely existed at all. Some have a philosophical basis, while others do not.<!-- /block --></p>
