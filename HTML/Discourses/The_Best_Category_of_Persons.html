<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The niica category of people are those who do not undertake any work. They think that they are ordinary people and cannot do any work. They are always scared of the probable obstacles they might encounter in their work. They do not undertake any work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The madhyama category of people are those who undertake some work but throw up their hands when any problem crops up. They presume that any obstacle that comes in their way is a Himalayan obstacle, and hence they give up their work. They think they will not be able to tackle the problems they face. They are not confident of their abilities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The uttama category of people are those who take up a task and are determined to fulfil it. They go on struggling against all odds till they achieve their goal. No problem can defy solution. No difficulty can be greater than their capacity to solve it. They go on fighting against all obstacles. They can face any challenge and meet any predicament. They are determined to achieve their objective, come what may.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->I want you to be persons of the uttama category. You must always think of the goal. Always look to your ideal. By spiritual ideation you can get inspiration to adhere to your principles.<!-- /block --></p>
