<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Where there is<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> no vibration, no pulsation, it is not life. And that&#146;s why everything in this universe of ours is moving. Nothing is fixed, nothing is stationary; everthing will have to move. And why will everything have to move? Because whatever we see, and whatever we think, and whatever comes within the scope of our inferences, are moving within the Cosmic Mind, are moving within the mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He thinks and we perceive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->All inferences are emanated from the Cosmic Mind, from the mind of the Supreme Father. You are dancing, you will be dancing; but these dances you are dancing within the mind of your Supreme Father. You are dancing within the mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a. You are dancing in His mind; your dances are creating a special type of vibration within His mind; it gives Him pleasure. You are doing good work; your good work creates a special type of  vibration in His mind; it gives Him pleasure. Whatever good thing you do, it gives Him pleasure. Whatever good thoughts you encourage or you relish, give Him pleasure. That is, whatever good you do, you do to please Him, to satisfy Him. And if by your action He is satisfied, that satisfaction of His satisfies you also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now here everything moves. Nobody can remain stationary; even the polestar is not stationary. Our sun is not stationary; it moves in the Cosmos along with this planetary world. There are so many stars, so many suns &ndash; stars like suns &ndash; so many nebula; they are all moving. Nobody is immobile, nobody is fixed. Your body moves, your sentiments, your instincts connected with your body, move. Your mind moves. Everything moves. This movement of yours is different from the movement of other animals, other created beings, because the speciality of human beings is that they get pleasure in subtler movements. And these subtle movements, or subtler movements, are special wonts of human beings. You get less pleasure from a crude object than from a subtle object. You get more pleasure in a subtle object. Crude dance cannot give you as much pleasure as classical dance can. Because human movement, human tendencies, are towards the subtle, the subtler and the subtlest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Each and every living being is guided by certain instincts. Plants have instincts, animals also have instincts, but human instincts are fewer in number than human psychic propensities. That is, in the case of humans, propensities are stronger than instincts; and here lies the fundamental difference between an animal and a man.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In quest of subtler objects, man felt, man realized, that the subtlest of this universe from which all waves, all expressions, emanate, is my Supreme Goal. And that Supreme Goal, that subtlest object, that perennial source of all inferences, is my goal, is my Parama Purus&#x301;a, is my Supreme Father. So a spiritual aspirant must always remember that his goal is not something physical or something psychic. His only goal is the hub of this universe, is the nucleus of this Cosmological order, is that Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->All human aspirations culminate at that very point. All human desires and longings coincide there at that particular desideratum. You boys and you girls, you are all spiritual aspirants. You are all developed human beings. You should remember this cardinal truth.<!-- /block --></p>
