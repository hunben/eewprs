<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->To attain Parama Purus&#x301;a, to become one with the Supreme Reality, He must be made the summum bonum of human life. But the attainment of the Supreme Reality is not possible overnight. For that the sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual practitioner] will have to undergo the systematic and methodical process of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for a long period, till every nerve-cell, nerve-fibre, every bit of his physical existence is divinized. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, after all, is a scientific process by which the entire psycho-physical existence is divinized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Those who are fortunate enough to have good spiritual sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta] due to their past karma can easily have a balanced mind that will slowly and steadily take them to their goal. But in most cases it does not happen like that. Citta na&#x301;dii ubhayatah prava&#x301;hinii &ndash; &ldquo;The mind can have both spirit and matter as its object.&rdquo; But it is difficult to make spirit the object because spiritual ideation is not possible through inferential vibrations (ta&#x301;nma&#x301;trik spandana). The senses do not help a person in spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. On the contrary, the sense organs are always ready to help the mind to flow extroversially. Material objects, through their tanma&#x301;tras (shabda, sparsha, ru&#x301;pa, rasa, gandha),<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> always attract the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Psycho-physical parallelism is very easy, while psycho-spiritual parallelism requires repeated mental efforts. That is why wise sa&#x301;dhakas superimpose Brahmabha&#x301;va on physical objects and mental thoughts. At once they cease to be physical or mental, they become spiritual. After all, each and every object &ndash; physical or psychic &ndash; is nothing but an expression of Brahma. As a result, one will not have to reap the consequences of one&#146;s actions. This is the only way by which one can prevent one&#146;s mind from being crudified due to constant psycho-physical parallelism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ordinarily, people who are not on sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; ma&#x301;rga [the spiritual path] look upon physical things as mere things. While they eat food, drink water, read books, talk to friends or perform any action, they get into bondages due to work. Their minds become assailed by karma bandhana. They won&#146;t attain salvation till their sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are finally exhausted. Hence to get rid of this karma bandhana [bondage of action and reaction], one must take Brahmabha&#x301;va [ideation on the Supreme].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Over a thousand years ago, there was a wise and devout Buddhist bhikku in Bengal, popularly known as Bhusuku. He was a good poet, a humourist, and a sa&#x301;dhaka of excellent category.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When the mind rises above body-consciousness and takes constant spiritual ideation, one enjoys the parama rasa [supreme taste]; one who, on the other hand, thinks of gross material objects gets the vis&#x301;aya rasa [taste of objects]. The latter is only preferred till one experiences the former; once parama rasa is tasted, the other becomes tasteless. On this point Bhusuku humorously remarked: A&#x301;j ba&#x301;un&#x32D;a&#x301;lii haili [&ldquo;I became a ba&#x301;un&#x32D;a&#x301;lii today&rdquo; (Ba&#x301;un&#x32D;a&#x301;lii can mean Bengalee)]. Here ba&#x301;un&#x32D;a&#x301;lii means one who has risen above body-consciousness; the vaun&#x32D;ga, this state, he attained as he took Cosmic ideation constantly.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When one sleeps on a cot, one&#146;s body comes in contact with the cot. When eating, one&#146;s hand and mouth come in touch with rice, vegetables, etc. When thinking, the mind comes in touch with thought. Everything crude or subtle is His manifestation. In the process of taking constant Cosmic ideation, the sa&#x301;dhaka experiences great bliss within &ndash; this is called dharmamegha&#x301;nanda.<!-- /block --></p>

The sa&#x301;dhaka lay down and Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; touched his lower four cakras with a stick. Then he asked the sa&#x301;dhaka:] Do you feel the presence of somebody, the touch of somebody? [The sa&#x301;dhaka replied yes. Then the sa&#x301;dhaka sat up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; again asked the sa&#x301;dhaka whether he was feeling His presence, His touch, His affection or not?
