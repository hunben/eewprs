<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Is Shiva a philosophy or a personality or a deity? We must first say a little about Shivatattva [the inner meaning of Shiva], devata&#x301;tattva and daevii shakti, and then analyse Shiva and the other gods and goddesses who are claimed to be related to Him. There are deep-seated questions in human minds about this, but all the questions remain unanswered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Shiva was a great personality. At the same time, His entire life we may say, His very way of life is a philosophy. And when one&#146;s personality becomes fully identified with one&#146;s philosophy of life, one becomes a god.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Dyotate krid&#x301;ate yasma&#x301;t udyate dyotate divi;<br>Tasma&#x301;t deva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[The vibrational manifestations emanating from the Supreme Nucleus are known as devata&#x301;s, and these devata&#x301;s address that Supreme Nucleus as Deva. He with His powers vibrates the entire universe, makes the entire universe dance; and He by dint of His occult and supra-occult powers brings everything back onto His lap.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The endless expressions of life emanating from the Universal Nucleus which move all-pervasively in and through everything of the universe and influence all entities are called devata&#x301;s [deities, gods and goddesses]. Shiva&#146;s ideology is totally identified with His life, with His way of life. Hence, Shiva is definitely a devata&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now while we are discussing devata&#x301;tattva [the inner meaning of a devata&#x301;] we must add something more. Normally, each and every expression that emanates from the Supreme Hub, the Cosmic Nucleus, is a devata&#x301;. In that sense, Shiva is not merely one such devata&#x301;; He is the aggregate of these devata&#x301;s. Shiva is no doubt a god, but the word &ldquo;god&rdquo; does not encompass the totality of His personality. He is not only a god, He is the God of gods  Devata&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; devata&#x301;, devana&#x301;m&#x301; devah ityarthe Maha&#x301;devah [&ldquo;The God of all gods and goddesses is Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo;]. Shiva is Maha&#x301;deva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now it is necessary to discuss those entities who were involved with Shiva, such as Pa&#x301;rvatii, Ka&#x301;lii, Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;, Sarasvatii, Laks&#x301;mii, etc.; and all the other gods and goddesses of Shiva Tantra, Buddhist Tantra, Jain Tantra, Post-Shiva Tantra and the Puranic religion. First we shall find out how much Shiva was related to them from the philosophical, social and personal points of view  or whether there was any relation between Him and them at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In this context, the topic of daevii shakti must be discussed. When some wave of expression emanates from the Universal Hub and moves in the process of systalsis, two main forces are active, Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;tattva [the Cognitive Force] and Shaktitattva [the Operative Force]. The former is called Citishakti, and the latter is called Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti. It is called Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti because the Operative Force maintains Her creation through ka&#x301;lacakra, the eternal time factor. (This has nothing to do with the deity Ka&#x301;lii.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, to discuss Shivatattva, devata&#x301;tattva and daevii shakti, we must review briefly a long period of history stretching over seven thousand years. In the field of applied Tantra that was popular during Shiva&#146;s lifetime, there were different forces, no doubt, but they were not deified into gods and goddesses. So to say something about gods and goddesses, we must go back still further. In the Vedic Age there were gods and goddesses, but there was no system of idol worship. People used to worship those gods and goddesses through sacrificial rituals. Indra, A&#x301;gni, Varun&#x301;a, etc., were all Vedic gods, but they were not worshipped with idols. Nor was there any system of worshipping Parama Brahma [the Supreme Entity] with idols. It was said that Iishvarasya pratima&#x301; na&#x301;sti [&ldquo;There cannot be any finite pratima&#x301;, image, of God&rdquo;]. Pratima&#x301; means &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo;, something identical to the original. Suppose there is an eggplant. If we create an object exactly like the original eggplant, we say that the second eggplant is the pratima&#x301; of the original eggplant. But as there is no other entity like Parama Purus&#x301;a, Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot have a pratima&#x301;. Tula&#x301; va&#x301; upama&#x301; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;as-ya na&#x301;sti [&ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a has no parallel or equal&rdquo;]. These were the ideas of the Vedic Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Next came the age of Shiva Tantra. In those days, many ka&#x301;lashaktis [deities] were accepted, but there was no system of idol worship. Then followed the age of Shivottara [Post-Shiva] Tantra, during the periods of Buddhism and Jainism. During this period, various systems of worshipping different gods and goddesses were introduced. In the subsequent period, that is, the period of the metamorphosed Post-Shiva Tantra (metamorphosed because it was Shiva Tantra but largely influenced by Buddhism and Jainism), image-worship became quite popular.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now in the course of time, when Post-Shiva Tantra evolved, Shiva was still a devata&#x301;, but the Buddhist and Jain Tantra of that time exerted some influence on His image, and, by adding some new elements to the existing image of Shiva, tried to create a new entity. Sometimes, in the Puranic Age, Shiva was invested with a sacrificial thread, but in reality Shiva never had any thread on His body; if He had any, it was a thread of snakes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Later, many gods and goddesses were brought to the scene and linked with Shiva,  because  until an  entity&#146;s  relation to Him was established in one way or other, that entity would not get any recognition at all. Take for instance the goddess Manasa&#x301;. Sometimes she is said to be the daughter of Shiva, but in reality, there was no goddess named Manasa&#x301; or Vis&#x301;ahari at the time of Shiva. In the Puranic Age, it was declared,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;stikasya munerma&#x301;ta&#x301; Va&#x301;sukiibhaginii tatha&#x301;;<br>Jaratka&#x301;rumuner patnii manasa&#x301;yae namo namah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Manasa&#x301; was said to be the mother of A&#x301;stika Muni and the sister of Va&#x301;sukiina&#x301;ga and the wife of Jara&#x301;tka&#x301;ru Muni. We will not raise any objection to the statement that she was the mother of A&#x301;stika Muni, but we cannot accept that she was the sister of Va&#x301;sukiina&#x301;ga. There is a story in one Purana that she was the sister of Va&#x301;sukiina&#x301;ga,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> but according to another Purana, Kadru was the mother of serpents and Mahars&#x301;i Ka&#x301;shyapa was their father. In that case the father of Manasa&#x301; is Ka&#x301;shyapa. Then how can she be the daughter of Shiva? So the Puranas are mutually contradictory. In fact, Manasa&#x301; has no relation to Shiva; Manasa&#x301; is only a laokik<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  goddess and was recognized as such in Buddhist Tantra and the Puranic religion. Shiva, however, was a great personality about seven thousand years ago, whose existence does not depend upon the tales of the Puranas. The Puranas were composed about 5500 years after Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->After Manasa&#x301;, let us take the case of Pa&#x301;rvatii. What is the meaning of the word Pa&#x301;rvatii? Some may derive it as Pa&#x301;rvatasya duhita&#x301;, pa&#x301;rvatasya kanya&#x301; (using s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii tatpurus&#x301;a<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> ) that is,  &ldquo;daughter of a hill&rdquo;.  Obviously the question will arise, and quite logically, how can a human girl whose body is made of five fundamental factors be the daughter of a hill? A river may be called the daughter of a hill, but in the case of a human girl we cannot say that. So the derivation of Pa&#x301;rvatii as pa&#x301;rvatasya kanya&#x301; is not logically acceptable; rather, the proper derivation is Pa&#x301;rvatadeshiiya&#x301; kanya&#x301; ityarthe Pa&#x301;rvatii (using madhyapadalopii karmadha&#x301;ray<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->): &ldquo;a girl born in a hill state&rdquo;. So when people say that Pa&#x301;rvatii was the daughter of the Himalayas, it does not mean that she was the daughter of a person named Hima&#x301;laya, but that she was a person born in the Himalayan Range. This Pa&#x301;rvatii was fair-complexioned; that is, she was an Aryan girl.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->In the then India, the mutual relations between the original inhabitants of India (Austrico-Mongolo-Negroids) and the outsiders, the Aryans, were by no means cordial. The Aryans, out of deep-rooted contempt for the indigenous people of India, used to call them sometime asuras, sometimes da&#x301;navas, sometimes da&#x301;sas, sometimes shu&#x301;dras.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  The Aryans did not accept these people in their society; rather, they declared them to be outcastes. But these ancient people of India, of Austrico-Mongolo-Negroid blood, had their own civilization and culture. They were also developed people: they had their science of Tantra, and their medicine. There was  a  prolonged  conflict  between  these  people  and  the Aryans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii was the daughter of an Aryan King, Daks&#x301;a, who ruled in the Himalayan regions. Many people were hopeful that after the marriage between Pa&#x301;rvatii and Shiva, the relations between the Aryans and the non-Aryans would improve. During the period of the vow of penance that Gaorii (another name for Pa&#x301;rvatii) undertook in order to attain Shiva as her husband, she used to dress in the fashion of a Shavara girl (the Shavaras were one of the non-Aryan communities). She used to stitch turmeric leaves together to make improvised outer garments. One of the Sanskrit words for &ldquo;turmeric leaves&rdquo; is parn&#x301;a. As she would wear par&#x301;n&#x301;a as her clothes, she was called &ldquo;Par&#x301;n&#x301;ashavarii&rdquo;. Later, after she became successful in her penance, people requested her, &ldquo;Now please set aside the turmeric leaves and wear fine clothes.&rdquo; When she actually discarded the crude turmeric leaves, she was nicknamed &ldquo;Aparn&#x301;a&#x301;&rdquo;. Unfortunately, even after the marriage between Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii, the relations between the Aryans and the non-Aryans did not improve; rather they became more strained  the conflicts became more acute than before. Gaorii&#146;s father, Daks&#x301;a, and the Aryans continued their slanderous campaign against Shiva, and finally, to humiliate Shiva, they held a yajin&#x32D;a [sacrificial ceremony] to which Shiva was not invited. Pa&#x301;rvatii went to attend the yajin&#x32D;a, and unable to bear the insults to her dear husband, immolated herself in the sacrificial fire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;a&#x301;nta hao go pita&#x301; Shivaninda&#x301; a&#x301;r sahe na&#x301;;<br>Kuver ya&#x301;r bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;rii, Brahma&#x301; Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u dva&#x301;rer dva&#x301;rii<br>A&#x301;mi ta&#x301;n&#x32D;ri a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;ka&#x301;rii jeneo ki ta&#x301; ja&#x301;na na&#x301;!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;&lsquo;I am a follower of Sada&#x301;shiva, the brilliance of whose divine presence outshines even the dazzling brilliance of the jewels of Kuvera&#146;s<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> treasury; whose unmatched dexterity in creation excels even that of the creator Brahma&#x301; himself; whose unequalled love surpasses even that of the dissolver Maheshvara himself; in whose loving shelter not only humans, but also animals and plants, feel absolutely secure. You certainly know this. I cannot bear this insult to Shiva any longer. Stop, Father, stop!&rsquo;&rdquo; After that self-immolation the relations between the Aryans and the non-Aryans improved.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->This Gaorii or Pa&#x301;rvatii had no relation whatsoever to the Puranic goddess Durga&#x301; whom people worship nowadays. Gaorii, or Pa&#x301;rvatii, was a human girl, and as such, she had only two arms. The ten-armed goddess Durga&#x301;, who was a deity of the Puranic Age, has nothing to do with Shiva or His age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The worship of the goddess Durga&#x301; is based mainly on the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, and to a lesser extent on the Devii Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Brhatnandikeshavara Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Duraga&#x301;bhaktitaraunginii, the Deviibha&#x301;gavat, etc. None of these books is older than 1300 or 1400 years. Seven hundred shlokas [couplets] were collected from those books and gathered together, and that constituted the abridged Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, which is also known as Durga&#x301;saptashatii, or more colloquially, Shrii Shrii Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii. None of these works existed at the time of Shiva; they have no relation with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->There are some people who believe that Durga&#x301; is the wife of Shiva, but this is not logically proved by any scriptural evidence. Shiva had only two arms, not four or six. Pa&#x301;rvatii also had two arms. But Durga&#x301; is a Puranic goddess, and the author of pura&#x301;n&#x301;a [educative fiction] can create in his imagination as many arms of Durga&#x301; as he likes. Nobody can object to this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->No system for the worship of Durga&#x301; is prescribed by the Vedic scripture; so to put a Vedic seal of approval on the worship of Durga&#x301;, the famous Deviisu&#x301;kta of the Vedas is cited. But Haemavatii Uma&#x301; [Durga&#x301; is sometimes also called &ldquo;Uma&#x301;&rdquo;], who is mentioned in the Deviisu&#x301;kta of the Vedas, has no relation whatsoever to Pa&#x301;rvatii (or Gaorii), the wife of Shiva, nor to Durga&#x301;, the Puranic goddess. People have been thinking erroneously that Durga&#x301; was the wife of Shiva, but in reality she had no relation to Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Yes, Shiva did have a wife &ndash; Gaorii, or Pa&#x301;rvatii. And another wife was Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;, or Ka&#x301;lii. Ka&#x301;lii was born in a non-Aryan community which was ethnically Austrico-Mongolo-Negroid. Now you may wonder about Ka&#x301;lii&#146;s appearance. Why is she undressed? Why is she sticking her tongue out? There are many tales about these matters, but you must not give any importance to these stories; you must discover the real history behind these things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->One of Shiva&#146;s wives was Gaorii, who had a son, Bhaerava. &ldquo;Bhaerava&rdquo; means &ldquo;one who practises Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;&rdquo;. Another wife of Shiva, Ka&#x301;lii, had a daughter, Bhaeravii. &ldquo;Bhaeravii&rdquo; means &ldquo;a woman who practises Tantra sa&#x301;-dhana&#x301;&rdquo;. Bhaeravii learned the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; from her father and practised it regularly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->But Bhaeravii&#146;s mother, Ka&#x301;lii, always feared that her daughter might encounter some trouble while out doing Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, so one night she went in search of her daughter. At that time Shiva was deeply absorbed in meditation in the cremation ground.  Ka&#x301;lii, while  walking along the path, trip- ped over Shiva. She felt extremely contrite and stuck her tongue out.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Shiva was roused from His meditation, and asked, Kastvam&#x301;?  &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Now, Ka&#x301;lii was deeply embarrassed, but being Shiva&#146;s wife, how could she conceal her identity by introducing herself as Bhaeravii? A woman cannot identify herself to her husband by the name of her daughter. So she identified herself by saying, Kaoverii asmyaham  &ldquo;I am Kaoverii.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn9"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn9">9</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Since then, Ka&#x301;lii has had another name  Kaoverii. The Sanskrit word is &ldquo;Kaoverii&rdquo;, but sometimes people wrongly spell the word in Bengali as &ldquo;Ka&#x301;verii&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Later Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti, also called Ka&#x301;lii, was accepted in Post-Shiva Tantra and also in Buddhist Tantra as a Tantric goddess. Still later, in the Puranic Age, this Ka&#x301;lii was worshipped as a goddess, and at that time she got a second name, Shya&#x301;ma&#x301;. But this Ka&#x301;lii, or Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti, has no relation to Ka&#x301;lii the wife of Shiva. Ka&#x301;lii the wife of Shiva existed seven thousand years ago; but Ka&#x301;lii the deity accepted in Post-Shiva Tantra and Buddhist Tantra goes back only 1600 or 1700 years. The worship of Ka&#x301;lii the deity is preached chiefly on the basis of the Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, so it has nothing to do with the Vedic Age nor the age of Shiva. But one thing should be remembered, that although she is a deity of Post-Shiva Tantra, she was accepted and worshipped in Buddhist Tantra also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->And in the same way,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;lii the deity has four arms. But Ka&#x301;lii the wife of Shiva had two arms, not four. So Ka&#x301;lii the goddess who is worshipped these days according to the Puranic system is not the one who was Shiva&#146;s wife.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Not only that, there is also a difference in meaning between ka&#x301;lii and shya&#x301;ma&#x301;. First, it is a fact that Ka&#x301;lii or Shya&#x301;ma&#x301;, who is worshipped as a goddess nowadays, has no relation to Shiva. Then, regarding her colour, in one part of the shloka she is described as meghavarn&#x301;a, that is, grey-black [&ldquo;having the colour of a cloud&rdquo;] (Ka&#x301;lii the wife of Shiva was a non-Aryan girl, so she may have been that colour); then again she is described in the same shloka as shya&#x301;ma&#x301;. The word shya&#x301;ma&#x301; in Sanskrit has two meanings. One meaning is &ldquo;green&rdquo;. Ka&#x301;lii, who is grey-black, cannot be shya&#x301;ma&#x301; in this sense; there would be an inconsistency in meaning, a contradiction in the shloka itself. The second meaning is,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->No goddess having eight or ten arms can be the wife of Shiva: He had only two arms. Similarly the Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti having four arms cannot be the wife of Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Shiva had a third wife &ndash; Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. She was a Mongolian girl with a yellow complexion, born in Tibet. I said a little while ago that Gaorii had a son, Bhaerava, and Ka&#x301;lii had a daughter, Bhaeravii. Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; had a son  Ka&#x301;rttikeya, or Ka&#x301;rttika, or Sanmukham, or S&#x301;ad&#x301;a&#x301;nana. (In Tamil San&#x301;-mugam, Ba&#x301;lasubrahman&#x301;yam or Muru&#x301;gam).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Bhaerava, the son of Pa&#x301;rvatii, was an ardent spiritualist, a Tantric sa&#x301;dhaka. Bhaeravii, the daughter of Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;, was also an ardent spiritualist and a sincere practitioner of Tantra; but Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&#146;s son, Ka&#x301;rttika, was of a different mould. Because of this Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; was very sad at heart; she was very unhappy with her only son. To remove Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&#146;s mental unhappiness, Shiva used to treat her with the utmost courtesy. People would complain that Shiva was not so soft and courteous in His dealings with Pa&#x301;rvatii and Ka&#x301;lii as He was with Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. He was pampering Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; too much &ndash; as if Shiva was dancing in joy, with Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; seated on His head.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->On the basis of this saying, Shiva was depicted in the Puranic Age with Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; tied to His matted locks of hair. Then a story was concocted in some Purana that the water discarded after washing the feet of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, flowed down from heaven, and Shiva supported the flow on His head; then this flow became the River Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; [Ganges]. That is, Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; the wife of Shiva became the River Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. Actually this River Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; has no relation whatsoever to Shiva. The story continues that from Shiva&#146;s head the river flowed in four directions &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->These are mere tales of the Puranas. The River Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; has no relation to Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; who was the wife of Shiva. &ldquo;Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&rdquo; the river is derived from gam plus gam plus d&#x301;a plus t&#x301;a&#x301; (to show feminine gender). Ga means a vast tract of land; ga&#x301; means a woman who is moving; so a woman who is coming from a distant land and going towards another distant land  a woman who is flowing from Gaun&#x32D;gottarii, the starting-point of the River Ganges, to Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sa&#x301;gar, the mouth of the river  through a 1500-mile stretch of land  is called &ldquo;Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&rdquo;. This River Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; [the Ganges] has no relation to the wife of Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
