<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Although microvita are very, very subtle physical bodies, they are living beings. Research can be done on them in chemical laboratories and medicinal as well as medical laboratories. A subtle technique is to be applied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The initial stage of matter is beyond perception. It falls into the category of the subtle realm of science. Most of the atomic research done until now has been done on the basis of the guessing method, because different stages of the atom, and different constituent parts of the atom, do not come under direct perception &ndash; they come within the arena of human concept. That is why microvita research is to be done first in the mental laboratory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Both atoms and microvita have subtler and cruder portions. The portion which is closer to idea is subtler and the portion which is closer to matter is cruder. For studying the cruder portions of both atoms and microvita physical laboratories are necessary. For studying the subtler aspects of both spiritual practices are necessary. The portion of atoms which have a close proximity to idea &ndash; that is, the subtler portion of atoms &ndash; is understood by spiritual practices. This part cannot be understood in physical laboratories only.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Why are physical laboratories necessary for microvita research? By just sitting and doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you cannot utilize microvita for the good of humanity. You have to engage yourself in physical research. If laboratory tests go on side by side with psycho- spiritual practices, then the research will have tremendous results. The case is similar for atomic research.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There are different kinds of atoms which do not come within the physical arena or even within the realm of physical perception. So research should be in the physical, psychological and spiritual spheres. If you want to utilize a certain state of atom &ndash; that is, the subtler portion &ndash; you will have to do spiritual practices, and if you want to know about the cruder portion you will have to do research. Both these two aspects are fast developing. Research into certain subtler portions of atomic matter cannot be done without spiritual practices, and research into the cruder portion of microvita cannot be done without physical laboratories.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So, in the case of matter, in the initial stage, research is to be done in the psychic, psycho-spiritual and spiritual arenas. If you want to know the different subtler stages of matter, concentrate your mind through japa, dha&#x301;rana&#x301; and dhya&#x301;na. If you want to know and use the cruder portion of microvita, translate this psychic research into action; that is, translate your psychic potentials into action, into physical acts in laboratories.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So I say, these two aspects of matter and human wonts are fast coming nearer. Research on the subtler portion of atoms is concerned with spiritual action, and research on the cruder portion of microvita is concerned with the different physical applications of science.<!-- /block --></p>
