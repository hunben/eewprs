<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I have already discussed the role of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a at some length. So far I have analysed the dual roles of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and showed how they existed side by side and radiated charming sweetness to His ardent devotees. But at the end of our analysis we blissfully discover that the topic pertains to mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [supra-aesthetic stance] &ndash; the supreme stance in human life &ndash; the highest and most blissful cult. The main point here is that someone is attracting, but then the crucial point is: who is that attracting Entity? The question whether it is Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a or Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is utterly irrelevant. It is sufficient to know that an Entity is there which is attracting, powerfully attracting, and that that attracting agent is Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. That is why I prefer to use only the word &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; not &ldquo;Vrajagopa&#x301;la&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->I have already said that nandana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [aesthetic science] proceeds along the systaltic wave movements of trough and crest. The quintessence of aesthetic science is to get joy and give joy. When the wavy movement at a certain stage of its progress is turned into linear movement, that is, the movement becomes straightened, then that is no longer aesthetic science, it becomes converted into supra-aesthetic science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is this supra-aesthetic science? Whenever sound, touch, form, smell or taste comes within the scope of someone&#146;s personal inferences, and if that is anuku&#x301;lavedaniiyam, that is, agreeably pleasant to the mind and nerves, that person will try to attract that thing. If the object is mobile he or she will draw the object, but if it is static he himself will go to the object. One feels attraction for the lofty peaks of the Himalayas. How? Through ru&#x301;pa tanma&#x301;tra. It is impossible to attract the Himalayas, because they are static, not mobile. But human beings are jaun&#x32D;gama [dynamic]. Jaun&#x32D;gama means that which moves, that which is dynamic. That is why humanity reaches out to the Himalayas, to come in contact with the entitative form of the mountains. The point here is this: the Himalayas do not attract people, it is people who want the Himalayas. People want to attract the mountains to themselves, but since this is impossible, they rush to the Himalayas. This is all aesthetic science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Suppose you see something and take a fancy to it. &ldquo;Ah, how fine it is!&rdquo; you will exclaim in joy. Suppose you listen to a nice piece of music and deeply enjoy it. Your friend may be sitting nearby, but you will surely say, &ldquo;Wait a bit, please. Let me listen to the music a little longer.&rdquo; Here you derive a&#x301;nanda [joy] from the music; it is similar when you give joy to others. Suppose there is a singer who is also a little hungry. He or she may decide to go on singing just to give the audience more enjoyment. This is the scope and extent of aesthetic science. But supra-aesthetic science is different from this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Humanity no doubt has some access to this science due to the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, but this science pertains exclusively to Parama Purus&#x301;a, to my beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Here Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a means both Vrajagopa&#x301;la and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. Thus far, there were two different roles of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. I moved and danced with both, but now they are merged into One. Supra-aesthetic science implies drawing the microcosms closer to Himself through inferential and other ectoplasmic attractions, or by attracting others to Himself through His irresistible charms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Supreme Progenitor of this universe. He has been creating, maintaining and destroying this universe through sain&#x32D;cara and pratisain&#x32D;cara. Now during the phase of pratisain&#x32D;cara He attracts everyone and everything towards Himself. This work of attraction may be done in various ways. Some may be drawn up by rope, some may be drawn up by the forces of love. Some can be attracted by sweet words of love and affection, while others can be captivated only by feelings of internal love. My beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a draws jiivas to Himself only by internal thoughts of love. This is pratisain&#x32D;cara. In this process of pratisain&#x32D;cara, the vast multitude of microcosms evolve. How do they evolve? They evolve because Parama Purus&#x301;a loves them, and the force of His intense love draws them towards Himself. If someone says, &ldquo;No, I won&#146;t go.&rdquo; that will not do. He or she shall have to go, there is no other option.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, Parama Purus&#x301;a has been ever attracting all towards Himself. The difference between nandana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is very vast indeed. Parama Purus&#x301;a is always attracting the microcosms. Although some are reluctant to respond to His call of love, even then they will have to come. This is the speciality of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->All the entities of this universe are mutually attracting all other entities. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is attracting all entities by dint of His love for all, by dint of His personal relationship with all. So Parama Purus&#x301;a alone is the presiding Entity of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, and not any other entity. When jiivas feel this attraction in the heart of their hearts, they think it is an excellent idea to draw all human beings to His charming sweetness by their loving hearts, and then guide them along the path of supreme beatitude, the path of all-round perfection, just as Parama Purus&#x301;a attracts all by the radiance of His unbounded love and affection. So those who love the Supreme, those who are genuine devotees of Parama Purus&#x301;a, are bound to love all and attract them to the path of supreme blessedness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Basically Parama Purus&#x301;a is the focal point, the pivotal point, of supra-aesthetic science. Jiivas, no doubt, have the power of attraction, but their attraction is not as irresistible as the supra-aesthetic attraction. Jiivas try to attract but their power of attraction is not all-pervasive. This is the crux of supra-aesthetic science. Parama Purus&#x301;a is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The word krs&#x301;n&#x301;a means one who attracts all, who draws all towards Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Attraction through Tanma&#x301;tras<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The question is, how does He attract the jiivas? The only means of attraction available to the microcosms is the ta&#x301;nma&#x301;trika sources. Microcosms are acquainted with the world through these tanma&#x301;tras. Similarly they come in close contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a through the tanma&#x301;tras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In this connection one thing more has to be said. As far as your relationship with Parama Purus&#x301;a is concerned, that ta&#x301;nma&#x301;trika realization or inferential bondage is not of the physical world, it is of the ectoplasmic world. That attraction is also there in the ectoplasmic body. When we look at the external world we stand and stare and simply marvel at the beautiful manifestations of the Lord. Similarly in our minds we can also enjoy beautiful expressions of the Lord &ndash; that is, the inferential bliss that emanates from Parama Purus&#x301;a. Tanma&#x301;tras emanate from both worlds, but physical tanma&#x301;tras emanate from the physical world, not the psychic world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>Gandha tanma&#x301;tra</b>: How do we receive the very subtle molecular expressions of this phenomenal world, this quinquelemental world, which is otherwise known as gandha tanma&#x301;tra [smell inference]? The smell that emanates from crude objects when they are pulverized is obviously crude. Depending upon the degree of subtlety or crudity, we can distinguish between sweet-scented and foul-smelling things. The subtler the smell, the sweeter it is. And when this sweet smell is there but we fail to locate the physical source of its emanation, that smell is called surabhi [aroma]. The source of its emanation is beyond the range of the sense organs. Whenever a person is deeply absorbed in the thought of Parama Purus&#x301;a, he or she gets this aroma. Obviously, each and every spiritual aspirant is entitled to get this aroma. That is, when the aspirant enjoys this ectoplasmic aroma due to a good deal of mental concentration, he or she gets the same sort of aroma in the external world as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a attracts the aspirant through the emanation of aroma. He does not draw the jiivas by rope, but through the waves of aroma. He binds you and draws you nearer to Himself. Your mind gives up all other objects and rushes headlong towards the Lord. The aspirant deeply enjoys the blissful aroma and exclaims in joy, &ldquo;How sweet, how blissful this aroma is! But where does it come from? I can&#146;t locate its source.&rdquo; This is how the Supreme Lord of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is drawing you to Himself, through the gandha tanma&#x301;tra. You too are running towards Him. You cannot but run that way because you are helpless in this regard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><b>Rasa tanma&#x301;tra</b>: Next is rasa tanma&#x301;tra [taste inference]. On deeper analysis we find that every object of this universe is sweet. Sweetness, not harshness, is the reality. Parama Purus&#x301;a no doubt deals many blows to the microcosms, but that is just to facilitate their progress. Judged from a materialistic perspective, every blow is apparently harsh, but actually it is not harsh, it is soft. He is concerned for your well-being, that is why He resorts to that apparently crude technique. Ultimately, that method, that way, will prove beneficial to you. Rabindranath Tagore wrote in one of his poems: Ei karecha bha&#x301;la nit&#x301;hur he Ei karecha bha&#x301;la [&ldquo;You have rightly served, O cruel Lord. You have rightly served&rdquo;]. This is all for the good of the jiivas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->You should bear in mind that everything of this ectoplasmic world is sweet, nothing is sour, nothing is bitter. Even any bitter expression of the Lord is meant for the good of jiivas and for that reason it is also sweet in the end. Tumi komale kat&#x301;hore madhure tinakte pu&#x301;rn&#x301;a [&ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is full, absolutely full, of softness, as well as harshness; sweetness as well as bitterness&rdquo;]. Hence He attracts jiivas through His characteristic sweetness, through the divine flow of His sweetness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->As already said, one of the many bha&#x301;vas is madhura bha&#x301;va. Madhura bha&#x301;va is a very exalted bha&#x301;va, for this bha&#x301;va fills the mind with sweetness and bliss and leads the aspirant to the closest proximity of the Lord. To a person who is predominantly a devotee of the Lord, everything tastes sweet, there is nothing bitter in the creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He is attracting you through the ectoplasmic world, binding you through the bonds of love. You cannot sever the bonds of love. It is said in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava philosophy:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Pasharite ca&#x301;y man pa&#x301;shara&#x301; na&#x301; ya&#x301;y go,<br>Kii kari go, kii habe upa&#x301;y?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The mind wants to forget Him, but cannot. Now, what is the way out?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Sometimes a person is inclined to think, &ldquo;No, I won&#146;t go to Him &ndash; He will scold me, He will punish me; I won&#146;t go near Him.&rdquo; Even then, he or she has to go. The mind may be reluctant to go, the legs may refuse to go, but even then one will have to move, to reach Him. One cannot remain away from Him. Rather, one has to rush along towards Him, because there is that inseparable bond, the inferential bondage of the Cosmic flow. For He is Mohana [One Who Attracts]. He is Manamohana [One Who Attracts the Mind]. He is Vishvamohana [One Who Attracts the Universe].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><b>Ru&#x301;pa tanma&#x301;tra</b>: Through ru&#x301;pa tanma&#x301;tra [form inference], He is attracting the microcosms. No one believes that something has come out of nothing. Similarly, no one believes that something will someday become nothing; it is unbelievable. Something will remain something, although it will go through the process of metamorphosis. Again, the question of nothing changing its form does not arise at all. So nothing will remain nothing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->This universe of Parama Purus&#x301;a has been moving along the path of pratisain&#x32D;cara. The more it advances on the path of pratisain&#x32D;cara, the sweeter is its expression, because it comes nearer to the nucleus of the Cosmic body. Birds and animals are more beautiful than bricks, stones or wood, and human beings are more sublime than birds and animals. The human mind is full of tenderness, softness, sweetness and other qualities of the divine flow. No other creature is as sublime as human beings, because no heart other than the human heart has such subtle sentimentality. The human heart is sweet because its sentimentality is sweet. And as the human heart is sweet, the human mind is also sweet. However bad a person may be, when he or she remains in his or her permanent composure, he or she remains a sweet and sublime personality. That is why the inner expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a in the human ectoplasmic world is decidedly more sublime than His manifestation in the outer world. For He is drawing human beings, attracting them in their ectoplasmic world. He says, &ldquo;Come along, come to Me. You will have to come.&rdquo; Humanity cannot but respond to His irresistible call.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Ru&#x301;pa la&#x301;gi a&#x301;n&#x32D;khi jhure gun&#x301;e mana bhor;<br>Prati aun&#x32D;ga la&#x301;gi ka&#x301;nde prati aun&#x32D;ga mor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;My eyes are saturated with the joy of beautiful forms. My mind is full of His qualities. Each of my limbs is yearning for access to Him.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><b>Sparsha tanma&#x301;tra</b>: We cannot remain separated from Him. He is attracting through sparsha tanma&#x301;tra [touch inference]. As an Entity, Parama Purus&#x301;a is as sweet as He is soft. People experience His softness in the deepest cavity of their hearts and in the controlling point of human sentimentality. There is no scope for harshness there. When one thinks of another entity, he or she thinks with the softness of the heart, not with harshness. For instance, suppose a little girl does not go to school. Her mother, in displeasure, bursts out, &ldquo;Blast you &ndash; neglecting your studies. You naughty child! If you don&#146;t change your ways, you&#146;ll go to hell.&rdquo; Later on she has second thoughts about her words, she realizes her mistake. She tells herself, &ldquo;It wasn&#146;t proper to chastise my little child that way. Supposing she didn&#146;t go to school, what of it? I wished her death. O God, I beseech You, don&#146;t take her life. They were only words from my mouth, O Lord. I didn&#146;t really mean them.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The subterranean Cosmic flow operating in the human heart is always soft, never harsh, and there my Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and my Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi are one. This is the flow of sparsha tanma&#x301;tra in human beings. This is how Parama Purus&#x301;a is attracting people in the world of touch inferences. He does not allow people to be harsh, He wants them to remain soft. Outwardly, these soft-minded people will have to assume a harsh composure against the wicked. This is the way of the world. By nature you are not hard-hearted. There are people whom we call cruel because of their hard-heartedness. But if those very wicked persons go deeper into their beings, they will no longer remain wicked or hard-hearted. Mostly it is just that they take a superficial view of life. Had they gone deep into their minds, had they tried to realize Parama Purus&#x301;a with their sentimentality, they would certainly have felt the presence of the undercurrents of His softness. The difficulty with them is that they never go deep into their sentimentality and hence they have a tendency towards hard-heartedness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><b>Shabda tanma&#x301;tra</b>: Next comes shabda tanma&#x301;tra. Parama Purus&#x301;a is drawing the microcosms through the sound inference. The very existential feeling of jiivas lies covert in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra [the lowest psycho-spiritual plexus in the human body], and the very urge to speak gradually takes the actual form of expression through successive stages of language formation &ndash; para&#x301;, pashyanti, madhyama&#x301;, dyotama&#x301;na&#x301;, vaekharii and shrutigocara&#x301; &ndash; and finally gives rise to audible language through successive waves. When people enter the core of the world of sounds, they experience their existential feeling, along with the shabda tanma&#x301;tras, through different stages of realization: sa&#x301;lokya, sa&#x301;miipya, sa&#x301;yujya, sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya, sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi and kaevalya.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> That is, as long as the sound inferences are there, sound is very evident to them, and in the subtlest stage of shabda tanma&#x301;tra they get Parama Purus&#x301;a in the form of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. The sa&#x301;dhaka advances on the spiritual path while realizing Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma [&ldquo;Brahma is of the same nature as pran&#x301;ava&rdquo;]. But at the last stage of realization, a sa&#x301;dhaka discovers that there is no sound, because if there is no curvature, there cannot be any sound. When waves get straightened, all sounds stop &ndash; only an all-pervading silence prevails. When sound is transcended, the spiritual aspirant enjoys unbounded spiritual bliss due to perfect psycho-spiritual parallelism. This shabda tanma&#x301;tra leads human beings towards the state of communion between jiiva bha&#x301;va and Shiva bha&#x301;va. That is why Parama Purus&#x301;a has been attracting the microcosms through all the inferential perceptions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Many people come to me and say, &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;, we are sinful persons, what will befall us?&rdquo; Frankly speaking, I don&#146;t feel happy at all when I hear these words. Parama Purus&#x301;a loves saints and sinners alike. He attracts all through madhura bha&#x301;va [sweetness], not kat&#x301;hor  bha&#x301;va [harshness] &ndash; that is, through all kinds of inferential vibrations. So, why should anyone worry about his or her future? This has no proper justification. Parama Purus&#x301;a takes care of all such worries. He is always lovingly calling people very, very close to Himself through the tanma&#x301;tras. This is the central theme of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. That is, human beings are always moving, not in the Vrindavana of the physical world, but in the Vrindavana of the world of bha&#x301;va. When Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was in the Vrindavana of the physical world, there were both the physical Vrindavana and the spiritual Vrindavana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Today, for all His devotees, and even for His non-devotees, there is very much spiritual Vrindavana. And Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is always there, for He said, Vrnda&#x301;vanam&#x301; parityajya pa&#x301;damekam&#x301; na gaccha&#x301;mi [&ldquo;I won&#146;t go anywhere, not even one step, from Vrindavana&rdquo;]. This is not the terrestrial Vrindavana, but the Vrindavana of the devotee&#146;s heart. In this Vrindavana, both the devotee and the Lord are there. They are playing the game of hide and seek &ndash; now He attracts the devotee, now He hides Himself. When the devotee rushes to Him, he or she discovers that the One who was attracting from behind the scenes was actually close at hand; and so he or she attains Him.<!-- /block --></p>

Both are attracting devotees by bonds of love. This is the inner spirit of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. When devotees feel the presence of Parama Purus&#x301;a in the Vrindavana of sentimentality and rush towards Him with all the sweetness of their hearts, then there is no difference between Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, between Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the cowherd boy; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the yogis and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the philosophers, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the naraliila&#x301; [sport of playing a human role] and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the Prabhuliila&#x301; [sport of playing a divine role]. They all merge into one. The liila&#x301;nanda [sportive manifestation] aspect of Parama Purus&#x301;a is suspended into the nitya&#x301;nanda [eternal] aspect of Parama Purus&#146;a. That exalted state of realization &ndash; the highest attainment for a bhakta &ndash;  is also the supreme achievement for a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii [person of knowledge] and also for a karmii [person of action].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The sooner one responds to the call of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the lord of mohanatattva [attracting power], the better. Any delay means wasting one&#146;s valuable time. Hence, it is proper that human beings should rush towards Him only, as time is very short. When devotees come in close proximity to this Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, then all expressions of Parama Purus&#x301;a are suspended into one supreme existence. In that most exalted state of realization, the devotee exclaims in ecstatic joy:<!-- /block --></p>
