<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Such is the Land of Hattamala! What exquisitely beautiful fairy-stories which, at the time of their being told, leave the taste of malpo 2 in the narrator&#146;s mouth, and the taste of puli cake 3 in the mouth of the one listening. Oh, such is the ancient and attractive Land of Hattamala.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There are so many different stories about the Land of Hattamala&#8230; All the young and old people of this country clean their teeth with diamond powder. In former times all the little boys and girls used to continually nag their mothers: &ldquo;We won&#146;t clean our teeth with diamond powder any more; we want to clean them with gold dust!&rdquo; The mother then explained, &ldquo;Look, if rubbed with diamond powder, the teeth will be very strong. You will even be able to chew fried iron peas without any effort. If cultivated green peas are not available at the ration-shop, then iron peas may be brought from the Durgapur 4 iron factory and eaten after frying them a little. And so, you see, there are many advantages to cleaning the teeth with diamond powder. And if you clean your teeth with gold dust, whenever you laugh 5 genuine pearls will pour out of your eyes, ears, noses and mouths in an unending stream. You spend the whole time laughing, and therefore the thousands and thousands of pearls will make the house continually dirty. Would you rather I cook for you or spend my time cleaning the house 700 times a day? It&#146;s up to you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The children accepted this argument. From that day onwards all the young boys and girls have been cleaning their teeth with diamond powder.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Such is the Land of Hattamala. There, shoal upon shoal of trout, their fins out-stretched, move about on land, in water and in air. They are just like the trout found in the Calcutta markets, except that each of them weighs no less than 80 kilos. Another difference is that their scales are made of real silver, and that on some of them light red enamelling work has been done. None of the goldsmiths of Calcutta could possibly do enamelling work of that calibre. That country&#146;s wax-gourds 61 are somewhat similar to the one&#146;s found in Calcutta. The difference is that they are shaped just like the large ornamental boats from East Bengal, 5 and their seeds are large, genuine pearls.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Such is the Land of Hattamala. 6 To compile all the stories about this country is an impossible task, because those who go there in search of stories never return. After seeing the wonderful things of that land, and tasting its delectable eatables, they stay on: the question of returning doesn&#146;t arise in their minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->One day in Calcutta a mynah bird, finding the door of his cage open, slipped out and flew away. He flew up into the open sky. After a while, the idea of going to Hattamala came into his mind. He flew in the direction of the Land of Hattamala and thought, &ldquo;I&#146;ll do my monthly shopping over there.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->While he was busy shopping many interesting stories drifted into his ear and settled there. He immediately copied them down in his note book. A little later the sun set. The mynah bird cannot see anything in the dark, and so, in a do-or-die attempt, he rushed back to Calcutta where he settled on the top branch of a swamp-pea tree at Ballygunge. 7 In the glow of the moon-light he told all these entertaining stories about Hattamala to his assembled maternal and paternal cousins, that is the large Indian parakeets, tailor birds, cockatoos and bulbul birds, and also to a number of men standing hidden in the background who also managed to lend an ear.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Hattamala is such a fascinating land, you know. At that time gold was incredibly cheap in Hattamala. All the houses were made of gold and nothing else. The animals and birds had an audience with the King to submit their petition: &ldquo;Kindly speak with the Council of Ministers and get the order passed that we may convert our bodies into gold.&rdquo; The Honourable King said, &ldquo;That&#146;s not very much to ask. I&#146;ll get it done right away.&rdquo; From that day onwards, the birds&#146; bodies have been golden. The only additional work which had to be done was some red enamelling on the parrots&#146; golden beaks.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What a large palace! And yet inhabited by so few people. At that time Prince Abhijit 8 was only seven years old, and Princess Madhumita,9 five.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->On that day the dawn was bathed in scintillating light. Clouds started building up in the early afternoon. Having completed the preparation for the forthcoming examination, Abhijit went out to play cricket. Princess Madhumita, seeing that her brother was not at home, also ran off in the direction of the cricket field. On the way there, she met a fan-tailed pigeon who said, &ldquo;Madhumita, you shouldn&#146;t be running around like that. Sit here on my back and use this Murshidabad 10 silken thread as your rein.&rdquo; Then many Indian blue-rock pigeons hurriedly flew down. The fan-tailed pigeon told them, &ldquo;Fly around us and keep guard.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->At that moment, as if from nowhere, a flock of hawks and a flock of sea-gulls flew down from the sky. A terrible fight took place between the hawks and sea-gulls and the flock of pigeons. So fierce was the battle that the whole sky shook, a violent tempest blew up, boats sounded their sirens; aeroplanes, stricken with fear, landed on the ground, and all the other birds went into hiding in their respective nests. What a frightful battle! Such a battle had never been seen before by any living being. At the fight&#146;s end the sea-gulls and hawks sounded the retreat and fled away in the direction of their homes, saying, &ldquo;Come on, brothers, run for your lives&rdquo;. With raised tails they scurried away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The pigeons took shelter in a pomegranate tree in the courtyard of a peasant&#146;s house. Their doctor applied ointment to their wounds and tied one or two small bandages. No one&#146;s injuries were very serious. Finally, after resting for a while and eating some puffed rice, potatoes and savoury pancakes, they set off on their journey. For a time everything went well; no mechanical trouble was detected in the wings. Just then, a giant condor (the world&#146;s largest flying bird) set out from a cave situated high in the Alps mountains. The condor, making a swishing sound with it&#146;s wings, rose up quickly into the sky; that is, it flew off in the direction of the flock of pigeons. Being attacked by the condor did not worry the pigeons in the least. But as you can imagine, they were very anxious about the safety of Madhumita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->They had lost their way and found themselves over a dense forest. The fan-tailed pigeon had made a very big mistake at the time of leaving the house he had forgotten to put the compass in his pocket. On that day the sun was hidden behind clouds; it was not night, and therefore the pole star was not visible. And so, how could the right direction be determined? They made the following plan. &ldquo;First of all we&#146;ll leave Madhumita in a safe place and then jump into the fierce battle with the condor; nail against nail, tooth against tooth, beak against beak.&rdquo; After sitting Madhumita on a strong branch of a tall tree, they set off for the fight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now, that very tree on which Princess Madhumita was sitting happened to be a huge chocolate tree. A chocolate was hanging beside each of the tree&#146;s leaves. Each chocolate was wrapped up in a multi-coloured paper wrapper on which the full details of the contents were written. There were ordinary chocolates, Brazilian chocolates, chocolates from the country of Chile, milk caramels, condensed milk caramels, Japanese toffees of a brilliant white colour, Swiss toffees made of aromatic roses, chocolates which melt like butter the moment they are put in your hand and some which, the very instant they are placed on the tongue, slip effortlessly down the throat. The Princess ate as many chocolates as she could manage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Just then, the forest was enveloped by dense darkness. Even the man at one&#146;s shoulder could not be seen. One&#146;s own hands and feet were also invisible. Therefore there was no hope at all of seeing the chocolates. While perching on the branch of that tree, Madhumita nodded off to sleep.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The next day at the break of dawn Madhumita thought, &ldquo;What should I do now?&rdquo; She looked around and saw, a short distance away, an ashke cake 11 tree. Someone had, would you believe, left a ladder leaning against its trunk. Madhumita briskly scaled the ladder and climbed into the tree. Warm ashke cakes were hanging everywhere. Madhumita picked a few of them and then wondered how she should eat them. Ashke cakes should be eaten either with molasses or with treacle. But, after looking this Way and that, not a single molasses tree or treacle tree was to be seen. With her head cupped in her hands she thought over and over again, &ldquo;Will these nicely puffed ashke cakes simply hang here in this way for nothing?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->At that moment, thousands upon thousands of multi-coloured honey bees came in her direction. Madhumita asked: &ldquo;Who are you brothers? From which country have you flown from?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->They replied: &ldquo;You must be aware, sister Madhumita, that there are many types of honey-bee in the world. In this forest we are of three varieties. One species is called &lsquo;rock bee&rsquo;. They are large in size, have a sharp sting and very potent poison. Do you know, the most interesting thing about them (as they said this their mouths became quite watery) is that they can store up to ten or fifteen kilos of honey in their hives. They are, however, unwilling to be easily tamed. The second species name is &lsquo;bush bee&rsquo; and the third species is called &lsquo;epis indica&rsquo;. The bush bees&#146; hive is a little small, they give less honey, their sting is less sharp, their poison a little less painful. Epis indica is of the same type, to some extent. Only the rock bee builds it&#146;s large hives in trees. The others make their hives in the courtyards of houses. Furthermore, some make a hole in mud walls and build their hives inside that. But all these types of hive produce less honey.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Madhumita said: &ldquo;Really, I never knew so many things.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The honey-bees said: &ldquo;We bees gathered here today represent all the different species.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Madhumita inquired: &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The bees answered: &ldquo;We noticed that, for want of molasses, our Madhumita was unable to eat ashke cakes. Therefore, we decided to give 1000 kilos of honey collected from all our different hives to Madhumita&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Madhumita started eating ashke cake after ashke cake dipped in honey.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->While Madhumita was gleefully dipping the cakes in the honey a huge ghost called Ekanore 12 appeared beside a giant, straight-trunked palm tree.13 At first Madhumita thought that he had come to take some of the honey covered ashke cakes from her. Then she saw that he had no such intention. He was a very good person and seeing that Madhumita was obliged to eat the cakes with her hands, felt sorry for her and wanted to help. He had therefore brought a giant stainless steel bowl for her use. The ghost said: &ldquo;Put the cakes in the bowl and eat them. That&#146;ll be more convenient for you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Madhumita said, &ldquo;Brother Ekanore, you are such a kindhearted person.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Ekanore said &ldquo;Before, when I was alive, I wasn&#146;t such a good man. Later I realized that bad deeds produce bad results. That&#146;s why now I always do good deeds. And therefore, I suppose you could now call me a good man. Haven&#146;t you ever heard about me?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Madhumita replied: &ldquo;Well, I can&#146;t recall having heard anything.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Ekanore said &ldquo;At night, don&#146;t you ever cry when you&#146;re about to go to bed?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Madhumita replied: &ldquo;Yes, I used to cry. Even now I cry.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Ekanore asked: &ldquo;When you cry, doesn&#146;t your mother ever recite any rhymes?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Madhumita replied: &ldquo;Yes, she does:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->There is an Ekanore<br>Who lives upon a palm tree<br>His ears are as big as bamboo-trays 14<br>His teeth as long as radishes<br>With a straw rope around his waist<br>He moves from house to house<br>That very child who cries<br>He ties inside his shoulder bag<br>Lifts him up and beats him against the ground.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Ekanore said: &ldquo;That&#146;s right, that&#146;s right, I am that very Ekanore.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Madhumita said: &ldquo;Brother Ekanore, I cannot express what a joy it is to have met you. Tell me, do you always live up in the trees?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Ekanore replied: &ldquo;This tall palm tree here is my residence. I do my duty sitting on its top.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Madhumita asked: &ldquo;What duty?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Ekanore said: &ldquo;This forest ends at a distance of 150 miles from here. After that the witch&#146;s kingdom starts. I sit up there on the palm tree with a telescope in hand to see if the witch is coming this way or not. If I see her coming I immediately warn all the beasts of the forest. I tell the monkey brothers, &lsquo;Make your hoop hoop sound.&rsquo; Everyone will then understand that the witch is on her way here. I tell our jackal brothers, &lsquo;Put your tails in your mouths and make the pheu pheu sound.&rsquo; Everyone will then be alerted that the witch is coming. Ah yes, I forgot to say, the sound that the jackals make after putting their tails in their mouths is called &lsquo;pheru&rsquo; in literary Bengali, whereas in spoken Calcutta Bengali we say &lsquo;pheu&rsquo;. My little Madhumita, you must certainly have realized that in this jungle there isn&#146;t a single living monkey, nor a single living jackal. There are only monkey ghosts and jackal ghosts.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Madhumita, at the same time, was speaking with Ekanore, looking at the freshly made ashke cakes, dipping them into the honey and eating them. The cakes were spotlessly white and also nicely puffed, as light as cotton, and perforated with innumerable pores: one, two, one thousand, ten thousand. That&#146;s why her grandmother said the other day:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You have seen the dove, my love, and have yet to see the trap.<br>You have eaten ashke, my love, but haven&#146;t counted the pores.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->After trying in vain to count the pores, Madhumita busied herself in the important task of eating cakes. Just then, a female ghost came down in great haste from a distant Siamese rough bush.15 Using a tape Madhumita calculated her height to be 29 feet. The female ghost went up to Ekanore first and said, &ldquo;Listen to this, my dear. You know that witch who goes to take a breath of fresh air on her bamboo-tray helicopter every day at dawn and dusk&#8230; well, today at dawn she didn&#146;t go. It&#146;s my guess, therefore, that today she will come to the forest a little early. That&#146;s why it won&#146;t be safe for anyone to stay standing down here for much longer. Now, because it&#146;s such a rainy and overcast day, I have made rice and lentil stew and fried papar 50 for you and brought it here. Eat it quickly and then climb straight up onto the tree. After doing the washing up, I will also climb up into the Siamese rough bush.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Madhumita asked: &ldquo;Are you our sister-in-law?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Ekanore said: &ldquo;Yes, Madhumita, this female ghost is my wife, your sister-in-law. Her full name is Mrs. Fish-Eating Ghost.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Madhumita asked: &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;fish-eating ghost&rsquo;, brother Ekanore?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Ekanore said: &ldquo;Oh, then you don&#146;t know&#8230; All those women in the world who only want to eat fish in their worldly life, that is, whose greed for fish is extreme, become fish-eating ghosts after their death. Fish-eating ghosts have one distinctive characteristic; only if the odour of rotten fishes&#146; scales drifts into their nostrils can their eyes close in sleep. They have been suffering from this disease for quite some time. No allopathic or ayurvedic 16 doctors have been able to cure this ailment of theirs.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Madhumita said: &ldquo;My goodness, it must be a very serious disease. In that case sister-in-law, Fish-Eating Ghost, when stricken with illness, why do you strain yourself so much?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Fish-Eating Ghost replied: &ldquo;You see, the disease comes at night, not during the day. When the deep night has descended on all sides and there is only darkness after darkness and, from afar, the hooting of owls is audible, in that very setting, sitting on the top branch of the Siamese rough bush the desire for sleep comes and yet sleep never falls on these wretched eyes of mine. At that critical time I have to rush to someone&#146;s dustbin to inhale the odour of rotten fish, and then come back to fall asleep immediately.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Madhumita said: &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Then, Madhumita saw two female ghosts taking a stroll in a nearby park and asked: &ldquo;Who are they, sister-in-law, Fish-Eating Ghost?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Fish-Eating Ghost answered: &ldquo;So you don&#146;t know. One of them is a mother-in-law ghost, and the other a daughter-in-law ghost. Their story is well known, haven&#146;t you heard it?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Madhumita said: &ldquo;No, I haven&#146;t. Will you tell me?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Fish-Eating Ghost said: &ldquo;Yes, but I&#146;ll tell you quickly, otherwise the witch will be upon us.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Fish-Eating Ghost told the following story:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->[The following section was also printed separately as part of &ldquo;Ghost In-Laws&rdquo; in Sarkar&#146;s Short Stories Part 1. This is the Sarkar&#146;s Short Stories Part 1, 1st edition, version.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Once there was a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law who used to quarrel fifty-eight times every day. One day they were working together in the kitchen. The mother-in-law was rolling rotis 17 and the daughter-in-law was cooking them. The mother-in-law yawned sleepily and said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What a nuisance this yawn is. I&#146;ve got a feeling<br>It portends the death of my daughter-in-law&#146;s brother.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->The daughter-in-law shook with indignation from head to toe. She also yawned, and said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This yawn is such a nuisance. I&#146;ve got a feeling<br>It portends the death of my father-in-law&#146;s brother-in-law.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The mother-in-law was outraged by this remark, but had to keep her feelings to herself. It was definitely a case of &ldquo;tit for tat.&rdquo; The mother-in-law had overlooked one of the basic principles of life &ndash; always think of the consequences before abusing others &ndash; and had to pay for it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This calls for a change in tactics,&rdquo; thought the mother-inlaw. &ldquo;I&#146;d better be a little more cunning.&rdquo; The next day she announced, &ldquo;We&#146;re going to make seven hundred varieties of cake today.&rdquo; So the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law went off to the kitchen together to make cakes. They made so many cakes: steamed cake, steamed rice cake, fried cake, juicy-cake, condensed-milk cake, banana cake, cake-to-win-over-your-sister-in-law, cake-to-win-over-your-mother-in-law, and cake whose aroma fills the whole neighbourhood. The crows were standing nearby, waiting hopefully; the kites were looking on greedily from afar; the neighborhood&#146;s small children were anxiously waiting; and the old folk of the locality were thinking, &ldquo;If one or two bowls happen to be thrown in this direction, it won&#146;t be such a bad thing.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Suddenly the mother-in-law left the kitchen. The daughter-in-law seized her opportunity and greedily stuffed four hot fried cakes into her mouth. Unfortunately the mother-in-law returned as suddenly as she had left, putting the daughter-in-law in a most difficult situation.

<a name="82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->Madhumita said: &ldquo;Well&#8230; well&#8230; well.

<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->While she was dipping the cakes into the honey and eating them, Ekanore went closer to her. He said: &ldquo;You should know, Madhumita, that there is a witch&#146;s kingdom 150 miles from here. The witch is extremely cruel, deviously wicked and most ill-natured. She flies her bamboo-tray helicopter to a different place each day and, on locating stray princes and princesses, catches them and keeps them as her personal servants. Since you have come here today I am very worried lest she locates you too, and takes you away.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->Madhumita said: &ldquo;In case the witch comes please, tell me what I should do. I will do just that.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->Ekanore said: &ldquo;If you see an old woman on the ground under your tree immediately look over in the direction of my palm tree.

She won&#146;t be able to harm you in any way. Moreover, if you think about God just once before speaking, that will be even better; you know it pays to be cautious. And if you see me sobbing sorrowfully and shedding copious tears you will know that she is the witch herself. So long as nobody talks to her she won&#146;t be able to cast her spell. The trouble begins the moment you start talking. No matter what the which may say, and, no matter what she asks, don&#146;t utter a sound. Close your eyes, think about God, and keep your mouth firmly shut.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->Madhumita said: &ldquo;I understand. It&#146;s very clear.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->Suddenly a gusty wind blew. The leaves of the trees seemed to be shivering. Everything was in the grip of fear and apprehension. The whole atmosphere was tense. All of a sudden an old lady was seen sitting under a tree.

The witch, her toothless mouth opened in a broad smile, said: &ldquo;Oh my dear granddaughter, won&#146;t you give me an ashke cake?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->At that crucial moment Ekanore&#146;s advice had unconsciously slipped out of her mind.

<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->The old witch said: &ldquo;Can&#146;t you see my dear granddaughter, there are so many varieties of ornamental embroidered designs and patterns on the end of my sari.

<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->Just at that very moment when Madhumita climbed down to give the witch some ashke cakes, the witch caught her with her tongs. Madhumita was at a loss as to what to do.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph -->The old witch&#146;s helicopter flew a long way, much further, so very far, still further. It flew:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="104"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=104 type=paragraph -->Madhumita found it very interesting. Looking down towards the ground she saw such picturesque natural beauty. The bamboo tray helicopter continued its journey. Whizz&#8230; whizz&#8230; whizz&#8230; Across seven seas and thirteen rivers, across the skies of many known and unknown lands, and over the heads of many familiar and unfamiliar people and animals. The helicopter flew on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="105"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=105 type=paragraph -->And then a large house was sighted below. The helicopter landed on its roof.

He who things something, says another thinks and does something else is known as a wicked person. All those people who are well-dressed and sweetly-spoken, as indeed many gentlemen are, are actually wicked in nature. I&#146;m a notorious witch; I&#146;m also wicked. Just see how fine my clothes and make-up are, and yet I only take a bath once a week. My head is crawling with ticks. They say, &lsquo;Beauty is only skin deep&rsquo; don&#146;t they?

<a name="118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->The witch narrated the following story: &ldquo;Once upon a time there was a wicked cat. At noon-time on a rainy winter&#146;s day she was lying snugly wrapped in the folds of the house owner&#146;s bed quilt. The window was just beside her. On the other side of the window a dog was standing in the pouring rain and getting soaking wet. From the comfort of the quilt the cat said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="120"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;A few days after this the cat ate her fill of milk and fish at the family-house. As a result the house&#146;s inhabitants stuffed her into a bag, tied it shut with some rope and went to sink it in the River Ganges. 28 Just at that time the dog said from the roadside:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->&lsquo;The other day you were so impertinent<br>Now, where are you going on the God of Death&#146;s 29 rope?&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But the wicked cat was not to be defeated. Even at the time of death she didn&#146;t lose her satirical wit. She said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->Seeing the witch slap Madhumita&#146;s cheek the hordes of cats shouted out &ldquo;Miaow&#8230; miaow&rdquo; and leapt towards her. They were just on the point of scratching, biting, and eating her, when she cried out, &ldquo;Oh my father, oh my mother, I&#146;m gone, I&#146;m dying,&rdquo; and, leaving behind her slippers, made a run for it. Seeing her condition all the cats burst into fits of laughter. The hordes of dogs came forwards growling. Today they were going to rip open the witch&#146;s throat. In fear for her life she rushed into the bathroom and bolted the door. Once inside her chest started palpitating, her heart heaved, her temples throbbed, her head reeled and her bones rattled. The witch was so terrified that she completely lost her voice. All the dogs arrived and bolted the door from the outside.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->The dogs and cats said in unison: &ldquo;Madhumita you are our sister. We are actually people.

<a name="128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->And then they suddenly noticed that the bathroom window was a little ajar. Taking the form of a sparrow the witch slipped out through the little opening and flew away. All the brothers and sisters, that is, the dogs and the cats lamented their loss: &ldquo;Oh dear, if only we had closed the window from the outside, everything would have been fine. That&#146;s why the elders say:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="156"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=156 type=paragraph -->All around was jungle, dense jungle. Not a single man was to be seen. Lying under the tree he started thinking&#8230; thinking&#8230; thinking.<!-- /block --></p>

That is to say, no other tree in the whole jungle was equal to it in size. There was a huge birds&#146; nest in the middle of the tree. A pair of giant birds by the name of Bangoma 36 and Bangomi lived there.

<a name="158"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=158 type=paragraph -->Bangomi replied: &ldquo;You&#146;re not following the news, Bangoma.

<a name="159"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=159 type=paragraph -->Bangoma said, &ldquo;That may be, but looking at the prince I get the feeling it&#146;s been some time since he last ate.

<a name="164"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=164 type=paragraph -->Bangomi said: &ldquo;Why will you burn yourself to death? If anybody has to die it should be me.

<a name="168"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=168 type=paragraph -->Bangomi answered: &ldquo;The Royal Family only eats vegetarian food. Fish and meat are, you know, non-vegetarian, and therefore the prince won&#146;t eat them.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="170"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=170 type=paragraph -->Bangoma and Bangomi said: &ldquo;No, if anyone has to die, it must be us. You have your whole life before you. If you stay alive you&#146;ll be able to do so many things.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="171"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=171 type=paragraph -->Just then Bangoma suddenly said: &ldquo;I collected some extra fruit the day before yesterday and put it into a hole in the lower portion of our nest.

<a name="172"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=172 type=paragraph -->Bangomi went to look, and on returning said: &ldquo;It is, it is.&rdquo; Then Bangoma and Bangomi placed that dried fruit in front of the prince and returned to their nest.

<a name="173"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=173 type=paragraph -->Abhijit had listened to Bangoma and Bangomi&#146;s entire conversation, and had developed a deep respect for them.

<a name="174"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=174 type=paragraph -->Prince Abhijit, pretending to be asleep, closed his eyes and leant against the tree.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="176"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=176 type=paragraph -->Bangomi said, &ldquo;My dear, if the prince heads in a southwesterly direction he will, after some distance, reach a place where there is a palm tree. There is a chocolate tree near that palm tree. On reaching that place Abhijit would be wise to wait there.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="177"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=177 type=paragraph -->By then night had set in. Nothing could be seen. The prince was waiting for the auspicious hour before sunrise known as Brahma Muhurta&#x301;.39 Just at Brahma Muhurta&#x301;, he thought about God and set off towards his destination. And, would you believe, after some time he saw a huge palm tree. A quilt, mattress, cot, bed, table, jug, glass, every household article, were on top of the tree and yet the householder himself was absent. And, would you believe, beside it the prince saw a real chocolate tree. He thought, &ldquo;I can eat chocolates any day so what&#146;s the use of climbing up that tree. Instead I&#146;ll walk on a little further.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="178"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=178 type=paragraph -->After going a little distance he saw an ashke cake tree. Quite a large number of broken and unbroken ashke cakes were lying scattered here and there on the ground under the tree. Abhijit was a clever boy. Seeing the debris, he guessed that some kind of incident must have taken place there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="179"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=179 type=paragraph -->Abhijit decided to keep watch on that tree. Normally, a tiger, due to greed, will continuously move around that very spot where it previously had the good luck to catch it&#146;s prey. If anyone had snatched Madhumita away from this place that person was likely to return again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="180"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=180 type=paragraph -->From where he was sitting, Abhijit caught sight of a fried-cake tree. He quickly went and scaled the tree and even ate one or two fried cakes. The cakes were delightfully tasty. They were made of the best golden Nodia 33 lentils and filled with coconut, and steaming hot as if straight from the pan.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="181"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=181 type=paragraph -->While sitting there he ate a few more cakes and thought: &ldquo;If I go and sit on that tree in front, I&#146;ll be able to keep a good watch on the ashke cake tree.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="182"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=182 type=paragraph -->He did as he thought. He went and sat on the top of that large tree, which was a huge puli cake tree.

<a name="183"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=183 type=paragraph -->While sitting on the tree, Abhijit ate cakes and kept watch on the ashke cake tree. Just then, he caught sight of a cow-ghost standing under his puli-cake tree.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="184"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=184 type=paragraph -->Abhijit asked, &ldquo;Sister ghost, sister ghost, would you like to eat a cake?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="185"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=185 type=paragraph -->The cow-ghost said: &ldquo;No thank you. I&#146;ve just had a full meal of cattle-fodder. Therefore I won&#146;t eat cakes just now, thank you. I&#146;ve simply come to remind you about something.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="186"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=186 type=paragraph -->Abhijit asked, &ldquo;About what&#8230;? About what&#8230;? Tell me&#8230; Tell me!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="187"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=187 type=paragraph -->The cow-ghost said: &ldquo;Ekanore ghost lives on that palm tree over there. He&#146;s a most civilized fellow, most gentle, and most educated.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="191"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=191 type=paragraph -->Abhijit asked: &ldquo;Where has he gone now?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="192"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=192 type=paragraph -->The cow-ghost said: &ldquo;He has perhaps gone to make arrangements for his father&#146;s last rites.

<a name="193"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=193 type=paragraph -->Abhijit asked: &ldquo;Why&#8230;? Why&#8230;? For what purpose?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="194"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=194 type=paragraph -->The cow-ghost replied: &ldquo;After all, it is the last rites of a ghost&#146;s father, you know! For that so many things are required, so much money is needed. It is for that very reason that the Brahmdaetya was nagging around him with a long list.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="195"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=195 type=paragraph -->Abhijit said: &ldquo;Oh, I see, then the last rites of a ghost&#146;s father is quite a costly affair?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="196"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=196 type=paragraph -->The cow-ghost said: &ldquo;Yes, extremely expensive. You know, only sinful people become ghosts after death and, if they don&#146;t spend a lot of money on the last rites, they won&#146;t be able to go to heaven. That&#146;s why the poor ghosts have to stay down in hell and rot there. Tell me, who&#146;s going to spend such a large sum on them, for their last rites?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="197"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=197 type=paragraph -->Abhijit asked: &ldquo;So where has he gone now?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="198"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=198 type=paragraph -->The cow-ghost replied: &ldquo;He&#146;s most probably gone to Benaras 41 to perform the last rites. In order to make the necessary arrangements, the poor man was obliged to incur a huge financial debt. Ekanore even had to pawn the ladder he used for climbing into his tree to purchase the items required for the last rites. That&#146;s why, even at such an age, he now has to scale the tree like a monkey.  I must be going now. Don&#146;t forget, prince, that you should not waste any time in making friends with Ekanore.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="199"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=199 type=paragraph -->Just as the cow-ghost was about to leave, Abhijit noticed a huge raven flying over his head. Surprisingly enough, it wasn&#146;t holding even a single cake in its beak.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="200"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=200 type=paragraph -->Abhijit enquired: &ldquo;Hey, sister cow-ghost, why isn&#146;t that raven eating any cakes? And why is he making that strange type of kor&#8230; kor sound?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="201"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=201 type=paragraph -->The cow-ghost replied: &ldquo;That&#146;s a mangosteen 42 eating raven; now he&#146;s become a ghost.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="202"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=202 type=paragraph -->Abhijit asked: &ldquo;What&#146;s a mangosteen eating raven? I have never heard of such a thing!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="203"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=203 type=paragraph -->The cow-ghost said: &ldquo;In that case, listen to his story. Once-upon-a-time there was a raven who was extremely greedy. One day, while hitting at a large mangosteen fruit with his beak, he happened to swallow it. Actually, he ate it out of intense greed but found to his dismay that his condition was just like a snake who had eaten a musk-rat. 43 Neither could he swallow it, nor could he throw it up. Oh, what terrible pain he was in! Then the raven moved throughout the whole universe; up to the heavens, across the earth, down to the underworld, in search of a doctor who would be able to save him by cutting the mangosteen in his throat into pieces. He cried out with great difficulty:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="204"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=204 type=paragraph -->&lsquo;To the mangosteen I will never go again.<br>The mangosteen I will never eat again.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="205"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=205 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;All the world&#146;s ayurvedic doctors knew that the raven was voraciously greedy and therefore they all decided: &lsquo;First of all let him rectify himself and only then will we cut up the gab fruit.&rsquo; Seeing his profuse weeping an elderly ayurvedic doctor felt sorry for him. He said: &lsquo;Come here, raven, let&#146;s see what I can do for you. But you will have to promise me that you will never indulge in such things again.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="206"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=206 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The raven said: &lsquo;Respected doctor, if you think I will, you must be mad.

<a name="207"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=207 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;And, weeping, he further said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="209"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=209 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Then the respected doctor, after sterilizing his sharp knife in a flame, cut the mangosteen stuck in the throat into 4 pieces. The raven heaved a sigh of relief. Then he flew to a mangosteen tree and gulped down greedly the 4 pieces of mangosteen. And then said to the ayurvedic doctor:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="210"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=210 type=paragraph -->&lsquo;If I don&#146;t eat mangosteen what else will I eat?<br>What else is there except mangosteen to eat?&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="211"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=211 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Saying this, he flew off. And then, after a few days, he choked himself on a mangosteen stuck in his throat and died. He was extraordinarily greedy. That&#146;s why you see him now flying in the sky as a raven ghost. He doesn&#146;t touch anything else except mangosteen. Only one sound comes out of his throat: &lsquo;Mangostee-ee-een.&rsquo; Look, he&#146;s still making that sound.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="212"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=212 type=paragraph -->Abhijit said: &ldquo;It&#146;s true, he&#146;s making that sound while flying around.&rdquo; And he asked: &ldquo;And for how long will he have to go on making that sound?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

But not everyone is like that. Take my case, for example. I have studied a lot, taught in a college and a school of Sanskrit, and practised a little ayurvedic medicine. In those days I used to manufacture medicine of world-wide repute in my ayurvedic laboratory. There I made &lsquo;palatial-house powder&rsquo; and &lsquo;giant elephant and gold compounded tablets&rsquo;, and thousands upon thousands of them were sold each month. Now, you see, when success goes to one&#146;s head, one loses compassion for one&#146;s fellow men. That, indeed, happened to me. I took to adulterating my products. And then, in course of time, I lost everything. Today I am penniless, destitute, the scum of the earth. Dear prince, I have committed many sins and, as a result, have become Ekanore ghost, and have had to set up house in the palm tree. Until these sins are neutralized by virtuous deeds, I won&#146;t have peace of mind. Even now I think, twenty-four hours a day I think, in what way I may atone for these sins. Whenever I get the opportunity I try my best to do good to others.

Other cows give milk when they are milked, but she used to give condensed milk sometimes freshly clotted, sometimes steaming, sometimes hot. You can&#146;t imagine how tasty and palatable it was. I can clearly remember, prince, that we once had such a severely cold winter that everything was quickly frozen, and even the waters of the river Ganges turned into ice. I wanted to take the launch from Chunchoro 33 fish market to Noihati.33  However, the launch service had stopped. After all, you can&#146;t expect a launch to travel over ice. As I wasn&#146;t one to be easily deterred, I drove over the ice of the Ganges on a motorcycle and in just one minute reached Noihati.33 There was no need to drive over the ice to get to Howrah 33 from Calcutta 33 as there&#146;s a bridge. But a number of times I amused myself by driving up as far as Salkia Bandhaghat 33 from Ahiritola.33 Oh, what a thrilling experience. Just thinking about it makes me jump with joy. Oh yes, let me return to what I was talking about. For some days during that very winter I milked the cow. On milking her I was astonished: &lsquo;My goodness, what happened to the condensed milk?&rsquo; It had turned to ice-cream. After that, for 15 days at a stretch ice-cream came out of the cow&#146;s udder. That season I sold ice-cream and pocketed 500,000 rupees.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Without thinking, he ran for his life. He rushed into his yard like a mad man gasping desperately for air, stumbled, fell flat on his face near the gutter and, clenched his teeth, and became senseless. When he regained consciousness he immediately reached into his bag to check the contents and exclaimed, &lsquo;I don&#146;t believe it! It can&#146;t be possible!

On returning at noon she takes a light meal and then basks in the mild sunlight. While she lays down, female devils and demons part her hair and pick out the ticks.
