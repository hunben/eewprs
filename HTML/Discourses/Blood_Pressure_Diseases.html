<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Symptoms<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Lack of sound sleep, getting up a number of times at night to urinate, headache, dizziness, palpitation or pain in chest, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Causes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->1. Usually those who do little physical labour but at the same time have a lot of fatty foods such as oil, ghee, etc., in their diets become victims of high blood pressure. Fat, in the absence of any physical activity, does not get an opportunity to break down and be converted into heat or energy. The surplus fat turns the body into a mass of flesh and fat, and this exerts an undue pressure on the various organs and glands of the body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->When this surplus fat accumulates within the veins and arteries, it narrows the passage available for the blood. As a result, the blood vessels fail to help the heart in maintaining adequate blood circulation. Under such circumstances, to keep the blood circulation normal, the heart has to overwork.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->2. Those who do not undertake much physical labour, but eat substantial quantities of nutritious food, suffer from excessive blood formation in their systems. This surplus blood, after being converted into flesh and fat, gradually obstructs the activity of the blood vessels, as previously described, and produces too high a pressure of blood on the heart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Meanwhile, the different bodily organs and glands of those who have an excess blood supply and whose hearts are under too much pressure, become over-active, and it generates anger or sexual passion in them. So in people with this type of high blood pressure, sexual desire and anger grow along with the disease. Sometimes this extreme anger or desire causes death due to bursting of the blood vessels.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->3. Those who shun physical labour, yet eat an abnormal quantity of animal or vegetable proteins, risk injury due to the surplus protein in their systems. Human bodies have no place to store surplus protein, because they have no need to store it. So the organs of the body try to expel it from the system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This surplus protein decreases the alkaline portion of the blood and increases the acidic portion. Over-acidity of the blood weakens the blood-producing and blood-purifying organs such as the liver, kidneys, etc., and as a result the veins and arteries also get hardened and weak. These hardened, weak blood vessels cannot maintain the blood circulation, due to which the heart comes under heavy pressure. In this condition, to keep the bodily organs functioning normally, the heart has to over-exert. But the weak blood vessels cannot bear this over-activity of the heart: they burst and cause internal hemorrhaging.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->4. For various reasons the blood-producing and blood-purifying organs may become weak. And when they become quite weak, one gets less than the required quantity of blood for the body. In this condition the patient suffers from a lack of sleep, headache, dizziness, serious physical weakness, etc. This is called low blood-pressure.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Morning &ndash; <i>Utks&#x301;epa Mudra&#x301;, Karma&#x301;sana, Yogamudra&#x301;, Diirgha Pran&#x301;a&#x301;ma, Bhu&#x301;jaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sana, Agnisa&#x301;ra Mudra,</i> and <i>Va&#x301;yavii Mudra&#x301;</i> or <i>Va&#x301;yavii Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Wonderful results can be obtained if <i>Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na</i> [meditation] is practised by patients as taught by an <i>a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya</i>. In fact, so long as patients have not acquired the capacity to perform <i>a&#x301;sanas</i> and <i>mudra&#x301;s, Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na</i> is the only medicine for the disease. With this disease, <i>vya&#x301;paka sna&#x301;na</i><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is especially helpful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Diet<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->With blood pressure diseases all acidic foods are to be rejected and alkaline types of food are to be taken in increased quantity. As far as possible, foods such as rice, pulses and rut&#x301;i should be eaten in less quantity, and fruits, roots, and leafy vegetable soup should be taken instead. Non-vegetarian food should be avoided. Fried, parched and sweetened foods are also harmful. If one feels the need, a little raw sugar or honey can be taken.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The amount of physical labour should gradually be increased and mental exertion should be decreased. But those who are suffering from low blood pressure should decrease their physical labour until the disease is cured.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Fasting is very beneficial in this disease, so patients must fast on <i>eka&#x301;dashii, pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima</i> and <i>ama&#x301;vasya&#x301;,</i> taking only water. Those who are physically weak, however, can drink lemon juice with water. It is desirable for patients of low blood pressure to take milk, fruit juice, etc. on fasting days.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Those who suffer from high blood pressure due to too much fat should drink curd-water or coconut milk instead of milk. Patients should carefully abstain from using intoxicants and should be careful to avoid eating constipating or fattening foods. They should also stay away from anger and sex.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->3. Take 1/16 or 1/8 tola of <i>sarpagandha&#x301;</i> root powder with a little honey and <i>triphala&#x301;</i> juice twice a day.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->4. Powder of <i>bhu&#x301;mi kus&#x301;ma&#x301;n&#x301;da</i> in 1/16 tola quantity should be taken twice daily with honey.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->5. 1/16 or 1/8 tola of dried <i>sarpagandha&#x301;</i> root powder with <i>michrii</i>-water should be taken twice daily.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  [[Regarding <i>vya&#x301;paka sna&#x301;na,</i> the author&#146;s <i>Ananda Marga Carya&#x301;carya Part 3,</i> &ldquo;Different Yoga Practices&rdquo; explains:<br> A bathtub is most convenient, but if this is not available, an earthen trough will suffice. If this is not available either, a wet towel can be used, soaking it repeatedly in water. Fill the bathtub with cold water, and sit in it undressed so that the area from the navel down remains submerged. Keep your feet dry and out of the tub. The area from the neck to the navel should be kept covered with a shirt or dry cloth. The crown of the head and the back of the head should be kept covered with a wet towel.<br> Now take another towel and rub the area from the right side of the abdomen to the groin seven or eight times. Do likewise on the left-hand side and horizontally from right to left and left to right. You should make sure that the towel on the head remains wet.<br> After this, wipe the abdomen, hands and thighs and take a full bath. If this is not possible, then leave the tub wearing a shirt.<br> This should be practised behind closed doors. In the absence of a bathtub or an earthen trough, a wet towel may be wrapped around the areas to be bathed, but in order to compensate, cold water must be poured constantly over the towel, and the towel which is to be used for the massage must be kept wet. After <i>vya&#x301;paka sna&#x301;na,</i> the thighs, pubic area and abdomen should be warmed with a dry towel.<br> Before and after this bath one should not eat, in order to allow the stomach to rest.<br> &ndash;Trans.]]</p>
