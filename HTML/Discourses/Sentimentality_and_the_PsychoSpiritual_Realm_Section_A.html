<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The cranium of females is usually slightly smaller than that of males, consequently women have less nerve cells in the brain than men. But the fact is that men use a very small number of the nerve cells in their brains, and the same applies to women. Spiritual practices and higher pursuits utilize more and more nerve cells. Suppose a man and a woman learn sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; at the same time, practise with the same sincerity and progress with the same speed &ndash; they will both achieve spiritual elevation. Now, suppose they both enjoy divine bliss after performing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for the same number of years. If all or say 99% of the nerve cells in the brain of the woman are utilized, a lower percentage will be utilized by the man because he has more nerve cells in his brain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Women have some propensities that are very strongly developed. In particular, women normally have great love and affection for their children. This is natural. But if the expression of a particular propensity is excessive, it may have adverse consequences. For instance, most stepmothers love their own children more strongly than their stepchildren, and if the intensity of this affection is not controlled, it may create tensions and divisions in the family. Also, because of the affection women have for their children, they may not like to go outside the home, and if this is taken to extremes, it may lead to harmful isolation. Similarly, if a large number of people living in a particular region only stay in their own region out of blind love for their locality, it will be detrimental to the progress of society as a whole. Good relations with other regions will not be encouraged, and the trade and economic development of their region may be adversely affected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Love and affection are very good attributes, but to protect oneself and society from their possible extreme expressions, the best path to follow is to channelize all one&#146;s love and affection towards Parama Purus&#146;a. This will expand the arena of one&#146;s love and accelerate one&#146;s march towards the Great. A person who has developed universal love will be able to do very great work in a very short time.<!-- /block --></p>
