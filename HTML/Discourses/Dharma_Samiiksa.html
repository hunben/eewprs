<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Every action that is performed produces an equal and opposite reaction, provided the three-fold factors of time, space, and person remain unassailed, unchanged. An incident may take place at 10:00 a.m., but its reaction may not come forthwith, it may come sometime after; and obviously the reaction to the action becomes slightly more than equal. Human beings perform various types of actions &ndash; big or small, good or bad &ndash; and consequently, they are to face the reactions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As far as we know, human history covers about fifteen thousand years, though its earliest stage was very crude. Human beings have done so many things [during this period] and thereby taken on various sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Lord Shiva, Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, or, we can say, Parama Purus&#x301;a, has come meanwhile, and helped and blessed suffering humanity. With such blessings, with such Cosmic grace, human beings can go beyond the periphery of karma and attain salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->One cannot, by dint of one&#146;s individual efforts, get rid of the heavy load of accumulated reactions to past sins which in Sanskrit is called pra&#x301;rabdha &ndash; for that one needs the grace of the Guru, the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The scriptures say, of course, that one has to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, because by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, one trains one&#146;s mind, one can discipline one&#146;s mind. The human mind is just like a lion of the circus. A lion is given adequate training before it is asked to put on its various skilful performances. The human mind can also produce excellent results when it is properly trained and disciplined.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now I have already said that one must undergo the unsatisfied sa&#x301;mska&#x301;ras, the unquenched sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. In order to attain salvation, one must burn up one&#146;s past sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. A seed when soaked in water germinates, but if it is burnt up it can never germinate. Every human being must be a dagdhabiija [burnt seed], that is, one whose sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are totally burnt up. For this, one absolutely needs the grace of the Guru, the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The scriptures say, &ldquo;Just an iota of the Cosmic grace is enough to ensure salvation for unit beings.&rdquo; The main purpose of Dharma Samiiks&#x301;a is to make the jiivas [unit beings] dagdhabiijas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->During the entire period of fifteen thousand years of human history, there has been no Dharma Samiiks&#x301;a&#x301; such as this. There is no mention of any such event in Sanskrit literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->We say that a child is invariably apa&#x301;paviddha, that is, &ldquo;unassailed by pa&#x301;pa, or sin&rdquo;. But however good people may be, they commit some omissional and/or commissional mistakes &ndash; some do it knowingly, some unknowingly, but once they commit pa&#x301;pa, or sin, they cannot retract those mistakes, they have to suffer, they cannot escape the consequences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Those who have assembled here are surely good people. Some of you have come all the way from five thousand or [ten thousand] miles away. Some have come from the vicinity. There is certainly some subtle reason behind your assembling here. You are all good people &ndash; certainly better-than-average people. That is why you have come. Though there are many, many others who live nearby, they do not come. In my opinion, Parama Purus&#x301;a should do something for these good people. How long can unit beings bear the heavy load of unburnt sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras? So if Parama Purus&#x301;a should take away some of the sins from the unit beings, they will feel relieved of the heavy load and feel lightened. These people, free from the bondages of pa&#x301;pa and sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, can do many big things. By dint of their collective efforts they will bring heaven down onto this terrestrial earth; they will perform many noble and heroic deeds with courage and valour. Hence Dharma Samiiks&#x301;a is the most epoch-making event of the last fifteen thousand years.<!-- /block --></p>
