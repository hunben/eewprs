<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Each and every object of this universe, whether animate or inanimate, is emanating countless vibrations. The Macrocosmic Mind is the controller of these vibrations. In the case of living beings, the mind controls everything directly, and in the case of non-living entities, the Macrocosm controls everything. The wind blows, the water flows, the stone rolls, the leaves flutter &ndash; each of these inanimate objects has a unit mind, but only a dormant one. They cannot create vibrations by themselves; the Cosmic Mind creates vibrations for them, but in the case of living beings, although the controller is the unit mind, the unit mind is also the limited expression of the Cosmic Mind, and thus they are bound to follow the dictates of the Cosmic Mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The purpose of the spiritual practice of a sa&#x301;dhaka is to transform the unit mind into Cosmic Mind. The mind of a non-sa&#x301;dhaka is guided by extroversial propensities. But a sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s goal is Parama Purus&#x301;a so a sa&#x301;dhaka will have to direct the mind towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. When the unit mind merges its limited identity into the vast cosmic entity, we call it &ldquo;self-surrender&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->As a result of surrender the smaller &ldquo;I&rdquo; of the unit mind is guided is guided by the bigger &ldquo;I&rdquo;. In the case of mundane desire for pleasure, name, fame etc. the feelings that are produced in the nerve cells and fibres are controlled by the small &ldquo;I&rdquo;. But the spiritual vibrations produced in the human body are created and controlled by the Cosmic Mind. That is, the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; is concerned with the mundane pleasures whereas the big &ldquo;I&rdquo; is concerned with spiritual bliss. The small &ldquo;I&rdquo; differs from individual to individual but the bigger &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the same in all. The purpose of sa&#x301;dhana is to convert the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; into the bigger &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Metaphorically speaking, the bigger &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the moon <!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in the sky which is related to everyone through every generation. Physical vibration is crude whereas mental vibration is very subtle. The difference between mental happiness in connection with physical vibration and spiritual happiness in connection with psychic vibration is clear. The pleasure derived by eating sweets is physical &ndash; to attain it one must go to a sweet shop. But for spiritual happiness a constant endeavour is required. The mind must be concentrated on the object of meditation, all the psychic thoughts and feelings should be directed to Parama Purus&#x301;a. A relationship of deep love must be established with Him so that there remains only one propensity in the mind the intense desire for Parama Purus&#x301;a. The type of sama&#x301;dhi that a sa&#x301;dhaka attains with such a devotional sentiment is called bha&#x301;va sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->(On May 10th, 1969, at Ranchi ja&#x301;grti, a sa&#x301;dhaka experienced bha&#x301;va sama&#x301;dhi. Sitting in dhya&#x301;na&#x301;sana he began to practice dhya&#x301;na on Mula&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra. As soon as he connected his mind with the Cosmic Mind he felt the sweet waves of cosmic bliss. Then he took his mind to deeper realms, practicing dhya&#x301;na in svadhista&#x301;na and man&#x301;ipura cakras. At this time he directed all his psychic energies to Parama Purus&#x301;a. Only one thought was dominant in his mind &ndash; only Parama Purus&#x301;a exists and no other entity. Then while doing dhya&#x301;na on anaha&#x301;ta cakra he had a feeling that Parama Purus&#x301;a was his own. At this stage the sa&#x301;dhaka remained absorbed in limitless bliss. Waves of bliss constantly flowed through the glands, nerve cells and fibres causing him to remain totally oblivious of the external world).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->During sama&#x301;dhi the vibration created in different parts of a sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s body are not controlled by the unit mind but by the Cosmic Mind. There is a feeling of indescribable bliss throughout the body which causes the sa&#x301;dhaka to shiver continuously. Bha&#x301;va sama&#x301;dhi can be experienced in any of the four lower cakras. But as soon as the mind rises above the ana&#x301;hata cakra a higher sama&#x301;dhi is experienced.<!-- /block --></p>
