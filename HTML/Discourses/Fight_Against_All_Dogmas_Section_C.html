<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Of course, there are a few opportunists whose very wont is to exploit the fellow humans. But they will not confess this openly. Rather by resorting to illogical logic they say that it is a providential decree that a certain percentage of people should remain neglected forever. They are destined to carry on their existence of inhuman torture; and a handful of people are destined to roll in riches and live in plenty and prosperity. This is also dogma. Those who are intelligent as well as righteous should surely protest and carry on a pactless fight against dogma because that which throttles the free intellect of human beings is sure to frustrate their intellectual liberation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->A similar thing happened in social sphere as well. For instance, some people announced that women are not entitled to spiritual salvation. If women want to attain spiritual emancipation they will have to be reborn as men. What an absurd proposition! All are the progeny of Parama Purus&#x301;a, some of them are sons, some are daughters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Can Parama Purus&#x301;a ever give any decree that only His sons will be entitled to liberation and salvation and His daughters will not attain it? This is indeed a strange and unnatural proposition; it is sheer villainy. This sort of repulsive logic was injected into human brains by constantly harping on the one theme that women have no right to spiritual salvation; and thus the spontaneous intellectual growth of women was impeded. The liberation of their intellect was curbed, and their spiritual progress and social advancement in many countries was severely hindered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->On one side the malevolent forces are to establish their professed dogmas and on the other hand Parama Purus&#x301;a wants the all-round development of human intellect. Hence I call upon you to carry on a ceaseless and pactless fight against dogma. You are sure to be crowned with victory.<!-- /block --></p>
