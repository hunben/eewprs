<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Agriculture is one of the oldest sciences known to civilization, and directly affects every human being. The knowledge of different crops, their utilization, growing requirements, etc. have been passed down and improved upon from generation to generation. Without this knowledge, human beings would have been dependent on the irregular food supply of nature, just like animals. So learning how to grow certain crops has been an essential requirement for human development, and a significant feature of social progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Human beings have acquired some knowledge of a variety of crops, but many plants still have unknown and so far unutilized potential. So human beings should expand their knowledge of all kinds of plants, and develop new and better methods of increasing crop yields.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Some important crops which are grown in Bengal are discussed below, and include: oil seeds, pulses, fibre crops, cereals, vegetables, sugar crops, fruits, nuts, tea, coffee, cocoa, coarse grains, spices, medicinal plants, flowers, trees, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->OIL SEEDS<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Many plants have seeds which can be used to produce oil. The oil extracted from the seeds of some of these plants is used to produce thickened oil, margarine and other products for human consumption. The oil can also be burnt as a fuel; used to make cosmetics, shoe polish, furniture wax, medicines, hair oil, etc.; or refined for industrial purposes and used as machine oil, etc. The skin of some oil seeds, like groundnut, can also be removed to make flour to produce bread. Many products can be made from oil seeds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It must be remembered that some oil seeds, particularly groundnut, soybean and linseed, consume a lot of fatty substances from the soil, so oil cakes must be applied as manure when planting oil seeds. The method for this is as follows. First, the cake should be made into powder and mixed with soil, then it should be mixed with water and formed into mounds in the field. If it is to be used at a later date, at that time water should be added to the mixture of powder and soil and then it should be applied to the field. Sunflower and sesame consume an ordinary amount of fatty substances.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Some of the better known oil seeds are: <ul><ol> <li>peanut (cina&#x301; ba&#x301;da&#x301;m) <li>sesame (til). The varieties include:   <ol>     <li>white     <li>black     <li>red   </ol> <li>linseed (tisi) <li>mustard (sars&#x301;e, saris&#x301;a&#x301;).

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Peanut (Cina&#x301; Ba&#x301;da&#x301;m)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The peanut grows under the ground and is one of the oldest food crops known. The word peanut is used in Queen&#146;s English, but in common English, groundnut is used. In recent history, other uses have been found for the humble peanut and its oil, most notably by the scientist George Washington Carver. Peanut is able to grow in less fertile soil throughout the year, and not much water is required for its cultivation. It is a three and a half month crop, contains a lot of protein and has much food value. It is an important food in the diets of many poor people because it is fairly easy to grow and highly nutritious. And it is a regular item in the diets of many not so poor people as well because it is tasty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->From the peanut we get peanut milk, peanut oil, peanut butter, peanut cheese, peanut casein (cha&#x301;na&#x301;) and rasagolla. The oil is often used in deep frying, and because it is quite heavy, it can be easily thickened. The thickened oil can be made into margarine. Peanut oil cake may be used both as manure and as animal fodder. If the red skin of the peanut is removed before pressing to extract the oil, then it can be used as a substitute for flour to make bread.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The method for sowing peanut is as follows. The shell is removed, but the red skin is left intact, then the peanut is soaked in water. When it has sprouted, it should be planted on the hills or mounds of the field.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Sesame (Til)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Ground sesame seeds, or sesame butter or tahini, is a popular food item throughout the Middle East. The small seeds are a common item in cooking, particularly as a topping for bread. Sesame seeds are highly nutritious and contain vitamins which are difficult to get from other vegetarian sources. Sesame oil can be used for cooking and has many other uses as well. Scented oils may be made by adding floral essences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Sesame should be sown during Pha&#x301;lguna. It has three varieties: <ul><ol> <li>white <li>black <li>red </ol></ul><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There are three seasons for growing sesame &ndash; summer, rainy season and winter. Sesame can be grown as a mixed crop with groundnut because groundnut is a tuber crop, while sesame bears fruit above the ground. The two can be sown together on the mounds of the fields. Another name for sesame is mungrail.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Linseed (Tisi)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Linseed is both an oil crop and a fibre crop. The oil is produced from the seeds and the fibre is produced from the stalk. Unprocessed linseed oil is not fit for human consumption because it is not good for the stomach. But after hydrogenisation and deodourisation, it can be made into a refined oil (dalda) which can be eaten. Linseed oil has some medical value, particularly as a liniment, and it also has other uses. However, it takes a lot of fatty substances out of the soil, and whenever it is planted, oil cakes must be applied as manure. After linseed is harvested, dhain&#x32D;ca (Sesbania bispinosa) must be planted as a green manure. The dhain&#x32D;ca should be grown for two months and then ploughed into the field to restore the soil and make it ready for the next crop. Linseed can also be grown with soybean as a mixed crop.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Mustard (Sarse, Saris&#x301;a&#x301;, Olerasi Family)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There are three varieties of mustard: <ol> <li>ra&#x301;i <li>yellow mustard <li>red mustard (tori sars&#x301;e) </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;i may be sown as a &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> along with paddy in the month of A&#x301;shvina. Yellow mustard and red mustard can be sown as mixed crops with wheat, but they are not sown as &ldquo;pigeon crops&rdquo; because they require regular cultivation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Mustard leaves are similar to radish leaves. However, all varieties of mustard have yellow flowers while radish has white flowers. The green leaves of yellow mustard (sars&#x301;e sha&#x301;k) should not be eaten because although they are tasty, they are acidic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Mustard oil is pungent. The seeds are ground to make a spicy condiment or used directly in cooking. Mustard oil is widely used as a cooking oil in India. It has some medicinal value and other uses as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Cotton<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Cotton is well known for its fluffy, white balls of fibre, but cotton seed is an important source of oil. Cotogen is produced from refined cottonseed oil, and the oil cakes are used as cattle feed. The seeds are roasted and eaten as a snack, but this snack is harmful for pregnant women and pregnant animals. In particular, the oil cake should not be given to pregnant animals as it may cause an abortion. Cotton is not difficult to grow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->After the seeds are removed from the balls, the fibre is spun into thread which is used to produce all kinds of textile goods. Until recently, when artificial fibres began to replace cotton and other natural fibres, cotton was the most widely used fibre for textiles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->There are two main varieties of cotton: <ol> <li>three year cotton (ga&#x301;ch ka&#x301;pa&#x301;s) <li>three month cotton (cha&#x301;s ka&#x301;pa&#x301;s) </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->There are also various types of tree cotton. The most notable is the silk cotton tree (simul), which can also be used to make honey. Tree cotton (deva kusum or Gossypium arboreum) is the best cotton variety. The seeds of tree cotton and three month cotton were first brought to India from Egypt. Tree cotton was previously cultivated in Burdwan and Bankura. Three month cotton is grown in the Punjab, Gujarat and Maharashtra, and the growing season is from November to February. If the soil is good, three year cotton can be planted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Sarguja&#x301; (Niger)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Sarguja is often grown in tribal areas. The plants are small and it is a winter crop which even grows on poor, stony soil. The oil has a distinctive smell, but it can be made fit for consumption after decolourisation and deodourisation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The method of sowing sarguja&#x301; is as follows. The seeds should be soaked overnight in water and then sown between two groundnuts. In the irrigation canal or furrow between the rows of the field (the nala), sprouted soybean should be sown.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Castor (Eran&#x301;d&#x301;a, R&#x301;er&#x301;i, Ricinus Communis)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->There are two varieties of castor: <ol> <li>wild castor (bheren&#x301;d&#x301;a) <li>indigenous castor (cha&#x301;ser r&#x301;er&#x301;i) </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Good silk worms can be grown on the leaves of both varieties. Non-mulberry andy silk is produced, which is used to make shawls (chadar), shirts and pants (Punjabi kurta and pajyama) and other clothing. Aside from silk production, castor can be used to produce many products. The green leaves can be used as a fodder for animals. The oil can be processed and has many uses ranging from rectified hair oil to machine oil. The oil also has medicinal value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The crop rotation for castor is the same as that for cow pea (ar&#x301;ahar), except that sesame and soybean should not be sown in the month of Pha&#x301;lguna. Green gram (s&#x301;a&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; moog) should be sown one month after harvesting castor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Karamcha&#x301; (Karanja&#x301;, Carissa Caranda)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Karamcha&#x301; oil was produced in 2&#180; Parganas 50 years ago for burning lamps. The burning oil gives off much smoke. Boot polish and kajal for children are made from the soot of the burnt oil. (Kajal is the black substance which is applied under childrens&#146; eyes in India to protect them from the glare of the sun.) The fruit of karamcha&#x301; is made into a type of pickle. Karamcha&#x301; is used as a hedge plant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Indian Olive (Mahua&#x301;, Mahul)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Indian olive is similar to the Occidental or European olive, but they are not the same. It is an important tree, and a source of both oil and sugar. The sugar is produced from the flowers and the oil is produced from the fruit. The oil can be used as vegetable oil or thickened and processed into margarine. In A&#x301;nanda Nagar and A&#x301;nanda Shiila, Indian olive grows abundantly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Soybean (Glycine max.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->The soybean has long been used as a major food item in the Orient, where methods for processing soybean into numerous food and non-food products have been well-developed. For example, there one finds soy milk, soy cheese (tofu), numerous imitation meat products, and many other products made of soybean and its by-products. In the Occident, however, the soybean has been used mainly as animal fodder until recently. Now its versatility is being recognized and it is becoming more popular. The oil can be used for cooking, thickened into margarine or used in other ways. Soybean can be sown with peanut in the irrigation furrows of a field, and sesame or sarguja&#x301; on the mounds. It is a bit sweet, therefore it should be planted after sprouting, otherwise ants will eat it up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Sunflower (Su&#x301;ryamukhi, Helianthus Annuus)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->The sunflower is known widely for its large sun-loving flowers which make it a good roadside plant. It is also known for its tasty seeds which can be eaten raw, roasted, ground into butter or in a number of other ways. The seeds supply a lot of oil and are a good energy food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->There are two varieties of sunflower: <ol> <li>large <li>small </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->It is usually the large variety which is used for oil production. The oil of sunflower can be used for cooking and other purposes as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Sunflower is an 80-90 day crop in North India, and in South India it is a 65-70 day crop. It can be grown throughout the year. When sunflower is crushed without separating the husk from the seed, a blackish cake is produced which is used as a cattle feed. If it is crushed after the husk has been removed, the cake is white and fit for human consumption. In the large variety, there is a removable skin on the seed. If this skin is removed before pressing the seed to extract the oil, it can be used to make flour for baking bread.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Sunflower can grow on very poor soil. Research should be undertaken to improve the following: <ol> <li>the production of the seeds, which should be increased; <li>the yield of the oil, which should also be increased; and <li>the odour, which should be removed by deodourisation. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Coconut (Na&#x301;rikel)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Coconut has many uses. The water is very good to drink and the flesh can be eaten. The tender green coconut is called &ldquo;d&#x301;a&#x301;b&rdquo; in Bengal. The hard inner shell and the outer husk can be used for a variety of purposes, including the preparation of medicines. Coconut oil becomes solid in cool climates. It is used in cooking and is well known as a hair and body oil. Oil cake can be made from coconut oil, which is also used in preparing bread. Coconut is most suited to South India and will not be as successful in A&#x301;nanda Nagar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Other Oil Seeds<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Rice bran can be pressed for oil and the remainder can be used to make cement. Olive and lady&#146;s finger can also be used to produce oil. Safflower (kusum flower) seeds can be used to produce a less popular but good quality light oil which can be taken by those who must avoid heavy fats. In fact, most seeds contain oil of varying types and uses. Melon and cucumber (sosa) seeds may be used for oil extraction, but they are not commercially viable. Radish seeds are larger than mustard seeds and they provide a pungent oil somewhat like mustard seed oil. Radish oil cake makes a good manure, but radish oil is not widely used. Even onion seeds can be used to produce an oil which has medicinal value. Research should be done on the uncommon oil seeds in order to increase their utility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->PULSES<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Pulses are a valuable source of protein, and indispensable in the vegetarian diet. Most pulses are high in protein but have varying degrees of fat. They are easier to digest than casein, but less substantial. They are more important as a food than cereals, and in emergency conditions, pulses are more essential for health. Some pulses are also used for oil production.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->For farming, pulses are important as nitrogen fixers. The roots of all pulses should be left in the soil for some time after the harvest so that they can perform this function. This is one reason why they make excellent blended crops with plants like cereals, which do not fix nitrogen in the soil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Pulse in Sam&#x301;skrta is &ldquo;dvidal,&rdquo; and in Hindi and Bengali, &ldquo;da&#x301;l.&rdquo; In Urdu all pulses are called &ldquo;dalahan.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->There are many common pulses which include:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph --><ol> <li>green gram (s&#x301;a&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; moog).

<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->Green gram is known as &ldquo;mudga&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta, &ldquo;muga&rdquo; in Bengali, and &ldquo;moog&rdquo; in Hindi. Mudga giri means &ldquo;a hill like moog,&rdquo; hence the name Munghyr.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->There are three varieties of green gram: <ol> <li>golden gram (sona&#x301; moog) <li>horse gram (ghor&#x301;a&#x301; moog) <li>grassy gram (gheso moog) </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->The most substantial of these is horse gram, but the variety which is the most sweet scenting and palatable is golden gram. The best quality golden gram is grown in the Nadia district of Bengal. Golden gram is a two month crop, thus five to six crops can be harvested per annum, with some rest period for the land. In the A&#x301;nanda Nagar area, both golden gram and tapioca may be cultivated. They make a good combination in khicuri (rice, pulse and vegetables cooked together) for mass feeding.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->There were formerly many seasonal green grams, but nowadays two main varieties, 60 day green gram (s&#x301;a&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; moog) and rainy season green gram, are grown. The period for rainy season gram is during the months of As&#x301;a&#x301;dha, Shra&#x301;van&#x301;a and Bha&#x301;dra. The production and growth of rainy season gram is ordinary. 60 day green gram grows throughout India, as does golden gram. Green gram grows best in half sandy (demi-sandy) alluvial soil. It grows well throughout the year, except in the rainy season, and requires less water than a&#x301;us paddy. One special rule for harvesting green gram is that the pods should be plucked singularly, one by one.

Black gram grows in the western and northern districts of West Bengal, certain parts of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and the Punjab. As a pulse, it is very substantial. Bara&#x301;, bari, dahi bara&#x301; and pa&#x301;pad are all prepared from this pulse. The creepers may be used as animal fodder. They may be cut at intervals of 45 days, except one month before the flowering date. Pruning should cease one month before flowering. Since black gram flowers in the month of A&#x301;shvina, pruning should be stopped in Bha&#x301;dra, otherwise there will be less flowering and fruiting. After pruning there will be a profuse growth of the branches and sub- branches. It may also be grown as a blended crop. Associated crops that may be grown with black gram are turmeric, sugar cane, sha&#x301;k (green leafy vegetables), brinjal, raw chilli (green chilli) and radish.<!-- /block --></p>

The greater the size of a tree, the greater the quantity of fibre, but the same rule does not necessarily apply for the quantity of fruit produced by the banana tree. Not more than two offshoot saplings should be allowed to grow from one banana tree. The extra shoots should be cut. There are many varieties of banana.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="148"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=148 type=paragraph -->The traditional method of planting involves a rotation of these three varieties. Usually, it also involves the sowing of at least one &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo;. The &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo; is sown after the rice has already grown and is standing in the field. The soil is not tilled. The &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo;, which is usually a pulse like cow pea (ar&#x301;ahar) or an oil seed like mustard (ra&#x301;i variety), is simply thrown into the field and comes up on its own. When the rice is harvested, the tops of the &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo; are also cut.

<a name="149"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=149 type=paragraph -->If the production of rice can be increased by a better method, it will be a great benefit to the people of rice growing countries.

<a name="150"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=150 type=paragraph -->With the system of four crops per year, there is no time for the &ldquo;pigeon crops&rdquo; because the field is constantly engaged in rice production. However, mixed crops can be grown. Mixed crops such as radish, big onion (big piaz), small hot onion (small piaz), and small sweet onion (sachi piaz) may be sown at the time of paddy transplantation. There cannot be mixed crops with a&#x301;man because there is too much water in the field. Mixed crops grow best with boro paddy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="151"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=151 type=paragraph -->The system of growing four rice crops in a year requires that the rice seedlings are kept in a nursery for the first month to six weeks of their growth, because each rice crop takes four months to mature. Traditionally, the seeds are sown in a small plot at random, then transplanted in a more systematic manner. With the new system, the seeds should be grown in a nursery for the first month, and then transplanted in the field. The seedlings should always be transplanted after one month, or one and a half months at the most in some rare cases. If the seedlings are kept in the nursery for a longer period, the production will decline. Thus, in the two and a half to three months of their main growth period, the transplanted rice seedlings will remain in the field, and the best paddy land will be utilized for the main period of rice production. The four rice crops which can best be grown with this system are a&#x301;us, a&#x301;man, early boro and late boro. The production of these crops varies &ndash; a&#x301;man produces the maximum amount of rice, boro a medium amount and a&#x301;us the minimum.<!-- /block --></p>

A&#x301;us paddy does not require waterlogging the field. Along with the a&#x301;us paddy seedlings, radish seedlings can also be planted.

A&#x301;man paddy requires waterlogging. As the water level rises, the plant grows taller, but the tip should always remain above the water or the plant will die. If the water is higher than four inches, the plant will be healthy but the crop will be poor. A&#x301;man paddy requires profuse watering and water accumulation. No mixed crop can be planted with a&#x301;man. At this time the big onion seeds are not ready and small onion cannot be planted as it is too small and will go under water. Thus, no mixed crops should be sown along with a&#x301;man paddy, but pisciculture can be practised.<!-- /block --></p>

In the early boro field, big onions can be transplanted (sprouted chachi piau&#x301; of the preceding period). Big onion is planted with early boro and small sweet onion (sachi piaz) is planted with late boro. Special care should be taken to obtain a big onion type which is a winter crop, as it requires less water. The big onion variety can be planted in the early boro field, but care should be taken that the top of the big onion plant always remains above the water. 60 day green gram (s&#x301;a&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; moog) can also be grown with late boro, as gram does not need much water. The green gram may be grown as a &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo; in the second two months of the transplanted a&#x301;us, field, the second two months of the transplanted early boro field, and the second two months of the transplanted late boro field. If irrigation water is not available after the a&#x301;man crop, instead of the boro crop, a &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo; can be grown.<!-- /block --></p>

If there is a sufficient supply of irrigation water available, only boro and no pigeon crop should be cultivated after the a&#x301;man paddy. Otherwise, the field should be engaged for pulse cultivation. Along with late boro, onion may be transplanted in the same field for three months. Small sweet onion (sachi piaz) takes four to five months to grow and should be cultivated in the nursery for the first one or two months before being transplanted. Onions need water (and are 67% water themselves), so they may also be harvested in the month of Vaesha&#x301;kha along with the late boro. The Sam&#x301;skrta word for onion is &ldquo;sukarkanda,&rdquo; in Hindi it is &ldquo;piaz,&rdquo; and in Bengali, &ldquo;pianz.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Seeds from big onions are used for producing small onion (chachi piaz), and the kalik or onion tubers from small onion are used for producing big onions. If big onions are to be harvested for marketing, then the stalk should be twisted down while it is green and about to flower. If this is done, the onion will attain its maximum size. In mid-Vaesha&#x301;kha, when the boro paddy and onion are to be harvested, harvest the rice. If the stalk of the onion is also cut down at this time it is better. After that, dig out the onion bulbs, then prepare the field for transplantation in mid-Vaesha&#x301;kha for a&#x301;us paddy. And so the cycle continues.<!-- /block --></p>

The prescribed period for sowing wheat is Ka&#x301;rttika, Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a, or up to the 7th of Paos&#x301;, that is, not beyond the 21st of December. Late wheat varieties grow in Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a, Paos&#x301; and Vaesha&#x301;kha. Wheat can be grown together with poppy (ordinary or opium varieties) and mustard. In England, wheat and poppy are commonly sown together. If, in the month of Pha&#x301;lguna, easterly winds blow, the ripening will be delayed. Wheat cannot be transplanted and is a winter crop, a sown crop. For mixed cropping grow lentil, pea, khesa&#x301;ri and poppy (both ordinary and opium) along with it. If these mixed crops occupy 10% of the field, they will not hamper wheat production. Rather, the production may increase because the mixed crops fix nitrogen in the soil.

<a name="209"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=209 type=paragraph -->Wax gourd originated in East India, in the Ganga basin in Saheb Ganj, Maldha, Nadia and Rajmahal.

The Sam&#x301;skrta names for telekocho are &ldquo;bimba&rdquo; and &ldquo;magchi,&rdquo; and in Bhojpuri it is called &ldquo;pilkandi&rdquo;. New varieties of wax gourd may be developed by crossing kundri and telekocho with wax gourd, or wax gourd with bottle gourd.

Betel leaf requires half light and half shade. Wax gourd may be grown in sandy soil like melons, but the sandy alluvial soil is recommended.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="213"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=213 type=paragraph -->When planting wax gourd cuttings, follow the same procedure as watermelons and musk melons. A pit one and a half feet deep should be dug in sandy alluvial soil and filled with a mixture of compost and soil in equal proportions, then the cutting should be planted. The cuttings should be prepared so that each cutting has two intact nodes, one at the base and the other at the top. Each cutting should be planted so that it is slanting with respect to the ground, and the lower node should not be covered by soil. After the wax gourd cutting is planted, it requires shade and proper watering in all seasons for the first five to six days while the new leaves appear. Within 7-15 days, a green sprout will appear on the upper node. After that it does not need much care. The plant starts flowering after one month. In the evenings the flowers bloom all at once at 11:30 p.m. sharp. When the size of the fruit starts becoming small, the old plants should be removed and replaced by new cuttings. Good cuttings are available in Burdwan, Ranaghat, Beldanga, Monghyr, Farakka, Rajmahal and Saheb Ganj.

<a name="278"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=278 type=paragraph -->The pods of this vegetable are shaped like drumsticks, hence the name &ldquo;drumstick&rdquo;. Drumstick is called &ldquo;muun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&rdquo; in the Scythian language, which means &ldquo;that which grows fast&rdquo;. The Scythians came to India just after the Aryans. The non-Brahmins of Maharastra and Madya Pradesh who are short with a dark complexion are of Scythian origin. The Brahmins of Maharastra are tall and have a fair complexion. &ldquo;Muun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&rdquo; is the Scythian word for drumstick, and &ldquo;muun&#x32D;gi&rdquo; is the Scythian word for ants which go on moving continuously.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="279"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=279 type=paragraph -->The bark, juice and oil of drumstick is a good medicine for skin disease. The oil is also good for kidney problems. If drumstick is eaten in spring and winter, people will not contract pox. The stem is beneficial for the gums. Lozenges can be made from the gum of drumstick, like the gum of the babul. The taste of drumstick gum is hot and spicy, so the flavour should be rectified before making lozenges. Drumstick is a suitable host for silk worms. Caterpillars feed on the plant, and when the cocoons have formed, they are to be removed from the tree. Silk thread is spun from the cocoons.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="280"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=280 type=paragraph -->There are two varieties of drumstick: <ol> <li>winter season, and <li>summer season. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="281"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=281 type=paragraph -->The winter season variety flowers in the rainy season. The flowers are white. The stick matures in the month of Vaesha&#x301;kha. If the branches are cut and the green sticks planted as cuttings, they are sure to succeed. The winter season drumsticks are more tasty than the summers season variety, and muun&#x32D;ga&#x301; silk worms like them more. The market value of winter drumsticks is also better.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="282"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=282 type=paragraph -->The summer season variety is also known as the all-season variety. The drumsticks are short, thick and inferior to the winter variety in taste and market value. This variety flowers all year long and the flowers are cream coloured. In Calcutta, it is called &ldquo;najne,&rdquo; in Burdwan, &ldquo;sojne,&rdquo; and the general name is &ldquo;baramasiya sojne&rdquo; or all-season drumstick.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="283"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=283 type=paragraph -->When planting drumstick cuttings, the upper portion should be covered with cow dung and the lower, thicker portion should be placed in the soil. If there is regular rain, there is no need to irrigate the plants. In the dry season the plants should be watered two or three times a day, which should continue until new leaves appear. Watering should be done so that the entire plant gets wet. This will ensure that the plant grows successfully.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="286"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=286 type=paragraph -->Sugar is an important part of the human diet, and for many farmers, sugar crops are an essential source of income. Sugar is also used in the production of alcohol, which has many medicinal and industrial uses. Fermented sugar juice is used to prepare vinegar, and the residual materials from vinegar production are used to make yeast. Sugar foods come in many forms according to the type of sugar crop and the degree to which it is refined. For example, besides refined sugar, there are several forms of liquid and solid molasses (gur), brown sugar or country sugar, sugar syrups, as well as many other types of sugar sweeteners.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="289"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=289 type=paragraph -->There are other sources of sugar which are not very commonly used because they are not commercially viable. For example, fructose or fruit sugar, obtained from fruits such as grapes, and sugar obtained from the red sweet variety of African yam, are good sources of sugar. The sweet root of the African red yam is a staple food for many people in Africa, especially during famine. It has been introduced into India and has many interesting qualities. Research should be done on these and other sugar crops to make them commercially viable. Research should also be done on commercially viable sources of sugar to increase their yield. High yield varieties of sugar crops should always be grown if they are available.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="291"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=291 type=paragraph -->Sugar cane is a member of the grass group. The long canes are simply peeled and chewed to extract the sweet juice. Mechanical methods of extracting the juice are also used. Previously, sugar cane was sown in Ka&#x301;rttika, but now early varieties can be grown in the month of Pha&#x301;lguna. It is preferable if sugar cane is planted in the month of Pha&#x301;lguna. The cuttings must be brought from at least 20 kilometres away or the crop will be prone to pests and disease. Solid molasses or gur may be prepared from sugar cane. Country sugar can also be made, as well as sugar candy. Research should be done on the early varieties of sugar cane, which take five to six months to grow, to see if the cane can be grown in a shorter period of time. Also, sweet varieties of sugar cane should be grown wherever possible. Good varieties are available from Coimbatore, Fiji and Mauritius.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="293"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=293 type=paragraph -->Sugar beet is a root crop. During the last world war, the sugar supply to Germany from Mauritus and India was blocked, so sugar beet was used as a substitute for sugar cane. Elephantum potato (kha&#x301;ma&#x301;lu) and elephant root yam (ol) have more food value than sugar beet, but they take longer to grow.<!-- /block --></p>

Solid molasses (gur), country sugar and half concentrated juice (used as a beverage) can all be prepared from date palm. The Bengal variety of date palm is not good as a food, but it is excellent for producing plant juice from which we can get good quality solid date palm molasses (khejur gur) and date palm sugar (chini). The juice produced on our farming projects should not be used for preparing fermented juice (khejur tadi). Date palm molasses is 125 times more substantial than refined sugar, but for diabetics, refined sugar is more harmful than molasses.<!-- /block --></p>

The planting method should be as follows. First plant one big tree, one medium tree, one big tree, one medium tree, etc. After the medium trees have been planted, start planting small trees in between the big trees &ndash; one big tree, two small trees, one big tree, two small trees, etc. The small trees can also be planted in association with medium trees. Before the trees are planted, deep pits should be dug in the ground and a good amount of compost and some calcium should be put into them. Calcium should be used when planting fruit trees, and especially with sour fruits because it makes the fruit sweet.<!-- /block --></p>

When it is still green, papaya can be cooked as a vegetable, and when it is ripe, it becomes a bright yellow or orange-red fruit. The medicinal qualities of papaya are well-known, and in particular, it is used to make pepsin to treat jaundice. Pepsin is prepared from the leaves of papaya. Latex can also be prepared from papaya, but it should not be extracted from the fruit. To make papaya latex, wait until the green papaya is about to mature, then pluck it from the tree. The latex is obtained from the tree itself after the papaya has been removed. Papaya latex is used medically to cure ulcers, as a liver tonic and to help loosen stiff, rheumatic joints.<!-- /block --></p>

Medicines can also be prepared from dried and dehydrated grapes. Grape sugar (drakshasarkara) can be made from grapes, but it is not presently commercially viable. Seedless grapes are generally grafted, but seeded grapes may or may not be grafted. Raisins (kishmish) can be made from seedless grapes after they have been dehydrated. Seeded raisins (munacca) can be made from seeded grapes after they have been dehydrated. In Bihar, people use seeded raisins as a nutritious sweet (meoya&#x301;) during festivals.

Big onion (bara piaz) is tasteless, but it may be considered pungent if it brings tears to the eyes. Some of the small onions which are sown on the border of the paddy fields should be left for flowering. Seeds will grow from these plants, but once the seeds have formed, the bulb will disappear.

<a name="433"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=433 type=paragraph -->Radish is a 45 to 60 day crop. Its original home was Japan and it first came to India 3,000 years ago. Its food value is less than that of potato, although it is rich in mineral salts and is good for the blood. It is a general purifier. It is not easily digestible, but it helps digestion because it stimulates saliva secretion. It can be eaten raw, cooked, pickled, etc. The leaves of mustard and radish are similar, but all varieties of mustard have yellow flowers while radish has white flowers. The green leaves of radish (mula sha&#x301;k) are a good food, but the green leaves of mustard (sars&#x301;e sha&#x301;k) are not. Where there is a dense growth of radish plants, they should be thinned out. The leafy off-cuts can be eaten as a vegetable (mula sha&#x301;k).<!-- /block --></p>

Gouge a cup-shaped cavity in the pulp and pour water into it. When the water dries up, wash the pulp and refill it with water. After some time, flowers and seeds will grow profusely downwards. Radish seeds should not be sown within a radius of three miles from where they were produced. Seeds should always be brought from outside the locality, otherwise the radish crop will be prone to disease.<!-- /block --></p>
