<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->From the study of history, it is known that the Rgveda was composed outside India, mainly in Central Asia and Russia. The Yajurveda was written mostly outside India; only a portion was written in India. And the Atharvaveda was composed in Afghanistan and India. Those three Vedas &ndash; Rk, Yaju and Atharva &ndash; long afterwards, say about 3500 years ago &ndash; were edited and divided into different branches by Maharshi Krishadvaipayana Vyasa. The oldest compositions were named Rgveda, the intermediate portions were called Yajurveda, and the remaining portions were named Atharvaveda. The last-named Veda was named after the great sage, Atharva, the first author of this Veda. And by compiling the musical compositions of the three Vedas, yet another Veda &ndash; the Sa&#x301;maveda, the fourth Veda &ndash; was created. Sa&#x301;ma in Sanskrit means &ldquo;musical composition&rdquo;. The Sa&#x301;maveda itself is not a Veda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Sada&#x301;shiva was born at a time when the age of the Rgveda was coming to an end and the Yajurvedic Age was about to begin. The people had not yet invented script. In the days of Shiva, the serious disadvantage was that, although the people were acquainted with the science of phonetics, that is, the intonations of the letters, they did not know how to write [[letters]]. The Bra&#x301;hmii and Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;hi scripts were invented some time after Shiva. Thus we can generally say that the Vedas and Tantras exercised their mutual influence over each other, through the invention of script, only at the time of the Atharvaveda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The external form that was given to Tantra by Shiva in His time underwent a slight transformation in subsequent periods. You may raise the question &ndash; well, when the goal is the same, when the path is also the same, then why this transformation? The only cause was: there was no written book in those days. All the compositions &ndash; both Vedas and Tantras &ndash; were handed down orally from one generation to another. As a result, there arose a difference of opinion among the teachers themselves &ndash; one teacher or muni [seer] would say one thing, and another muni would say something else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now although letters were invented during the age of the Atharvaveda, the Vedas could not be written down due to one obstacle &ndash; a peculiar superstition (better to call it a dogma) that the Vedas should not be written down. Maharshi Atharva&#146;s followers &ndash; Aungira&#x301;, Aungirasa, Satyava&#x301;ha, Vaedarbhi, etc. &ndash; tried for the first time to get the Vedas written down in letters, but they were not courageous enough to do so because it was forbidden. (The very name of Vaedarbhi suggests that he was a resident of Vidarbha, and in India, particularly in the Vidarbha area, the Atharvaveda was partly written. Hence it is not proper to assume that the entire Veda was written outside India.) The Vedas were called shruti because they had to be mastered only by hearing: letters had not yet been invented. But once the script was invented, what could be the reason for not writing down the Vedas? The problem was the superstition, and the scholars did not dare to defy the superstition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now the Post-Shiva Tantra that gradually crystallized through the transformation of the original Shiva Tantra had two branches &ndash; the Gaod&#x301;iiya School and the Ka&#x301;shmiirii School. In East India, that is, Bengal, where the Gaod&#x301;iiya School of Tantra was popular, the Vedas had little influence. But in Kashmir, where the Ka&#x301;shmiira branch of Tantra was more dominant, there was the influence of both Tantra and the Vedas. During those days of ascendancy of the Ka&#x301;shmiira branch of Post-Shiva Tantra, the Ka&#x301;shmiira scholars first wrote the Vedas in contemporary Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script; that is, the Vedas were written first in Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script. Later came the age of Buddhism and Jainism; of course Post-Shiva Tantra was running parallel to them. Script had already been invented. The books on Jainism were mostly written in Pra&#x301;krta, in the Bra&#x301;hmii script which was a bit transformed; while the books on Buddhism were written in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, that is, in Pali, in the Bra&#x301;hmii script of that time. But the Post-Shiva Tantra was written in Sanskrit; of course in Bra&#x301;hmii script. So this all proves that the invention of scripts removed a great obstacle on the way. At this time there was a mutual exchange of ideas among Jain Tantra, Buddhist Tantra and Post-Shiva Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When some ideas or schools of thought exist side by side for a long period in a certain country, there is bound to be some sort of mutual exchange, and the result of this type of exchange cannot but be beneficial. It is often found that the result is either good or, at the worst, neither good nor bad. For instance, the Puranic concept of the deity Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a and the Islamic concept of Piirabhakti combined together to give rise to a new concept of Satyapiira in Bengal. Its effect was not bad.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Similarly, those three schools of Tantra &ndash; the Jain, the Buddhist, and the Shivottara [Post-Shiva] &ndash; began to come to an understanding. All three schools broadly accepted the division of Tantra into sixty-four main branches, considering its various expressions. The only difference that persisted was the external one of differences in terminology: each school retained certain specific terms of its own. But they all generally accepted that human life had sixty-four types of expression, and hence there were sixty-four branches of Tantra. In their internal essence, they were not very far from one another; only certain terms &ndash; something external &ndash; were used differently by different Tantras. For instance, the Mu&#x301;la&#x301; Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; Shakti [Fundamental Cognitive Principle] was called Jinaratna or Jinaraana in Jain Tantra &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Bhan&#x301;ai Ka&#x301;hn&#x301;u jina raan bi kaesa&#x301;<br>Ka&#x301;len&#x32D; bob samvohia jaesa&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ndash; whereas in Shiva Tantra, rather in Post-Shiva Tantra, the word Shiva was used, and Buddhist Tantra used the various epithets of Buddha. Thus the sixty-four Tantras were running parallel.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->For each of these sixty-four Tantras, one particular yoginii-tattva was accepted as the presiding deity (a particular controlling deity of a particular branch of Tantra was called a yoginii). All three Tantras accepted this arrangement. And all three, in order to maintain their popularity, used the name of Shiva &ndash; they declared that each Tantric deity was the wife of Shiva. Those of you who have gone to Jabbalpur might have noticed the sixty-four small temples on a hill there dedicated to these sixty-four yoginiis. They are all sixty-four Jain Tantric deities. Similarly, in Buddhist Tantra, particularly in Vajraya&#x301;nii Buddhist Tantra, sixty-four deities were accepted. Shivottara Tantra followed the same practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Interestingly, you will notice how at this stage a silent synthesis was taking place among the different schools. Some of the Jain deities were recognized by Buddhist Tantra (for instance, the Jain deity Ba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii, with a swine&#146;s face, was transformed into Vajraba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii in Vajraya&#x301;nii Buddhist Tantra). Shivottara Tantra gave similar recognition to deities of other Tantras. Conversely, some of the deities of Shivottara Tantra were recognized and accepted by Jain and Buddhist Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->All this proves that the synthesis of these three systems of Tantra charted a new path. This was all made possible by the invention of script. As long as script was unknown or unused, they maintained their distinct separateness; but with the popular use of script, they began to come closer to each other. For example, Ambika&#x301; is an accepted deity of Jain Tantra. But then she also became recognized by Shivottara Tantra &ndash; she was supposed to be a wife of Shiva. (But as you know, these deities cannot be the wives of Sada&#x301;shiva, who is seven thousand years old, whereas these deities are all of comparatively recent origin &ndash; about two thousand years old &ndash; arising after the invention of script.) This Ambika&#x301; Devii has been accepted in a different manner in Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Puranic Shakti Cult], as the goddess Laks&#x301;mii, but actually she is a Jain deity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, there is a town named Kalna where there is still a temple dedicated to the goddess Ambika&#x301;. Once there was a tremendous influence of Jainism in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The town was named Ambika&#x301;-Kalna, after the goddess, and is now called Enbo-Kalna. Another instance: the Buddhist goddess Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; was accepted in Shivottara Tantra, and still later, in the Puranic Shakti Cult. And her changed form was accepted in the Puranic Shakti Cult as the goddess Sarasvatii. The goddess Ka&#x301;lii of Shivottara Tantra was accepted in Buddhist Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Thus there came an age of synthesis. And following this synthesis, these deities were accepted as gods and goddesses in Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Puranic Shiva Cult] and the Puranic Shakti Cult in somewhat changed form. This form underwent slightly more transformation during the middle of the Pathan Age, whose influence still lingers in a minor form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now in the process of synthesis among Jain, Buddhist and Shivottara Tantra, there evolved a new concept, the concept of Dashamaha&#x301;vidya&#x301; [Ten Maha&#x301;vidya&#x301;s], centring around those deities who had general influence in all three systems of Tantra. The idea of Dashamaha&#x301;vidya&#x301; arose out of ten Tantric deities, some from Jain Tantra, some from Buddhist Tantra and some from Shivottara Tantra. These deities, in slightly changed form, were accepted in Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ik Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Puranic Shakti Cult, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u Cult, Shiva Cult and Gan&#x301;apati Cult]. While analysing the history of Dashamaha&#x301;vidya&#x301;, it is interesting to see how the concept of each deity evolved &ndash; how an idea dawned upon the human mind and gradually expanded in the path of synthesis until finally its basic defects demolished its own fundaments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->These Ten Maha&#x301;vidya&#x301;s are Ka&#x301;lii, Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;, S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii, Bhuvaneshvarii, Bhaeravii, Chinnamasta&#x301;, Dhu&#x301;ma&#x301;vatii, Bagala&#x301;mukhii, Ma&#x301;taungii and Kamala&#x301;. These deities are present in all three Tantras. Sometimes their biija mantras are the same, sometimes different. For your proper understanding, let me give you a brief idea about these ten deities.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The first of these deities is Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;. She is one of the controlling deities of Shivottara Tantra, but simultaneously she was accepted in Buddhist Vajraya&#x301;na. I have said a number of times that Shiva was the most influential personality. Therefore an attempt was made to establish some kind of relationship with Him: it was announced that Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; was Shiva&#146;s spouse. But one should remember that Shiva was born five thousand years before the age of Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;; so how could Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; be His wife? Secondly, Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; &ndash; this controlling deity &ndash; is depicted as having four hands. No human structure can have four hands. So Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Shakti &ndash; Ka&#x301;lii &ndash; this deity &ndash; is not Shiva&#146;s wife. She is a Tantric deity belonging to subsequent ages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The second deity is Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;. Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is one of the Tantric deities of Vajraya&#x301;na Tantra. I have said previously that the Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; that was worshipped in India was known as Ugrata&#x301;ra&#x301;, while the deity that was worshipped in China was called Bhra&#x301;marii Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;black as a bumblebee&rdquo; &ndash; and the one who was worshipped in Tibet (Kim&#x301;purus&#x301;avars&#x301;a, as it was known previously) was blue-coloured. So this Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; was later than Buddha, and later yet than Shiva; hence Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; cannot be accepted as the wife of Shiva either. There is not even any similarity in name. Shiva did have one wife whose name was Ka&#x301;lii, so she has at least the similarity in name with Ka&#x301;lii, the deity of Post-Shiva Tantra. But this was not the case with Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;. Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; is purely a deity of the Buddhist Vajraya&#x301;na Tantra. But she is accepted as a deity in Post-Shiva Tantra and the Puranic Shakti Cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Even today, you will come across boys with names such as Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;pada, Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;prasa&#x301;da, etc., and girls with such names as Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;devii. This is the history behind these names.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; has no relation to Shiva. People wrongly believe that she is the wife of Shiva. I shall say something more about Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; later, when I discuss Sarasvatii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Then comes S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii, the third deity. In this connection, let us say something about biija mantra. At the time of Shiva, there was no use of biija mantra in Shiva Tantra. The people loved Shiva so intimately that they did not think it necessary to worship Him with a particular biija mantra. In subsequent periods the use of biija mantra became an accepted practice. In Buddhist Tantra, the acoustic root of Ka&#x301;lii was ram&#x301;: this was also the acoustic root of energy. This biija mantra signifies the application of energy in action. But in Post-Shiva Tantra the biija mantra for the same purpose was changed into riim&#x301;. (Ra, the acoustic root of energy, plus ii suffix, indicating feminine gender, equals riim&#x301;.) This denotes that energy is a female entity. And in still later days, when this deity Ka&#x301;lii was accepted in the Puranic Shakti Cult (the present custom of the worship of the goddess Ka&#x301;lii is derived from the Puranic Shakti Cult), the biija mantra (riim&#x301;) was further changed into klrm&#x301;: Klrm&#x301; Ka&#x301;liika&#x301;yae namah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Generally in the Post-Buddha days, during the period of the Puranic Shakti Cult, all the Buddhist, Jain and Post-Shiva Tantric deities were declared to be the wives of Shiva, otherwise the society would not recognize and worship them. But they have different biija mantras. In the Puranic Age, the commonly-accepted practice was that the controlling deities derived from Post-Shiva Tantra were designated as &ldquo;Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; Shakti&rdquo;, and those derived from Vajraya&#x301;na Buddhism were designated as &ldquo;Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Shakti&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->For instance, Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;: she was known as &ldquo;Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii&rdquo; when worshipped in Buddhist Tantra. When an image was made of her, she would be painted jet-black; her left leg would be placed forward, her right leg behind; and there would be red patches on her left leg. This deity, Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii, was not worshipped inside houses or in villages; she was worshipped in the cremation grounds outside the villages. These days, these deities are called by various names: for instance, Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii, Shmasha&#x301;na Ka&#x301;lii, Raks&#x301;a&#x301; Ka&#x301;lii and Rat&#x301;antii Ka&#x301;lii. These are all deities of the Buddhist Tantra Cult, subsequently declared to be &ldquo;Va&#x301;ma&#x301; Shakti&rdquo;; and the goddesses of Post-Shiva Tantra who are now accepted in the Puranic Cult are called &ldquo;Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; Shakti&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->But the images of Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; Shakti are painted black or blue, or light green, and the right leg is placed in front. They are worshipped mainly at home, or inside the villages. The idea is: we may accept the deities of Buddhist Tantra, but not as family deities or village deities. Some sort of distance must be maintained. But in the case of the Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; Shaktis, there is no such distance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Though both types of deity, daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; and va&#x301;ma&#x301;, were declared to be the wives of Shiva, historically speaking, they had no relationship with Shiva, because all these deities originated at least five thousand years later than Shiva. Not only that, no human structure can have four hands. They have been selected out of the sixty-four schools of Tantra. Basically, they are not human structures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->An old Bengali poem says,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Let us come to S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii of these Ten Maha&#x301;vidya&#x301;s. S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii is also called Shiva&#x301; &ndash; that is, &ldquo;the wife of Shiva, one whose object of meditation is Shiva&rdquo;. S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii, who was originally a deity of Buddhist Vajraya&#x301;na Tantra, was accepted subsequently in Post-Shiva Tantra with a new name, Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii. Later, in the Puranic Sha&#x301;kta Cult, this deity Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii was accepted and worshipped, though she was not very popular among the masses. More recently, towards the end of the Mughal period and the beginning of the British period, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;acandra, the king of Nadia, introduced the worship of Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii, in a slightly changed form and with a new name &ndash; Jagaddha&#x301;trii. Thus Jagaddha&#x301;trii is essentially a Buddhist Tantric deity transformed from S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii. (You should note carefully that the worship of Jagaddha&#x301;trii was especially popular in Krishnanagar. It is comparatively recent in origin, as it started in the early part of British history.) Just as S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii in Buddhist Tantra was conceived to be the wife of Shiva, Ra&#x301;jara&#x301;jeshvarii and Jagaddha&#x301;trii were also declared to be Shiva&#146;s wives. But how can they be the wives of Shiva, who lived seven thousand years ago?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->It may be a bit irrelevant to mention here, but the fact is that the worship of Jagaddha&#x301;trii is carried out in both Krishnanagar and Chandannagar with great pomp and pageantry. An inhabitant of Chandannagar &ndash; possibly his name was Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; Govinda Bandyopa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya &ndash; was the Dewan, the Prime Minister, of Nadia. Following the example of Krishnanagar he introduced the worship of Jagaddha&#x301;trii in Chandannagar also. In art, grandeur, pomp and pageantry, Chandannagar lags behind Krishnanagar. But Chandannagar can claim supremacy in one special area: there the Jagaddha&#x301;trii idols are of gigantic size.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Anyway, these deities, which originated in the days of medieval Jain Tantra, Buddhist Tantra and Post-Shiva Tantra, were not the wives of Shiva. Some had four hands, some had eight hands, etc., so they were not representations of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->In this connection, one more question may arise. People say that Ramchandra, the king of Ayodhya&#x301;, was the first to worship the goddess Durga&#x301;: you may have also heard such a story.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Let us discuss this topic. But obviously, before that, we have to say something about the epic Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. The story of the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a was handed down orally from generation to generation in India, Malaysia and Indonesia, for many thousands of years, not only two thousand or four thousand years. But the story was first written down in the form of a book by Maharshi Valmiki, and that too long after the age of Shiva, even after the age of Buddha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->We have two proofs on hand to substantiate this point: First, that the antiquity of a certain book is proven by its language. If the language is old, the book is also old; if the language is modern, the book is also modern. The language of the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a by Valmiki is not at all old; rather it is very simple Sanskrit, the type of simple Sanskrit in which the scriptures of Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na Buddhism were written down. The second proof is, the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a by Valmiki contains some allegations against Buddha. In the book, Buddha has been castigated for his atheism; he has been branded as an atheist, as a thief and as a hypocrite. This proves conclusively that the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a was composed after Buddha; otherwise how could Buddha be criticized in the book? All these castigations are to be found in the &ldquo;Ayodhya&#x301; Ka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&rdquo; of the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Let us say a little more about this. So far as the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata is concerned, it did not come down orally from ancient days. The event of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata took place some 3500 years ago, in the days of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, and it was written down at the same time or a little later. In the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata also, there are some references to the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. These are not references to the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a of Valmiki, but to the oral story of the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a prevalent in those days. In any case, in those days when the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a was composed by Valmiki, the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a was not in existence. The Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a contains references to the goddess Durga&#x301;. This Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a was composed in the Puranic Age, when the Shakti Cult was developing. The goddess Durga&#x301; of those days is described in one place as eight-handed, and in another place as ten-handed; but final recognition was given to the ten-handed goddess.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->These are all imaginary creations of the authors of the Puranas [mythological stories]. At the time when the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a was being composed by Valmiki, the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a was not in existence, hence the story of the goddess Durga&#x301; was not known to the people. So the stories in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a that Rama was worshipping the goddess Durga&#x301; with one hundred and eight blue lotuses, and that the goddess stole one of them, were unknown to the people. Valmiki&#146;s Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a contains no reference to these stories.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Then came the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, on the basis of which the Shrii Shrii Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii was composed. You should know that during the days of the Puranic Shakti Cult, the primeval stage of the Operative Principle was known as A&#x301;dya&#x301; Shakti, and this A&#x301;dya&#x301; Shakti at Her fiercest was called Can&#x301;d&#x301;a Shakti or Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii. In the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a also, whose abridged form was the Shrii Shrii Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii, which contained stories of the goddess Durga&#x301;, King Surath, etc., there are no references to Rama; there is no story that Ramchandra performed the worship of the goddess.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Now, many of you are aware of the fact that Ramchandra was not an historical figure, but a fictional one: he was an imaginary character to represent an ideal king. Mahars&#x301;i Valmiki was the first person to give proper expression to that character. But the poet Tulsidas tried still harder, in the Mughal period, not very long ago, to accomplish this through the Ra&#x301;macaritama&#x301;nasa, written in the Avadhii language. The Ra&#x301;macaritama&#x301;nasa is not the complete Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Tulsidas described the character of Rama as he thought Rama should be; he delineated the character of Rama as he conceived of Rama in his own mind. Tulsidas was a truthful person. He did not name his book the Tulasiida&#x301;sii Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, he named it Ra&#x301;macaritama&#x301;nasa [&ldquo;The Life of Rama As Conceived by Tulsidas&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->In this book also, there is no mention of the goddess Durga&#x301; being worshipped by Rama. Then where does it occur that Rama worshipped the goddess Durga&#x301;? In the early part of the Pathan period, there ruled a king at Taherpur in the district of Rajshahii in the Varendrabhu&#x301;mi (the present north Bengal). His name was Kam&#x301;sana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a Ra&#x301;y. That King Kam&#x301;sana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a had enormous wealth &ndash; a vast zamindary, or estate. He called the Brahman pandits of the zamindary and expressed his desire to perform either Ra&#x301;jasu&#x301;ya or Ashvamedha Yajin&#x32D;a.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ldquo;Let the people know that I possess abundant wealth. I shall donate liberally to charity during the ceremony.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->On hearing this, the pandits observed, &ldquo;O noble sir, this is Kali Yuga, when you cannot perform Ashvamedha or Ra&#x301;jasu&#x301;ya Yajin&#x32D;a. Instead, you can make liberal expenditures on the occasion of the worship of Durga&#x301; as depicted in the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya; you can then organize great pomp and show. So please hold Durga&#x301; Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; according to the description given in the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Then King Kam&#x301;sana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a first introduced the custom of the worship of Durga&#x301; by spending 700,000 gold coins (millions of rupees). So you understand that the practice of the worship of Durga&#x301; is not at all an old practice; it started only in the early part of the Pathan period of history.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Now following King Kam&#x301;sana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a&#146;s example, Raja&#x301; Jagadvallabha (some say &ldquo;Jagatna&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a&rdquo;), of Ekt&#x301;a&#x301;kiya&#x301;, perhaps in Rangpur District of Bangladesh, performed the worship of Durga&#x301; with still greater pomp and show by spending 850,000 gold coins; and following their examples, other landowners also thought, &ldquo;Are we inferior to them? We can also be big spenders!&rdquo; So they too started worshipping the goddess Durga&#x301; with pomp and grandeur. Thus the worship of Durga&#x301; became a general practice in every great landowner&#146;s house, and the number of people performing the worship increased. But the worship was always held within a family setting.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->At that time some twelve friends in a village called Guptipara or Guptavrnda&#x301;van at Bala&#x301;garh Police Station in Hooghly District thought, &ldquo;Maybe we are not able to perform the worship individually, but we can collectively organize the pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [worship].&rdquo; In the Urdu language, a friend is called iya&#x301;r; thus the worship organized by twelve friends [in Bengali, &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; is ba&#x301;ro] is ba&#x301;ro + iya&#x301;rii = ba&#x301;roya&#x301;rii pu&#x301;ja&#x301;. Previously it had been held in a family setting, but now it became collective. Since in Ba&#x301;roya&#x301;rii Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [Collective Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;], low-caste people are denied the privilege of offering ain&#x32D;jali, Ba&#x301;roya&#x301;rii Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; was transformed, in very recent times, into Sa&#x301;rvjaniin Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [Everyone&#146;s Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;], so that everyone could take part in it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->In any case, this Durga&#x301; Pu&#x301;ja&#x301; was an event of the early period of the Pathan rule. Later the poet Krttiva&#x301;sa Tha&#x301;kur composed the Bengali Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. At that time King Hussain Shah was the Nawab of Bengal. He was a great patron of learning, and he was very keen to have good books written in original Bengali or translated from the Sanskrit language. At his request, the poet Krttiva&#x301;sa translated the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a from Sanskrit to Bengali. The worship of Durga&#x301; had already become a general practice in the houses of landlords in Bengal; so in order to lend greater credence to the worship of Durga&#x301;, he mentioned in his book the Bengali Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, this incident of Rama worshipping the goddess Durga&#x301;. It was not an historical fact, nor was it a very old event: it was merely an event of the Pathan period. Thus the Bengali Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, composed by Krttiva&#x301;sa, was the source of the information that Rama worshipped the goddess Durga&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Later on I will say a little more about the periods of Jain Tantra, Buddhist Tantra, Post-Shiva Tantra and the Puranas, which were prevalent about 1300 years ago, and on whose basis evolved the Puranic Shakti Cult, Shiva Cult, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u Cult, Gan&#x301;apati Cult and Su&#x301;rya Cult.<!-- /block --></p>
