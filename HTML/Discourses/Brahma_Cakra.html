<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Now, the subject of our discourse will be &ldquo;Brahma Cakra&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Everywhere in this observable universe we find that there is a system. The mighty Himalayas follow a particular system. The wee bit of material expression also follows a particular system. Everywhere there is a system, there is an order. Nothing can be done in a disordered way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The smallest article that can be seen by the human intellect, if not by human eyes, is the atom. And in the atom also there is a particular system, the atomic system, and the centre, that is, the nucleus, has electrons moving round that nucleus. This is the atomic system. These systems are called cakras in Sanskrit. So for this atomic system the Sanskrit name should be pa&#x301;rama&#x301;n&#x301;avik cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The same system is followed by the earth also. Here in this ethereal system we see that in the middle is the earth, and the moon is moving around that nucleus. It is the same system. This one may be called pa&#x301;rthiva cakra. That one pa&#x301;rama&#x301;n&#x301;avik cakra, this one pa&#x301;rthiva cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now the next bigger cakra or bigger system is the solar system, and that is: the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving round that sun. The same system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->And the biggest cakra, the biggest system, is Brahma Cakra, the Cosmological system. In that Cosmological system, the nucleus is Purus&#x301;ottama. The hub of that Cosmic [[wheel]] is Purus&#x301;ottama, and so many jiivas [unit beings] are moving around that Purus&#x301;ottama. The same system. So this Cosmological system, or this Cosmological order, is called Brahma Cakra in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now in this cakra or in these cakras two forces are working: one is the eccentric force and the other is the concentric force. For this eccentric force, or centrifugal force, the Sanskrit term is Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or avidya&#x301; shakti; and the concentric force, or centripetal force, is called Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or vidya&#x301; shakti in Sanskrit. Both are Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Both concentric and eccentric, vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301;, are expressions of the same Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the same Creative Principle. And that Nucleus is the lord of that Creative Principle, is the sva&#x301;mii of that Creative Principle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now this avidya&#x301; shakti, or Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, centrifugal force, has got a two-fold expression, two different expressions. One is called viks&#x301;epa shakti and the other is called a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has got two expressions. And jiivas are moving around this Nucleus Purus&#x301;ottama with the help of these two forces (&ldquo;two forces&rdquo; means Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;), and when a balance is there, a balance between Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the radius of that jiiva&#146;s circle, the circle of that particular jiiva, will neither increase nor decrease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, the first portion of avidya&#x301; shakti is called viks&#x301;epa shakti in Sanskrit. Viks&#x301;epa means a repulsive force, the force repelling the jiiva from its Nucleus. That is, a jiiva is darted away, is drifted away, from its Nucleus by<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> propensities, by depraving ideas, by depraving propensities. So these depraving ideas or depraving propensities are what is called viks&#x301;epa shakti. Clear? The jiiva is darted away from Purus&#x301;ottama by mundane propensities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And the second expression of avidya&#x301; shakti is a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. In Sanskrit a&#x301;varan&#x301;a means &ldquo;to cover&rdquo;. This shakti [force] is just like a black curtain in between Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; and jiiva. And because of that a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti, that dark curtain of a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti, that sombre curtain of a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti, jiivas cannot see the Lord. Jiivas think that &ldquo;Whatever we are doing, nobody sees, nobody can see&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I am doing everything secretly, nobody will see me.&rdquo; The condition of a jiiva committing pa&#x301;pa [sin] secretly is just like that of a rabbit when followed by a hunter. It is said that when a rabbit, a hare, is followed by a hunter, it shuts its eyes with the help of its ears. And it thinks that &ldquo;As I am not seeing the hunter, the hunter is also not seeing me.&rdquo; And such is the condition of the jiiva under the influence of this a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. Due to viks&#x301;epa shakti it moves away from its Lord, and due to a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti it cannot see its Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->That misguided and misdirected jiiva does not know that it is under the influence of a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. But the vision of his Lord remains unassailed by the cimmerian wonts of that a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. His vision can pierce through that black curtain. The jiiva committing misdeeds, committing sins, secretly, thinks that its action will remain covered forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->These are the two expressions of avidya&#x301; shakti: viks&#x301;epa shakti and a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now regarding the vidya&#x301; shakti, the concentric force, the centripetal force, the force moving towards the hub of the wave: A man following the path of vidya&#x301; shakti naturally will be decreasing the length of his radius, the radius of this Brahma Cakra. The radius will go on decreasing in length. But this vidya&#x301; shakti has also got two influences on the minds of individuals, on microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Of these two expressions, the first one is called samvit shakti. Samvit means spiritual consciousness, spiritual awakening. A man engaged in bad things all of a sudden feels that &ldquo;No, I shouldn&#146;t do all these things. No, I should be a good man henceforward.&rdquo; Such an idea all of a sudden comes in his mind. And this thing, this change of mental tendency, is brought about by samvit shakti of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Do you follow? This is what is called samvit shakti. &ldquo;No, henceforward I must be a good man. No, henceforward I must be a spiritualist. I must not encourage any depraving idea.&rdquo; Samvit shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->And the second expression of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is hla&#x301;dinii shakti. After a man decides that &ldquo;Henceforward I will be a good man, henceforward I will be a sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual practitioner],&rdquo; he gets the krpa&#x301; of that Almighty Lord. (Regarding krpa&#x301; I will say something afterwards.) And after getting His krpa&#x301; through some medium he gets initiation. After being initiated he is to move along that spiritual path. That movement along the spiritual path is brought about by hla&#x301;dinii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->This hla&#x301;dinii shakti is also known as Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti in Sanskrit. &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo; means spiritual aspirant, &ldquo;one who is engaged in a&#x301;ra&#x301;dhana&#x301;&rdquo;. One who is engaged in a&#x301;ra&#x301;dhana&#x301; is called &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo; in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava [Vaishnavite] philosophy. And Purus&#x301;ottama is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; moving towards Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. So that hla&#x301;dinii shakti is called Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti. Clear?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now in a particular shloka [couplet] it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe brhante tasmin ham&#x301;so bhra&#x301;myate Brahmacakre;<br>Prthaga&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; prerita&#x301;rain&#x32D;ca matva&#x301; jus&#x301;t&#x301;astataste-na&#x301;mrtatvameti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[All unit entities, all unit structures, revolve around the Nucleus Consciousness in the Cosmic Cycle of creation. This rotation of theirs will continue as long as they think that they are separate from their Creator. When they become one with the Nucleus, they will attain immortality.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;jiiva. A&#x301;jiiva means &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;. Here a&#x301;jiiva means &ldquo;mental occupation&rdquo;, &ldquo;mental objectivity&rdquo;, &ldquo;mental pabulum&rdquo;. Now in this Brahma Cakra, around this Nucleus Purus&#x301;ottama or Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, all the jiivas are moving; they are hovering around that Purus&#x301;ottama along with their peculiar physical frames and their peculiar mental objectivities, along with their peculiar mental longings &ndash; they are hovering around that Purus&#x301;ottama. Each and every creature is moving like this. Their radii are neither increasing nor diminishing. If a man encourages Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; the radius will be diminished; if a man encourages Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; it will be enlarged, it will be increased.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe &ndash; &ldquo;With different structures and with different mental longings&rdquo;, so many creatures are hovering around that Purus&#x301;ottama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Tasmin ham&#x301;so bhra&#x301;myate Brahmacakre. Ham&#x301;so means jiiva. And Prthaga&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; prerita&#x301;rain&#x32D;ca matva&#x301; [&ldquo;This rotation of theirs will continue as long as they think that they are separate from their Creator&rdquo;]. Why do they hover round that Purus&#x301;ottama? Because in their minds there is a sense of separateness, sense of separation, from their Cosmic Lord. They think that they are separate entities from Purus&#x301;ottama. They do not feel their unison with Purus&#x301;ottama, that&#146;s why they hover round that Nucleus. And when they come to think that they are not separate entities from that Hub of the wheel,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> all of a sudden that radius will cease to exist, and with the help of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; the merger will take place. And that merger is the unison of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->So, Prthaga&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; prerita&#x301;rain&#x32D;ca matva&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;They feel that they are separate entities from that Hub, and that&#146;s why they are hovering round.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Jus&#x301;t&#x301;astatastena&#x301;mrtatvameti [&ldquo;When they become one with the Nucleus, they will attain immortality&rdquo;]. Just now I said that by His krpa&#x301;, that samvit shakti<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is awakened. Now, what is krpa&#x301;? Here the rs&#x301;i [sage who composed the shloka] says that &ldquo;being benefited by Him, he becomes one with his Nucleus&rdquo; &ndash; the merger takes place, and he attains immortality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Mortality and immortality. This movement round that Nucleus takes place within the three fundamental factors of relativity. And those three fundamental factors are the spatial factor, the temporal factor and the personal factor. There are three fundamental factors in the sway of relativity, in the realm of relativity. And these three fundamental factors are time, space and person. Temporal bondage, spatial bondage and personal bondage. Jiivas move through the realm of these three factors. And this movement naturally brings about certain changes in their body and mind; and this change, this transmutation, this metamorphosis, is called death, is called ma&#x301;ran&#x301;a. What is ma&#x301;ran&#x301;a, what is death? Death means change. Death is nothing but change. From childhood, boyhood came &ndash; childhood died; from boyhood, adolescence came &ndash; boyhood died&#8230; So death means change. Death is nothing but change. When an old man dies and a babe is born, it is also a change. But where the link between the preceding stage and the succeeding stage is missing, we say it is physical death. Because in that case, that is, when an old man dies and a new babe takes a place and sits in a mother&#146;s womb, we cannot find the link. And that&#146;s why we say, &ldquo;That old man has died.&rdquo; This is also an ordinary change. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->But where there is no movement, we say those items moving round that Nucleus are passing through the realm of time, space and person; but the Nucleus doesn&#146;t pass through time, space and person. It is above the realm of time, space and person. It controls time, space and person. And that&#146;s why it undergoes no metamorphosis, it undergoes no transmutation. That&#146;s why it is beyond the pale of life and death. It is beyond the periphery of life and death. It is beyond the compass of woes and agonies. And that&#146;s why when one is ensconced in that supreme centre, one establishes oneself beyond life and death. One is established in amrtatva, one is established in immortality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Now, in the shloka it has been said, &ldquo;Being benefited by You&rdquo;. That is, &ldquo;After getting His krpa&#x301;.&rdquo; What is krpa&#x301;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->God cannot have any partiality in Him. He has got equal love for each and every creature of this universe, for all animate and inanimate objects. His krpa&#x301; and His compassion is being equally showered upon each and every individual, upon each and every object. He bestows His compassion equally on each and every object. Equally on pa&#x301;piis [sinners] and pun&#x301;yava&#x301;nas [the virtuous]. But common people do not feel it, they do not feel that they are getting His krpa&#x301;. Why do they not feel it? That krpa&#x301;, that water of compassion, is being showered on each and every creature equally, but ordinary people do not feel that they are being drenched by those sacred waters. Why? Because they are holding the umbrella of vanity over their heads, that&#146;s why they are not being drenched. And what is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? You will have to remove that umbrella from above your head and get yourself drenched by the sacred water. You will have to remove that umbrella of vanity, you will have to remove that umbrella of hatred, you will have to remove that umbrella of shyness and get yourself drenched by that water; and then you will feel that you are being graced by Him. This is what is called krpa&#x301;. Krpa&#x301; is there, but you will have to come to feel it by your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And when you will remove that umbrella, you will get proper direction, and then you will be guided by hla&#x301;dinii shakti, by Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti. Here you will come in contact with His nu&#x301;pura dhvani [sound of ankle bells], you will come in contact with the enchanting flute of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->What is that flute? The on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. In the first phase, the sa&#x301;dhaka comes in contact with a hissing sound, just like the sound produced by that insect known as cricket in English. Yes. And in the second stage it is called nu&#x301;pura dhvani &ndash; a jhum jhum jhum jhum jhum jhum jhum jhum sound &ndash; like this. It is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asya nu&#x301;pura dhvani. In the third stage it is just like the sound of a flute, and it is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asya ba&#x301;nsharii dhvani, muralii dhvani. You will hear these sounds both internally and externally. In the course of your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you will come in contact with these sounds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->So Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;, that is, the sa&#x301;dhaka, became mad when she came in contact with that soothing sound of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s flute. She became mad. And that madness, that spiritual madness, is begotten of what? Hla&#x301;dinii shakti. And by that shakti, Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a became united. Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; came in unison with that Cosmic Purus&#x301;ottama &ndash; with that Purus&#x301;ottama who is the hub of this Brahma Cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
