<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><I>Ku</I> and <I>ku&#x301;</I> are of quite antithetical in nature. In most words we get the use of <I>ku</I> only. <I></I>The use of the verbal root <I>ku&#x301;</I> is very limited. In Bengali most of the words with the prefix <I>ku</I> are with the short vowel; the use of long <I>u&#x301;</I> is very rare. In semantic terms the <I></I>word <I>ku</I> has a very wide range of meanings; in contrast, the arena of meaning of the verbal root <I>ku&#x301;</I> is very limited. <ol> <li>One meaning of <I>ku</I> is grimacing, which the monkeys and vixens do, for example.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><li>The verbal root <I>ku</I> is also used to mean mimicking the calls of different animals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><li>The verbal root <I>ku</I> can also be used to express a feeling without saying a word. For example, suppose someone brings a glass of sherbet in winter. Instead of telling him &ldquo;No, don&#146;t give me the sherbet&rdquo;, you simply say, <I>un&#x32D;-un&#x32D;-un&#x32D;-un&#x32D;</I>. This nonverbal sound will clearly indicate that you do not want the sherbet. Thus, the verbal root <I>ku</I> can be used for the articulation of such sounds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><li>The verbal root <I>ku</I> can also be used for the sound &ndash; <I>un&#x32D; &#133; un&#x32D;</I> &ndash; which we call groaning, that is, <I>goun&#x32D;ga&#x301;ni</I> in Bengali, that a sick man or an afflicted person makes in pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li>The verbal root <I>ku</I> can also be used to mean the humming of a bee or the buzzing of a bumble bee. The fact of the matter is that neither does a bee hum nor does a bumble bee buzz. These are actually the sounds of flying. The verbal root <I>ku</I> has some functional uses. But more in use is the form <I>kavate</I> [[(the verbal root <I>ku + lat&#x301;</i> [present tense] <i>te</I>.)]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><li>The verbal root <I>ku</I> is also used, more or less, in the sense of moving or making something move in the quinquelemental [physical] or mental level through a systaltic path, and also in the sense of diminution or belittling. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->We get the word <I>ku</I> by adding the suffix <I>kvip</I> to the verbal root <I>ku</I>. In most cases the word is used in feminine gender. The etymological meaning of the word <I>ku</I> is &ldquo;mundane manifestation&rdquo;. As the expression of the mind is called thought, similarly any mundane expression is called <I>ku</I>. In common usage <I>ku</I> means <I></I>many things. <ol> <li><I>Ku</I> is the result of the descent of the psychic entity, as it is metamorphosed into the solid factor through different stages of crudification. In other words, <I>ku</I> refers to each entity of the stellar world. All the luminaries &ndash; nebulae, stars, planets, satellites, meteors and comets &ndash; all belong to the category of <I>ku</I>. This earth, so close to us, is also <I>ku</I>. The word <I>ku</I> is an integral part of the various names of the earth.<!-- /block --></p>

When he speaks, one feels as if he is disgorging venom. He quarrels with me day and night.&rdquo; Inherent meaning is: &ldquo;For the welfare of the world, for the benefit of the denizens of the earth, my husband has been constantly advising all beings. He is so busy with different manifestations; he has to use his mouth for so many varied utterances that he has to have as many as five mouths (<I>iisha&#x301;na, daks&#x301;ineshvara, ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni, va&#x301;madeva</I> and <I>kalyan&#x301;asundara</I>)&rdquo;<I></I>.<!-- /block --></p>

In this state, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> or <I>Parama Shiva</I> is known as <I>Ardhana&#x301;riishvara</I>.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ldquo;He remains with me (with Annapurna) in every form as a copulative compound.&rdquo; Hara and Gauri in the copulative compound form becomes HaraGauri, that is, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> and<I>Parama&#x301; Prakrti</I> are <I></I>united in an inalienable concomitance at the sweet will of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.The above quoted lines are from Raygunakar Bharatchandra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><p><I>Ku</I> means inanimate expression, the earth or &#133; physical expression. We get the word <I>kula</I> from <I>ku</I>; <I></I>that is, we get the word <I>kula</I> when we add the suffix <I>d&#x301;a</I> to the verbal root <I>la</I> in connection with <I>ku</I>. Etymologically <I>kula</I> means that which holds the mundane expression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><li>In common usage, it means different modes of physical action. The physical expression of a creature expands through its progeny. So <I>kula</I> means &ldquo;genealogy&rdquo;. In this case, the <I>la</I> is at the initial position of the verbal root <I>la</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><p>So <I>la</I> (here in the sense of the holder) will continue to occupy the position of the intial <I>la</I>. For the same reason, the word <I>kula</I> must be spelt with the initial <I>la</I> and not with end-<I>la</I>. That is, it will be <I>kula</I> and not <I>kula</I> [<I>Kulra</I> with end-<I>la</I>]<I></I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><p>The same initial <I>la</I> will also be used in the spelling of our familiar fruit, <I>kula</I> (<I>bar&#x301;ai &ndash;</I> the jujube). The end-<I>la</I> can only be used in those Bengali words that retain the form of Sanskrit words or Sanskrit derived words but not in the case of indigenous words or foreign words. The word <I>kula</I> that we use for a special kind of fruit [jujube] is an indigenous Bengali word. So in its spelling, the initial <I>la</I> is used. But the word <I>bar&#x301;ai</I> is not indigenous. It is derived from Sanskrit, <I>badarii</I> (<I>badarii&gt;baarii&gt;baiira</I>)<I>. Baiira/ bera/ bor&#x301;ai /bor /bogr&#x301;ii &ndash;</I> all derived from one single source &ndash; <I>badarii</I>. So you understand that the spelling of the word <I>kula</I> is the same, whether it means genealogy or jujube. And you also realize that the word <I>kula</I>, which means genealogy, is derived from the word <I>ku.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><p>Kula</I> or jujube [<I>Zizyphus mauritiana</I>] grows equally well both in the equatorial zone and the tropics. In fact, it grows everywhere except in extremely cold places. So much so that the jujube tree grows even in the snow-covered regions of the Himalayas and bears fruit after the disappearance of snow. There are different kinds of jujube in different countries. The largest jujubes are available in places where the climate is warm, rainfall is little, and the soil is mixed with sand. That is why in India the large-sized jujubes of high quality are available in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and in the vicinity of Agra in Uttar Pradesh. The jujubes of Allahabad and Kashii are not bad. In Bengal there is good rainfall. So in Bengal, although there is a good jujube crop, its size or quality is not of high standard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><p>The same condition is also applicable in the case of prickly trees. The place that is congenial for the good growth of jujubes is also congenial for the good growth of date palms. And like the jujube, in Bengal there is substantial date palm production but not of high quality. Even if high quality seeds of date palm are sown in Bengal, the tree growth will be good, the juice will also be very sweet, but the quality will not be good. The date palms grown in Bengal are all seed and skin, and practically without any kernel. So you understand that, like the jujube tree, the date palm tree is also a prickly plant. That is why there is similarity in the nature and behaviour of the jujube<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and the date palm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><p>Generally trees with thorns send their roots deep into the subterranean soil, and from deep down they draw their sustenance. That is why most plants that grow in the desert are thorny. The screw pine trees <I>(Pandanus)</I> are also thorny. So their growth in the desert area is not that bad. Even in countries with heavy rainfall, they prefer sandy riparian soil. Even in the desert region of Gujarat I have observed the luscious growth of cacti. There are different varieties of jujube &ndash; some are very sweet and some very sour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph --><p>The spring season is the natural time for the ripening of the jujube. As in Southeast Asia, no other fruit is easily available at that time, the jujubes enjoy a seasonal demand during this period. Probably that demand is also likely to continue. Jujube helps in digestion (dried jujube is more effective than a fresh one). Pickle made from jujube causes the secretion of saliva and therefore acts as an appetizer. Jujubes in small quantity are good for the pancreas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><p>Jujube leaves are medicine for severe kinds of pox and measles (when a patient suffers from smallpox, the suppressed pox under the skin causes severe pain on the body, and the patient dies in excruciating agony). The wood of the jujube tree is very good for sports equipment. Jujube wood is also used in making fire works. In different countries jujube grows in different seasons (some in summer and others in autumn). Moreover, there are twenty seven different subspecies of jujube with radically different characteristics and shapes. In eastern India we are generally familiar with three main varieties of jujube: 1) large, longish and tasty jujube of Kashii or the coconut-jujubes; 2) round; very sour when green and sweet-sour when ripe &#133; <I>t&#x301;opa&#x301;kul</I>; and 3) wild jujube or <I>shiya&#x301;kul</I> [<I>Zigyplus oenoplia</I>, the berry grown on a wild thorny plant] carelessly grown in the wilderness. As a jackal is very fond of <I>jambu</I> [rose apple], so the word <I>jambu</I> or <I>jambuka</I> refers to both a jackal and a <I>jambu</I>. Similarly, since jujube is a favourite fruit of jackals, it is also called by another name of jackal, that is, <I>ba&#x301;dara</I> (<I>not ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dara or bandara</I>). A type of non-mulberry insect is reared in the jujube tree. That is why such a plant has specific commercial value. I have personally seen lac insects reared in the jujube trees in Manbhum or Murshidabad district of Bengal. I have seen this in Thailand also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><p>The <I>kula</I> in the compound word <I>kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii</I> (coiled serpentine) comes from the word <I>ku</I>. According to <I>Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;natantra</I>, the last bone at the bottom of the spine carries the weight of the entire upper portion of the spine. This bottom piece of bone is therefore called <I>kula</I>, that is, the <I>la</I> that holds <I>ku</I> or the solid factor. According to Tantra, the sleeping divinity is lying in this <I>kula</I> in the shape of a coiled serpentine. This seed that holds the solid factor is called <I>la</I>; in other words, <I>la</I> is the acoustic root of the solid factor. This coiled serpentine moves upward through <I>mantrabodha</I>, <I>mantra&#x301;gha&#x301;ta</I>, <I>mantracaetanya</I> [ideation of mantra, <I>ma&#x301;ntrika</I> striking or stirring of the <I>kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii</I>, <I>ma&#x301;ntrika</I> consciousness], with the help of the acoustic sound <I>hum&#x301;</I>, and unite with <I>Parama Shiva</I> seated on the thousand petalled lotus in <I>Sahasra&#x301;ra cakra</I>. This is the highest form of meditation. This elevation of the coiled serpentine is called <I>kulasa&#x301;dhana&#x301;</I>. One who performs this spiritual practice becomes famous as <I>kulasa&#x301;dhaka</I> or <I>kaola</I> (<I>kula + an&#x301;)</I>. This process or path of Tantra sadhana is known as <I>kula&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</I>. Lord Shiva, the founder of this Tantra, is therefore called <I>maha&#x301;kaola</I> or <I>a&#x301;di kaola</I> [the pioneer <I>kaola</I>]. And the guru who teaches this sadhana is known as <I>kulaguru</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph --><p>Nowadays many people understand the term <I>kulaguru</I> to mean &ldquo;family preceptor&rdquo;. No, <I>kuluguru</I> is one who is well experienced in <I>kulasa&#x301;dhana&#x301;</I> &ndash; who is <I>siddha</I>, that is, an expert in this discipline, and who is competent to teach the process of this <I>kulasa&#x301;dhana&#x301;</I>. <I>Svastyayan</I> or benedictory ceremony is a part of <I>sha&#x301;ntikarma</I> of Vidya&#x301; Tantra. The part of this benedictory ceremony that is known as <I>purascaran&#x301;a</I> is also the process of raising the coiled serpentine. According to Tantra, <I>purascaran&#x301;a</I> is a necessary part of this [process]. There is no difference in the rituals of Shaeva, Sha&#x301;kta, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava, Saora, and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya <I></I>Tantras. What is <I>kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii</I> in Shaeva Tantra, whose goal is <I>Parama Shiva</I>, is called Maha&#x301;ka&#x301;lii in Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, and its final aim is termed as <I>Maha&#x301;ka&#x301;la</I> or <I>Maha&#x301;kaola</I> or <I>Naira&#x301;tmashakti</I>. And in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava philosophy, the two are termed as Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Purus&#x301;ottama Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. However, in whatever way the raising of coiled serpentine or <I>purascaran&#x301;a</I> is done, <I>kulashakti</I> will always remain at the bottom in the solid factor (holder of <I>kula</I> whose acoustic root is <I>lam&#x301;</I> and which is the base of physical existence). This is the base or <I>a&#x301;dha&#x301;rshila&#x301;&ndash;</I>that is why it is also called <I>mula&#x301;dha&#x301;ra</I>. Its goal is also that Supreme Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><p>This raising of the <I>kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii</I> is the struggle of consciousness against crudity. Piercing through the dense darkness of crudity, consciousness rushes on towards its Supreme fulfilment. It is a struggle &#133; a severe struggle. The acoustic root of struggle is <I>hum&#x301;</I> (we say <I>ran&#x301;ahum&#x301;ka&#x301;r</I>, i.e., war cry). The seed of <I>kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii</I> is also <I>hum&#x301;</I>, because it is in the raising of <I>kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii</I> by its tail that the <I>sumum bonum</I> of human life lies hidden.<!-- /block --></p>

The word <I>pa&#x301;pa</I> is used both in the general sense and the specific sense. In the general sense, <I>pa&#x301;pa</I> means <I>pa&#x301;taka</I>. <I>Pa&#x301;taka</I> means offence against Dharma. <I></I>This <I>pa&#x301;taka</I> has two branches &ndash; one branch is known as <I>pa&#x301;pa</I>. To do what one should not do is <I>pa&#x301;pa</I>, and not to do what one should do is called <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I>. Both <I>pa&#x301;pa</I> and <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I> are undesirable. But the sages and ascetics of ancient times used to say that <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I> is more detestable than <I>pa&#x301;pa</I>. There are three different degrees of <I>pa&#x301;taka &ndash;</I> 1) <I>pa&#x301;taka</I>, 2) <I>atipa&#x301;taka</I>, and 3) <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

Suppose someone has stolen two hundred rupees from another person. If they return that money to the owner with interest and pay something over and above it, and at the same time ask for forgiveness, then that common <I>pa&#x301;taka</I> is expiated. To wound someone&#146;s feelings is also this kind of <I>pa&#x301;taka</I>. If someone hurts a person and then begs his forgiveness &#133; repeatedly requests forgiveness, and if that person sincerely forgives him, then it may be presumed that the <I>pa&#x301;taka</I> has been expiated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph --><p><I>Atipa&#x301;taka</I> means that kind of sin, the expiation of which calls for severe austerities and physical suffering. If, for example, your mistake causes someone a great loss or ruins his future then that will also be a great sin. Normally there is no expiation for such a sin. But, if you devote yourself completely in your life-long efforts to help them by making amends, and the person forgives you from the core of their heart, then one may consider that expiation has been effected. But it does not really happen, because, can a person to whom you have caused permanent damage really forgive you from the core of their heart? In history we come across many such acts of great sin. The manner in which Ajatashatru killed his father, Bimbisara, was an act of great sin. Shashanka killed Rajyavardhana, who was his invited guest. That was also an act of great sin. The way in which Harsavardhana killed Jayashankarii, wife of Shashanka, and their minor son was also an act of great sin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph --><p>The worst kind of sin is called <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I>. The fundamental difference between <I>atipa&#x301;taka</I> and <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I> is that the sight of an act of great sin like <I>atipa&#x301;taka</I> does not tempt others to commit such sins. It is also possible that the people will not remember the event. However, the worst sins are those that leave a permanent scar on society and human history with recurring consequences ... <I></I>Had Ravana simply abducted Sita, that would have been a great sin. But, masquerading as an ascetic, Ravana first gained the confidence of Sita and then treacherously abducted her. Ravana came in the guise of an ascetic and then became a thief. This has a recurring consequence. Even today, on seeing an ascetic, a housewife may be afraid that, who knows, like Ravana, that man may be actually thief in the guise of an ascetic!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph --><p>The other branch of <I>pa&#x301;taka</I> is <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I>, which means not to do what should be done: for example, properly educating the child; taking measures so that they can be independent and self-sufficient. One should give a daughter in marriage when she comes of age (but if an educated or self-sufficient daughter does not agree to marry, that is a different matter). One should gratefully remember the good one has received from any benefactor. One should follow the path of Dharma. If one refuses to abide by these &ldquo;shoulds&rdquo; &ndash; if one indulges in the opposite of these in action, thought or words &ndash; then one has committed <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I>. It does not matter whether it is <I>pa&#x301;pa</I> or <I>pratyva&#x301;ya</I>, the fact is that whenever something assumes a condemnable dimension, one uses the word <I>ku</I> for it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph --><li>Any violation of the accepted code of conduct is generally called a crime. A community or a state stands on certain codes. When these codes are related to the administration of the state, then it is called a constitution. When it is related to governance or justice, then it is called law. An unconstitutional or anti-constitutional act is regarded as a crime in every state. That is why an act of violation of the constitution or law is called a crime. But apart from certain cardinal human principles, there are always different views regarding various matters in different communities. This is the reason why in different communities or states there are differences in the structure of the constitution, the legislative, administrative and judicial systems. So, one has to conform to the constitutional, social, legal and administrative systems of the country in which one lives at a particular point in time; otherwise one is liable for punitive action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph --><p>If we continue to expand the few fundamental human principles that we have, and accordingly revise the constitutional, administrative and legal systems of different countries, then it will lead to better prospects for human unity. Then humanism and Neo-humanism will receive an impetus to accelerate the speed of their progress, which is a major requirement of its journey [towards unity]. If we gradually increase the fundamental unity of human beings and simultaneously reduce the apparent points of difference, the universal humanity will certainly become one and indivisible some day. This is not a visionary dream &ndash; it will be the first indication of human wisdom in reality. In any case, the word <I>ku</I> can be used for whatever is considered a crime or culpability in any particular place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph --><li>There are activities that provoke, as a reaction, a filthy sensation in the body or mind of a person. This induces in them a desire to stay away from such activities, and creates in them a mentality of over-reaction against such activities. This reactionary mentality is called <I>ghrn&#x301;a&#x301;</I> or hatred. Hatred is an imposed psychic bondage. So it is a kind of <I>pa&#x301;sha</I> [eight types of external fetters]. What originates in the mind and expands to the external world is called <I>ripu</I> [six inherent bondages]. That which originates outside and influences the mind is called <I>pa&#x301;sha</I>, as told earlier. An intelligent person keeps his or her <I>ripu</I> in control and fights the <I>pa&#x301;shas</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph --><p>The sages and ascetics do not recommend any mechanism for opposing the <I>ripu</I>s<I></I>, because if a particular <I>ripu</I> is repressed, it tries to find an outlet through another <I>ripu</I>. The same is true about the remaining of <I>ripus</I> (lust, anger, greed, attachment, pride and jealousy). If the propensity of greed is strong in a person and they are compelled to control it under the pressure of poverty &ndash; for example, if a person who used to take bribes is compelled to refrain from taking bribes due to pressure from law enforcement authorities&ndash;their greed will find expression through anger or some other <I>ripu;</I> that is, they will burst into a rage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph --><p>So the recommended psychological stance is that <I></I>a <I>ripu</I> must be kept under control, and under no circumstances should it be allowed to run counter to the society or to societal norms. Suppose someone has a strong weakness for eating. Overeating or eating prohibited food can naturally lead to sickness or premature death. So that person restrains their greed in such a manner that their greed is satisfied and at the same time potential disease is prevented. Suppose someone addicted to drink has become a slave of liquor under its strong influence. If they can sublimate their alcohol addiction into a passion for music or painting or any other finer art, then their passion will be satisfied without any injury to themselves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph --><p>Regarding the <I>pashas</I>, the wise people of ancient times expressed their strong conviction that the <I>pa&#x301;shas</I> [imposed bondages of the mind &ndash; fear shame, doubt etc.] must be opposed. To fight fear, for example, one must move quickly towards the very source of that fear, equipped with necessary physical and psychological weapons. If you remain confined in your cloister, fearfully barring the door, the fear will make its way into your mind and there take root. Then the bondage of fear can never be thrown off. So always remember that <I>ripus</I> [inborn enemies &ndash; lust, angers, greed attachment, vanity and jealousy] must be controlled and <I>pa&#x301;shas</I> [bondages] must be opposed. The endeavour to be liberated from the <I>pa&#x301;shas</I> is a step forward in human expansiveness &ndash; an ascent towards human glory and excellence. <I>Pa&#x301;shobaddho bhavejjibo pa&#x301;shamukto bhavecchivah</I> [Bound by <I>pa&#x301;sha</I> is the <I>jiiva</I>, liberated from bondage is Shiva].<!-- /block --></p>

A wolf is neither faithful nor loyal to its master. A dog is not ferocious by nature. It attacks or frightens someone as part of its duty. A wolf is ferocious by nature. It has no sense of duty. A dog would not normally kill a creature if its stomach were full. But a wolf, even when its belly is full, kills a creature. If it has no capacity to eat it, it carries the carcass to its den and eats it according to its convenience. Dogs do not generally fight with other members of the dog family. They fight with members of the feline family. But a wolf does not observe any such principle. A wolf avoids the strong and unnecessarily attacks the weak. Although there is a family resemblance between the wolf and the dog, whenever a dog is sighted the wolf attacks and kills it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph --><p>There are many differences between a jackal and a dog. A dog generally moves about during the daytime. But jackals are night prowlers by nature. A jackal moves in the daytime only when it is in danger, it has to change locations or is excessively hungry. A jackal lives in a hole, but a dog never likes to live in a hole. It prefers to live in the open. A jackal cannot be tamed; but a dog can. By virtue of being night prowlers, the jackals periodically howl in chorus to preserve their solidarity and register their presence. However, dogs do not have this habit. They bark collectively only when they have to fight an enemy as a body. Although both jackals and dogs belong to the canine family, a dog chases a jackal whenever it sees one. A jackal runs away at the sight of a dog. By nature a dog is brave and a jackal is cowardly.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph --><p>The dog has been a companion of human beings since ancient times. History tells us that dogs have been of use and continue to be of use to people in different ways in their prosperity as well as in their adversity.

<a name="93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph --><p>While talking about <I>kukkut&#x301;ii</I>, I am reminded of an incident. I have preserved the memory of that incident under the heading &ldquo;Kamal Means Guernsey&rdquo;. It happened a long time ago. Since then much water has flown down the Ganges into the Bay of Bengal. I have completely forgotten the exact date and time. But I vaguely remember that it was a Paus&#x301; [winter time] evening, and I had gone to attend a function held by an aristocratic family. It was the day when the newlywed bride was to ritualistically have lunch at her in-law&#146;s place for the first time. The marriage was held in the month of Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a <I></I>[eighth month of the Bengali calendar] but the bride&#146;s rice-eating ceremony was held in the month of Paus&#x301;. Do you know why? At the time, when the marriage was held in the month of Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a, it was near the end of an English month. The Kolkata babus&#146; pockets were absolutely empty; no money in the purse, no money in the bank! So the master of the house, that is, the father of the bridegroom thought, if invited at that time, the guests would not come in shame, due to not having money to buy suitable presents or any present at all for that matter. Moreover, the guests who would come would bring cheap gifts. So, keeping the salary aspect in mind, the master of the house invited his guests in the month of Paus&#x301;. I reached the wedding house in the Paus&#x301; evening. I also had to buy a present by borrowing money from different sources. The invitation card carried the inscription: &ldquo;Food will be served strictly in accordance with Government Guest Control Regulations.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph --><p>I thought that even though people write like this, in practice they would serve <I>ra&#x301;dha&#x301;ballabhii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I> instead of <I>luci<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> </I> to one&#146;s bellyful, because a <I>ra&#x301;dha&#x301;ballabhi</I> does not come under the purview of the relevant regulations!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph --><p>Anyway, what could I do? I was just sitting idle and biding my time ... There was no leaf of any tree in sight so that I could count the leaves. So I was just listening with rapt attention to the colourful talk going on around me. The ladies had come to show off their saris and ornaments. Their discussions were confined mainly to saris and ornaments. The gentlemen were discussing diverse topics. We were all seated, however, the handsome young man who was shining amidst us like the full moon kept on standing. Many people asked him to sit down, but he said, &ldquo;Don&#146;t worry, I&#146;m fine.&rdquo; He kept on standing, possibly because in the standing position the glamour of his suit would be more prominent. If he sat down he would not be able to highlight the glamour of his dress. Many people were admiringly staring either at his coat or his trousers, and some had their eyes glued unashamedly to his clothes. One callow youth could not resist his indecent curiosity, and asked, &ldquo;Sir, from where did you buy such a beautiful coat?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph --><p>The handsome young man said, &ldquo;So you have noticed it! Then listen. It is about twelve years now.

<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;I left for New York, thinking I would enjoy myself there.

In that locality the price of everything was twice the normal price, sometimes two and a half times, sometimes even more. It seemed as if the locality was telling everybody, &#x301;Come, squander your money here.&#146; The shopkeepers of that place were always in the pink, because the customers there won&#146;t ever haggle. They would pay whatever they were asked. Many would not ask for the receipt and others would refuse to take it, even if given. The question of returning the change just did not arise. I also lived in this high style. Many Lords were confounded by my behaviour, which also turned the heads of many Barons. Once I went to a shop and asked for the best trousers that they had. They showed me one; it was really good. I asked, &lsquo;What&#146;s the price?&rsquo;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;They said, &#x301;Twenty thousand rupees, sir&#146;. (Twenty thousand rupees at that time would mean eight hundred fifty thousand now.)&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph --><p>The young stripling stared confusedly. He was dumbfounded; only his lips were shaking slightly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph --><p>The handsome young man resumed, &ldquo;Then I told them to show me a good cut of coat. They showed me one. I asked, &#x301;What&#146;s the price?&#146; They said, &#x301;Thirty thousand&#146;. Of course they quoted the price in US dollars.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;I wondered, Thirty thousand!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;They had already become familiar with my generous temperament. At the time of my buying the trousers, they got an idea of how open-handed a spendthrift I was.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

I&#146;ll pay you two thousand in gratitude, and I&#146;ll make out a cheque for thirty-two thousand and buy it right now.&#146; I gave just as I said. This is that coat.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph --><p>The greedy, hobbledehoy young man kept on gazing in wonder. After some time, when his eyes became dazed by the glamour of the coat, he closed them. I was also marveling while listening to their conversation and looked at his suit feeling like a veritable peasant. There is no harm in telling the truth. I was wondering who this handsome young man could be. Once I thought he was possibly the son of some nawab. Then it dawned on me that the age of nawabs has long since passed. Their sun has set forever. Then who is this person? Who is he? My mind said, &ldquo;Haven&#146;t you recognized him yet? He must be some deputy minister.&rdquo; I said to my mind, &ldquo;Oh mind, you are right. The day that automobiles replaced elephants and horses was the day that deputy ministers replaced nawabs and emperors. Just a revised and enlarged edition of the same thing.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph --><p>It was now time for dinner. We all took our seats as usual. The additional minister also had no choice but to sit. Taking a great risk of spoiling the ironing of the trousers, he sat very carefully. As some people drink water from a small pitcher without any direct physical contact, similarly the deputy minister sat in a delicate manner.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> No, the master of the house strictly followed the printed inscription on the invitation card. The dinner plate was very light. Possibly that is the reason why it is called light refreshment in English (light refreshment &ndash; to restore the mood in a light manner). As I looked around, I felt that the amount of interest that could be accrued on the price of the gifts was enough to recover the cost of the light refreshment. The value of the gifts would be an additional gain. Thank God, while leaving my house I had told my cook to prepare for me boiled rice and a broth of wax gourd. I now realized I had done the right thing. I must eat on my return; otherwise the whole night I will feel the sharp pangs of hunger. What I ate settled silently in a solitary corner of my stomach. No belching, no feeling of surfeit. While returning, the additional minister came to my mind several times. However, after coming back home I had my rice and wax gourd broth and went to sleep happily.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph --><p>These warm trousers I have been using for the last twelve years. Just below the right hand pocket, it has become torn. I thought of giving it to the laundry today itself and asking the owner of the cleaning shop if they could get it darned by an expert. I have noticed for the last few days that a new dyeing-cleaning shop has opened near my house. Its name is <I>shuciishubhra dhaotanilaya</I> [the house of cleaning pure white]. I thought, let me go there. My clothes will be safe in the local laundry. I reached the shop. The owner was quite a gentleman &ndash; simple, and amiable in conversation. On enquiry I learnt that the name of the gentleman was Sri Elebele Albam. <I></I>I shared our joys and sorrows with Mr Album for some time. Like me, he was also from a middle-class family. He was talking about the business of dyeing and cleaning. He said one could get fabulously rich in Europe if one ran this business properly, because although the wage of the washerman is high there, the ingredients for washing are cheap and of high quality. Things are not like that here. Washing is not good, and on top of it clothes are often spoilt. The gentleman was saying that here most of the laundry owners serve their customers after getting the washing done by washermen for a lump sum payment. Most dyeing-cleaning shops cannot afford to get the clothes washed with their own labour. After making payment to the washermen, very little [profit] margin is left in their hands. He was saying that in those European countries, the dyeing cleaners also make a substantial earning by lending high quality clothes. In this country the scope for this is also very limited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Your words are absolutely true, literally.&rdquo; The gentleman said, &ldquo;In this country people send clothes to the laundry under two circumstances. First, those who must have their clothes washed quickly within a specified period of time. Second, those who cannot trust unknown washermen with their clothes. They consider the laundry much safer. So they give their clothes to the laundry.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph --><p>The gentleman was saying that everything has a good side and a bad side. In other countries there are washing machines for washing the clothes. In India there is practically no use of this. So most people in other countries wash clothes themselves instead of sending them to the laundry. This puts the laundry owners at a disadvantage. But in India one has to wash clothes by hand. So busy people don&#146;t find sufficient time or leisure to wash their clothes. Consequently they have to depend on the laundry. Moreover for ultra modern scientific cleaning, people of India as well as other countries have to come to the laundry. But as I said, all things considered, it is not a profitable business.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph --><p>Our talk was rolling along smoothly. Then suddenly I saw the deputy minister from the previous evening arriving at the laundry all by himself. Possibly he had parked his car at a distance. In his hands were the costly coat and trousers we had seen the previous day. He handed in the coat and the trousers to Mr. Album and gave him a fresh currency note of ten rupees. I glanced for a moment at the deputy minister, but could not find any glamour in his figure. Possibly because he was not in those trousers and coat, his glamour had diminished to some extent. I could not see yesterday&#146;s lustre in his face or flicker in his eyes. I imagine he had perhaps overeaten yesterday, and as a result of indigestion had fifty bilious belches. That might have made him a bit weak and lack-lustre. But how could he eat so much? He could eat that much only if he were served a lot. Anyway, after the deputy minister left I asked Mr. Album, &ldquo; Did you take an advance for washing his clothes?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;By no means. I take payment towards washing charges only after I hand over the washed clothes.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

The feminine of <I>sita</I> is <I>sita&#x301;</I>. This means a white feminine object; in common usage it means sugar. Since sugar is white, it is also called <I>sita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="145"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=145 type=paragraph -->Kum + jan + d&#x301;a = kuin&#x32D;ja</I>. Some may think that in this case the consonantal <I>ma</I> is the end-phoneme of a word. No, that is not true. In this case <I>ma</I> is an inflectional form, as in <I>gam + ga&#x301; = gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;</I>. Here the consonantal <I>ma</I> is an inflectional form and not the verbal terminal <I>ma</I>. Since it is not a terminal <I>ma</I>, the word <I>kuin&#x32D;ja</I> must be spelt with the fifth letter, that is <I>in&#x32D;</I>, just as <I>gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;</I> must be written with <I>un&#x32D;</I>. I have noticed that in northern and western Indian languages, attempts are made to spell <I>kuin&#x32D;ja</I> and <I>gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;</I> with <I>m</I>. This is not proper. Etymologically <I>kuin&#x32D;ja</I> means something that is born or grown from the earth and remains there. In common usage <I>kuin&#x32D;ja</I> means the following: <ol> <li>Tree. A tree is called <I>mahiiruha</I> because it shoots up from the earth. Another name is <I>kuin&#x32D;ja</I>. A cluster of plants or creepers is also called <I>kuin&#x32D;ja</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

This system of the Government taking charge was called the Court of Wards. For this the Government used to appoint one or more magistrates as the director of the Court of Wards. They used to run the estate until the minor son of the zamindar came of age or the incapable zamindar was considered fit to get back the estate. This Court of Wards used to pay a monthly allowance to the zamindar or his minor heir.</p>
