<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Indu means &ldquo;moon&rdquo;; Indu means &ldquo;the moon&#146;s ama&#x301;kala&#x301; [sixteenth digit or crescent]&rdquo;. In some people&#146;s opinion, indu means the entire moon. The light of the moon used to be considered as a symbol of sentient whiteness. Shubhrajyots&#x301;napulakitaya&#x301;minii [&ldquo;The radiant moonlit night&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The word kamala can be derived in two ways: (1) kam + ac + la&#x301; + d&#x301;a = kamala, meaning etymologically, &ldquo;that which holds beauty&rdquo;, or (2) kam + alac = kamala, which means &ldquo;that which is an embodiment of beauty&rdquo;. In both cases the colloquial meaning of kamala is &ldquo;lotus flower&rdquo;. In the first case the verbal root la&#x301; is derived with a&#x301;di la<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and in the second case a&#x301;di la is also used in the suffix alac; thus, in both cases, a&#x301;di la is used in the construction of kamala. Similarly, a&#x301;di la is also used in the construction of kamala&#x301; because this word is derived by adding the suffix t&#x301;a&#x301; to the word kamala.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Thus indukamala means &ldquo;white lotus&rdquo;. The word indiibara, which is used for &ldquo;blue lotus&rdquo;, is clearly a graceful combination, but when indukamala is used to mean &ldquo;moon&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the crescent of the moon&rdquo;, its meaning comes from the word indu. The etymological difference between the two deserves careful consideration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Synonyms for kamala are padma, abja, saroja, sarasija, kubalaya, kokanada, nalinii, naliniipus&#x301;pa, mrn&#x301;a&#x301;laman&#x301;ika&#x301;, etc. In Bengal it is padma, in north India kamala, in Kashmir pampos&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Indubila&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Indu + bil + ac = indubila. By adding t&#x301;a&#x301; it becomes indubila&#x301;. Indu means &ldquo;moon&rdquo; or &ldquo;the crescent of the moon&rdquo;. The meaning of the verbal root bil is &ldquo;to bore&rdquo; or &ldquo;to make a hole&rdquo;. By adding the suffix van (in some people&#146;s opinion, vun) to the verbal root bil we get the word bilva whose etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which makes a hole&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;bel fruit&rdquo; [wood-apple]. In ancient times people held the view that eating burnt, unripe bel or wood-apple would alleviate ulcers and other kinds of stomach problems, while eating ripe bel would create stomach ulcers. Thus they named the fruit bilva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->According to a story from the Puranas, the etymological meaning of indubila&#x301; is &ldquo;that woman who made a hole in the moon, or the crescent of the moon, in order to extract its nectar&rdquo;, that is, that woman who was inspired by the belief that if she made a hole in the moon its accumulated nectar would come out. Colloquially, indubila&#x301; refers to the mother of the god of wealth, Kuvera.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Indhana<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The word indhana is derived by adding the suffix lyut&#x301; to the verbal root indh or idhi. That wood which is used as fuel for cooking is indhana. By the same reasoning, in the modern era we can also call the coal or electricity that we use for cooking indhana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In southern Bengal, indhana is called jva&#x301;la&#x301;nii ka&#x301;t&#x301;h, in the central and western regions it is called la&#x301;kr&#x301;i, and in the north it is called khar&#x301;i. Wood which is used as cooking fuel is also called aran&#x301;i. Not all kinds of wood are suitable as cooking fuel. Many kinds of wood do not catch fire easily, others do not stay lit. Due to insufficient combustibility, some woods become scorched but do not burn strongly. Those woods which burn strongly are usable as cooking fuel and they are known as aran&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those forested areas which contain large amounts of aran&#x301;i are called aran&#x301;ya. In ancient times the sages generally used to live in these aran&#x301;yas, although this did not hold true for those who used to live off forest-grown fruits and roots. Those who used to cook their food needed cooking fuel, so they used to live in the aran&#x301;ya. They did not live in the ordinary forest areas which were bereft of aran&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->You must all be aware of the fact that the Vedas have two main branches: karmaka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a and jin&#x32D;a&#x301;naka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The karmaka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a is further subdivided into two: mantra and bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a. The jin&#x32D;a&#x301;naka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a is also subdivided into two: a&#x301;ran&#x301;yaka and upanis&#x301;ada. The etymological meaning of a&#x301;ran&#x301;yaka is &ldquo;that which pertains to the forest [aran&#x301;ya]&rdquo;, or &ldquo;forest-born&rdquo;. Colloquially it refers to all those philosophical portions of the Vedas which concern the objective world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Those areas which contained large amounts of less-combustible or less-flammable trees were called ban in the common language. For example, I will point out that the Bankura jungle has an abundance of high quality wood while in the Sundarbans there is a lack of high quality wood &ndash; the greater part is wood for fuel. By this analysis, we can call the Sundarbans aran&#x301;ya, while the Bankura jungle we would call ban in the common language, not aran&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->All those woods which were not used for cooking, that is, which were not indhana, but which were used for yajin&#x32D;a [Vedic ritual sacrifice], such as sha&#x301;l (indra), bilva (bel or wood-apple), yajin&#x32D;ad&#x301;umbara (ud&#x301;umbara) [Indian blackberry], are called samidha rather than aran&#x301;i or indhana. In ancient times, yajin&#x32D;ad&#x301;umbara was usually used as samidha; for this reason, those who were engaged in the performance of sacrifices would not use yajin&#x32D;ad&#x301;umbar wood as indhana; due to superstition they would not even consume its fruit. In subsequent times, most likely after their arrival in India, they began to use indraka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha (sha&#x301;l wood) and bilvaka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha (bel wood) in their sacrifices. I have sometimes seen samidha called yajin&#x32D;a indhana in old Pra&#x301;krta literature. This usage is defective. Indhana is not used for sacrifices; it is used for cooking.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Ira&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The verbal root ir means &ldquo;that which flows&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which does not remain static&rdquo;. One colloquial meaning of the word ira or ira&#x301; is &ldquo;water&rdquo;. Iravat or Ira&#x301;vat means &ldquo;sea&rdquo;. According to a story from the Puranas, the name of the huge elephant that emerged from the churning of the sea was Eravata/Era&#x301;vata or Aeravata/Aera&#x301;vata (mammoth).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Another colloquial meaning of ira or ira&#x301; is &ldquo;air&rdquo;. Sweet-scented ira means &ldquo;fragrant air&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Yet another meaning of ira or ira&#x301; is &ldquo;money&rdquo;. In this sense, the value of money lies in its mobility. If money stops circulating then it loses its value. The wealth of the individual or the state accrues through ceaseless circulation; thus money should not be kept in a pot buried in the ground. Its greatest value lies in its circulation. Irava&#x301;na or ira&#x301;va&#x301;na means &ldquo;wealthy&rdquo;. Another meaning of iravatii or ira&#x301;vatii is &ldquo;rich&rdquo; [in feminine form].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Still another meaning of ira or ira&#x301; is &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; or &ldquo;erudition&rdquo;. In the case of the physical world, ira or ira&#x301; is a name for wealth due to its mobility. For the same reason, another name for erudition is ira or ira&#x301;. Calamity results in individual, social and political life if wealth remains confined &ndash; the water in a clay pitcher leaks out if it is not used. Such is also the case with erudition. Its real worth depends on its circulating and spreading, otherwise it becomes a burden. Pustaka&#x301;ntaragata&#x301; vidya&#x301; parahastagatam&#x301; dhanam [&ldquo;Knowledge confined to books is like wealth belonging to others&rdquo;]. Knowledge is spread through distribution, by doing service. Herein lies the significance of its name ira&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->For the same reason, another meaning of the word ira&#x301; is &ldquo;articulation&rdquo; or &ldquo;vocality&rdquo;. Those who have the capacity to speak and make others understand should speak and explain good things to others. The faculty of speaking should not be confined to a mute vocal cavity. As speaking and knowledge is ira&#x301;, thus knowledge and the presiding deity of knowledge used to be called Va&#x301;gdevii (va&#x301;k + devii)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in ancient times. The word ira&#x301; used to be especially revered by the learned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Ila&#x301;bila&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word i is &ldquo;desirous of obtaining&rdquo;. The word la&#x301; (la&#x301; + d&#x301;a + t&#x301;a&#x301;) means &ldquo;one who holds&rdquo;. Colloquially, ila&#x301; means &ldquo;a collection of wealth&rdquo; (a collection of money or learning). The etymological meaning of the word ila&#x301;bila&#x301; is &ldquo;he or she who goes around everywhere searching for holes or poking around in hopes of obtaining riches&rdquo;. The colloquial meaning of the word ila&#x301;bila&#x301; is Kuvera&#146;s [god of wealth] wife.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->In one Puranic tale, the name of Kuvera&#146;s wife is Ila&#x301; (Iks&#x301;va&#x301;ku&#146;s daughter). According to a Puranic story, the male Mercury was physically transformed into a woman. After becoming a woman, his name became Ila&#x301;. Through surgery he was again changed back into a man. Iks&#x301;va&#x301;ku&#146;s daughter&#146;s real name was Ira&#x301;. After Mercury was changed back into a man, Ira&#x301; was given the name Ila&#x301;. This Puranic tale offers evidence that there were sex changes in the past similar to the great number that we see today in modern times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Iliisha<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Il + iisha = iliisha. Il means &ldquo;to go down into water&rdquo;. Iisha means &ldquo;ruler&rdquo;&#8230; &ldquo;king&rdquo;. The etymological meaning of iliisha is &ldquo;the king of water&rdquo;. Colloquially, it refers to a certain kind of fish. Since those iliisha which unwittingly get caught in ponds, swamps, or stagnant water have their taste spoiled, they are called viliisha (vi + iliisha = viliisha). In Bengal, different people spell iliisha in different ways. This is not desirable. The correct spelling is iliisha because it is according to its derivation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Is&#x301;t&#x301;a<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The word is&#x301;t&#x301;a is derived by adding the suffix kta to the verbal root is&#x301;. Is&#x301;ta would be correct but the cerebral letter s&#x301;a cannot be joined to the dental letter ta; thus here ta is changed into t&#x301;a yielding is&#x301;t&#x301;a. The meaning of the verbal root is&#x301; is &ldquo;the desire to obtain&rdquo;. That which a person nurtures in the innermost recesses of his or her mind in the hope of obtaining it is that person&#146;s Is&#x301;t&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In the spiritual world a person can only have one Is&#x301;t&#x301;a, one desideratum. In that world there can never be two goals, there can never be &ldquo;desiderata&rdquo;. In the psychic world, or within the jurisdiction of the mind, a person may have more than one object of desire, that is, there may be multiple is&#x301;t&#x301;as. Desideratum and desiderata &ndash; a person can run after both kinds of ideation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Within the confines of the physical world, a person can run after or follow more than one object. The collective or combined name of all the various is&#x301;t&#x301;as that a person may have in the physical and psychic spheres is abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a (abhi + is&#x301;t&#x301;a = abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a). For example, we can say &ldquo;he has come to Calcutta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> to fulfil his desires [abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a].&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->I just finished saying that in the spiritual world a person has only one Is&#x301;t&#x301;a. Here there is no scope for duality. In that world plurality is not accepted &ndash; giving it internal support is harmful as well. In that world the &ldquo;many&rdquo; can be illumined through the riches of the profound knowledge of the &ldquo;One&rdquo;. Getting overenthused with the &ldquo;many&rdquo;, this &ldquo;One&rdquo; cannot be found.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->It is said that someone once asked Hanuman: &ldquo;Well then, Hanuman, why is it, if you admit that Rama and Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a are one, that you take Rama&#146;s name so often, and never once, not even by mistake, do you take Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a&#146;s name?

<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->It happened a long time ago. At that time I didn&#146;t have my own house in Delhi; sometimes I used to stay in hotels and sometimes in a rented house. This time I was staying in a hotel. I returned to the hotel around 8:00 p.m. after finishing my evening walk and went into the bathroom to wash my hands and face in the basin. Suddenly, from behind me, I heard a well-known and welcome voice from the past: &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;It is the voice of Dulu Palit that I know so well from my childhood.&rdquo; Dulu was both a close friend and a distant relative. He was the son of an aristocratic family near Magra. Dulu Palit, Vrajagopal Sannyal, and myself had had an intimate friendship. Both of them were quite handsome, but their inner beauty was even greater. It was their inborn nature to do good to others. But where was Dulu&#146;s voice coming from in this hotel bathroom? How did he get here? This was not a dream. I was standing in front of the washbasin in full possession of my senses, washing my hands and face &ndash; it simply couldn&#146;t have been a figment of my imagination or a trick my ears were playing on me!<!-- /block --></p>

Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; used to love Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a tremendously; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a also loved Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; enormously. Dulu used to tell me: &ldquo;We will love each other so much that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;&#146;s love will pale by comparison.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->I used to tell him: &ldquo;I will be able to but will you be able to?&rdquo; And he used to reply: &ldquo;Of course I will. Just you wait and see!&rdquo; Now, today, I was hearing Dulu&#146;s voice again, sounding offended and asking: &ldquo;Why won&#146;t you look at me?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->The voice seemed to be coming from behind me.

<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Vrajagopal was my childhood friend. He knew very well that Dulu Palit could not remain apart from me, anymore than &ldquo;q&rdquo; from &ldquo;u&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;All he does is lie down, tossing and turning and talking about you.

<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->I informed Vrajagopal that I would return to Calcutta from Delhi by plane as soon as I had finished my work there and go straight to his house from the airport when I arrived.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Vraja was consoled and hung up the phone. I went back into the bathroom to talk further with the Dulu on the wall, that luminous Dulu in his coat and pants. &ldquo;Now tell me how you are,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Are you fine now?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Quite well, as good as can be,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;How can I tell you how good it feels to be near you? Good enough to die, it seems to me. Didn&#146;t the poet say: &lsquo;If I die in such moonlight it is good; such a death is as good as heaven&rsquo;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Don&#146;t talk about death,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;or else I will get very angry. I shall have to rebuke you. You are well aware of my temper.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->I went back to washing my hands and face in the bathroom. From the clock I heard the sound of the nine o&#146;clock chime.

<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->I returned to the bedroom. A few minutes later there was a phone call from Calcutta. Again I heard the voice of Vrajagopal. &ldquo;I have very painful news to tell you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just now, at exactly nine o&#146;clock, our friend Dulu left us for the next world.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

The surface meaning is: &ldquo;The courtyard went into the inner room &ndash; O honoured lady, do you understand? As a result of the courtyard going inside the room, the thief that was hiding in the courtyard also went inside and stole your earrings.&rdquo; The hidden meaning is: &ldquo;By reaching the higher stages of spiritual practice the outer world is swallowed up within you. Then you also become all-knowing. That thief of minds has stolen away your worldly bondages.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->On the practical level, what happens is that the unconscious mind is all-pervading, integral and immeasurably vast. Through spiritual practices the riches of the unconscious mind are brought down into the subconscious mind. The spiritual aspirant then understands everything; he discovers the secret signs of knowledge. Then, according to his or her needs, he or she is able to bring this acquired wealth of the subconscious mind into the conscious mind and use it in the external world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->How much can book knowledge help a person! It goes in one ear and out the other. If, by means of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practices], a person can bring into the subconscious mind the boundless knowledge that resides in the unconscious mind, then that becomes transformed into lasting riches which then are, or can be, employed extensively for the welfare of humanity. The remedies for illnesses or answers to questions that a person receives at the shrine of different gods and goddesses is not due to the greatness of those gods and goddesses. As a result of sincere longing a state of one-pointedness arises in the mind and if, at that time, that person falls into deep sleep because of physical tiredness then the answers to his or her questions may descend from the unconscious mind into the subconscious mind. There the person receives the answers to his or her questions about illness or other questions according to his or her mental conceptions and beliefs. The person thinks that he or she has perhaps received these answers due to the grace of such-and-such god or goddess. Actually, thanks to the grace of the Supreme Consciousness, his or her unconscious mind is the hidden repository of infinite knowledge. Due to one-pointedness, the person has been able to temporarily submerge part of his mind within the boundaries of that profound knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->Now have you understood the meaning of am&#x301;gana gharapana?

The subject of the sus&#x301;umna&#x301; arose by way of discussing the id&#x301;a&#x301; na&#x301;d&#x301;ii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->In old Sanskrit, id&#x301;a&#x301; was also spelled with antahstha lra, that is, it was also spelled ilra&#x301;.

If we want to say &ldquo;this amount&rdquo; (ei parima&#x301;n&#x301;) we can say iyat parima&#x301;n&#x301;, just as we can say kiyat parima&#x301;n&#x301; for &ldquo;some amount&rdquo;. Iyat is an adjective. If we want to make it into a noun we add tva or ta&#x301; to it. Iyat + tva = iyatva. Iyat + ta&#x301; = iyatta&#x301;. For example, sat + tva = sattva (a&#x301;nbsattva [dried mango juice], ka&#x301;nt&#x301;a&#x301;lsattva [dried jackfruit juice]). Sat + ta&#x301; = satta&#x301; meaning &ldquo;existence&rdquo;. But when it means &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; or &ldquo;possession&rdquo; then it is spelled svatva. Here sva means &ldquo;one&#146;s own&rdquo; and the suffix tva has been added to make it a noun.<!-- /block --></p>

It is a proper noun.  Proper names are not subject to change when used in another language.  A person whose Bengali name is Arun Kumar will still be Arun Kumar if his name is written in English; it will not be &ldquo;son of crimson red&rdquo;. Hence the name Kalikata should be written Kalikata no matter  what language or script of the world it is written in. Writing &ldquo;Calcutta&rdquo;  is not even worthy of consideration. It betrays intellectual poverty  or split-thinking. In English one should write Kalikata.</p>

Today, that which I thought of as  my own in the worldly sense has become other, and that Supreme Being  I have made my own.
