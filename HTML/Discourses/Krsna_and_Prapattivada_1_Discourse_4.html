<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the field of human intellect and intuition, there was and still is a nice idea &ndash; the idea of prapatti. In the light of this idea of prapatti we shall analyse the roles of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In India, in the realm of spiritual practice and philosophy, the importance of prapattiva&#x301;da [the doctrine of prapatti] is very great. &ldquo;Philosophy&rdquo; is a Latin term; the Arabic equivalent is phalsapha&#x301;, and darshana is the Sanskrit term. Philosophy is the theoretical aspect of actional flow. What should we do? How and why should we act? These things are what constitute the scope and subject matter of philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->From a perusal of ancient Indian history, we know that Sada&#x301;shiva was born over seven thousand years ago. People in those days were not intellectually advanced. It is futile to discuss philosophy with people of undeveloped intellect; it is a mere waste of time both for those who do not grasp philosophy and for those who try to explain it. When the human intellect develops sufficiently, only then do people begin to understand philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->While trying to unite the scattered human groups into a well-knit social system, Lord Shiva marked that for the advancement of humanity, the essential prerequisite was spiritual progress, and this required the awakening of the spiritual urge. Lord Shiva awakened the spiritual urge in the people of His time. He taught them spiritual practice. He taught them the practice of Tantra, which is the practical aspect of spirituality, as you know. He also taught them spiritual dance, that is, ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava. Pa&#x301;rvatii gave society the lalita ma&#x301;rmika dance. Shiva also taught Maharshi Dhanvantari the vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra. (Here one should remember the difference between the vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra and the a&#x301;yurveda sha&#x301;stra, another school of medicine. The school of medicine that depends on the Vedas is called a&#x301;yurveda, and the Tantra-based school of medicine is called the vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra. In Bengal the vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra is more popular than a&#x301;yurveda.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Lord Shiva also taught Maharshi Bharata the science of music &ndash; nrtya, giita and va&#x301;dya [dance, song and percussion music].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Thus He opened various channels for the expression of human intellect and wisdom. But He did not expound any philosophy, because the people of those days were not sufficiently developed intellectually. But whether people are intellectually developed or undeveloped from the philosophical point of view, everyone is entitled to spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, everyone can attain the supreme height of spirituality. One may or may not comprehend philosophy, but still one can attain Parama Purus&#x301;a by dint of spiritual cult. For that, the knowledge of the three R&#146;s is not essential. Rather, Lord Shiva cautioned that those who were dabbling in philosophical discussions in those days were just confusing people&#146;s minds and misguiding the masses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->(Of course there was no recognized philosopher in Shiva&#146;s time. Maharshi Kapila, the first recognized philosopher on this earth, emerged much later than Shiva. Kapila was born at a place near Jhalda in the district of Purulia in West Bengal, and he did his sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; at Gangasagar in Sagar-dwip.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Common people cannot understand philosophical intricacies. Someone will say &ldquo;a&rdquo; [as in &ldquo;what&rdquo;], someone else will say &ldquo;a&rdquo; [as in &ldquo;cat&rdquo;], and so on and so forth. For instance, the single letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; in the English alphabet has got twenty-one types of pronunciation. Suppose a kindergarten child is taught twenty-one types of pronunciation by twenty-one teachers, the child is bound to get lost and confused. One should learn these things step by step. A-N-T alone is pronounced &ldquo;ant&rdquo;, but A-N-T in &ldquo;elephant&rdquo; has a different pronunciation.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Lord Shiva branded those philosophers who were spelling out confusing philosophical ideas to the common people as Lokavya&#x301;mohaka&#x301;raka&#x301;h [&ldquo;Their only work is to inject disease into human life&rdquo;]. Loka means &ldquo;the world&rdquo;, vya&#x301;moha means &ldquo;disease&rdquo;, and ka&#x301;raka&#x301;h means those who inject these so-called philosophies into people&#146;s minds. Lord Shiva drove such philosophers away from society. He clearly opined that such so-called philosophers would not be able to help the then society to progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Maharshi Kapila came much later than Lord Shiva and some time before Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s advent. He propounded his school of philosophy, elaborating his ideas regarding creation and evolution through twenty-four principles. These twenty-four principles, he said, were there at the beginning of creation &ndash; not one or two or four or five, but the total number of twenty-four principles was there. Since Maharshi Kapila fixed the total sam&#x301;khya&#x301; [number] at twenty-four, his school of philosophy came to be known as &ldquo;Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya&rdquo;. In fact, in his Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, Kapila did not say anything about Parama Purus&#x301;a, but by way of elaborating his philosophical views he said, &ldquo;Sure enough, there is one Supreme Entity &ndash; the Creator of this universe. To that Entity I give the name Janya Iishvara.&rdquo; (Here the implication is &ldquo;for the creation&rdquo; [janya means &ldquo;for&rdquo;].) &ldquo;We are bound to accept this Iishvara.&rdquo; This much only Kapila said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This exposition of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy caused some whispering, some murmuring, among the people immediately after Kapila&#146;s time. People wondered how Kapila, the greatest scholar of that age, who had long pondered the mysteries of creation, having formulated those twenty-four principles and given the concept of Janya Iishvara, had utterly failed to elaborate or clarify this concept further. He said, &ldquo;Sorry, I can&#146;t say any more than what I have already said.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Some of the people then began to think that the very intellect with which Kapila had invented his philosophical doctrine was provided by no other entity than Janya Iishvara. Thus to say anything about Janya Iishvara naturally remained beyond the intellectual capacity of Kapila. This sort of philosophical whispering became vocalized in later periods. People began to boldly say, &ldquo;No, Kapila is not right &ndash; he is wrong in his philosophical assertions. How could he say anything about the Creator, without whose will not even a blade of green grass can move? How could Kapila dare pronounce anything about that Supreme Entity!&rdquo; Thus arose a new philosophical idea &ndash; the idea of prapattiva&#x301;da [the doctrine of prapatti], as it is called today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And sure enough, in the wake of this prapattiva&#x301;da, its antithesis also came into the being, the idea of viprapatti. And aprapatti also arose, which neither supported nor opposed prapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The Shaivites &ndash; those who pursued the Shiva cult &ndash; were instructed by Lord Shiva to steer clear of any philosophical discussions. Lord Shiva had announced that the world would have the right sort of philosophy at the opportune time, and now it was pointless to bother about so-called philosophies. Hence the Shaivites were aprapattiva&#x301;diis, that is, they were neither supporters nor opponents of prapattiva&#x301;da. Both viprapattiva&#x301;da and prapattiva&#x301;da, as philosophical ideas, were becoming quite popular.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was born into this philosophical environment. Basically He was not a philosopher: in both His roles, as Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, He was a pragmatic man, a practical personality. Prapattiva&#x301;da, which received special support directly or indirectly from Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, found a permanent place in Bha&#x301;gavata sha&#x301;stra, which evolved at a much later date.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->By studying the Sanskrit language, one can easily determine the period of composition of the scriptures. If we find etad nas dha&#x301;mah, we should immediately conclude that the composition is about 12,000 years old, because the language is Rgvedic. But if we find idam&#x301; asma&#x301;kam&#x301; grham&#x301; asti, we should conclude that it is 1500 years old at the most. The language of the Bha&#x301;gavata sha&#x301;stra clearly indicates that this scripture was composed much later than Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time, and it has given a direct recognition to prapattiva&#x301;da.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now let us analyse what shape prapattiva&#x301;da assumed in the hands of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Vaishnavism, or the cult of devotion, chiefly rests on the idea of prapatti. In the initial stage, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma [the faculty of knowledge and the faculty of action] threw out a challenge to prapattiva&#x301;da, but finally they gave in with these words: &ldquo;We just put up a facade of resistance. In our heart of hearts we accept your supremacy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The word prapatti is derived pra &ndash; pat root + ktin suffix. Prapatti means complete surrender. The inner spirit of prapatti is that whatever is taking place in the universe is all due to the Cosmic will. Had Parama Purus&#x301;a willed otherwise, things would have been different. Hence the Cosmic will is at the root of each and every action. Thus we should say, &ldquo;O Lord, Thy will be done. I am but a machine. Utilize this machine in any way You like. I am nothing but a mere tool in your hands.&rdquo; This is the spirit of prapattiva&#x301;da. This inner spirit of prapatti is nicely reflected in a modern Bengali song:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Sakali toma&#x301;r iccha&#x301; iccha&#x301;mayii ta&#x301;ra&#x301; tumi;<br>Toma&#x301;r karma tumi kara ma&#x301; loke bale kari a&#x301;mi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->[All that is happening is Your own thought-projection. Whatever You wish to do becomes implemented. It is You who do everything. People foolishly claim the credit for doing things.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Though this song was composed by a follower of the Shakti Cult, it represents perfectly the spirit of Vaishnavism. The idea is more in conformity with Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;aviiya [Vaishnavite] prapattiva&#x301;da than with the Shakti Cult. However, this is not the subject of the discourse today, or else I would point out how the Shakti cult was influenced by the doctrine of Vaishnavism. The subject is prapattiva&#x301;da.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a does not say anything verbally about prapatti, but all His actions, His behaviour, the music from His proverbial flute, His call to the people &ndash; all these clearly reflect the spirit of prapattiva&#x301;da. Nevertheless, He abstains from vocalizing His approval of prapattiva&#x301;da. At the same time, He desists from speaking for or against jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma. He is simply making the people float in the stream of devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a played the most regaling notes on His flute. The waves of ideation that emanated from His music, the trough and crest of the waves, flowed and reached the innermost recesses of the mind, and aroused a responsive ideation in the devotees. Each devotee felt that the sound of the flute was calling him or her alone. &ldquo;I can no longer afford to ignore the sound of the flute and stay away, for the flute is calling me by name.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Thus human beings advanced and moved on. How do people progress? They progress according to the vibrational waves and inspiration emanating from the mind of the Boundless Entity, and this reaches the inner cores of their minds and souls. These billowing waves drive the jiivas [living beings] forward and bring them into close proximity to the Boundless Entity. That is to say, the music emanating from Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s flute shook the minds of the sa&#x301;dhakas, causing them to echo and vibrate. This resonance is nothing but prapattiva&#x301;da. Here there is scope neither for jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na nor for karma. Here mobility is the only task, the only dharma. &ldquo;The way He is calling me &ndash; I am to move accordingly.&rdquo; This state of mind is one of the sweetest states, the madhura gun&#x301;a [sweet quality] of prapattiva&#x301;da. &ldquo;I am rushing ahead due to the sweet call of His flute and entering into His sweet and blissful environment.&rdquo; Hence for Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, there is no need to interpret the faculties of knowledge and action. There is no scope for fighting over philosophical ideas. Only complete prapatti is there, and once it shakes the jiiva, he or she can no longer stay away. One rushes out and starts running after Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Chot&#x301;e ye jan ba&#x301;nshiir t&#x301;a&#x301;ne<br>Se ki ta&#x301;ka&#x301;y pather pa&#x301;ne?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->[One who runs after the sound of the flute &ndash; can he or she ever bother about the road?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Human beings are moving ahead. They do not bother about whether they have stumbled and fallen on the ground, or whether their limbs have become bloody with cuts and scratches. The jiiva does not care. He or she has no time to stop. This is the Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a who, although directly a prapattiva&#x301;dii, never uttered anything verbally about prapatti. Influenced by such a prapattiva&#x301;dii doctrine, the devotees of Lord Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a sang:<!-- /block --></p>
