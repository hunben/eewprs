In its etymological sense, <I>ka&#x301;rpat&#x301;ika</I> means &ldquo;a thing related to cloth&rdquo;. <ol> <li>In common usage it refers to &ldquo;a thing made of cloth&rdquo;, such as a cotton wrapper, bandage, strip (<I>pat&#x301;ii</I>), <I></I>etc. Many people think that <I>pat&#x301;ii</I> is a foreign word. But that is not true. It is a Sanskrit word used in Bengali in its original form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><p>You are possibly aware of the fact that there was a time when people used to bother too much about castes. And in this regard, they displayed terrible intolerance. Caste-discrimination was about to strangle humanism. In many cases this happened. People belonging to the so-called lower strata of society were not really considered human beings. In certain spheres they were treated worse than animals. It was not thought that a food item must be discarded &ndash; it is not considered so even now &ndash; when a mouse, a mole, a fly or mosquito touched it. But what to speak of it being touched by certain so called lower-caste people &#133; or their entering the kitchen &#133; or their sitting in the kitchen veranda &ndash; in certain cases, they were even barred from entering the courtyard of the house. Although it was loudly claimed that everything is the manifestation of Brahma, <I>Sarvam&#x301; khalvidam&#x301; Brahma</I>, in reality all kinds of casteism were concealed within the boundaries of religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><p>In those days the boomerang of this religious bigotry did not spare even the heads of society. On the contrary, it was Brahmans who did the greatest injury to other Brahmans. The descendents of Krttivas Thakur (his nephew&#146;s line) had to carry a social stigma because Krttivas Thakur had committed the offence of translating the <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I> into Bengali. A high-caste Brahman was downgraded due to leaving his village to settle in another. Thus surnames like Banerjees became Kusha&#x301;riis, Batabyals, Ma&#x301;scar&#x301;aks; similarly, Chatterjees were downgraded to Ka&#x301;in&#x32D;jiilals, Pa&#x301;kr&#x301;a&#x301;shiis; Bhattacharyas became Chakravartis. For a petty offence a person was expelled from his or her caste or expelled from his or her religion. People were forced to renounce their religion or undergo various kinds of persecution under pressure of circumstances. Looking more closely, it would seem that in those days the only job of one class of people was to find fault with others, to ruin people in the name of religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><p>At that time, in the district of Birbhum there was an intelligent man named Deviibar Ghatak. In order to save people from this precarious situation, he formulated a system of communities comprising people who had similar kinds of faults or qualities. As a result, no one could henceforth be summarily expelled from his or her caste. Moreover, since people of similar offences or qualities belonged to the same community, there was no question of vilification of one person by another. Amongst the Brahmans of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region (Banerjee, Mukherjee, Chatterjee, Gaunguly, Ghosal), this community system was called <I>melbandhan</I> (Phuliya&#x301; Mel, <I></I>Sarva&#x301;nandii Mel, Khardaha Mel, etc.). The same <I>melbandhan</I> was called <I>pat&#x301;iibandhan</I> by the Brahmans of the Barendra class (such as Sanyal, Bhadurii, Lahirii, Bagcii, Maetra). Those who had lost their original aristocratic Brahman status but had not yet been fully incorporated into a lower Brahman caste, that is, those who were in an intermediary stage, were called <I>bhaun&#x32D;gakuliin</I> [a fallen aristocrat]. They are called <I>ka&#x301;p</I> in Barendra society. However, you understand that this <I>pat&#x301;ii</I> is neither an indigenous word nor a foreign word but is in fact a Sanskrit word.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;rpat&#x301;ika</I> is thick socks. The thick strip of cloth which soldiers use or formerly used to wrap their legs with is also called <I>ka&#x301;rpat&#x301;ika</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><li><I>Ka&#x301;rpat&#x301;ika</I> also means &ldquo;parasite&rdquo; (<I>parga&#x301;cha&#x301;)</I>. Some synonyms of parasite, that is, <I>parga&#x301;cha&#x301;</I>, are <I>parajiivii</I>, <I>ka&#x301;rpat&#x301;ika, ka&#x301;nta&#x301;ra</I> etc. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><I>Kr + pa&#x301;s = karpa&#x301;s</I>. <I>Karpa&#x301;s</I> means &ldquo;cotton&rdquo;. The derivative form of <I>karpa&#x301;s</I> in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta is <I>ka&#x301;pa&#x301;s</I> (in Bengali also &ndash; in Bengali it is desirable to use <I>a&#x301;</I>); in colloquial Maharastrian Pra&#x301;krta it is <I>ka&#x301;pus</I>. But the original Sanskrit word is <I>karpa&#x301;s</I> and not <I>ka&#x301;rpa&#x301;s</I>. <ol> <li>The word <I>ka&#x301;rpa&#x301;s</I> means cotton goods such as shirts, pants, caps, ribbons, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><li><I>Ka&#x301;rpa&#x301;s</I> also means &ldquo;light socks&rdquo;. It is better to remember that in ancient times ordinary people used light socks or <I>ka&#x301;rpa&#x301;s</I>, while soldiers used <I>ka&#x301;rpat&#x301;ika</I>, or thick socks.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><li>In common usage <I>ka&#x301;rpa&#x301;s</I> also means &ldquo;paper&rdquo;, because in those days paper was made of cotton. Paper made with cotton through an indigenous process was called <I>tulot&#x301; ka&#x301;gaj</I> [&ldquo;cottony paper&rdquo;] in colloquial Bengali. The word <I>ka&#x301;gaj</I> [most common Bengali word for &ldquo;paper&rdquo;] is not a native word; it is a foreign word. It has come from Arabic. The original Arabic word is <I>ka&#x301;gad</I>. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><i>Ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><I>Karaka + t&#x301;a&#x301; = ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I>. Etymologically <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I> means someone who does an important and responsible job or is utilized to do such a job. In common usage it has the following meanings: <ol> <li>A socially-outcast woman. In ancient times men who were engaged in the profession of spying were called <I>gahapurus&#x301;a</I>. They were not generally considered as belonging to the respectable class of society, because they were obliged to do many mean or heinous deeds in the course of their work. The women who were engaged in this profession were called <I>vis&#x301;akanya&#x301;</I> [&ldquo;poison-girls&rdquo;]. Generally they used to have poison in their rings. In the event of any possibility of being caught by the enemy or apprehension of a secret being divulged, they would commit suicide by swallowing that poison. That is why they were called <I>vis&#x301;akanya&#x301;</I>. In the course of their work, these <I>vis&#x301;akanya&#x301;s</I> had to go to many different places and operate in many undesirable environments. So women of good families did not take up this profession. Generally the job of a poison-girl was done by socially-outcast women. These socially-outcast women engaged in important work were called <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;s</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><li>Dance is a science but is presented through artistic skill. The dancers who acquired special proficiency in this artistic skill were called <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;s</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><li>Acting is also an art of high order. The actresses who acquired special proficiency in this art were called <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;s</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><li>People who propagated the main ideas of a theory or a thesis in the society were called exponents of that theory. Generally the exponents did not explicate their theories themselves; the interpreter was usually a different person. The explication of a theory according to the words used [in the text] was called <I>t&#x301;iika</I>. Special explanation or criticism of a particular part of a theory was called <I>t&#x301;ippani</I> or annotation. General interpretation, glossary and annotations used to be presented separately. But if all these items were rolled into one and incorporated into one discourse, then it was called <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I>. For example, we have <I>Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khyaka&#x301;rika&#x301;, Dha&#x301;matiika&#x301;rika&#x301;, Vaeya&#x301;sikaka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I>, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><li>An idea, whether simple or complex, remains confined to the world of thought unless it receives the golden touch of reality. An unrealized idea is of less value than even the ice of the polar regions. In order to translate an idea into reality, it is essential to combine the wisdom of the mind with a longing [for the implementation of the idea]. The process of manifesting an idea involves several operations. First, there is a mental planning about how to manifest the idea in reality. Secondly, providing the strength necessary to translate the thought into action is required. Thirdly, the strengthening of the infrastructure on the ground for its immediate and subsequent expression must be done. When all these three conditions are harmoniously combined with a touch of expertise, then and only then can an idea attain manifestation in reality. This manifestation of an idea is called <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><li>In very few cases is an idea translated into reality on the strength of one single person or due to the scholarly motivation of that one person. In most cases it needs a medium or more than one medium. This medium is also known as a <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><li>An action is always prompted by an inner inspiration. This inspirational force is sometimes internal in origin [inherent in the individual], at other times external in origin [derived from another person]. Whatever may be the case, it is a kind of <I>samvit</I> [awakened consciousness], and if this <I>samvit</I> is not there, the result is never realized. This <I>samvit</I> is also called <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><li>Every creature needs a means of livelihood for its existence. With this means of livelihood, one preserves one&#146;s physical existence and makes the necessary existential enhancements and refinements. This enhancement, refinement or preservation of one&#146;s structure is referred to as the crude means of living. The lower animals may have some need for a psychic means of livelihood in addition to their need for a physical means of livelihood, but human beings have a great need for a psychic means of livelihood. It is so indispensable &ndash; be it a crude or subtle or causal entity &ndash; that the mind rushes to it and revolves round it. This psychic objectivity is called mental pabulum. In the absence of this mental pabulum a human being loses mental balance and either becomes a lunatic or die. Some animals of a high order also face the same fate. This mental pabulum is also called <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><li>Soon after the beginning of civilization, that is, soon after men formed communities or societies, the practices of lending, borrowing and usury came into existence. The rate of interest was determined in different ages and at different places by the intensity of the need to lend or to borrow. Whatever may be the kind of usury, the entire process of usury is known as <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><li>You have seen the <I>shya&#x301;ma&#x301;</I> bird. A <I>shya&#x301;ma&#x301;</I> bird [a song bird of the thrush family] is a small bird. You also must have heard the song of the <I>shya&#x301;ma&#x301;</I> bird throughout Bengal. Do you recall there is a song by the poet, Satyendranath Datta: <I>Kotha&#x301;y d&#x301;a&#x301;ke doyel shya&#x301;ma&#x301; phiun&#x32D;e ga&#x301;che ga&#x301;che na&#x301;cere</I> [&ldquo;Where do you find that place where <I>doyels<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I> and <I>shya&#x301;ma&#x301;s</I> sing and <I>phiun&#x32D;es<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> </I> dance on the branches of a tree?&rdquo;] Yes,I am talking about that <I>shya&#x301;ma&#x301;</I> bird. This <I>shya&#x301;ma&#x301;</I> bird is also called <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I> bird or <I>ka&#x301;lrika&#x301;</I> bird or <I>ka&#x301;lri</I> bird.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph --><li>All of you must have tasted watermelon. Watermelons are of various kinds. The skin of some is black, of others green, and of still others whitish. Some have red pulp, some slightly reddish, and others yellow. Those with yellow pulp are Chinese watermelons; they are very small in size but extremely sweet. According to botanists, the place of origin of the watermelon is the Arab countries. Whatever may be the case, it is generally presumed that this watermelon first came to Kaliun&#x32D;ga [coastal Orissa] by a sea route. That is why, irrespective of its shape and size, the watermelon is called <I>ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga (kaliun&#x32D;ga + an&#x301;)</I> in chaste Bengali. The black-skinned watermelon in particular is called <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I> or <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> or <I>ka&#x301;liiphalam</I>. A <I>Kharmuja&#x301;</I> [muskmelon] is called <I>kharmuj</I> in Bengali; in Sanskrit it is called <I>sphot&#x301;ak</I> or <I>sphot&#x301;an</I>. And <I>phut&#x301;i</I> or <I>ba&#x301;un&#x32D;gi</I> [another smaller variety] is called <I>sphut&#x301;ika</I>. So you understand that <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I> also means a watermelon with black skin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><li>All of you have eaten curd, or yoghurt. In towns yoghurt is generally bought from the market. But many people curdle milk at home if sufficient milk is available. In order to make <I>dai</I>, or yoghurt (<I>dadhi &gt; dahi &gt; dai</I>), it is necessary to mix some acidic substance after the milk has been heated. This acidic substance is called <I>dadhyamla</I> (<I>dadhi + amla</I>) in Sanskrit, the colloquial Bengali form of which is <I>dambal</I>. In some places <I>dambal</I> is called <I>jor&#x301;an</I>. It is this <I>dambal</I> which is also called <I>ka&#x301;rika&#x301;</I> or <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> or <I>ka&#x301;lrii</I>. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->By using the suffix <I>un&#x301;</I> with the verbal root <I>kr</I>, we get the word <I>ka&#x301;ru</I>. The etymological meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;ru</I> is &ldquo;devotion to work&rdquo; or &ldquo;to go on working efficiently&rdquo;. <ol> <li>In common usage, <I>ka&#x301;ru</I> means any kind of fine work. Whether it is needle work or crochet work, woodwork or work with chisel and hammer, if the final product is of superfine quality, we call it <I>ka&#x301;ru</I>. In this connection you should remember one thing. Only work done by hand is called <I>shilpa</I> [art] or <I>shilpankriya&#x301;</I> [an art product]. In other words, <I>shilpa</I> or <I>shilpana</I> means work in which manual skill is required. If you use the word <I>hastashilpa</I>, you commit the fallacy of tautology, because <I>hastashilpa</I> would literally mean &ldquo;a handicraft made by hand&rdquo;. When referring to a good singer, people sometimes use the word <I>kant&#x301;hashilpii</I> [vocal artist]. The word sounds like the expression &ldquo;a gold iron-cup&rdquo; [or a square circle]. Where is the action of the hand when singing with one&#146;s throat? But one can use the word <I>seta&#x301;rshilpii</I> [sitar artist], because the hands are used when playing the sitar. However, if someone can sing songs of a very high quality, such singing can be placed in the category of <I>ka&#x301;ru</I>, because it is a superior skill.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><li>In ancient times a small, very sharp and whetted chisel called <I>narun&#x301;</I> was used when working with metal and wood. The work done with this kind of chisel is called <I>ka&#x301;ru</I>. There was a time, in Vishnupur of Mallabhum, that <I>narun&#x301;</I> was used in renowned terracotta works.

<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><li>A human being is compelled to do something for survival. Some people use domestic animals in various ways for their livelihood. For example, a person domesticates bulls to use them in tilling the soil or in pulling the cart. A bull does not till the soil or draw a cart on his own. Some persons pull rickshaws, others drive taxis, run shops, write books, and still others teach students &ndash; all these are means of livelihood. All these are public vocations; there is nothing secret about them. This kind of public vocation is also called <I>ka&#x301;ru</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph --><li>Many people often have a secret profession in addition to their public profession.

In some cases the income from this secret profession is much more than the income from their public means of livelihood. Their public profession in such cases is only a charade.

There are some persons also who not only avoid <I>ka&#x301;rukaran&#x301;a</I> [rigorous bath] but avoid their usual bath on some pretext or the other. Such a person would sometimes say, &ldquo;Today it is very cold,&rdquo; or sometimes would say, &ldquo;Today I have caught a cold,&rdquo; or again at another time would say, &ldquo;Today I am in a great hurry, so in spite of my willingness, I cannot have a bath today.&rdquo; We shall call such persons bath-sensitive.

According to this legend, Brahma&#x301;, [mythological god of creation], at the request of Yama [god of death], created Citragupta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (the forefather of the Kayastha caste) out of his own body. In the capacity of office superintendent, Citragupta keeps the records of the death ceremonies of the world for the god Yama. Similarly, Brahma&#x301; created Vishvakarma&#x301; from his body at the request of Baebasvata Manu. Of course Brahma&#x301;, according to Baevasvata Manu, had been carrying on the act of creation, but due to his unsophisticated knowledge of art, his creations were becoming very uninteresting. It is said that the moment he was born, Vishvakarma&#x301; brought about a flow of infinite variety in creation. After the last day of Bha&#x301;dra [the fifth month of the Bengalee calendar, from mid-August to mid-September], the picturesque variety of autumnal beauty becomes conspicuous throughout the land. So in some parts of the country people worship Vishvakarma&#x301;, the god of artistic creativity, on the last day of Bha&#x301;dra.<!-- /block --></p>

Different parts of the camel have similarities to the parts of various animals. A Bactrian camel has two humps. On another similar occasion, Vishvakarma&#x301; paused and, putting together parts of different horned animals, created a new kind of horned animal. It is this horned animal which is known as <I>niilga&#x301;i</I>, or the Indian antelope. He paused for the third time when planning the creation of a tree that can be compared to a human being. This time he happened to create the coconut. Do you not you think that the different parts of a coconut have similarities with various parts of a human being?

In common usage, by <I>ka&#x301;la</I> we understand the following: <ol> <li>A measurement of time. The moon moves around the earth. In its orbit, it crosses the twelve houses of the zodiac. The mind&#146;s measurement of this single revolution is called <I>ka&#x301;la</I> [which sometimes means &ldquo;time&rdquo; in general], and this particular time taken by the moon is called a lunar month. For nearly half of this lunar month the moon remains in a diminishing or waning process due to the narrowing of the reflection of the sun. The rest of the time it remains in a gradually waxing condition due to the broadening of the reflection of the sun. So we have divided the lunar month into two fortnights &ndash; the bright fortnight (<I>shukla paks&#x301;a)</I> and the dark fortnight <I>(krs&#x301;n&#x301;a paks&#x301;a)</I>, starting with the new moon and the full moon respectively.

<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph --><p>The time taken by the earth to go around the sun when it passes through the twelve houses of the zodiac is called a solar year (365 or 366 days). During this solar year, because of the angular difference in the axis, sometimes the northern part of the earth tilts towards the sun, and at other times the southern part. Accordingly we sometimes say &ldquo;northern tilt&rdquo; [summer solstice], and at other times &ldquo;southern tilt&rdquo; [winter solstice]. In order to present it symbolically, we say that the sun is in the Tropic of Cancer or in the Tropic of Capricorn. All these are also measurements of time. Every house of the zodiac subtends an angle of 30 degrees at the centre. Although in every case it makes a 30 degree angle, the segments of the orbit are not equal. So the earth takes different times to cross the various segments. We call the time taken to cross one segment a solar month. A solar month generally consists of 30 or 31 days, but in rare cases it may also be 29 or even 32 days. All these are <I>ka&#x301;las</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph --><p>The mental measurement of the motivity of action and the result of the measurement are called time.

This tree, belonging to the <I>sarica indica</I> family, has thick and bushy foliage. But a pine tree or <I>deoda&#x301;r</I> is tall and straight. Pine wood is used in making paper and also in making matchsticks. The gum or resin of the pine tree has many chemical uses and is also used for medicinal purposes. The word <I>rasa&#x301;in&#x32D;jana</I> is used for both the gum and the oil of pine. The special name for pine oil is <I>rasataela</I>. Another name for resins or pine &ndash; <I>rasa&#x301;in&#x32D;jana &ndash;</I> is <I>ka&#x301;la</I>. Pine oil has been in use as a medicine for phlegmatic diseases.

On entering the tree, these insects eat up parts of the tree and produce a black-coloured juice from their bodies through a [particular] chemical process. Since ancient times, this black juice is well known as <I>aguru</I>. The tree is called <I>a&#x301;gara</I> because it [<I>aguru</I>] is obtained from this tree. <I>A&#x301;gara</I> trees grow in regions where there is heavy rainfall.

A g<I>oks&#x301;ura</I> is called <I>gokhro</I> in the Kolkata region.

The <I>Gokhro</I> variety of snake generally lives in an old house in a residential area. When the tail of a very old <I>goks&#x301;ura</I> falls off, quite often the people, instead of killing it, allow it to live in the house, and then they call it <I>va&#x301;stusa&#x301;pa</I> [a residential snake]. The <I>keut&#x301;e</I> or cobra has several species and subspecies, such as <I>ka&#x301;lakeut&#x301;e, a&#x301;lkeut&#x301;e</I>, etc. A cobra generally lives outdoors in fields away from human habitation. <I></I>The <I>ka&#x301;lakeut&#x301;e</I> generally lives away from human habitation in forests, bushes and shrubs.<!-- /block --></p>

Although <I>a&#x301;lkeut&#x301;e</I> is short, thin and as poisonous as any snake of the cobra family, its temper is always very hot ... If any person walking on the ridge inadvertently disturbs its peace, it at once rushes out and bites that person. But other snakes do not rush out to bite; they bite only in self-defence. <I>A&#x301;lkeut&#x301;e, ka&#x301;lakeut&#x301;e</I> and common <I>keut&#x301;e &ndash;</I> all three &ndash; cannot stand heat.

On hearing the sound of a coming train, other snakes flee the rail lines, but the ill-tempered <I>keut&#x301;e</I> does not. Possibly it thinks, &ldquo;Whom do I fear enough to run away from?&rdquo; Accordingly it remains on the line.

Generally it can be said that the few snakes we find in cold countries are nonpoisonous. Snakes live primarily in tropical countries, particularly where there are adequate wet lands. In Bengal, India and Southeast Asia, particularly in the land of <I>Shya&#x301;mdesh</I> [Thailand], the number of snakes and reptiles is exorbitantly high.
