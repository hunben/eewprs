<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Is the misery less even if one is bound with chains made of gold? No, bondage is bondage, be [the chains] made of gold or iron. The bondage of satkarma [good actions] is that of gold, and that of asatkarma [bad actions], iron. Either of them is to be broken off. One has to refrain from bad actions so that the chains of iron might not be forged; and good actions are to be effected, but what one has to do is to offer the chains made of gold at the feet of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;: &ldquo;I do not desire the fruits of my good actions, O Lord! I offer them to Thee.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As long as the physical body exists, some actions are bound to be performed. No one can help doing actions. [Respiration] is itself an action. Once I said that even if one does not desire to do any action and sleeps, then that sleep, too, is an action. Actions must be performed &ndash; not bad actions, but good ones, which too are to be offered to Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Even after crores of kalpas [aeons] the reactions of actions are not exhausted. This continues to be so as long as the reactions have not been experienced.&rdquo; How will the reactions of the actions be exhausted? Karmabhogena ks&#x301;iiyate &ndash; &ldquo;When the reactions are experienced, then only are they exhausted.&rdquo; Avashyameva bhoktavyam&#x301; krtam&#x301; karmashubha&#x301; shubham &ndash; &ldquo;one has performed good actions, so their fruits are to be enjoyed; so also is it with bad actions.&rdquo; Hence one has to be cautious while performing actions. After that, repentance will fetch no benefit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Avashyameva bhoktavyam&#x301; krtam&#x301; karmashubha&#x301; shubham. Now the question arises whether the reactions will be just [equal] to the actions, or less, or more. Equal and opposite reaction is [the rule], but then, whether the enjoyment of the reaction of actions is purely psychic or physico-psychic is to be seen. Where the action is purely mental, the reaction will be just [equal] to that. But if the action is physico-psychic, the question is, what will be the reaction? Still one thing is there, that if the mind is not affected by the physico-psychic action, nothing happens.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> But [usually] when the reaction is physico-psychic, it has more effect than the action performed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->If it is purely psychic, the reaction will be just equal to it. [But] the reaction of the physico-psychic action does not affect the mind cent per cent. A person enjoys [psychic] reactions just [equal] to the actions performed. If there be some quantity of the reaction of physico-psychic action [that affects the body], in that case, the reaction will be much more than the action performed. The mind will be affected just according to the psychic action &ndash; that is the case with psychic actions. [But] if the action is physico-psychic, some of the reactions [affect] the mind, some [do] not. That which affects the mind is  a psychic reaction, that which does not is physical. Among these reactions, the one that is in the pure physical sphere does not affect the mind. The pure psychic coupled with the [physical] of a physico-psychic reaction add up to produce a greater reaction. So the quantity of reaction in case of a physico-psychic action becomes much greater. Hence one should be careful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->There are so many grades of sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual practitioner]. Some say, &ldquo;O Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, please get my sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras exhausted as soon as possible. Give to me whatever is there.&rdquo; [But] some say, &ldquo;I am ready to bear the fruits of my own [actions] and I am also ready to bear the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of others.&rdquo; There are varieties of feeling. Some want to carry the burdens of others so that others might not be in trouble. Sa&#x301;dhakas are at different stages, and their feelings are just according to their stages. While doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a sa&#x301;dhaka reaches a stage where pu&#x301;rn&#x301;a bhakti [cent per cent devotion] is aroused for Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. Then one remains unassailed even if a cyclone of misery attacks him or her. One feels maximum torture in the mind, but he or she little cares for it, taking it to be the benediction of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; Himself. Torture is there but he or she derives bliss from it. The sa&#x301;dhaka of that stage is called dagdhabiija [burnt seed]. A dagdhabiija comes within the range of psychic directly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Biija means &ldquo;seed&rdquo;. Wherever a seed is sown, it [sprouts into] a plant; but where the seed is burnt, a plant is not produced. A sa&#x301;dhaka becomes dagdhabiija when he or she has no more pain or pleasure of his or her own. One who has surrendered in toto and has not kept in hand even a single paisa of it, is alone dagdhabiija. All carry their own burdens, but if a dagdhabiija sa&#x301;dhaka so desires, he or she can carry the burdens of others also. And those who want to carry the burden of others do lessen the burden of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; indirectly. You should remember this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Do not remain worried about your individual problems at all. Be prepared to carry your own burden and be prepared also to carry the burdens of others. Then alone are you brave. Be dagdhabiija. Everyone has his or her own individual problems. Do not try to pass them on to others. On the contrary, bear the burdens of others. No one is your enemy. Be ready to bear the burdens of others.<!-- /block --></p>
