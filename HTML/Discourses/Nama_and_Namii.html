<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->To call a person or a thing, a name is needed. And what is a name? A name is not just a word. The bha&#x301;va, or ideation, for an object goes together with its name. And it is essential to bear in mind that one cannot name oneself, somebody else does the naming.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There is an old problem &ndash; which is more powerful, Parama Purus&#x301;a or His name? Before leaping across the ocean, Hanuman consulted Rama about it. Rama replied, &ldquo;Go ahead, Hanuman. You can jump across the ocean. But I cannot.&rdquo; Hanuman said, &ldquo;Yes, I will be able to cross the ocean.&rdquo; And Rama asked him, &ldquo;How will you be able to cross it?&rdquo; Hanuman replied, &ldquo;With your power.&rdquo; Rama asked, &ldquo;How [will you get My power]?&rdquo; And Hanuman replied, &ldquo;I will take your name, then I will jump.&rdquo; Hence the na&#x301;ma [name] is more powerful than the na&#x301;mii.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Why is it more powerful? A scientific explanation is needed here.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The named, before being named, remains nameless. When there were no devotees, God had no name &ndash; He was nameless. When there came to be devotees, then God became named God.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->I was saying in Delhi that the fight between God and devotees is an old fight, a sweet fight. And what is that fight? God says to devotees, &ldquo;It is you who are superior. Because of you, I have been named. Had it not been for you, who would have called me by the name of God? Even if I was God, I was not &lsquo;God&rsquo;. Because of you, I have become God.&rdquo; And devotees say, &ldquo;You are the base of my life. In Your absence, the existence of my life becomes jeopardized. You have created, and You alone are the base.&rdquo; Devotees consider God to be superior, and vice versa. This fight to make the other superior has no end.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now, let us see why the name is more powerful than the named. The shakti, or energy, in the name is kendrita &ndash; centralized. It is stambhita &ndash; latent. But when a name comes into being, it means a namer has come, and through the name, the named is addressed. In that situation, the latent power in the name gets activated. You know that from the beginning there has been a system of writing on&#x32D;m in which there is a dot and a crescent. The dot represents energy [in potential form], it represents cognition in potential form. There is no expression. And this mark [the crescent] represents expression. When the latent energy becomes activated, this mark will be the symbolic representation of the activation &ndash; that is, energy is now no longer latent, rather it is translated into action. As long as energy is latent, it is as good as not being energy. When the energy is activated, when it is expressed, then people will take it as energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Rabindranath was a great poet. Had the poetic genius in him not got expression and remained latent, the world would not have taken him to be a great poet. Had he composed his poems in his mind and not written them, he would not have won acceptance by the people as a great poet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the same way, when the namer does not name, the named is powerless. Therefore it is said that the name has greater power than the named.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->For example, Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; He is the beloved of all. In [old] Sanskrit there is a word bapra. Bapra means &ldquo;dear&rdquo;. Bapra became bappa in Pra&#x301;krta. In Ardha Pra&#x301;krta it first became ba&#x301;ppa&#x301;, and then changed to bapu and then to ba&#x301;ba&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->So the meaning of the word ba&#x301;ba&#x301; is &ldquo;dear&rdquo;. As Parama Purus&#x301;a is the beloved of all, so all are beloved for Parama Purus&#x301;a. So when Parama Purus&#x301;a is &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;&rdquo; for units, for Parama Purus&#x301;a the units are also ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. This is because the relationship is that of love, in which there is no scope for superior or inferior, higher or lower &ndash; all are equal. Whether the devotee is greater or God is greater, each is ba&#x301;ba&#x301; for the other. Why wait for the decision of the fight?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->A person addresses Parama Purus&#x301;a as he or she wishes to. Therefore the named has to be named. [But as regards the extent to which a name is] ideational (bha&#x301;vava&#x301;haka) &ndash; the name Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot be so very  ideational. [Whereas] the more [an ideational] name is taken, the more the bliss increases. Is it clear?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->And what should be [that ideational] name? The most proper name for Parama Purus&#x301;a, the most suitable name, the most activating name that a person can use, is that person&#146;s own Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> For that person, other names of Parama Purus&#x301;a are no name at all. This is the correct attitude. As you have heard before, once Hanuman was asked, &ldquo;You are well-versed and you know one thousand and one names for Parama Purus&#x301;a, yet you keep repeating &lsquo;Rama, Rama&rsquo;. Why?&rdquo; To this Hanuman replied &ndash; and his reply was full of teaching &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Shriina&#x301;the Ja&#x301;nakiina&#x301;the ca&#x301;bheda Parama&#x301;tmani;<br>Tatha&#x301;pi mama sarvasvah Ra&#x301;mah kamalalocanah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I know that Shriina&#x301;tha and Ja&#x301;nakiina&#x301;tha are one from the spiritual point of view.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> From the spiritual point of view Shriina&#x301;tha and Ja&#x301;nakiina&#x301;tha are one and inseparable.&rdquo; Tatha&#x301;pi mama sarvasvah &ndash; &ldquo;Nevertheless, Rama is everything for me, and I do not recognize Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a or anybody else. For me the word &lsquo;Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a&rsquo; has no value.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So you must remember, the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra of a person is everything for that person; other mantras are no mantra for that person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Hence human beings must name Parama Purus&#x301;a. If somebody says, &ldquo;Don&#146;t name Parama Purus&#x301;a, simply do dhya&#x301;na [meditation],&rdquo; you will discover something while meditating, also &ndash; that one has to address Parama Purus&#x301;a by name, otherwise one is not satisfied. When you meditate you have a wish to address the meditated, to say something to that party. That is, again the name comes up. Though the name is something limited, the human mind cannot help using it. Ultimately the name and the namer will no longer remain, only the named will remain. But as long as the namer and name do remain, the name has to be used &ndash; simply because one can&#146;t help it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->People see the liila&#x301; [play] of Parama Purus&#x301;a all around. The whole universe is expressed because of His liila&#x301;. What does liila&#x301; mean? Where you see the effect but not the cause, that is liila&#x301;. Where you see the effect together with the cause, that is not liila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->A human cannot do liila&#x301;, only Parama Purus&#x301;a can do it, because a human&#146;s mind cannot grasp the liila&#x301;&#146;s cause. If someone considers himself or herself to be very wise and traces different causes behind different effects, that person will still not be able to reach the first cause, because the theory of causality works only in the arena of mind and the arena of time, space, and person. So when at the last point the effect is found within the scope of time, space, and person, but the cause remains beyond that spatio-temporo-personal boundary, one will not be able to catch the cause, as one&#146;s mind will not work there &ndash; the cause has gone beyond the boundary of the mind. The theory of causality was founded by Maharshi Kanada. Kanada said, Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;vat ka&#x301;rya&#x301;bha&#x301;vah &ndash; &ldquo;Where there is no [cause] there is no [effect].&rdquo; The theory is correct, but a human can only find those causes which are within the scope of the mind &ndash; that which is beyond the scope of the mind cannot be found. That is, one&#146;s intellect is limited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So a person gives a name to Parama Purus&#x301;a to the extent that he or she understands within the scope of time, space, and person. And when, while [repeating] that name, they reach the named, they find that the named is beyond relativities. Then the mind tries to catch Him by [transcending] the relativities, and when it goes beyond them, it is absorbed in sama&#x301;dhi. The sama&#x301;dhi is in Parama Purus&#x301;a, because the sama&#x301;dhi is beyond the relativity. This is the science of sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The language of humans and the capacity of that language is greatly limited. Whatever you feel in the mind cannot necessarily be expressed in language. If you are given hard candy, rasagolla&#x301;, and per&#x301;a&#x301;, you will call them sweet. But are these sweets really similar? No. The sweetness of everything differs. But you do not have separate words in your dictionary for the separate kinds of sweetness. If you are pricked with a small pin, or a cut is made on your body somewhere with a knife, you will utter, &ldquo;Uhhh!&rdquo; in both cases. But it is difficult to understand which &ldquo;Uhhh!&rdquo; is indicative of which pain. Therefore language is more limited than bha&#x301;va [feelings]. And bha&#x301;va is very, very limited in comparison to maha&#x301;bha&#x301;va [eternal bliss]. And when people are established in maha&#x301;bha&#x301;va, they become bliss itself. How can this be expressed through language? So where there is less bliss, people will talk a lot, and where there is a maximum of it, people will be silent. Language has no place where there is a maximum of bliss, because it has no capacity there. Still people try to the best of their capacity. They continue to search for different adjectives for Parama Purus&#x301;a. Therefore the poet Padmadanta said about Parama Purus&#x301;a:<!-- /block --></p>

People used to make ink by mixing it in water.) Take an ink tablet. You want to describe the qualities of Parama Purus&#x301;a. (By explaining the qualities, the name will come. As per the description of the qualities, you will develop the name. You have decided to write the qualities first and the name later.) In order to write, you require ink, an ink tablet. &ldquo;Suppose you get an ink tablet as big as the Himalayas&rdquo; &ndash; Asitagirisamam sya&#x301;t kajjalam&#x301; sindhupa&#x301;tre &ndash; &ldquo;and your ink pots are the oceans.&rdquo; Surataruvarasha&#x301;kha&#x301; lekhanii &ndash; &ldquo;the imaginary pa&#x301;rija&#x301;ta tree, which spreads from heaven to hell, is taken as a pen.&rdquo; &ldquo;And the entire earth serves as the paper&rdquo; &ndash; pa&#x301;tramu&#x301;rvii. &ldquo;Now if Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; [the goddess of learning] writes for eternity&rdquo; &ndash; likhati yadi Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; sarvaka&#x301;lam &ndash; &ldquo;even then she will not be able to describe all the qualities of Parama Purus&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; tatha&#x301;pi tava gun&#x301;a&#x301;na&#x301;miisha pa&#x301;ram&#x301; na yati. Still people try because they cannot help it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Now, you see that sometimes people do actions which they should not do. Does that mean that Parama Purus&#x301;a will become dissatisfied with those people?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->When that which should not be done is done, it is known as pa&#x301;pa [sin of commission]; and when that which should be done is not done, it is known as pratyava&#x301;ya [sin of omission]. For example, service to society should be done, and if it is not done, it is pratyava&#x301;ya. Stealing should not be done, and if it is done, it is pa&#x301;pa. But is it pa&#x301;pa? No, your relationship with Parama Purus&#x301;a is beyond vice and virtue. It is your personal relationship with Him. A two-year-old child may sit on the lap of its father, may even pass stool or urine &ndash; the father is quite respectable and learned &ndash; but does the father kick the child out and say that the child has committed a sin? No. Your relationship with Parama Purus&#x301;a is entirely personal. Suppose on some whim you have said something bad about Parama Purus&#x301;a, why should He get angry? So do not think that Parama Purus&#x301;a will get angry. Whatever you do will be to the satisfaction of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Why do you worship Parama Purus&#x301;a? [Because the gift of your mind pleases Him.] Why will you do social service? The world is His creation, so if you serve the world, Parama Purus&#x301;a will be satisfied. Whatever you do, you do for the satisfaction of Parama Purus&#x301;a. People should not forget this. There is no question of vice and virtue with Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->There is a story about the cowherds and Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Once Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a fell seriously ill. All the doctors of all the hospitals of Mathura treated Him, but in vain. Ultimately people asked Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Himself for the remedy of His disease. He said, &ldquo;If some devotee will give the dust from their feet, and if that is rubbed on my forehead, I will be cured.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->So Narada was asked to go about and procure the dust from the feet of a devotee. But people refused to give the dust from their feet, as they did not want that dust to be rubbed on the forehead of the Lord. They said that even to listen to such a thing was sinful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Narada could not get any dust from anywhere. Then he went to Vrindavana, where he saw many cowherds tending the cows. They gave the dust from their feet and told Narada to use it if it would help the Lord. They further said that if the dust did not work, that would prove that they were not devotees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->But Narada said to them, &ldquo;What kind of devotees are you? Will you give the dust from your feet to be put on the Lord&#146;s forehead? Will that not be a sin?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
