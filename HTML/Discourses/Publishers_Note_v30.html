<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam (&ldquo;Blissful Discourses&rdquo;) series assembles all the known General Darshan discourses given by Ma&#x301;rga Guru Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti. General Darshan (GD) speeches, or discourses, were those given to Ananda Marga members, often as a part of the daily routine, in whatever locality Ma&#x301;rga Guru happened to be staying in at the time. Normally briefer and lighter in tone (though no less profound in their fundamental meanings) than the discourses given on the formal occasions of Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (DMC), these talks were sometimes delivered in a very intimate way to relatively small groups of Margis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Ananda Vacana&#x301;mrtam series was begun in 1978 with the GD discourses given by the author at that time; it then kept pace with the GD discourses that the author gave over the subsequent six years. Starting with Part 23, the series has included GD speeches given before 1978. Most of the contents of this present volume is from that earlier period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In this present volume, ten discourses (most of them quite short) have been assigned to the appendix &ldquo;From the Notebooks of Devotees&rdquo; in the last pages of the book. These are discourses that were recovered in the form of typed discourse notes; or in the form of typed transcripts of tapes where the original tape was no longer available to be checked. It was thought advisable to locate these discourses separately. Writers who wish to quote from these discourses should attribute the material to the &ldquo;Ananda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 30 appendix&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Normally within each Ananda Vacana&#x301;mrtam the discourses appear in chronological order. Although in this volume the appendix has been separated from the main text, within the main text and within the appendix, respectively, the chronological order has been maintained. Note that an interesting series of discourses given by the author in Patna on the 14th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 21st of December, 1971, has been included here &ndash; but since tape recordings are still available only for the first four of these discourses, the last two have been assigned to the appendix.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Under our normal procedures the discourse &ldquo;The Dialogues of Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii &ndash; 5&rdquo; would have been published together with the other 1967 &ldquo;Dialogues of Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii&rdquo; in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 23; but this dialogue had not been recovered at the time that that book was published. (Though this dialogue has been numbered &ldquo;5&rdquo;, since four had already been published and numbered, it was not actually the last of the series. It may have been third.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Similarly, &ldquo;Beware of Dogma&rdquo; would normally have been published together with the author&#146;s other 1979 Istanbul discourses in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 14. It was not available at the time that book was published, however, so it has been included here.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate here &ndash; in addition to the original language of each speech, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if other than in this book, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the cases of some of the discourses published here, no written record was found of the language in which the discourse was given; but if the language could be clearly inferred from the location and other circumstances of the discourse, we have cited that language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the editors have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Eds.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

The only other set of notes available in the same typing as that of this discourse [and the next] is of a DMC in Ranchi on &ldquo;25-5-69&rdquo;, a date and place corroborated by two GD&#146;s in Ranchi on 23 May 69 and one on 24 May 69. That the author toured the Philippines in April only is also corroborated by evidence regarding the author&#146;s tour from Indian magazines. So we have dated this discourse and the following one as April, not May, 1969.
