<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was essentially a spiritual entity, but fortunately the common masses had a chance to see Him in human form. Even in that capacity He controls all other physical entities. Each and every structure has a centre (kendra) of its own and a good number of sub-centres (upakendra).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The major part of human existence is mental; only a minor part is physical. An undeveloped human being is a big problem. It&#146;s not enough for a person to have a human body. He or she must have an evolved mind; otherwise he or she cannot be called human.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->All these sub-centres are controlled by the Cosmic Nucleus, that is, Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. But all the sub-centres are not Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The pineal gland or sahasra&#x301;ra cakra controls the entire human body. Each and every entity, whether unicellular or multicellular, has certain substations which are basically ideational. The piithas affect the nerve-cells and nerve-fibres, and these affected nerve-cells and nerve-fibres affect the mind in their turn, and thus the crude mind affects the subtle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Sometimes in the course of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; a deliberate and conscious relationship is established between mind and Consciousness. The closer the relationship, the better it is for spiritual realization. This is the fundamental difference between a spiritual aspirant and a non-aspirant, and the scientific and systematic endeavour to establish the closest relationship between the unit mind and Cosmic Consciousness is termed &ldquo;yoga.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Depending upon the difference in the controlling points of the cakras, spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; can take either of two forms: (1) Controlling the hormone secretion of the glands and strengthening the controlling points of the cakras is the system known as hatha yoga, because it is more physical in character. This science is more extroversive in character and consequently part of avidya tantra. (2) To surrender one&#146;s mind to Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; This is introversive or ideational in character and is part of Vidya&#x301; Tantra. This is the real sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, where the entire psycho-physical entity surrenders itself to Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The meeting point between Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and the jiiva&#x301;tma is just below the pineal gland or sahasra&#x301;ra cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Each sub-centre is related to the next sub-centre. Of the two cakras, the lower one is comparatively crude. The physical control of any cakra is exercised by the controlling point of that cakra, but its ideational control is exercised by the controlling point of the next higher cakra. For instance, the svadhisthana cakra cannot have full control, both physical and ideational, over all the nerve-cells and nerve-fibres attached to the svadhisthana cakra; rather the ideational aspect of the control remains with the manipura cakra. The sahasrara cakra of pineal gland exercises no crude physical control, that&#146;s why it is absolutely spiritual in character.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This point is the subtlest mental point. Paramashiva is, as it were, the minutest, the subtlest, point The pure &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is the causal matrix or Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; shakti. By dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; this causal matrix or Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; shakti comes in contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a utilizes the pituitary gland of any human framework. Whenever a direct contact between Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and the unit mind is established, human beings attain salvation. For this the mind must be absolutely pure. In certain different stages ajin&#x32D;a cakra comes in contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a controls the centre and the sub-centres both directly and indirectly. Parama&#x301;tman Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a controls all the pure spiritual ideation, and Jiiva&#x301;tman Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a controls psycho-spiritual ideations. For sa&#x301;dhakas, the only mission is to surrender at the feet of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a by strengthening the physical sub-centres. He maintains His association with the microcosms either as Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti or as Cosmic Nucleus.<!-- /block --></p>
