<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Sama&#x301;ja gurus [social preceptors] are those who lead the entire society by virtue of their extraordinary intelligence, deep wisdom, towering personality and leadership ability. Hence it can be easily imagined that this world has been blessed with few such social preceptors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Kaolas are those who do kula sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [the spiritual practice for the elevation of the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii] and elevate their minds to the level of Cosmic Consciousness through the realm of intuition by turning microcosmic negativity into Macrocosmic positivity. A Maha&#x301;kaola is one who makes others kaola by his infallible spiritual guidance. But Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is quite a different Entity, a unique Entity, for He is spiritual preceptor, social preceptor, kaola and Maha&#x301;kaola all in one. He is also something more: He acts as a compass in every stratum of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sada&#x301;shiva was Ta&#x301;raka Brahma. As sovereign preceptor He did whatever was necessary for the undeveloped humanity of that age, providing inspiration and active help in every sphere of intellect in human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Humanity advanced a lot during the time of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. But together with the flowering of human intellect there arose various mundane, social and psychic problems. To solve those problems Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had to play various roles. Naturally the question as to which role was more significant and which less significant, or which situation was more difficult and which less difficult, is of no consequence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time philosophy was undeveloped. Even though the sage Maharshi Kapila had been born before Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, his philosophical ideas had not been elaborated on, commented on, annotated, etc. The great Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya commentator Iishvarakrs&#x301;n&#x301;a, a follower of Kapila, was born much later. So there existed no particular philosophy in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time in the light of which Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s activities could be judged.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->At the time of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, our present age lay far in the future. It is not possible to judge Him properly from the perspective of the present age, because people today are not at all familiar with the environment of the age in which He lived. Nevertheless, we can analyse His activities in the light of the various schools of philosophical thought which have been discovered (or we could say invented) since His time and say how far His actions agreed with or deviated from their philosophical outlook.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy is accepted as the oldest school of philosophy. Kapila, its founder, declared as its principal idea that the fundamental elements which make up the jagat [the world], the jiivas [microcosms] and Iishvara [God] have been specifically enumerated; that is, the world is a composite of those twenty-four elements. (Those elements were not elements in the sense in which contemporary science uses the word.) In Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, for practical purposes recognition was given to God as Janya Iishvara<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->. But the main role of director of the universal drama in the flow of creation was assigned to Prakrti [the Operative Principle], and thus She was given another name as well &ndash; Pradha&#x301;na [Foremost]. The presence of Purus&#x301;a [Consciousness] is like that of a catalytic agent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->For instance, gold is used as a catalyst in the preparation of makaradhvaja [a type of a&#x301;yurvaedik medicine]. Once it has been prepared, the gold can easily be separated out. Yet makaradhvaja thus prepared is called svarn&#x301;a-ghat&#x301;ita makaradhvaja [gold-made makaradhvaja] &ndash; gold was the catalytic agent. Similarly, in the Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy it has been recognized that Purus&#x301;a does not actually do anything, yet without His presence nothing can take place in the universe. Purus&#x301;a does not actually do anything Himself; in this sense it is all the same whether Purus&#x301;a is there or not. It is the vast, dominant Prakrti which does everything. Purus&#x301;a is seen as the entity which remains inseparably associated with the countless tiny jiivas. Thus the chief contention of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy is that there are many purus&#x301;as but only one Prakrti. Behind this one Prakrti and many purus&#x301;as there is the presence of one catalytic agent (i.e., whose existence is indispensable), a kind of iishvara [controller] called Janya Iishvara. That is, everything is done because of [janya] this Entity, hence Janya Iishvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, if we consider Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, we see that Ekameva&#x301;dvitiiyam &ndash; &ldquo;Purus&#x301;a is one without a second, and all the jiivas are Prakrti.&rdquo; Here there is not a singular Prakrti but a multiplicity of Prakrtis. What is the nature of Prakrti? Prakrti Sa&#x301; nityanivrtta&#x301; [&ldquo;Prakrti always undergoes change and decay, little by little&rdquo;]. In this respect She can be likened to ghee, which grows radiant when it comes in contact with fire but ultimately burns itself out. In the same manner Prakrti (and every jiiva is Prakrti) is nityanivrtta&#x301; [&ldquo;constantly decaying&rdquo;]. When the jiivabha&#x301;va [microcosmic bearing] becomes pinnacled and advances towards Parama Purus&#x301;a to the complete exclusion of all other thoughts, becomes &ldquo;I don&#146;t want anything of this world, I want only Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Entity,&rdquo; it is termed &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;. This is the expression of the single-minded devotion of the microcosmic mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Many people are not aware of the real import of the term &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;. The actual import is this: When the human mind realizes that nothing of this quinquelemental world is permanent, that nothing is absolute or final, that all thoughts and activities are extremely brief and transient, that the only reality is Parama Purus&#x301;a, and says, &ldquo;I will run only after Him, not after anything else,&rdquo; that very mentality is Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. How long can human beings hope to remain alive? One hundred or one hundred twenty years at most. During Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time, there was a popular belief that the average human life span was one hundred twenty years. Later on this idea changed and people began to believe that the average longevity of human beings was one hundred eight years. The earlier idea is mentioned in Ks&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301;&#146;s saying:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Nara&#x301; gaja&#x301; bishe sha-y ta&#x301;r ardhek ba&#x301;nce hay;<br>Ba&#x301;ish balda tera cha&#x301;gla&#x301; bale gela bara&#x301; pa&#x301;gla&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[Humans and elephants live for one hundred twenty years. A horse lives for half that time; a bullock for twenty-two years, and a goat for thirteen years. That was the calculation of the astrologer Baraha.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Human beings and elephants live for one hundred twenty years.&rdquo; No one lives forever, no one eats forever. Not only that, if at one meal someone is offered more food than he or she can eat, he or she will have to decline it: food is not absolute, clothing is not absolute, nothing is absolute&#8230; Parama Purus&#x301;a is the only real entity, the only absolute entity. The further the jiivas move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, the more elevated their minds become. When they reach a very subtle stage of elevation, their concentrated mind-stuff speeds towards Him with the one-pointedness of an arrow. Such a mentality is called Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. One who aspires to know the concept of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;-Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in depth must possess a sufficiently-developed intellect. The Bha&#x301;gavata sha&#x301;stra, considered to be the most authentic texts on the bhakti [devotional] cult, does not give a satisfactory explanation of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; tattva [the concept of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;]. Those texts have failed too.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->What is Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va? When devotees feel in their heart of hearts that their existence is meaningless without attaining Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, that they cannot survive a single moment without feeling His blissful presence, they have attained the stage called Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. Such devotees know nothing other than a&#x301;ra&#x301;dhana&#x301; [total mental absorption in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; the Supreme]. This Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; mentality is found manifest in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and nowhere else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->People come to this world for a short time for some fun and games, and then they go. So for human beings the earth is like a traveller&#146;s inn, where they will not stay for long. Or it might be compared to a railway waiting room, where passengers from different places come and sit together for a while. The moment the train whistle blows, they forget each other, pick up their bags, and set off for the train. They do not look to right or left. Parama Purus&#x301;a Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is that train, and this world is the waiting room.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->This is an extraordinary idea &ndash; this is Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va [the realization of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;], in which a&#x301;ra&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the main thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a is one without any second &ndash; Ekameva&#x301;dvitiiyam. But now I will show that Purus&#x301;a is neither the purus&#x301;a nor the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. According to Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy there are many purus&#x301;as, but in the spiritual cult there is only one Purus&#x301;a. There are many Prakrtis, but one Purus&#x301;a; many Radha&#146;s, but one Is&#x301;t&#x301;a, one Nucleus; only one sun, but many planets and satellites orbiting around that singular sun. The significance of human existence does not lie in philosophy or in argument, but in racing after Parama Purus&#x301;a. This beautiful notion will not be found anywhere except in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. There is not even a passing reference to it in any scripture or philosophical text.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Earlier I mentioned that the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy can be compared to the gold which is used as a catalyst in the preparation of svarn&#x301;a-ghat&#x301;ita makaradhvaja. He is there, passive, watching everything, but doing nothing in particular. But Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a as Purus&#x301;ottama, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a as Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, is extremely active (this concept of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is completely alien to Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy). Unlike the Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya purus&#x301;a, Ta&#x301;raka Brahma calls everyone towards Himself: &ldquo;Come, come, come to Me. I have come here for you and you alone. I am verily yours. Come and surrender to Me without any hesitation, without any reservation. I will take care of your future.&rdquo; Ta&#x301;raka Brahma provides this great assurance to humanity, and Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is an embodiment of this great assurance. He is not passive like the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Suppose someone is starving, or is being tortured or persecuted. The Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya remains a mute spectator to this suffering (and its witness-ship goes unrecorded), whereas Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a calls to suffering humanity, saying: &ldquo;You, the starving, the persecuted, the tortured, come to Me. I will liberate you.&rdquo; The sweet sound of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s  flute conveys the message of liberation to the ears of all. Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy cannot come anywhere near this idea, cannot even touch Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s fingernail. It is far, far away from the practical reality. Where there is a tremendous expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a, how far can philosophical dabbling solve the actual problems? So we see that the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya and Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a are not the same thing. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is the collection of all the divine qualities and occult powers, whereas the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya is almost a static entity whose presence matters very little to the created beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->According to Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya, a brick, a piece of wood, an insect and a cat each are all purus&#x301;as, and they are all moving about in respective structures which are parts of Prakrti. But with Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a things are quite different. His philosophy is that each and every entity is a partial manifestation of Prakrti on which the one radiated Purus&#x301;a is reflected. When in contact with the purus&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;sa [expression of consciousness], the jiivaprakrti [unit prakrti] realizes that the Cognitive Faculty, the sweet expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a, pleases the hearts and minds of the microcosms. Human beings feel very happy to live in the world because they experience a blissful feeling all over. Madhuram&#x301; madhuram&#x301; sarve hi madhuram&#x301; [&ldquo;Everything in this universe is saturated with sweetness&rdquo;]. So how blissful must be Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, from whom such sweet vibrations come! A rasagolla&#x301; [Indian sweet] definitely tastes sweet, but Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is an infinite number of times sweeter &ndash; sweeter beyond measure. Thus as soon as jiivas understand deeply who Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is, they rush towards Him with a fervent desire to merge in Him &ndash; this is jaeva dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The interesting thing is that here jaeva dharma, ma&#x301;nava dharma and Aeshvariiya dharma<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> are combined harmoniously, fusing together into something excellent and unique. The devotee becomes indifferent to any censure or praise and rushes towards Parama Purus&#x301;a in the form of Manomohana Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a [&ldquo;the one who nourishes the human heart with divine bliss&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is also called Mohana [literally, &ldquo;attractive&rdquo;] because He charms everyone and attracts everyone towards Himself. A devotee does not like to be with Him in the presence of others, but wants to enjoy the intimacy and sweetness of being with Him alone. Such a devotee does not like to think that He belongs to everyone, but to him or her alone. But when the devotee and He are alone together, does the devotee then think, &ldquo;He is all mine&rdquo;? No, the devotee then forgets what to say to Him, and becomes oblivious to himself or herself. When people are self-conscious, hundreds of questions arise in their minds. Only when that self-consciousness merges into Parama Purus&#x301;a, do the questions come to an end. Because in the presence of the Entity who is beyond all questions, the devotee becomes self-forgetful. That is the stance of Cosmic bliss. Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, or for that matter any philosophy, does not come anywhere near that stance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->There is no mention of and no scope for bhakti in Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. Bhakti is like a tether which draws people near. In the cult of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, one remains where one was, and in the case of karma, one remains preoccupied with hundreds of actions. Without the cultivation of bhakti, one can never come in close proximity to Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The cult of devotion first originated during the period of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. (Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a came later.) We find Parama Purus&#x301;a in charming form, in attractive form, in the form of one&#146;s own (more one&#146;s own than anyone else could be), for the first time in human history in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. In the cult of devotion, devotees view Parama Purus&#x301;a from their respective viewpoints according to their individual sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. The people of ancient India adored Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in three different ways: va&#x301;tsalya bha&#x301;va, madhura bha&#x301;va and sakhya bha&#x301;va.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Nanda and Yashoda&#x301; [Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s foster father and mother] adored Him in va&#x301;tsalya bha&#x301;va, whose spirit is: &ldquo;How lovely the child is, how pleasingly He speaks, how charming is His smile, how sweet is his inarticulate &lsquo;Pa-Pa-Pa Ma-Ma-Ma&rsquo;. I shall feed Him, I shall dress Him, I shall bathe Him, I shall make Him laugh. I shall caress Him, placing Him on my lap.&rdquo; Such devotees are busy exclusively with Him. Nanda and Yashoda&#x301; were the first to find the Cosmic bearing of Parama Purus&#x301;a reflected in a tiny child. The name of this bha&#x301;va [attitude, stance] is va&#x301;tsalya bha&#x301;va. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s own father, Vasudeva, and mother, Devakii or Daevakii (one person, two names) were separated from Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a during His childhood and thus were deprived of va&#x301;tsalya bha&#x301;va. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a only returned to them when He was quite mature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; attained Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a through madhura bha&#x301;va. In Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a she found everything that was charming and sweet in life. The spirit of madhura bha&#x301;va is this: &ldquo;I will make my entire existence, whether physical, mental, social or spiritual, one-pointed to derive bliss from my dear Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rdquo; Usually ninety-nine percent of all devotees maintain this Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va due to its sweetness. Never before in history did anyone attain Parama Purus&#x301;a in madhura bha&#x301;va; they attained Him for the first time in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. And Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a increased the degree of sweetness by playing His flute. People might say, &ldquo;I will never look at Him again&rdquo; &ndash; but then the flute sound would come to their ears and they would say, &ldquo;How can I not look at him?&rdquo; Or they might say, &ldquo;I will never even think of Him again, but will remain content to look after my little worldly family&rdquo; &ndash; but then the notes would call to them: &ldquo;Why didn&#146;t you come today? Are you not coming? I&#146;m waiting for You.&rdquo; This is madhura bha&#x301;va. In the history of the world, Parama Purus&#x301;a first appeared as the personification of charm and sweetness, to be attained through madhura bha&#x301;va, in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
