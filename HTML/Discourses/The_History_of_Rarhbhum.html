<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Not in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of black soil, but in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of laterite (red) soil, lie the following villages: Bandyogha&#x301;ti of Birbhum district (the original abode of the Bandyopa&#x301;dhya&#x301;yas, or Banerjees); Mukhot&#x301;i village of Bankura district (the original abode of the Mukhopa&#x301;dhya&#x301;yas, or Mukherjees); Cha&#x301;t&#x301;uti of West Burdwan (the ancestral home of the Chat&#x301;t&#x301;opa&#x301;dhya&#x301;yas, or Chatterjees); Ghos&#x301;li of Manbhum (the ancestral home of the Ghos&#x301;a&#x301;ls); and Gaun&#x32D;golii of West Burdwan District (the ancestral home of the Gaun&#x32D;gopa&#x301;dhya&#x301;yas or Gaun&#x32D;guliis). All these villages are located in the land of laterite soil; none is in the area of black soil. The Baul school of music also originated in the area of laterite soil. In the study of history, this significant fact should be remembered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Still more [[remarkable]] is the fact that all the principalities whose names end in <I>bhu&#x301;m</I> are situated in the land of laterite soil. For example, the northernmost region is called Birbhum. Birbhum comprised Rampurhat Subdivision, Kandi Subdivision, Pakur Subdivision, Sahebganj and Rajmahal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the Austric language, <I>biir</I> means forests; so <I>biirbhu&#x301;m</I> means &ldquo;the land of abundant forests&rdquo;. Next to Birbhum is Gopabhu&#x301;m, which comprised Suri Subdivision, Dumka Subdivision, and Deoghar Subdivision. The Sadgops with the surname of Ghosh used to be the rulers in this area, hence it was called Gopabhu&#x301;m.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Next to Gopabhu&#x301;m was Sa&#x301;mantabhu&#x301;m, which comprised Durgapur Subdivision, Asansol Subdivision, and Jamtara Subdivision of Santhal Parganas. All these are areas of laterite soil. South of Sa&#x301;mantabhu&#x301;m was Mallabhu&#x301;m, comprising the present-day Visnupur Subdivision of Bankura District. Then Senbhu&#x301;m comprising of Bankura Sadar Subdivision. The Vaidyas having the surname of Sen were the rulers here: hence the principality was known as Senbhu&#x301;m and Senpa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii was the capital. Later King Banku Rai built a new city which was named after him, Bankurai. This was subsequently changed to Bankura.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->To the west of Sa&#x301;mantabhu&#x301;m was Shikharbhu&#x301;m, which extended from the Barakar River to Parashnath Hill after Dhanbad. Parashnath Hill was the last boundary of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, but the area was known as Shikharbhu&#x301;m because the name of the hill was Sametshikhar. There is a temple there to Parashnath, but the hill is far more ancient than the temple, so the land was called Shikharbhu&#x301;m.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->To the west of Senbhu&#x301;m was Manbhu&#x301;m, which was named after King Mansing. Manbazar was its capital. South of Manbhu&#x301;m was Barahabhu&#x301;m. Two Munda brothers, Adibarah and Keshbarah, founded this kingdom. Barahabhu&#x301;m comprises Bagmundi, Barahabazar, Balarampur, Candil, Patamda, Icagarh, and Bandoyan. Bandoyan is situated beside the Binpur police station of Jhargram Subdivision of Midnapore District. Barahabazar (Barabazar) was the capital of Barahabhu&#x301;m. (Many people wrongly pronounce the word Barahabazar as Barabazar).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->South or southwest of Birbhum is Singhbhum, and close to Singhbhum is Dhavalbhum. Tatanagar comes within this Dhavalbhum area. All the villages around Tatanagar are Bengali speaking. East of Dhavalbhum is Shavarbhum, which comprises Midnapore North and South Subdivisions. The Shavaras or the Kheriyamundas were its rulers, so the area was named Shavarbhum. The Kheriyas and the Cuya&#x301;r&#x301;s were the original inhabitants of Shavarbhum, and at the southwest of Dhavalbhum and Shavarbhum was Bhain&#x32D;jabhum. The rulers of Bhain&#x32D;jabhum used to place peacock emblems on their crowns and on their thrones: thus Bhain&#x32D;jabhum was also known as Mayurbhain&#x32D;ja (<I>mayu&#x301;r</I> means &ldquo;peacock&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Thus this vast area extending from Birbhum on the north to Bhain&#x32D;jabhum in the south was known as Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hbhu&#x301;m, the land of laterite soil. All the people of this area spoke almost the same dialect of Bengali &ndash; Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali. Of course, there was some difference in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii dialect spoken in Birbhum and the dialects spoken by the Mahatos of Bhain&#x32D;jabhum. There are some similarities also. The main speciality of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii dialect of Bengali is that in the future and past tenses, the suffix <I>ek</I> is used for transitive verbs. For instance, <I>Kii bal-lek?</I> [&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;] or <I>Kutha&#x301; ya&#x301;bek?</I>, [&ldquo;Where will he go?&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Formerly it was written in the third-class compartments in trains, <I>S&#x301;a&#x301;t&#x301; jan basibek</I> [&ldquo;Seats for sixty people&rdquo;]. In Bengali poetry also, the suffix <I>ek</I> was used. In the Bengali compositions of Vidyasagar, <I>ek</I> was widely used. In Bengali poetry, the poet Bharatcandra wrote:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Tatha&#x301;stu baliya&#x301; Devii dila&#x301; barada&#x301;n,<br>Dudhe bha&#x301;te tha&#x301;kibek toma&#x301;r santa&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->[The goddess Devi granted a boon, saying, &ldquo;So be it. Your children will live amidst plenty.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->There are other specialities of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii dialect. In Bengali, the suffixes <I>e</I> and <I>te</I> are used in the seventh case ending; but in the second case ending, they also use <I>e</I> and <I>te</I> to indicate directions. For example, if one says, &ldquo;He lives in, or at, Kolkata,&rdquo; the Bengali sentence will be, <I>Se Kalka&#x301;ta&#x301;y a&#x301;che</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Similarly, if one wants to say, &ldquo;He is going to Kolkata,&rdquo; a person speaking Bengali, will say, <I>Se Kalka&#x301;ta&#x301;y ya&#x301;cche</I>. That is, for three prepositions &ndash; in, at, and to &ndash; the same suffix is used in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In standard or recognized Bengali, the suffix is the same, but in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali it is slightly different. The suffix <I>ke</I> is used to denote direction, and <I>e</I> or <I>te</I> is used as the 7th case ending to denote position in something (like standard Bengali). For example, <I>Se ghare a&#x301;che</I> [&ldquo;He is in the house&rdquo;]. It is the same in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii dialect and in standard Bengali. But if we say, &ldquo;He is going to the house&rdquo; in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali, people will say, <I>Se gharke ya&#x301;cche.</I><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->A woman has gone to a pond for a bath. In standard Bengali we will say, <I>Bhadramahila&#x301; pukure gechen</I> [[literally &ldquo;The lady has gone to the pond&rdquo;]]. But in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali it is said, <I>Bhadramahila&#x301; jalke gechen</I> [[literally &ldquo;The lady has gone to the water&rdquo;]], because the direction is towards the pond.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The poet Rabindranath Tagore has written, <I>Bela&#x301; ye par&#x301;e elo jalke cal</I> [&ldquo;the sun sets, let us go to the pond&rdquo;]. In a <I>Bha&#x301;du</I> song [folk songs of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h] it is said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;t bha&#x301;dute jalke gelo<br>A&#x301;ma&#x301;r bha&#x301;du ka&#x301;r ba&#x301;r&#x301;i,<br>Chay bha&#x301;dute gharke elo<br>A&#x301;mar bha&#x301;du ka&#x301;rba&#x301;r&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[Seven damsels went to the water.<br>Which one is my nearest?<br>Six damsels came back home.<br>Where is my dearest?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There is still another speciality of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii dialect of Bengali. For &ldquo;can&rdquo; and &ldquo;cannot&rdquo;, the standard Bengali uses <I>pa&#x301;ra&#x301;</I> and <I>na&#x301; pa&#x301;ra&#x301;</I>. But in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii dialect, it is different. For instance, in standard Bengali one says, <I>se pa&#x301;rbe</I> [&ldquo;he can&rdquo;], but in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali dialect, it is <I>u pa&#x301;rbek</I>. In standard Bengali it is said, <I>se pa&#x301;rbe na&#x301;;</I> in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali, <I>u la&#x301;rbek</I> [&ldquo;he cannot&rdquo;] or <I>u pa&#x301;rbek na&#x301;i</I>. But better to say, <I>u la&#x301;rbek</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->So this land of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is composed of laterite soil. The eastern part of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is composed of black soil, because that part has been formed from alluvial soil carried by the rivers. It is not exactly red because <I>paca&#x301; ga&#x301;chpa&#x301;la</I> [humus or decomposed vegetation] is also mixed with the red soil. Thus the eastern Burdwan, Howrah and Hooghly Districts are very fertile. The remaining portion of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, which is composed of laterite soil, is gradually eroding.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->But how was this laterite soil formed? It has come from the constant erosion of the hills. The small hills which we see today were medium-sized hills in the past, and the undulating highlands of red soil were once great hills. Now those hills have been reduced to mere anthills. And where the land is still very high, we must infer that these were once extremely lofty peaks which in the gradual process of erosion have been reduced to small mounds. The land of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h flows in waves of hills and valleys: where the crests are lower, these areas were once valleys and smaller hills; and where the land is comparatively high, there the hills were extremely lofty. All of these hills have undergone, and are still undergoing, a gradual process of erosion. If someone travels past Bolepur station by train, one will invariably come across huge areas of extreme soil erosion (<I>khoya&#x301;i</I> in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali): it seems as if the skeletons of the hills are exposed. And when that soil gradually flows down towards the sea, it creates new fertile lands. By large-scale afforestation, this type of extreme erosion can be checked &ndash; there is no other alternative. In fact, it is extremely necessary now to create large new forests by afforestation, so the roots of the trees will hold the soil and prevent erosion. Of course, it is not true that the entire red soil has been lost.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Previously this whole area was completely hilly; in fact Birbhum, West Burdwan and Bankura were all hills. Thus we find this vast area of undulating land today. If there is a slight increase of rainfall, tea cultivation will be very successful. In fact, tea plantation requires just this type of land. Even coffee and cocoa may be cultivated there, because the land is sloping.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Along these high slopes one may discover many heavy minerals. In the ancient past this was a belt of hard rock; it was neither an area of sedimentary rock created by volcanic eruption, nor igneous rock; rather it was metamorphic rock (formed by extreme pressure under the ground). Wherever the land is undulating in Bankura, Birbhum, West Burdwan, Purulia etc., one can discover heavy minerals buried deep within the earth. Actually these are being discovered even now: there is a strong likelihood that great deposits of gold and copper will be found there. If the people of Bengal prepare a detailed plan for the future, they will have to take these possibilities into consideration, and accordingly they can develop industries in the area. But this will not be easy; it will demand hard labour. As Swami Vivekananda once said, nothing is accomplished without toil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The old Bengali word for the verb &ldquo;come&rdquo; or &ldquo;came&rdquo; was <I>a&#x301;sila</I>. What is its colloquial form now? In old Bengali this verbal form was not in existence; it was <I>a&#x301;ila</I>. In medieval Bengali, the correct term was <I>a&#x301;sila,</I> but in colloquial language, even in ancient days, <I>a&#x301;sila</I> was not used; the proper term was <I>a&#x301;ilen</I> or <I>elen</I>. The poet Krttivas Thakur wrote:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Deshete a&#x301;ila Ram, a&#x301;nanda saba&#x301;r;<br>Shunila Kaekeyii ra&#x301;n&#x301;ii shubha sama&#x301;ca&#x301;r.<br>Abhima&#x301;ne Kaekeyiir ba&#x301;ripurn&#x301;a a&#x301;n&#x32D;khi;<br>Katha&#x301; kii kaben Ra&#x301;m Ma&#x301; baliya&#x301; d&#x301;a&#x301;ki.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->[Ram returned to his country to everyone&#146;s delight. When Queen Kaekeyii heard the news, her eyes were full of tears from the pain of her wounded heart. Will Ram approach her and address her as &ldquo;Mother&rdquo;?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->So we find the old form <I>a&#x301;ila</I> here, and now the latest colloquial form of <I>a&#x301;ila</I> is <I>ela</I>. The Bengali language, through gradual changes along the various river valleys, has developed into its present standard form. These river-valley languages have joined with one another in Samatat&#x301; Bengali, from Kolkata to Goyalanda. Thus it is generally accepted that Nadia [[with its Nadia dialect]] is the central point of the Bengali language.<!-- /block --></p>
