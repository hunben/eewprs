<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Purport: In pratisain&#x32D;cara, after the citta comes into being, there ensues gradually the pervasive manifestation of mind. And in this manifestative flow we find in the unit-body that the crudest sheath or cell is the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a [conscious mind], subtler than this is the manomaya kos&#x301;a [subconscious mind], subtler than this subconscious is the atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a [supra-mental mind], yet subtler than this supra-mental mind is the vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a [subliminal mind], and the subtlest of all kos&#x301;as is the hiran&#x301;yamaya kos&#x301;a [subtle causal mind]. The crude receptacle of the unit is the annamaya kos&#x301;a [physical body], which is the property of sain&#x32D;cara. The ka&#x301;mamaya and manomaya kos&#x301;as are called the crude and subtle minds, respectively, and the other three kos&#x301;as, that is, the atima&#x301;nasa, vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya and hiran&#x301;yamaya, are called the causal [or astral, or unconscious] mind collectively. The witnessing purus&#x301;a of the crude mind is called Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a, that of the subtle mind is called Taejasa, and that of the unconscious mind is called Vishva. Sain&#x32D;cara&#146;s annamaya kos&#x301;a, the crude receptacle of the living unit, is called the sthula deha [crude body]. The five kos&#x301;as, from the ka&#x301;mamaya to the hiran&#x301;yamaya, are called the suks&#x301;ma deha [subtle body], and the mahattattva and aham&#x301;tattva are called the sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya deha [supra-causal body, i.e., the body between the hiran&#x301;yamaya kos&#x301;a and (till merger into) Purus&#x301;ottama]. As with the plantain flower, in the case of these kos&#x301;as also, subtle things are observed and understood only after removing their crude parts.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Purport: The Cosmic Mind is held in seven lokas [worlds], namely bhu&#x301; [physical world], bhuvah [crude mental world], svah [subtle mental world], mahah [supra-mental world], janah [subliminal world], tapah and Satya. Purus&#x301;ottama Himself, who is the witnessing entity of the Cosmic Mahattattva and Aham&#x301;tattva, is known as the Satyaloka. He is also called the Causal Cosmic Body. The cognitive purus&#x301;a (knower) of Brahma&#146;s hiran&#x301;yamaya kos&#x301;a [causal cosmic mind], is called Vira&#x301;t&#x301;a or Vaeshva&#x301;nara, and the loka concerned is called the taparloka. The witnessing purus&#x301;a of Brahma&#146;s vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a [subliminal cosmic mind] is also called Vira&#x301;t&#x301;a or Vaeshva&#x301;nara, and the loka concerned goes by the name of janarloka. The witnessing purus&#x301;a of Brahma&#146;s atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a [supra-mental cosmic mind] is also called Vira&#x301;t&#x301;a or Vaeshva&#x301;nara, and the loka concerned is called the maharloka. The collective name of these three kos&#x301;as is &ldquo;causal cosmic mind&rdquo; or &ldquo;subtle cosmic body&rdquo;. The manomaya kos&#x301;a of Brahma is called the subtle cosmic mind, and its witnessing purus&#x301;a is called Hiran&#x301;yagarbha. This also falls within the scope of the subtle cosmic body, and the loka concerned is called the svarloka. The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of Brahma is called the crude cosmic mind, and its witnessing purus&#x301;a is called Iishvara. This may also be called the crude cosmic body. As per degree of expression of subtlety or crudity, this kos&#x301;a is called partially bhuvah [crude mental world], and partially bhu&#x301;rloka [crude physical world].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Purport: In wakefulness all three minds, namely, conscious, subconscious and unconscious, remain active. In dream, only the crude or conscious mind remains asleep, and the other two minds remain active. In sleep, both conscious and subconscious minds remain inactive; only the unconscious mind remains awake and does the work of the other two minds. When there occurs a vibrational disparity in the psycho-physical parallelism, the unconscious mind also becomes inactive. This state is called death.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Purport: Virtuous or non-virtuous, whatever the act be, it begets a sort of mental distortion. The mind, however, regains its normal composure through vipa&#x301;ka, that is, after undergoing the consequences of one&#146;s good or bad deeds. Where action has taken place, but the consequences thereof have not been gone through or served, that is, the vipa&#x301;ka has been kept in abeyance, such suspended or deferred vipa&#x301;ka is called sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra [reaction in its potentiality].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->According to the nature of the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras held in the causal, or unconscious, mind at the time of death, Prakrti, in order to get those sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras served through vipa&#x301;ka, effects the contact of the bodiless minds with living structures<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in the wombs of different beings &ndash; living structures that have parallelism with those bodiless minds&#146; sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra-determined mental waves. This we call the rebirth of the unit concerned.

<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Purport: After the separation of the mind from the body, that is, after death, the sense of weal or woe cannot exist in the unit, because for perception of pleasure and pain cerebral nerve cells and, partially, nerve fibres are necessary (which the bodiless minds do not have after death); and so the popular dogmas and beliefs that So-and-so&#146;s bodiless soul will be happy with such-and-such observances, or be unhappy and miserable with such-and-such acts, or will satisfy its revengeful propensities, are utterly and completely wrong.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Purport: Actually spirits and ghosts do not exist. When in a frightened or indignant or hypnotic state a person attains temporary concentration of the mind, his or her mind-stuff takes the form of the object imagined. In such a state one sees the vision of one&#146;s thought without as well. Thinking about ghosts and spirits in solitude, he or she sees them also in the open. The external vision of the internal thought may be termed as positive hallucination. Conversely, in such a state of mind even the actually existent object may appear as non-existent. This we may call negative hallucination. Those that say that they have seen a ghost do not lie. Only the delusion of the mind appears to them as visual perception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->If hypnosis be thoroughly introspective, one may mistake one&#146;s own entity for a spirit or ghost. In such an event the person behaves in such a manner that people start saying that So-and-so is possessed by a spirit. Theomania or theophanic possession is also of the same variety.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Purport: Even behind the requital of an act (the fruits that follow the completion of an act) lies the divine desire of benevolence. The punishment for an evil act teaches one to keep away from evil doings. The reward for a good and benevolent act teaches people that they will never get such a reward if ever they commit an evil act.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Purport: Brahma alone is the guru.

<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Purport: Obstacles in fact are no foes on the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practice], but indeed friends. They only do service to a person. It is on account of these obstacles that the battle rages against them, and this counter-effort alone carries the sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual aspirant] to his or her cherished goal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Purport: It is useless to pray to God for something, for He is sure to give what is necessary. Solicitation or importunity in the name of worship is nothing but toadyism and flattery.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Purport: Being merged in the constant thought of God is devotion.
