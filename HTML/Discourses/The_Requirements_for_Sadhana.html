<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii asked Shiva, &ldquo;What is the minimum requirement in order to become a sa&#x301;dhaka?&rdquo; Shiva replied, &ldquo;Sukrataer ma&#x301;navo bhu&#x301;tva&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii cenmoks&#x301;ama&#x301;pnuya&#x301;t.&rdquo; When living beings attain a human form as a result of their actions, then they become competent to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The next question posed by Pa&#x301;rvatii was, &ldquo;What qualifications such as age, academic qualifications, character, etc., should a human being have in order to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Regarding age, it might be appropriate to say that there are basically four stages in human life. In the first stage, the primary duty of the human being is to receive knowledge and do dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In the second stage, one must fulfil worldly duties and perform dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In the third stage, one must see to any remaining family responsibilities and perform dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Finally, in the fourth stage, when the human body has become incapable of performing worldly duties, one must do dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; alone. So there are no barriers of age as far as the requirements for sa&#x301;dhaka are concerned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is an old story about this. Once a child named Dhruva started doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and singing bhajanas at the early age of five. This scared the eminent rs&#x301;is and munis. They thought that this young boy would surpass them in spiritual excellence. So, as devotees, they all implored Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a to save them from being defeated and humiliated. Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a sent Na&#x301;rada to resolve the issue. Na&#x301;rada means &ldquo;one who spreads devotion&rdquo;. So Na&#x301;rada came to the boy Dhruva and tried to allure him with toys, sweets, a kingdom, and things of that sort. He inquired why the boy was so enthusiastic about sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and bhajanas at such an early age, especially when he had a whole lifetime at his disposal for spiritual pursuits. Dhruva replied,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Kaoma&#x301;ra a&#x301;caret pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;ah dharma&#x301;n bha&#x301;gavata&#x301;niha,<br>Durlabham&#x301; ma&#x301;nus&#x301;am&#x301; janma tadapyadhruvamarthadam.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;O Na&#x301;rada! You are a sage, you know much more than I do. Yet I wish to mention, in order to clarify things, that we get a human form after numerous animal lives.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sukrtaerma&#x301;navo bhu&#x301;tva&#x301;.&rdquo;  This human life is attained through the medium of lots of clash and cohesion. Of all creatures&#146; existence, this human existence is the most rare. But even rarer is the human body that has been perfected through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Shravan&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;pi bahubhiryo na labhyah<br>Shrn&#x301;vanto&#146;pi bahabo yam&#x301; na viduh,<br>A&#x301;shcarya vakta&#x301; kushalo&#146;sya labdha&#x301;<br>A&#x301;shcarya jin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta kushala&#x301;nushis&#x301;t&#x301;ah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Even after getting human life, only a few get the opportunity to listen to dharmika discourses. Among those, only a few develop the desire to practise dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And even among these, only a few actually grasp the spirit of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Those rare ones who understand, perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and reach the goal are truly blessed. In the effort to perfect oneself, even if one faces obstacles and hindrances from one&#146;s elders and near ones, one must ignore them. This is not a sin, not a crime.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Dhruva further said, &ldquo;Na&#x301;rada, who knows what will happen tomorrow? You have become old and you got the opportunity to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and sing bhajanas at this age. But in my life, the sun may or may not rise tomorrow. Suppose I die tonight? So how can I wait till old age?&rdquo; Then Na&#x301;rada went away silently. &ldquo;Dharma&#x301;n Bha&#x301;gavata&#x301;niha,&rdquo; said Dhruva. All men should try to become established in Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma in childhood. Then one is likely to have a lot more time at one&#146;s disposal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->What is Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma and what are the qualifications for it? The one qualification is prapatti, that is, &ldquo;I have surrendered everything unto Bhagava&#x301;n. Whatever He wants I will do.&rdquo; Those who get established in this feeling at an early age are true human beings. What is Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma? It is vista&#x301;ra (psychic expansion), rasa (flow) and seva&#x301; (service). Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma differentiates humans from animals. There are some attributes which exist in trees, animals and humans alike, and there are other attributes which exist in animals and humans only. Furthermore, there are certain attributes which are unique to human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Some people say, &ldquo;The human being is a rational animal.&rdquo; I refute this statement. In my opinion, the human being is not an animal. The human is a rational being. Human existence is an ideological flow. Therefore, the human being is not an animal. Just as plants and animals are both living things but are not alike, similarly, animals and humans are both living beings but are not alike.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Animals move but plants do not. Animals cry but plants do not. What, then, differentiates humans from animals? Vista&#x301;ra, rasa and seva&#x301;. These are the three essentialities of Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma, and it is Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma that differentiates human beings from other creatures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Everybody wants expansion. The desire for expansion is the innate characteristic, the dharma, of human beings. No one desires to remain ks&#x301;udra &ndash; a tiny thing. All wish to expand their psychic arena. In order to quench this thirst for vista&#x301;ra, one must do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; regularly. In this way a day is sure to come when one&#146;s mind will become one with the Cosmic Mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The second factor is rasa, and third is seva&#x301;. Since time immemorial there has been a never-ending flow of Cosmic cognition. Human beings want their desires to coincide with His will. When one is able to achieve this, the life of the unit becomes successful and complete. This is rasa. Human life is blessed. In the Sha&#x301;stras such people are called &ldquo;a&#x301;ptaka&#x301;ma&rdquo;. This desire to become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a exists only in human beings, not in other living beings; neither in animals nor in plants and trees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The third essential factor of Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma is seva&#x301;. Only humans are aware of their own identity. Plants, animals and material objects are not aware. A rupee does not know that it is a rupee. A mango tree does not know that it is a mango tree. A jackal does not know that it is a jackal. But humans know that they are human.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Human beings also know that Parama Purus&#x301;a is their source of impetus, is their Father, and that they are all His children. As His children, they have a brotherly relationship with all other jiivas, or unit beings. Due to this knowledge of brotherhood, the human is superior to all other beings. Parents are greatly pleased when they find that their children have been loved and helped by someone. Similarly, Parama Purus&#x301;a will be pleased when you serve His creation &ndash; not only human beings, but also plants, animals, and the rest of creation. That is, bhu&#x301;ta yajin&#x32D;a, pitr yajin&#x32D;a and nr yajin&#x32D;a are to be performed. Those who have this feeling are in the real sense of the term human beings. Just having the body of a human does not make a person a real human being, a rational being. Those in whom this feeling has arisen will be called followers of Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma. They are doing the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma. So,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Kaoma&#x301;ra a&#x301;caret pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;ah dharma&#x301;n Bha&#x301;gavata&#x301;niha,<br>Durlabham&#x301; ma&#x301;nus&#x301;am&#x301; janma tadapyadhruvamarthadam.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->At the earliest age possible a wise person will start following Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma, will start Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. To follow Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma, the only requisite qualification is total self-surrender.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->After Dhruva made his reply, what happened? Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a appeared and asked the boy to get up, telling him he was very young, and asking what the necessity was of doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; at such an early age. Then Dhruva said, &ldquo;The sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; was for You, and You have come. So now I will get up.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->You must remember the fact that, to realize Him, age, sex, academic qualifications and such things are not relevant. Great scholars, senior people and maha&#x301;mahopa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya pan&#x301;d&#x301;itas may lag behind, while an illiterate person races ahead and fulfils his or her purpose. You should not have any inferiority complex in your mind regarding age, sex, education, etc. You are His children. It is your birthright to reach Him, irrespective of your status, academic qualification, or age. Make proper utilization of this right.<!-- /block --></p>
