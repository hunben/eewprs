<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar teaches us in his book, <I>Birds and Animals, Our Neighbours</I>, to regard other species as &ldquo;neighbours on earth&rdquo;, due the same dignity and respect we give our fellow human beings. This book beautifully reflects the author&#146;s philosophy of Neohumanism, which holds that all-encompassing, perfect love is the essence of spiritual realization, and the highest stage to which humans can aspire. In this book the author shows his passionate love and compassion for all forms of life, and inspires us to likewise protect birds and animals while honouring their rights and their presence on earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Environmental preservation or ecological balance is a widely-discussed topic in these times. Focus on this vital issue has now, though belatedly, stirred up an increasing awareness about the grave danger that ecological imbalance poses to the civilization on this planet. However, the development of awareness brings with it the pertinent question &ndash; why do human beings neglect nature, and undermine as well as destroy non-human creatures? The answer is, the vested interests inherent in the human psyche.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->According to Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, two &ldquo;destructive tendencies&rdquo; are predominant in the human mind: one is &ldquo;intra-humanistic&rdquo;, that is, the exploitation or oppression of fellow human beings; and the other is &ldquo;inter-creature&rdquo;, that is, the torture of animals, plants and other living beings. The inevitable result is the &ldquo;catastrophic ruin of human life as well&rdquo;. In both tendencies, the disease is one and the same, and it must be eradicated from the very root, the mind. Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar prescribes the only way to achieve this: bring about a radical change in the human mind on the basis of Neohumanism &ndash; by awakening genuine love for the entire living and inanimate universe. Only then will the human, plant and animal worlds be saved from extinction; and &ldquo;humanity will attain the consummation of its existence.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Starting with a series of discourses delivered in Kolkata in the early 1980&#146;s, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar began to reveal his exquisite vision for saving our imperilled world through a Neohumanistic transformation. Then in 1985 in Kolkata he began giving a remarkable series of discourses which were later compiled into more than thirty volumes in two series, <I>Varn&#x301;a Vicitra&#x301;</I> and <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I>. In nearly all the volumes of those two series, he brought to the fore the issue of preserving non-human creatures, discussing the lives, natures, habitats, status and plights of various animals, birds, insects and plants. In addition he taught us how to behave with and protect these innocent creatures, and urged us all to give them the same care and attention that we give to human beings. Because according to him, all non-human creatures have the same &ldquo;existential value&rdquo; as do human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In 1987, he instructed that those of the aforementioned discussions from those two series that were related to animals, be published in the form of a separate Bengali book, to be titled <I>A&#x301;ma&#x301;der Prativeshii Pashu o Paks&#x301;ii</I>. Thus the first edition of that book comprised of excerpts from whatever parts of the two series had been published by that time; those parts amounted to somewhat more than half of what finally came to be published<I></I>. Since then there has been a long-standing demand from our esteemed readers for the publication of an English translation. The publication of the present book is a humble response to that request, and moreover includes additional information now gleaned from the volumes unpublished as of 1987 and from the early- 1980&#146;s discourses mentioned above. Where the same information has come in two or more different passages from among all the volumes, normally only one passage has been included herein.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Because of the aforementioned expansion of the book, it has not been possible to follow exactly the organization of it originally given by the author; hence the responsibility for such organization, and for some of the chapter titles, now lies with the editors. In order to provide in a systematic manner a complete panorama of the author&#146;s detailed discussions (originally scattered over more than thirty volumes), the present book has been divided into nine parts. Since the subterranean flow of Neohumanism permeates the book, two of the author&#146;s groundbreaking discourses on this topic, both of which touch on Neohumanism&#146;s vast role as the panacea for all world problems, have been included in Part 1. In Parts 2 through 8, we have arranged the author&#146;s descriptions of various animals, birds and insects, their species and subspecies, under different headings synchronized with the evolution of the living world from the unicellular or multi-cellular protozoa to the developed ape family. Part 9 contains the author&#146;s poignant reflections on the relationship between human beings and animals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the interests of accuracy, the author&#146;s explanations of certain Sanskrit, Bengali and other terminologies have all been retained in full.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Source references for all material in the book are provided in the footnotes at the end of each sequence of paragraphs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->As <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301; Part 1, Part 2</I> and <I>Part 3</I> had all been translated into English and published previously, the material taken from those books has been included herein with minimal further editing. Most of the material taken from <I>Varn&#x301;a Vicitra&#x301;</I> <I>Part 1</I> to <I>Part 8</I> and from <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301; Part 4</I> to <I>Part 26</I> has been newly translated from the original Bengali for this book. For research purposes, we have included an appendix which provides the Latin names that correspond to the Bengali and English names of each bird and animal mentioned herein.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate in the Publisher&#146;s Note &ndash; in addition to the original language of each discourse, its date and place, by whom it was translated, and where (if other than in this book) it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a recording of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all cataloguing of recordings has been completed. Further information as to recordings will be provided in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the translators have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Many readers are concerned that the author&#146;s discourses, as published, should adhere as closely as possible to the precise wording the author used in speaking. For this reason, in the case of discourses given originally in English, the editors do not alter pronouns and other terms which the author in his lifetime considered &ldquo;common-gender&rdquo; words. As the author once said, &ldquo;You know, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is not only masculine gender, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is common gender also. &lsquo;Man is mortal&rsquo; &ndash; here &lsquo;man&rsquo; means both male and female.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The author was a natural advocate of women&#146;s rights and on at least one occasion indicated that &ldquo;lopsided justice&rdquo; in language should be eliminated at some future date. In keeping with his guideline and with current trends, it is our policy in the case of translated discourses (where the published wording will necessarily be that of the translators) to use gender-neutral language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The author used a particular shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus <I>ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra</I> can be read, &ldquo;the root <I>tr</I> prefixed by <I>ava</I> and suffixed by <I>ghain&#x32D;</I> becomes <I>avata&#x301;ra</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Acknowledgements<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->This book is a result of the assistance and support provided by many persons in various ways. Their sincere efforts are helping us to develop an ever more professional working system, so that the immense contribution of Shrii P.R. Sarkar can be presented in the best possible manner. Some esteemed lovers of Shrii P.R. Sarkar&#146;s books have come forward to make arrangements for the continuing publication of his books over the coming years; thanks to them, progress is being made in building up a committed and dependable sales network. In this regard, we welcome the participation and support of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Every new book translation starts with a draft by the main translator. It is then reviewed by a &ldquo;first editor&rdquo; who compares the English translation with the original Hindi or Bengali. Thereafter it is sent for &ldquo;second editing&rdquo; to improve the standard of English. On completion of second editing, it is sent for final verification, which includes one more comparison with the original Hindi or Bengali. Other important functions include the coordination of these different steps and the development and management of a global distribution and sales network.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Some of those who have contributed to these efforts are as follows: retired Professor Dr. Subhas Chandra Sarkar translated all the materials for the book from different parts of <I>Varn&#x301;a Vicitra&#x301;</I> and <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I>, except for the materials taken for different chapters from the already-translated <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301; Part 1</I> to <I>Part 5</I>, and some or all of the materials for four other chapters: The second of the three &ldquo;Humans Are So Cruel!&rdquo; excerpts had already been translated for <I>Neohumanism in a Nutshell Part 2</I>. Some of the material for the &ldquo;Caring for Child-Bearing Animals&rdquo; chapter had already been translated for &ldquo;Advice for Pregnant Women&rdquo; in <I>The Awakening of Women</I>. &ldquo;The Whimsical Elephant&rdquo; was translated by Deva&#x301;shiis&#x301;a for this book, and the <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301; Part 9</I> portion of the scorpion topic in the &ldquo;Bugs, Scorpions, Lice and Mosquitoes&rdquo; chapter was translated by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Priyashiva&#x301;nanda Avadhuta. The latter also did the first editing of the entire book. Ga&#x301;yattrii Ghista, Ta&#x301;raka Ghista and Pashupati Landau did the second editing of the entire book. Kirit Dave with the help of others prepared the cover design of the book and also took on coordination of the entire project along with distribution and sales management. Dr. Vishvajita Bhoumick and Shriimati Arpita&#x301; Bhoumick prepared the appendix of Latin names for birds and animals. Dr. Vishvajita Bhoumick also helped to proofread the entire book. Ma&#x301;dhava Basak did typing and layout of the book along with many other valuable tasks.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Most of the other pictures of birds, animals, etc., used as illustrations in the book were drawn for us by artists Shrii Anjan Basu of Kolkata, Shrii Swapan Das of Delhi, Shrii Devashis Datta of Baroda and Shrii Dinesh Verma of Sydney. Others who contributed to this effort are Shrii Abhinava Ashu of Mumbai, Shrii Anup Sheet of Kolkata, Shrii Gautam Guha of Kolkata, Shrii Swapan Dey of Kolkata, Shriimati Arpita&#x301; Bhoumick and Vishvajita Bhoumick of Siliguri, and Shrii Vishal Thakur of Ranchi. We also express our sincere gratitude to each of them.<!-- /block --></p>
