<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Giita&#x301; says: Svadharme nidhanam&#x301; shreyah paradharmo bhaya&#x301;vahah. Even if svadharma [humans&#146; &ldquo;own dharma&rdquo;] is without merit and paradharma [the dharma of other beings] is pleasant and delightful, &ldquo;it is better to perish in svadharma; paradharma is terrifying.&rdquo; What does the Giita&#x301; mean by svadharma? Does it mean the different religions &ndash; Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma, Sha&#x301;kta Dharma, Hindu Dharma, etc? No, it does not mean that. Svadharma means manus&#x301;ya dharma [human dharma].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Trees and plants also have a sort of dharma; they are also guided by certain principles. In fact, all living beings do have a dharma common to all of them. But in addition to that common dharma, plants and trees have a specific dharma as well; that is their svadharma. Similarly birds and animals have a specific dharma; that is their svadharma. And humans have their own specific dharma; that is their svadharma. What then is that specific svadharma of humans? It is ma&#x301;nava dharma [human dharma], Bha&#x301;gavata dharma [divine dharma], whose fundamental pillars are vista&#x301;ra [the principle of expansion], rasa [the principle of total surrender to Parama Purus&#x301;a], seva&#x301; [selfless service to Parama Purus&#x301;a and His creation], and tadsthiti [the final ensconcement in Parama Purus&#x301;a]: to expand, to spread out; to be lost in the endless flow of divine feelings; and to derive bliss from that [vista&#x301;ra], rasa and seva&#x301;. And the supreme goal of tadsthiti is to attain permanent ensconcement in Parama Purus&#x301;a. This indeed is manus&#x301;ya dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The svadharma of human beings, then, is this manus&#x301;ya dharma, this Bha&#x301;gavata dharma. What has been stated is that even if the practice of Bha&#x301;gavata dharma brings pain and sorrow and the practice of paradharma (that is to say, the dharma of animals and plants) brings pleasure, humans will have to stick firmly to their svadharma, their ma&#x301;nava dharma. Humans should never allow themselves to descend to paradharma, the dharma of birds and beasts, of trees and plants. On no account should animal dharma be encouraged. The flag of ma&#x301;nava dharma must always be held high under all circumstances. This is exactly what Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a means when He says: Svadharme nidhanam&#x301; shreyah paradharmo bhaya&#x301;vahah &ndash; &ldquo;It would be better to die upholding human dharma, upholding the ideal of humanity; one should never allow oneself to fall back into a state of animality.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
