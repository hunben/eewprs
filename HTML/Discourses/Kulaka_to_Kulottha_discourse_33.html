<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><li>One whose supremacy is accepted within the society of artists, or whom other artists accept as their representative, or whom they have elected as their leader or representative, is also called <I>kulaka</I>. Here &ldquo;artist&rdquo; means singer, poet, writer, painter or the practitioner of any fine art. If the actors of a country or society send one of their actors somewhere as their representative, then that person will also be considered as <I>kulaka</I> or the <I>abhinetr-kulaka</I> [representative of the actors].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><p>The feminine form of <I>kulaka</I> is <I>kulaka&#x301;/kulakii. Kulaka&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;that woman who has been born into a good family&rdquo; or &ldquo;that woman who acts as a representative of artists&rdquo;. A woman who is not <I>kulaka&#x301;</I> herself but the wife of a <I>kulaka</I> is called <I>kulakii</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><li>The word <I>kulaka</I> may also be used for the unknown creepers, shrubs, bushes and roots which have medicinal properties and which grow in mountainous regions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li>You might have occasionally seen a sort of green snake among green creeping plants. Their eyes glisten because they are green. That makes people afraid; they think that these snakes must be highly poisonous. These snakes are called <I>la&#x301;ud&#x301;aga&#x301;</I> snakes [<I>Opheodrys aestivus</I>] in certain parts of Bengal. They stare at a person from behind the leaves when they see that person approaching them. They are not easily visible at first because of their green camouflage. People run away the moment they see them. This <I>la&#x301;ud&#x301;aga&#x301;</I> snake is also called <I>kulaka</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><p>There is a controversy over whether or not this <I>la&#x301;ud&#x301;aga&#x301;</I> snake actually bites people, whether or not they are poisonous at all, and whether or not they belong to the snake suborder or the <I>kakt&#x301;esiya&#x301;s</I> order. But many people believe that they are poisonous. They are one among a number of creatures who live or keep themselves alive by camouflage. But they are not chameleons. Nor are they related in any way to the <I>kakt&#x301;asiya&#x301;s</I> [prehistoric reptiles] family creature that we call the chameleon. They are natural camouflage artists, and like other such creatures they camouflage themselves to hunt their prey or to protect themselves from hunters. Lions, giraffes, and several species of deer are also creatures that create natural camouflage. There is a variety of tame deer that survives through natural camouflage. Generally lions, giraffes, and certain types of deer and golden iguana live in larger numbers in the desert areas or in areas where the surrounding natural colours are grey or sandy. Their enemies, their hunters and their prey cannot recognize them because their colour mergeswith the colour of their surroundings. This is called&ldquo;natural camouflage&rdquo;. Creating confusion in the mind of the enemy through camouflage has been practiced since ancient times in different armies of different countries by wearing khaki dress and other such colours. The purpose was to camouflage their presence by having the colour of the army dress merge into that of their surroundings. In any case, this <I>la&#x301;ud&#x301;aga&#x301;</I> snake takes full advantage of the opportunity afforded by camouflage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><li>A proper name for &ldquo;white ant&rdquo; in Sanskrit is <I>plus&#x301;in</I> (with <I>in</I> at the end). The earthen nest or anthill of the white ant is called <I>valmiika</I>. You must be familiar with that story. When Ratna&#x301;kara sat for spiritual austerities, he remained immobile, motionless, for such a long time that the white ants built up their nest around his body. Since his body turned into an anthill, or <I>valmiika</I>, people gave him the name Maharshi Valmiiki. <I>Kulaka</I> is another name for &ldquo;anthill&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><li>As you well know, there are many species of <I>in&#x32D;dur</I> such as the mouse, the rat, the field mouse [marmot group], tree rat, etc. Some of them live in kitchens, some in storerooms, some in holes in the wall and some in tree hollows. They have many names according to their species and dwelling place: <I>in&#x32D;dur, mus&#x301;ika, a&#x301;khu, kundu</I>, and so on. The mole also has three main species in India. But they are all field moles; they live in burrows in the fields. The entrance to the burrow is towards the bottom and the burrow itself moves upward. So what happens is that during heavy rains when the field is on the point of being submerged, it is difficult for water to seep into the dwelling. If there is water at the mouth of the hole, they can easily come out and escape. Since it lives in a field, the mole&#146;s proper name is <I>vasumitra</I>. During the day the mole cannot see properly, so they mostly come out at night. Certainly you will hardly ever see a mole entering your house during the day. You see it at night.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><p>The mole&#146;s burrow is also called <I>kulaka</I>. One proper name for the mole is <I>kulakeya</I>, in the sense of &ldquo;<I>kulaka</I>-dweller&rdquo;, <I>kulakeyii</I> in feminine gender. Do you not call &ldquo;the mole&rdquo; that type of firework which runs about hither and thither during the Diipavali [light festival] just like a mole does, making a sharp hissing sound? This mole firework does not stay in a <I>kulaka</I>; it is kept in a box or in one&#146;s pocket. The mole&#146;s hole is called <I>kulaka</I>, but do you know the name of the rat&#146;s hole? It is good that you do. If you do not know, then listen well. The word is <I>kundubil</I>. <I>Kundu</I> means &ldquo;rat&rdquo;; <I>bil</I> means &ldquo;hole&rdquo; or &ldquo;opening&rdquo;. The word <I>bil</I> is used in Hindi and in a few North Indian languages to mean &ldquo;hole&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><li>If you use this word <I>kulaka</I> in neuter gender (<I>kulakam&#x301;</I>, declined in the same way as the word <I>phala</I>), it refers to a large <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> [Angled gourd; <I>Lufa acutangula Roxb</I>]. You may also use the word <I>kulaka</I> for the smaller type of <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> that grows in bunches. However, its specific name is <I>saptaputra</I> or <I>saptaputrika&#x301;</I>. The word <I>satputia&#x301;</I>, derived from <I>saptaputrika&#x301;</I>, is used in certain areas of North India for the smaller variety. The large variety is called <I>jhiun&#x32D;gii</I> in those places. This vegetable makes the mouth salivate, so it helps somewhat in eating and digestion. However, if one eats large amounts of <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> day after day, one runs the risk of contracting dysentery. <I>Jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> keeps the body cool and fresh, but it makes people more active because it increases blood circulation to some extent. <I>Jhiun&#x32D;ge-posta</I> [a type of dish made with poppy seeds] protects the body from dryness or contraction during the summer season, just as pigeon-peas do. Many knowledgeable people say that the addition of poppy seeds increases the quality and sweetness of <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I>. A high-level enquiry commission can be set up to determine the veracity of this statement! <I>Jhiun&#x32D;ges</I> from the Ranchi region are quite long and also tasty as well. The proper name for <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge-posta</I> is <I>pos&#x301;ita-kulakam&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><p>The proper Bengali word for poppy seed is <I>pos&#x301;ita</I>. Its colloquial form <I>posta</I> is derived from <I>pos&#x301;ita</I>. <I>Pos&#x301;ita</I> is spelled with <I>s&#x301;a</I>, but <I>posta</I> is spelled with <I>sa</I> because the cerebral letter <I>s&#x301;a</I> and the dental letter <I>ta</I> cannot be conjoined. So it must take <I>sa</I>. If <I>s&#x301;a</I> is retained then we have to use <I>t&#x301;a</I> instead of <I>ta</I>. In that case the word becomes <I>pos&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>, but it is not pronounced <I>pos&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> but rather <I>pus&#x301; + kta = pus&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>. The word <I>pus&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>, however, is used with a different meaning. In the months of <I>caetra</I>, <I>vaesha&#x301;kha</I> and <I>jyaes&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>, <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge-posta</I> in small quantities is good for health. <I>Jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> soup with ginger paste (known as <I>kar&#x301;ui</I> in certain places) is considered to eliminate food aversion, increase appetite and increase blood circulation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><p><I>Jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> buds blossom together towards the afternoon with mild crackling sounds. So a person whose virtues flourish all of a sudden is praised in conversational Bengali by comparing them to the <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> flower.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><p>The matter of water gourd crops up in connection with <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I>. The proper name for water gourd is <I>jalatumbii</I>. This water gourd has hardly any beneficial quality; it is mostly just water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><li>If there is more than one stanza in a poem they are collectively called <I>kulaka</I> (in neuter gender). If a song has more than one verse then they are also collectively called <I>kulaka</I>. Some people also call a stanza of a poem a <I>stavaka</I>. No, <I>stavaka</I> cannot be used in this sense. The Bengali derivative of the word <I>stavaka</I> is <I>thoka&#x301;;</I> for example, a <I>thoka&#x301;</I> [bunch] of flowers, a <I>thoka&#x301;</I> of fruits. The word <I>thoka&#x301;</I> is also used for &ldquo;bouquet&rdquo;; for instance, a bouquet of flowers may be called <I>pus&#x301;pa-stavaka</I>. The word <I>stavaka</I> can also be used in the sense of &ldquo;tier&rdquo; or &ldquo;layer&rdquo;. For instance, instead of saying, &ldquo;arranged in layers&rdquo;, one can say, &ldquo;arranged in <I>stavakas</I>&rdquo;. The word <I>tha&#x301;k</I> is also a corrupted form of <I>stavaka</I>. In a special sense, <I>stavaka</I> also means, &ldquo;flower petal&rdquo;. There is a Sanskrit verse:<!-- /block --></p>

The etymological meaning of the word <I>kulakka</I> is &ldquo;to harmonize psychic feelings with worldly expression&rdquo;.

A fifth columnist or a person engaged in a work of sabotage may also be called <I>kulaghna.</I><!-- /block --></p>

The colloquial meaning of <I>kulaja</I> is: <ol> <li>&ldquo;Noble&rdquo;, that is, one who has been accepted by society as an aristocrat. During the selection of brides and bridegrooms for marriage, a bridegroom from a highborn family is also called <I>kulaja</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph --><p>In ancient times students used to study in the residences of their teachers during the period of their education. After the child had attained a certain level of knowledge, intelligence and sense, their guardian used to take him to the house of the teacher and leave him there. He used to be educated in the school attached to the teacher&#146;s residence up to the age of twenty-four. Arrangements were made for free housing, food and clothes. The student used to return home at the age of twenty-four after receiving a certificate. Many intelligent students were able to complete their studies before the age of twenty-four and returned to their own homes in their own countries with their certificates.<!-- /block --></p>

The guardians felt proud to send their wards to such places for their education.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph --><p>Generally the lecturers or assistant lecturers would teach, teaching were controlled by the professors, the professors&#146; work was looked after by the <I>aca&#x301;rya</I>s, and the <I>aca&#x301;rya</I>s were assisted in their work by <I>upa&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas</I>. The meaning of the word <I>a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya</I> is <I>a&#x301;caran&#x301;a&#x301;t pa&#x301;t&#x301;hayati ya sa a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya</I>, &ldquo;one who teaches through ones conduct&rdquo;. In other words, the <I>a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya</I> must teach and have conduct worthy of respect. Only then will the education they imparted have a strong base and be assimilated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph --><p>Those who were in charge of those centers of learning, whether big or small, were not rich themselves. Their wealth or capital was the scholarship they had acquired through tireless endeavour. The public, rich people and royalty used to help them with monetary and other kinds of assistance. This was given unconditionally, that is, there were no pre-conditions imposed on them to sing the praises of the kings in return. These centres were not the supporters, carriers or promoters of any &ldquo;ism&rdquo;. Their only work was to spread the streams of knowledge and wisdom far and wide, independent of any external interference.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph --><p>The scholarship of the heads of the centres of learning or <I>maha&#x301;vidya&#x301;laya</I> (college or residential university: a large centre of learning in which every branch of knowledge was taught) was renowned far and wide. People used to pay them more respect than they would to royalty. Even the king used to stand up from his throne when he saw them. Those among these pundits or great scholars who used to arrange for free food, clothing, lodging and education for ten thousand students in an educational institution were called <I>kulapati</I>. I find nowadays that in certain regions of northern India the chancellor of a university is called <I>kulapati</I> and the vice-chancellor is called <I>upakulapati</I>. (In earlier times a university was called a <I>gurukula</I>. The word <I>vishvavidya&#x301;laya</I> is quite recent. It is the literal translation of the word &ldquo;university&rdquo;). This creates a certain semantic confusion regarding these words because a chancellor does not make arrangements for free food, clothing, lodging and education for thousands of students. However, if somebody has done this or does so in the future, then they will certainly be categorized as <I>kulapati</I>. In Bengali the chancellor is erroneously called <I>a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya</I> and the vice-chancellor <I>upa&#x301;ca&#x301;rya</I>. This is also a misuse of the words. The <I>a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas</I> and <I>upa&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas</I> are neither teaching nor serving as examples of conduct. The words used for this should be <I>prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;dhiipaka</I> or <I>vidya&#x301;dhiipaka</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph --><p>At one time in Mithila the genealogists exerted a great influence among the Maethila Brahman and Maithila Kayastha (Maethilakaran&#x301;a) communities. Brides and bridegrooms were generally chosen in a large mango garden called Saora&#x301;t&#x301;ha near Madhuvanii. The Saora&#x301;t&#x301;ha fairgrounds were called Sabha&#x301;ga&#x301;chi. There the guardians would come with the prospective brides and bridegrooms, or sometimes without them, and finalize the choice of bride and bridegroom and the date and time of marriage with the help of these genealogists. Sabha&#x301;ga&#x301;chi still exists but the Saora&#x301;t&#x301;ha fair is no longer very important. These genealogists had the main role in this Sabha&#x301;ga&#x301;chi. This Sabhaga&#x301;chi of Saora&#x301;t&#x301;ha had more influence among the Maethila Brahmans than among the Maethila Kayasthas (whose surnames were Karan&#x301;a-Kayastha Kan&#x301;t&#x301;ha, La&#x301;lada&#x301;sa, Datta, Sharan&#x301;a, Mallika, etc.).

It is also worth remembering that in order to transform the town of Krishnanagar into an ideal town in all respects, Krishnachandra, the king of Nadia , brought in confectioners from Burdwan and Natore and also potters that were expert lac artisans of Ilambazar in the district of Birbhum. Some of the expert potters of Krishnanagar also came from North Bengal.

Terrified by this sort of excellence and planned approach, many people, especially those who are exponents of opposite views, often become panic-stricken and pour out their venom against those <I>kula&#x301;la</I>s [ideal leaders with exceptional brilliance]<I></I>. This matter should be investigated with the neutral outlook of a judge or a critic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph --><p>The intense <I>kula&#x301;la</I> consciousness that stimulated and churned public opinion on the eve of Indian Independence was the result of the <I>kaola&#x301;lika</I> role [exceptionally brilliant role] of Subhash Bose in the political arena. The day has come for those who want to remain neutral in matters of judgment to ponder the issue carefully. I can say, without showing the slightest disrespect to the Indian leaders of those days, they not only lacked social and revolutionary consciousness but also a clear vision of a well-defined and sound economic structure. They wanted to irritate the British by swaying public opinion in various ways and then reap the harvest of Indian freedom, like cutting a crop gently with a sickle and storing it in a granary. &ldquo;Kill the snake but do not break the stick.&rdquo; Those who think that the policy of non-violence is no policy at all, that it is merely the political strategy of people with no other alternative, should remember that the mental attitude of the leaders of those days was not the result of having no other alternatives. With the help of the influence they had over the people, they could have tried to gain independence by vigorously stirring the collective consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph --><p>No one can deny that Mahatma Gandhi aroused the consciousness of the public, but he could not direct that awakened consciousness to the path of struggle. It can be said that the uniqueness of their policies centered around a kind of negativism and lack of struggle. The excellence of Subhash Bose was of a different kind. He wanted to capture freedom by exploiting the situation, or in plainer language, overpowering and stunning the opposition by adopting a policy of &ldquo;strike while the iron is hot&rdquo;. Herein lies the qualitative difference between him and other leaders of that time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph --><p>Although simplicity and straightforwardness was not completely lacking in the so-called creed of non-violence of Gandhism, it was somewhat absent. Gandhi&#146;s followers were perhaps not as simple as he was in his personal life; as a result this <I>kula&#x301;latva</I> difference [qualitative difference of leadership] became more pronounced in the public eye. The Congress chairman was called the President of the State in those days. Was this not rather ludicrous? There was no state; how could there be a state president? If there is no head then how can there be a crown on that head? The contest between Subhash Bose and Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the Congress party chairmanship was a contest of this <I>kula&#x301;latva</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph --><p>Gandhiji was a simple man. So when Subhash Bose won and Sitaramaiya was defeated in that contest, he said openly, &ldquo;Sitaramiya&#146;s defeat is my defeat<I></I>.&rdquo; <I></I>Subhash Bose never allowed this difference in <I>kula&#x301;latva</I> with Gandhiji to become personal, nor did Gandhiji. But some ambitious Congress leaders did just that. And their spewing of venom, as well as use of the chains of non-violence, at the personal level, were two of the many reasons for Subhash Bose&#146;s emigration. Those who used to call Subhash Bose a traitor or a misguided patriot based on mere superficial knowledge, without any deep understanding of politics, or being goaded by different kinds of motives, had perhaps lost sight of one fact. If Britain, France and the United States could dine together with Russia in order to protect their countries&#146; freedom, despite being poles apart in economic outlook, then what serious fault did Subhash Bose commit when he sought the help from the Axis powers (Germany, Japan and Italy) in the cause of a country having no military strength and aspiring for freedom? Actually the war was between two imperialist as well as expansionist forces. Neither of the parties was pure and holy. Whichever side Subhash Bose had joined for the cause of freedom of the country, his opponents would have certainly condemned him. Those who call the working plan or ideology of Subhash Bose &ldquo;Subhashism&rdquo; are mistaken. There is no such &ldquo;ism&rdquo; as &ldquo;Subhashism&rdquo;. Subhash Bose wanted freedom for the country and he wanted it very strongly. So he took the role of a pragmatist and an opportunist. If some have condemned him for this, then it has to be understood that they wanted success the easiest way possible without suffering any scratches themselves in their political life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph --><p>If the Allied forces (Britain, France, America and Russia) condemn Subhash Bose for political or social reasons of their own, or punish Tojo declaring him to be a war criminal, would it be proper for an Indian at that time to join chorus with them to oppose Subhash Bose, in spite of his being an embodiment of <I>kula&#x301;la</I> [ideal leaders]? The fact of the matter is that a person&#146;s thinking becomes clouded if there is a marked difference between them and someone else in respect to <I>kula&#x301;latva</I>. With their clouded thinking they muddy the waters of social life, hardly a sign of elevated thinking. This kind of mentality is diametrically opposed to clear thinking and is the worst result of geo-sentiment. Anyhow, I hope you have properly understood the meaning and idea of the word <I>kula&#x301;la</I> in this context. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph --><li>During the time of King Ballala Sena <I></I>certain Brahmans and Kayasthas of Bengal were called <I>kuliina</I> by royal decree based on certain particular qualities. Since then their descendants have enjoyed <I>kuliina</I> status irrespective of whether or not they possess those virtues. One of the important features of this system was that this special status would be maintained through daughters, that is, the parents would give their daughters in marriage to bridegrooms with the same <I>kuliina</I> status. If a daughter was given in marriage to a non<I>-kuliina</I> (i.e., <I>shrotriya</I> Brahman or <I>maolika</I> Kayastha) <I></I>then the family lineage would be adversely affected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph --><p>If three lineages remain <I>kuliina</I> (the mother&#146;s, one&#146;s own and the father-in-law&#146;s), it is known as <I>naekas&#x301;ya kuliina</I> [pure <I>kuliina</I>]<I></I>. If the three lineages are not <I>kuliina</I>, but if every daughter has been married to a <I>kuliina</I>, it is called normal <I>kuliina</I> or natural <I>kuliina</I>. If a daughter marries into a non-<I>kuliina</I> family, it is called broken <I>kuliina &ndash; bhaun&#x32D;ga</I> <I>kuliina, ka&#x301;p kuliina</I> or <I>shuddha maolik</I>. If this continues for seven generations they are called <I>shrotriiya</I> or <I></I>ordinary <I>maolika</I>. If <I>shrotriiyas</I> or ordinary <I>maolikas</I> have no marital relations with <I>shrotriiyas</I> or ordinary <I>maolikas</I>, then they become known as pure <I>shrotriiyas</I> or pure <I>maolikas</I>. Otherwise they are known after seventh generation as <I>Vam&#x301;shaja</I> Brahmans or Kayasthas <I></I>( <I>va&#x301;un&#x32D;sh ba&#x301;mun</I> or <I>va&#x301;un&#x32D;sh ka&#x301;yet</I> &ndash; &ldquo;non-<I>kuliina</I> of defective lineage&rdquo;). In the case of Brahmans, in the absence of a royal directive if their link with their original settlement is lost, then they lose their <I>kuliina</I> status. For instance, a resident of the village Bandyoghatii in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h (the person&#146;s name was Guro Bandyopadhyaya) who started living in the Ma&#x301;saca&#x301;t&#x301;aka <I></I>area of Bhuluya&#x301;<I></I>, that is, Noakhali, lost their <I>kuliina</I> status and became <I>shrotriiya</I>, that is, their surname became Ma&#x301;sacar&#x301;aka, which became transformed into Ma&#x301;saca&#x301;t&#x301;aka/Ma&#x301;saca&#x301;r&#x301;aka/Cakravartii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph --><p>How advantageous this <I>kuliina</I> system was, it is difficult to say. But its main disadvantage was that these <I>kuliina</I>s were often forced to marry their daughters to a man with many wives in order to preserve their <I>kuliina</I> status<I></I>. Often they were compelled to marry their underage daughter to an old man with many wives. Quite often their daughter had to remain unmarried all her life. On the other side the disadvantage was that while individual <I>kuliinas</I> had many marriages (Ram Chandra Mukhopadhyaya of the village of Janai married one hundred sixty-five times), the <I>shrotriiya</I> or <I></I>non<I>-kuliina</I> men could not find brides. Many men had to remain bachelors. As a result, while on one hand the number of <I>kuliinas</I> increased by leaps and bounds, the <I>shrotriiya</I> families were on the verge of extinction. Consequently all sorts of improper behaviour was seen in society. Unmarried daughters of <I>kuliina</I> families and unmarried men from <I>shrotriiya</I> families created social problems. Finding no way out, society had to close its eyes to such improper conduct. Such a state of affairs cannot bode well for any community.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph --><p>As a result of this faulty <I>kuliina</I> system the number of Banerjees, Mukherjees and Chatterjees in the Bengali Brahman community increased like wildfire, while the number of Ma&#x301;saca&#x301;r&#x301;akas, Kusha&#x301;riis, Bat&#x301;abyals, Ka&#x301;n&#x32D;ijla&#x301;ls, Pa&#x301;kr&#x301;a&#x301;ha&#x301;shis, Pa&#x301;lodhis, Patitundis, Diirgha&#x301;un&#x32D;giis, and Gar&#x301;hgar&#x301;his, <I></I>etc<I></I>. decreased almost to the verge of extinction. The Ghoshas (<I>Dash</I> <I>Ghos&#x301;a</I>), Vasus and Mitras of the Bengali Kayasthas <I></I>increased in large numbers, while the number of pure <I>maolika</I> &ndash; Sena, Sim&#x301;ha, Deva, Dutta, Kara, Guha, Das and Palita decreased considerably. The normal <I>maolikas</I> such as the Sura, Pal, Niyogi, Rudra, Dhar, Brahma, Bhain&#x32D;jas, Damas, Naha, Raha, Aikat, Aica, Chandra, Ca&#x301;ki, Nandi, etc., nearly reached the point of extinction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph --><p>The situation reached such a critical stage during the Pathan era in Bengal when the Nawab was Hussain Shah. Hussain Shah found the situation alarming. He consulted his prime minister Purandar Khan<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and attempted to change the system. Purandar Khan held a large meeting with the <I>kuliina</I> Kayasthas and changed the <I>kuliina</I> system from a system of lineage through the daughter to a system of lineage through the eldest son. That is, a <I>kuliina</I> Kayastha would be able to give his daughter in marriage to any <I>kuliina</I> or pure <I>maolika</I> or ordinary <I>maolika</I> bridegroom. He would be able to arrange the marriage of his other sons to any such family.But the firstborn son would have to be married to a <I>kuliina</I> Kayastha. In other words, a Kayastha with the surname Ghosh would be obligated to marry their firstborn son to someone in a Basu or Mitra family, but they would be at liberty to arrange the marriage of their other sons and daughters with any family. This both preserved the <I>kuliina</I> system in the Kayastha community and also prevented the degeneration of their scholarly genius.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph --><p>The Nawab and Purandar Khan attempted to arrange such a meeting with the Brahmans as well, but they did not agree to their proposal. As a result, the <I>kuliina</I> system among the Brahmans continued to be passed on through the daughters. In later times it was discovered that there were hardly any <I>kuliinas</I> left among the Brahmans. Anyhow, some Brahmans and some Kayasthas continued to be called <I>kuliina</I> in accordance with the <I>kuliina</I> system introduced by Ballal Sena among the Brahmans and Kayasthas of Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
