<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Gaor&#x301;a&#x301;dya Vaedikas [Vedics belonging to Gaor&#x301;a] are inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h in this sense. The middle-class Brahmans, composed of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hiiya Brahmans and Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hiiya Utkal Brahmans, and the Maharashtrian Brahmans who had come from outside, live in the southern region of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. They call themselves Madhya Deshiiya Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Brahmans. I find nothing wrong with this [with their calling themselves Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Kayasthas of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are very few in number. From this one might assume that the Kayasthas came from outside. But in eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and adjoining Bagri (Kandi, Katwa, Kalna, Kulingram, Konnagar, Kolkata, Krishnanagar, Jessore, Baghhati, Baghanchra, Akna, Mahinagar and Jyotsiram), the Kayasthas are very many in number. Is it probable that such a large number of Kayasthas came from outside? Rather, the Kayasthas in the whole of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and also in adjoining Bagri call themselves Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hiiya Kayasthas. In other words, they have completely identified themselves with the red soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Now, there is a tradition that Shashanka, the king of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, unified all the small Kayastha leaders in his battle against Buddhism. And let us judge whether it is believable that Vijaysingha conquered Lanka with the help of his Kayastha followers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the Buddhist age, the Kayasthas lived in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, and their domination also was immense. Many used to write, while introducing themselves, Sadbaoddha-Karan&#x301;a-Ka&#x301;yastha-T&#x301;hakkur [surnames of Kayasthas in the Pali language]. The Buddhist and the Jain ages were really different expressions, according to changes of place and person, of the same age. So the Kayasthas were certainly there in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h during the Jain age. Since they were there in the Jain-Buddhist age, it can easily be supposed that they had been there even in the pre-Jain-Buddhist age. So according to their psychology and also from a historical standpoint, the Kayasthas are originally sons of the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Maybe a handful of Kayasthas who followed Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma came or were brought to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h from outside to assist the Brahmans in imposing Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h like a jagaddal stone [a kind of immovable stone]. But the idea that all the Kayasthas of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h have come from outside is absolutely untenable. Those who came from outside were probably honoured as kuliina Ka&#x301;yasthas [Kayasthas of noble descent]. The rest were denied that honour due to their relationship with Buddhism or Jainism. They are known everywhere as maolik [original] or ancient Bengalees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->A considerable number of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Kayasthas migrated from the Singur and Haripal regions of Hooghly District in the south of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and settled in Samatat across the Bhagirathi, and also in Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k further east. It is they who are the kuliinas [of noble descent] of those areas, and not those who had been living there previously. King Shashanka did unify the strength of the Kayasthas. Again, it just might be true that Vijaysingha, accompanied by his followers, conquered Singhal [Sri Lanka] and Kerala in c. 534 BCE. Though the Singhalese became Buddhists, Buddhism did not get firmly established in Kerala. The progeny of the followers of Vijaysingha still live in Kerala. They are known as the Kerala Kayasthas (Nairs). They use surnames such as Nair, Menon, Kaimal, Panikkar, etc. Their customs, lifestyle, facial appearance, everything, resemble those of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Kayasthas. Therefore it seems that Vijaysingha, in association with his Kayastha followers, may possibly have done something like this. But in conclusion I will mention that whatever I have said about Shashanka and Vijaysingha is more speculative than based on concrete information.<!-- /block --></p>
