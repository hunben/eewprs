<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Old Persian words iyak, ik, ikka&#x301; came from the Vedic word eka. The substantive form of ik or iyak is ika&#x301;i (unit). The word is common in Urdu. &ldquo;Pertaining to eka&rdquo; is ekka&#x301;. For example, a one-horse vehicle or chariot is called ekka&#x301; (ekka&#x301; ga&#x301;r&#x301;ii khub chut&#x301;eche/oi dekha bha&#x301;i ca&#x301;nd ut&#x301;heche [the one-horse cart is moving so fast/look brother, the moon has risen]).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In pure Bengali when someone was routed or defeated one used to say t&#x301;ekka&#x301; deoya&#x301;. For example: khela&#x301;dhu&#x301;loya saba&#x301;ike t&#x301;ekka&#x301; diyeche oi chot&#x301;a chelet&#x301;i [that little boy has defeated everyone in sports]. Because there is a distinctive similarity between t&#x301;ekka&#x301; and ekka&#x301;, t&#x301;ekka&#x301; is sometimes used in Bengali where ekka&#x301; should be used. In card games we say t&#x301;ekka&#x301; [ace] in Bengali where we ought to use ekka&#x301;. In young children&#146;s games you find ekka&#x301;&#8230; dokka&#x301;&#8230; tekka&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In olden times a one-horse cart was called ekka&#x301;, and a two-horse cart was called t&#x301;omt&#x301;om. If the vehicle was covered, it was called tangaka in Sanskrit &ndash; t&#x301;a&#x301;nga&#x301; in Shaorasenii Prakrta. Nowadays however, the horse-drawn vehicles which we know by the name of pa&#x301;lki or bagi are not very old. They were first introduced in Calcutta during British rule. Men and women in high posts used to use pa&#x301;lkis for going here and there. The Indian palanquin or sedan-chair was in use nearly up until the end of the Mughal Era but towards the end of the Mughal Era its use rapidly declined. In my childhood days I saw the palanquin<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> or sedan-chair used in Bihar but after I became a little older I never saw it again. In those days the village people would sometimes go to the city in palanquins for medical treatment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->At any rate, when the Europeans came to India at the end of the Mughal Era they brought with them their palanquin which in Bengali was called pa&#x301;lki. The British introduced it in Calcutta. The bearers were mostly from Orissa. The fare was one paisa per mile.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  They petitioned to have the fare increased to one and a half per mile. When their petition was not approved they held a strike for several days. Then the English with their inventive intellect designed the pa&#x301;lki ga&#x301;r&#x301;ii or bagi [bogey] ga&#x301;r&#x301;ii  and provided for it to be drawn by horses. In this way we got today&#146;s horse-drawn carriage. A single carriage is called a &ldquo;bogey&rdquo; in English. The pa&#x301;lki carriage had the convenience of the pa&#x301;lki and because it was horse-drawn it could go faster as well. As a result, after a short time the horse-drawn carriage became favoured by the people over the traditional palanquin. So the palanquin&#146;s days slowly came to a close; its fares also decreased. However, it managed to survive in villages where there were no proper roads that the horse-drawn carriages could travel.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Similar to the ekka&#x301;-t&#x301;omt&#x301;om carriage in India was the phaeton carriage in Europe. The gentlemen of Calcutta used to ride in these phaeton carriages and enjoy the open air in the Esplanade. The pa&#x301;lki carriage gradually replaced the phaeton carriage because the women of this country who normally lived in seclusion at home did not like to ride in the open phaetons. They used to ride in the pa&#x301;lki carriages to maintain their sanctity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The days of the ekka&#x301; also came to an end, pushed out by the pa&#x301;lki carriage. Only in those cases where the roads were poor or where there was a need to bring heavy loads of vegetables to the local market, did the ekka&#x301; carriage survive. It still survives today in a few places where cycles and rickshaws cannot do precisely this kind of work. Moreover, cycles and rickshaws need somewhat better roads than the ekka&#x301; does.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Speaking of the ekka&#x301;, a story comes to mind in which the ekka&#x301; plays an important role.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->I had gone at the time to a village in Nawada subdivision of Gaya district in search of archaeological artifacts from Magadha. This place was more or less in the Ks&#x301;uri river basin. At the southwest it bordered the historically renowned Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301; mountain where the Buddha performed spiritual austerities and later gave his spiritual teaching.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->I was somewhat late returning. Though it was night there was no harm done because the night train from Gaya would pass through Nawada station quite late. The train was running late and dawn was breaking when I arrived home in Jamalpur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It was the full moon night in the middle of Hemanta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and a cool breeze was blowing; I had no trouble seeing even without a torch. I was feeling quite happy after having verified several important facts. The issue under consideration was whether or not the Buddhist Mantraya&#x301;na was dominant in Magadha during the middle of the Buddhist era or the Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na. In the Buddhist Mantraya&#x301;na they recognized the goddess (which also happened later in Tantra and the Puranic religion) and she was also honored in the Buddhist Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na, but the two were divided along doctrinal lines &ndash; one accepted Vajrata&#x301;ra&#x301; and the other Niilta&#x301;ra&#x301; or Niil Saraswatii.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> With the passage of time Niil Saraswatii took the form of Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;pa&#x301;ramita&#x301; in Tibet and later Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;pa&#x301;ramita&#x301; was accepted in India by the followers of Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na. At the outset, Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;pa&#x301;ramita&#x301; and Niil Saraswatii were considered to be one and the same, but later they became separate goddesses. In the beginning, their Dhya&#x301;namantra was also the same, but it also became different afterwards.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In Magadha I found the whole or broken statues or remainders of destroyed statues of Niil Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;, Ugrata&#x301;ra&#x301;, Bhra&#x301;mariita&#x301;ra&#x301;, and Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;pa&#x301;ramita&#x301;. From this I arrived at the firm conclusion that they were accepted in Magadha despite the divisions that took place on or outside of Magadha soil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->I was walking in the direction of Nawada station, the station still about six miles away, when I saw a pond on the left side of the road. In Magadha there are very few ponds but during the Buddhist era ponds were often dug next to Buddhist monasteries because many mendicants and students used to stay there and a great deal of water was needed for them for which a well would not be sufficient.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->When I saw the pond I stopped. I thought that perhaps there might be a garh<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> nearby. There was no garh to be seen but I did see a tall mound next to the pond. If one sat on one side of the mound then the other side was not visible but if one stood one could see all the way around it. I sat on one side of the mound and started pondering &ndash; I had never heard of the existence of a Buddhist monastery in such a place. But then whose mound was this?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Suddenly I saw an ekka&#x301; coming down the same path by which I had come. It came to halt in front of me and, lo and behold!, there was no driver, no one at the reins. The horse knew the path and brought the vehicle there. Just as it pulled up, a young gentleman appeared from the other side of the mound. I asked him in Magahii: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; He greeted me with folded hands and said with a slight smile: &ldquo;Look, it seems perhaps that the ekka&#x301; has come for you. Otherwise wherefrom would it come in such an unlikely moment and place? Quite astonishing, in fact!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;It certainly is.&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;You are quite correct.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Please, get in the ekka&#x301;,&rdquo; he said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But there is no driver,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;How will the horse go to where I want to go?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Don&#146;t worry about it. I can drive the ekka&#x301;.&rdquo; Saying this, he helped me get in the ekka&#x301; and then jumped into the driver&#146;s seat himself and started to drive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;This is quite astounding. An ekka&#x301; has come for me &ndash; how, I don&#146;t know how &ndash; and you as well it seems. And another astounding thing is that you know how to drive it. It amazes me to see so many astounding things at one time.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am not any the less surprised to see you here,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;If you had gone a little further you would have come to Kaoya&#x301;kol village.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> You used to be able to find statues of Vajraba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii and Vajrayoginii from the Chinese Buddhist Tantra there, in other words they were recognized goddesses in Ciina&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [Chinese Tantra]. Their main place was Vikramman&#x301;ipur&#146;s (Vikrampur) Vajrayoginii village in Bengal (the village name is Badarajoinii). Statues of Vajrayoginii and Vajraba&#x301;ra&#x301;hii were also found in old Tripura&#146;s Mayana&#x301;matii (subsequently British Tripura or Kumilla&#x301; district) and Dattapa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; village of Bhuluya&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You are so knowledgeable,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->He replied very politely and gentlemanly. &ldquo;I drive the ekka&#x301; and I also do one or two other things. I was very happy to see that you are doing research on Magadha&#146;s archaeological wealth. Actually, I didn&#146;t just come here; I&#146;ve been with you secretly all along. When you sat down on one side of the mound, I sat down on the other side.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I see. But how is it that you know so much about the Buddhist era?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I live in this land and I won&#146;t know it? I love every particle of Magadha.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->I was very pleased to hear this from him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Finally we arrived at Nawada station. I gave him my thank-you but when I offered him some remuneration he folded his hands and said: &ldquo;I am so happy to have had the opportunity to drive you. If I accept a fee then I will not be so happy, so please, don&#146;t give me any money.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->What could I do? I sat down in the waiting room and a short while later the train to Jamalpur arrived. The train was nearly empty and I was able to find a small compartment that was unoccupied. I fell asleep but at one point the rattling of the train woke me up and when I looked up I saw the same young man who had brought me to Nawada station in the ekka&#x301; sitting in front of me.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When did you get in?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->This time he answered in Bengali. &ldquo;I also got in at Nawada, just after you did.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What happened to the carriage?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;After you got down I could no longer see it, almost as if it was magic. As if you had conjured it up with your magic wand. Do you know what I am thinking now? I am thinking that this body of mine is also yours; as if you created it with a magic incantation.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What are you saying!&rdquo; I interjected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->He smiled. Now he was speaking completely in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I can see that you are also very enthusiastic about archaeological research,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Now tell me, what was this mound for?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That mound is not a relic of the Buddhist era, rather it dates from the British era. As far as I know &ndash; but of course you are well aware of this &ndash; in the year 1905, India&#146;s Viceroy, Lord Curzon, divided the land of Bengal, or Bengalistan, into two parts, East Bengal and Assam Province with its capital at Dhaka, and West Bengal with its capital at Calcutta.

<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The people of Bengal did not accept this partition. They started agitating strongly for the reunification of Bengal. One can say that the struggle for Indian independance began with this movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One may ask why the Sepoy Mutiny was not part of the struggle for independance. Because it was not inspired with the goal of liberating the country. That struggle began out of the fear that the East India Company would destroy religion. It was supported by some dispossessed local kings and nawabs. When the Sepoy Mutiny first started in Barrackpore and Berhampore, the thought of liberating the country was not in the smallest corner of their minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When the movement began against the partition of Bengal, the desire to liberate the country had not yet arisen in their minds either. Their primary objective was to make the two Bengals one again. But after the agitation to unite Bengal had been going on for some time, the desire to liberate the country from the grip of foreign enemies arose in their minds. Thus we can say that this time saw the sprouting of the seed of desire for independence. The rulers of East Bengal and Assam Province at the time completely lost their senses, like a mad dog, in the effort to suppress the movement. As a result, &lsquo;terrorism as an effect of helplessness complex&rsquo; arose among the oppressed and persecuted Bengali population. Such tyranny was not seen in [west] Bengal, so terrorism also did not flourish there.<!-- /block --></p>

The police chief of East Bengal and Assam Province, Mr. Tegartt, scoured the region in a furious effort to capture them. Thereafter they quit East Bengal and Assam and came to Bengal where they continued to conduct their terrorist activities from Nawada in Gaya district. Along with their terrorist work, Shubhendra Narayana ran a betel shop in Nawada and Manotos&#x301;a Vasu used to drive an ekka&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The two friends used to meet each other in their spare time. As their terrorist activities in Gaya district grew, a lot of eavesdropping started going on. Informants were recruited in different neighbourhoods to help catch the terrorists. After a long search they were able to track the two of them down. There was a great battle between the police and these friends near the mound where you were seated, next to the pond. Both of them were killed. A grave was dug and Manotos&#x301;a was buried on the spot. A mound was built up over it so that the site could be identified.<!-- /block --></p>

Nowadays I have realized that liberty not only means escaping the clutches of an external enemy; liberty means gaining one&#146;s freedom from all kinds of bondages &ndash; economic, dialetical, intellectual, educational, linguistic and cultural. Geo-sentiment and racial sentiment alone are not all there is to freedom. External forces ruled this country because they were able to extract its essence, its vital juices. When they saw that they had to expend a lot of money to maintain the sugar cane production, when they saw that it was no longer profitable after having sucked the industry dry, then they left. They did not go due to any other pressure; economic difficulties forced them to leave. It is important to remember, both then and now, that it cannot be called freedom when black exploiters take the place of white exploiters. Even though the foreign powers have left, their exploitative machinery is still in place. That machinery will have to go.

A tributary breaks off from the middle part of this icha&#x301;matii on its right-hand side and joins the Bha&#x301;girathi near Shantipur. This tributary is known by the name of the Churni. It is said that the Dewan of Nadia, Raghunandan Mitra, made this river (or rather canal) in one night by pilfering the waters of the icha&#x301;matii with the help of a huge number of diggers. Since the canal (in subsequent times called a river) was fashioned with stolen waters it was given the name Churiye Neoya&#x301; [Pilfered] &ndash; shortened to Churni. Up until the time that the Churni came out of the Icha&#x301;matii, that is, as long as the Icha&#x301;matii came from the Padma but before the Churni was made, the river is known as the Ma&#x301;tha&#x301;bhaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. Thereafter the right-hand river is known by the name of the Churni and the left-hand, original river, by the name of the Icha&#x301;matii.

But there is a fundamental error here. In Vedic or laokik Sanskrit, ra&#x301; is used to mean &ldquo;manifestation&rdquo;, &ldquo;vocality&rdquo;, &ldquo;receive&rdquo; or &ldquo;obtain&rdquo;. It is not used in the sense of &ldquo;giving&rdquo;. When thus analysed, indira&#x301; means &ldquo;one who gets or receives abundance&rdquo;. The Puranic goddess Laks&#x301;mii gives abundance, so to use the word indira&#x301; for her is completely unjustified.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->Ind + un&#x301; =indu. &ldquo;The one in whom there is nectar or the abundance of beauty&rdquo; &ndash; this is the etymological meaning of indu. Its colloquial meaning is the moon. According to the yogic scriptures, among the sixteen kala&#x301;s [sixteen divisions of the lunar cycle] the fourteenth is seen on the fourteenth lunar day and the fifteenth is seen during the full moon but since the moon remains in a certain position the sixteenth kala&#x301; is not visible. It remains in darkness. This sixteenth kala&#x301; is the receptacle of ambrosia. Because it remains covered in darkness, its name is ama&#x301;kala&#x301; and because it is the recptacle of nectar, its other name is indu.<!-- /block --></p>

[I do not drink wine; I drink nectar by singing the praises of the Divine Mother.]) Shiva was the King of the Yogis so the yogis used to think that this ama&#x301;kala&#x301; was permanently bound up in his matted locks. Thus one of the names they gave him was indushekhara. But in laokika Sanskrit and in the people&#146;s languages the word indu is also used to refer to the entire moon. If indu was only used for the sixteenth kala&#x301; where would the complete moon (indumatii) be able to go?<!-- /block --></p>

And precisely for this reason where will the krs&#x301;nendus, pu&#x301;rnendus (the kala&#x301;, not the entire moon), shubhendus go? If yet another error is indulged, saying that indu means the entire moon, in order to shore up this prevalent error, will this be proper? In this case, in order to mend the situation and to rectify another mistake, I can say emphatically that indu means the sixteenth kala&#x301; of the moon. Still, in some people&#146;s opinion, indu refers to the entire moon.<!-- /block --></p>

In the Bengali army there were large numbers of bagdiis [a Hindu caste] During battle the duliya&#x301; or dule ba&#x301;gdiis used to help them by carrying their palanquins.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)   In those days the half-paisa coin was quite common in the market and was worth something as well. Officially the pie-paisa was in use but practically it was the half-paisa or adhla&#x301;. In my childhood days in Bihar one could get four kacuri [a kind of pancake made from pulse] and vegetables for one adhla&#x301;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  The Bengali year has six seasons. Hemanta corresponds to the end of autumn and beginning of winter. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)  In many people&#146;s opinion this Niil Saraswatii was later transformed into the white-coloured Puranic goddess Saraswatii. Up until the time of British rule what people meant by the worship of Saraswatii was the worship of books. After the first statue of Saraswatii was made during British rule the Saraswatii puja was introduced. The Saraswatii of the Vedic and post-Vedic eras and the Saraswatii which is worshipped today are not the same. The Dhyanamantra of the modern Saraswatii, Ya kundendu tus&#x301;a&#x301;raha&#x301;ra dhavala&#x301;, [who is as white as the kunda flower and as glittering as a string of icicles] is not an ancient mantra.</p>

The word Chotanagpur was dropped from the name of the Province later on.</p>
