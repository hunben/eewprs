<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There was a small town on the banks of the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; where my younger brother worked. Evening had set in by the time I reached there with my mother. One feels even more helpless in an unfamiliar place in the evening than in a familiar place in the middle of the night. My brother had been informed we were coming, but I had not let him know when. I had left quite abruptly. After a good deal of searching, we found my brother&#146;s bungalow near the river landing at one end of the European colony. I found myself looking at a massive bungalow which was standing in the darkness like a ghost. No one had even lit a lamp. And who was there to do so! I got news from Rahman, who resided in a servants&#146; building:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sahib had to leave on urgent official work. Because of the possibility of your coming, he left the key with me. Please go inside and rest. I&#146;m sending a neighbour to stay in one of the servants&#146; buildings. He&#146;ll do whatever chores you need done. If there&#146;s anything you need from the market, please let me know and I&#146;ll go get it now.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Mother said, &ldquo;Let me see what&#146;s already there in the house and what&#146;s not, then I&#146;ll let you know what you have to bring.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->We unlocked the house and entered. There were countless rooms. It seemed to me as though our untimely arrival had broken up a long-standing gathering, and that all those assembled had been suddenly forced to bid farewell. I started shivering. Surrounding the house was an orchard with mango, ja&#x301;m and coconut trees. Actually it would be much more accurate to call it a forest than an orchard. Several stray dogs started howling from there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As one might expect, we were quite tired after our train journey. Mother said, &ldquo;First let&#146;s have a little tea, then we&#146;ll see what&#146;s where.&rdquo; I located the oven. I found everything &ndash; coal, cow dung fuel-cakes, tea leaves, sugar &ndash; I only couldn&#146;t find milk. Hence, I thought I would send Rahman to the bazaar to bring milk and a little fruit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Exiting from the station I had noticed some clouds gathering in the northeastern corner of the sky. I had not realized that within the hour the whole sky had become covered with clouds. This I realized when I went to call Rahman and saw the sky&#146;s dark clouds, amid which thunder and flashes of lightning had begun&#8230; the winds were howling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->I did not call Rahman. Perhaps I could have. But where could I send him on the brink of such a storm? The inevitable decision was taken to have tea without milk, and somehow or another pass the night. I sat down in a reclining chair. The storm&#146;s destructive dance began&#8230; crashing sounds came from all around. Doors and windows would periodically open and shut noisily. The storm kept growing. The lamps, our companions in this unfamiliar place, went out. With a flashlight, mother somehow started to go about her tasks. Drowsiness crept over my eyes. Mother said, &ldquo;One room is locked&#8230; I think that&#146;s where the provisions are.&rdquo; I realized mother&#146;s conjecture was correct. My brother had perhaps mistakenly taken the storeroom key along with him, or left it elsewhere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->I got a strange feeling. Someone it seems had come up and was standing in front of me. At first I did not want to look at the person, but after a few moments I was obliged to when she said, &ldquo;Could I please tell you something?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Who is this? I saw a beautiful young woman standing before me&#8230; married&#8230; not just lovely but flawlessly beautiful: Tanvii shya&#x301;ma&#x301; shikharidashana&#x301; pakvabimba&#x301;dharos&#x301;t&#x301;hii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> [&ldquo;Dark and slender, with fine teeth and lips the colour of ripened bimba fruit&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The woman spoke again, &ldquo;Listen to me!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Surprised, I looked at her with questioning eyes. I wasn&#146;t really interested to hear what else she had to say &ndash; I wanted to know who she was. But what did the young woman understand of my curiosity? She went on with her own soliloquy: &ldquo;You know, I live here. When someone comes I really love to cook and serve food myself.  But you see, now there&#146;s no way I can. You all have arrived so tired, and I certainly should have cooked and fed you. But I&#146;m not able to do so. Now just imagine how painful that is for me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->I stared at her. Now I really wanted to know why it is she could not feed me. This time she again avoided giving me a straight answer and said, &ldquo;Look, in that storeroom there&#146;s rice, dal, salt, grains, etc. There are even out-of-season peas brought down from Darjeeling.&rdquo; Smiling a little she said, &ldquo;Everything you need for khicur&#x301;i<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is there. Since mother didn&#146;t eat rice today, I don&#146;t think there&#146;ll be any problem with eating khicur&#x301;i now.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now it seemed the young woman would satisfy my curiosity. She said, &ldquo;Oh, you know I forgot to tell you the most important thing. The key is in a niche at the back of the dressing table.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now she went on: &ldquo;It&#146;s been a long time since I came to this house, but I&#146;ve not seen anyone else fall into your predicament.&rdquo; This time, beginning to answer my actual question she said, &ldquo;After marriage we lived in my husband&#146;s house in Kolkata. We had come here just for a short change of scene. One day what happened is that, absorbed in a petty domestic quarrel, I lost my wits and killed myself in this room. The next day everyone in the household returned to Kolkata. Local people thought I&#146;d died of cholera.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The young woman suddenly seemed to dissolve into the air. A little later when I regained my senses, I found my mother shaking me gently saying, &ldquo;Oh, so you dozed off? Have some tea.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->I said, &ldquo;Not just tea, Mom. Arrangements are also under way for khicur&#x301;i.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->I jumped up and reached into the niche behind the dressing table. Sure enough, there was a key there, and it was none other than the key to the storage room.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  Shrii Himangshu Sarkar, the younger brother whose house the author visits in this story, in his book Parama Shraddheya Agraja &ndash; Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, clarifies that Abdul Rahman was his cook. Being Muslim, Rahman assumed that Shrii Sarkar and his mother, being from a Hindu family, would not eat food cooked by him, and therefore intended to send a Hindu neighbour for that purpose. In fact Shrii Sarkar was far from subscribing to such dogmas. See pp. 13 and 111 of the Bengali edition of Parama Shraddheya Agraja. &ndash;Trans.</p>
