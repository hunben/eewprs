<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->That evening Tarun Kumar<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> was sitting alone on its sandy shores. He was not counting the waves of the blue sea: he had no time for such trifling matters. Rather, he was wondering if he could drink all the water in a single gulp, like the sage Agastya.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> If he could, it would be easier for him to catch a glimpse of the vast mysteries under the sea.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->He would suffer the same fate as those other children&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->What&#146;s that approaching him?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->A jet black figure. It is coming closer and closer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Tarun Kumar said, &ldquo;Who are you, brother?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;m the chief ghost.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Tarun asked, &ldquo;Is there anything I can do for you? You should know that I&#146;m a medical student. Things like dead bodies and skeletons don&#146;t frighten me at all. And anyway, I don&#146;t believe in ghosts.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The ghost replied, &ldquo;That may be, but you can see me, can&#146;t you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Tarun replied, &ldquo;This is nothing but an optical illusion.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Look here, Tarun,&rdquo; retorted the chief ghost, &ldquo;it&#146;s no use arguing. I will do what I came to do. Other children would have fainted by now, but you are still conversing with me. I cannot but admire such strength of mind. However, I won&#146;t leave this place until I&#146;ve frightened you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Tarun said, &ldquo;This is going too far. My patience also has its limits, you know. You&#146;d better leave this place honourably while you still have the chance. Otherwise it will be difficult for you to keep body and soul together.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost tried frightening Tarun by flashing his twenty-eight teeth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Tarun had no other choice. He started showering the ghost with blows, punches and slaps. The beating was so severe that he started bleeding profusely. He fell down on the sandy shore and groaned: he had lost twenty-two and a half teeth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->It suddenly occurred to Tarun that he was going to be a doctor in the near future. Therefore, he tried to revive the chief ghost by fanning his head and sprinkling water on his face. He did everything he could, but was unable to bring him back to his senses. He even tried using cassia leaf, burnt chilli<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and smelling salts, but in vain. Finally, at about midnight, refreshed by the soothing touch of the cool sea-breeze, the chief ghost slowly opened his eyes, and said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tarun, you are indeed a citizen of the Kingdom of Light. That&#146;s why you&#146;ve brought your enemy back to life. We, the citizens of the Kingdom of Darkness don&#146;t hesitate to take the life of even a faithful friend. You are truly great.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Tarun asked, &ldquo;Where is the Kingdom of Darkness, friend?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost, happy to hear Tarun&#146;s sweet words, replied:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Our country is under the fathomless depths of yonder blue sea. Would you like to go there?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Tarun said, &ldquo;Will you take me? If you will of course I&#146;ll go.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost replied, &ldquo;I&#146;m always ready to take you there. However, our country is infested with all types of creatures: ghosts, demons, goblins, witches, elves, hobgoblins and ghouls. If you attempt to enter that land in your body of human flesh and bones they will devour you. But I know what you can do. If you put this lemon lozenge between your teeth and lips you will become invisible. If you place it between your teeth and tongue you will again be visible.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Tarun Kumar immediately took the lozenge and placed it between his teeth and lips. It was very tasty. In no time its juice had reached his stomach and&#8230; at that very moment&#8230; Tarun looked down at himself and saw&#8230; my goodness&#8230; his body had become completely invisible!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Tarun hung onto the chief ghost&#146;s neck and journeyed&#8230; to the bottom of the blue sea&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->As they climbed down the sea-ladder&#8230; shoals upon shoals of sharkfish, dolphins, octopuses, sea horses and whales were almost touching them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Oh, how dark it was&#8230; The deeper they went, the darker it became.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The people of the Kingdom of Light could never imagine such darkness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Everyone in this kingdom was blind. Even those who had eyes could not see.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Then, slowly&#8230; the shoals of sea-creatures dispersed. Finally they reached a land&#8230; as yet unknown to the people of the Kingdom of Light.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Tarun Kumar asked the chief ghost,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Is this the Kingdom of Ghosts?<br>Is this the Kingdom of Darkness?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But the Kingdom of Ghosts is divided into three provinces. There was a time when all three were ruled by the same king. Now they have been split up.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;How vivid are my memories of the troubled days we endured at the time of that division. The founder of the Kingdom of Darkness&#8230; was called&#8230; &lsquo;Bhut&rsquo;!<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Bhut&#146;s son was called &lsquo;Kimbhut&rsquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And Kimbhut&#146;s son was called&#8230; &lsquo;Adbhut&rsquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And he had three sons:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;&lsquo;Fear&rsquo;, &lsquo;Slumber&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hypocrisy&rsquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;These three were locked in a blood bath over the partitioning of the kingdom. They fought over which village should be included in whose kingdom, which kitchen&#146;s oven&#8230; should be on which side of the boundary line, which kingdom should get the muddy bed of a pond, and which kingdom its surface water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There was so much fighting. So much bloodshed. We all lost our lives in that battle and became ghosts. Little did we realize at the time that such bloody killing&#8230; would do us no good.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Tarun was deeply touched by the chief ghost&#146;s repentance, and said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You have committed a great blunder. We are wiser; we never quarrel over land-division in the Kingdom of Light. Our kingdom is an integrated whole.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost announced, &ldquo;Tarun Kumar, this part of the Kingdom of Darkness is called the &lsquo;Kingdom of Hypocrisy&rsquo;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->After walking a little way Tarun heard a lot of shouting and stopped in his tracks. He asked the chief ghost,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What&#146;s all that shouting about, friend?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost replied,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The students have brought a &lsquo;no-confidence&rsquo; motion against the teachers because those who failed the examination have not been promoted. But the motion wasn&#146;t passed due to sabotage by the promoted students. That&#146;s the cause of the uproar. Let&#146;s go and see what&#146;s happening.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Tarun and the chief ghost entered the school. Its appearance was quite impressive, but in all other aspects it was desolate. They saw that the teacher had already started his class with the promoted students. They were all ghosts, like everybody in the Kingdom of Ghosts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Their ugly heads are turned backwards<br>Their feet are twisted around<br>By seeing their odd gestures<br>One feels goose pimples all over<br>They hunt their prey at midnight<br>And snore during the day<br>They gamble during the darkness of night<br>And get scared at the sight of light.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->The teacher was delivering a speech in a loud voice, claiming that all the teachers in the school, excepting himself of course, were incompetent. He disclosed that the teachers of the headmaster&#146;s faction were maltreating the teachers of his own group. He also mentioned that all his private students got excellent results in their examinations; and many more things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->Tarun Kumar wasn&#146;t over inspired by the teacher&#146;s speech. One thing he did appreciate, however, was his lucid explanation of the dangers of using intoxicating herbs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->As soon as the class was over, Tarun followed the teacher back to the staff-room. There he saw him light a beedie, saying, &ldquo;Ah, that&#146;s better&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->It is written in the ghost-scriptures that it is forbidden to touch fire. But the fire of the burning beedie<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is not prohibited!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Tarun returned to the school the next morning. He was surprised to see that the students were still attending meetings instead of classes. A self-styled leader was addressing them:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Dear friends, this is the age of democracy. Everyone has the right to enjoy the benefits of a democracy, haven&#146;t they? Then why should the students and common people of the Kingdom of Ghosts be deprived of this right? The teachers and guardians have been imposing dictatorial rule over you since time immemorial. How long will you tolerate this reign of terror? The only way to live a life worthy of a ghost is to embrace democracy. We must establish democracy in the fire of revolution and write its words boldly in letters of blood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;My dear friends, I anticipate your full support. Remember that I am always your friend, in every place: at meetings, in the universities, in the assembly, everywhere. I shall be delighted if you give me the honour of representing you. Today I propose that we save the neglected majority of our society. We students greatly outnumber the teachers, so let&#146;s raise our voice today and save democracy. We, the students, should take over the management of the school, set the question papers and mark the examination papers. Never again shall we tolerate the rule of the minority.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;My dear friends&#8230; one more point. English may be a good language, and may claim considerable respect throughout the entire universe, but as I, and your other friends, don&#146;t know English very well, we must start an anti-English campaign. Whenever the teachers start lecturing in English you should protest by blocking your ears with your fingers.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->Tarun listened to the lecture attentively and then silently followed the leader to his house. His appearance belied the fact that he was a student. Sometime after their arrival the gentleman&#146;s children came home from the English-medium school where they were studying. Tarun heard them call their mother, &ldquo;mummy&rdquo; and their father, &ldquo;daddy&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->Tarun said to his companion, &ldquo;Friend, what&#146;s going on here?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost replied, &ldquo;My dear brother, have you already forgotten the name of this kingdom? This is the Kingdom of Hypocrisy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->That evening Tarun Kumar and the chief ghost decided to stay in the leader&#146;s house to observe his behaviour. You must have realized that he was not a man but a ghost, like all the others. His feet were twisted around like any other ghost.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->During the evening some visitors arrived at the house to conduct a secret meeting. Before starting they closed their eyes and chanted the name of &ldquo;bhut&rdquo; (&ldquo;ghost&rdquo;) with deep reverence and then smoked some intoxicating herbs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->The first visitor said, &ldquo;Sir, the speech you delivered today was truly unique and has created considerable agitation and unrest among the students.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->The second visitor said, &ldquo;I&#146;ve never heard such a speech before in my entire life. It will certainly ensure your election victory. Moreover, the students will organize your publicity campaign.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->The third visitor said, &ldquo;I think we should have called the election by now to take advantage of the students&#146; present sentiments.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->The leader said, &ldquo;Don&#146;t worry about that. We shall organize a huge procession a few days before the election. After exciting the students with rousing speeches we shall put them with the ladies at the front of the procession. If the police start using force to control the unruly mob, we shall announce that our opponents have killed women. And even if the ladies flee away in fear of the police, all those students who were roused by my speech will remain. They will surely not run away. If one or two students die at the hands of the police, we shall raise the slogan that the police have killed innocent students. This slogan will help our work; the students will labour heartily for our cause.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->Tarun said to the chief ghost, &ldquo;Friend, what are all these terrible things I&#146;m hearing?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost replied, &ldquo;There&#146;s no need to be so alarmed. Always remember the name of this kingdom, brother, always keep it in mind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;We couldn&#146;t even imagine such atrocities in our Kingdom of Light,&rdquo; said Tarun. &ldquo;By the way, those leader ghosts also have sons and daughters. Won&#146;t they also be killed by the bullets?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Don&#146;t you know,&rdquo; said the chief ghost, &ldquo;that those with children studying in schools and colleges would never excite the students in such a way. And even if they did, they would keep them safely at home.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->Tarun muttered, &ldquo;Oh, I see&#8230;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->The next day they followed one of the students home from the school. His father was well-educated and quite cultured. While talking with his son, he said, &ldquo;Never take other people&#146;s belongings without asking. If you do, it&#146;s called stealing.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->Tarun Kumar and the chief ghost were both delighted to hear such strong moral teachings and decided to follow the gentleman to his office at the railway-station.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->On arriving there they saw an amazing thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->The gentleman started taking rice, salt, oil, mangoes, pulse, wax-gourds<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and other things from different sacks of different sizes. He did it in such a way that the seals were left unbroken. He sent all these things back to his house with one of the office boys.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Tarun was astounded. &ldquo;After forbidding his son to steal, he himself stole&#8230; But of course, this is the Kingdom of Hypocrisy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->The gentleman (gentle ghost) went into his office and sat down. Tarun and the chief ghost stood behind him. A merchant came to pick up his goods.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->The gentleman said, &ldquo;Come back later. I don&#146;t have any time now.&rdquo; The merchant replied, &ldquo;But I need those goods today.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; said the gentleman apologetically. &ldquo;I&#146;m alone here. I don&#146;t have 10 hands, you know, only two. I&#146;m fed up with all this work.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->The merchant ghost said, &ldquo;Here, take this 10 rupee note. It will make you feel better.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->The gentleman ghost retorted, &ldquo;Obviously you don&#146;t realize just how depressed I am! Do you think that 10 rupees will make me all right? Are you trying to ridicule me? I don&#146;t accept bribes; I&#146;m a pious man, you know.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->The merchant ghost slipped a fifty rupee note into his hand. Then the gentleman ghost got up and happily did the work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->It was quite difficult for Tarun to endure this situation. He decided to report the incident to the police and set off to do so without further delay.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->Tarun was pleased to see the sub-inspector&#146;s devotion to duty and expected that he would pursue the matter to the end.

<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You know, you&#146;ve committed a crime. Therefore it would be advisable for you to satisfy the sub-inspector, just as any other intelligent person world.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->Just then, another fat ghost entered the private office of the sub-inspector ghost with a look of apprehension, gave an over-courteous salute showing his unquestioning loyalty, and said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;With your endless grace, sir, we can now deal with the scoundrel properly.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes, it can be done,&rdquo; said the sub-inspector gravely, &ldquo;but it involves a lot of risk.

<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->The fat ghost thrust 750 rupees into the sub-inspector&#146;s hand. He in turn thrust a little money into the hand of one of his subordinates and put some money aside for a senior officer of higher rank.

<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->After seeing this scene Tarun turned to the chief ghost in silent amazement.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->Tarun then set out for the house of the head ghost&#146;s secretary to lodge a complaint against the sub-inspector ghost. On arriving he saw an unbelievably fat ghost sitting in front of the secretary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost whispered, &ldquo;He&#146;s the minister ghost. He&#146;s so fat he can&#146;t walk on his own two feet. In the entire country there is no other public servant equal to him in merit. Whenever he delivers his eloquent speeches, people simply stare at his face in complete astonishment. Now, let&#146;s see what the minister and secretary have to say.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph -->The secretary ghost was saying, &ldquo;But if I appoint your nephew instead of the suitable candidate won&#146;t there be considerable opposition?

<a name="103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Let your reputation go to hell!&rdquo; exclaimed the minister ghost. &ldquo;The day I was elected minister all the ghosts of the country knew that I would make my fortune.

<a name="106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->The secretary ghost listened to everything and said, &ldquo;I will carry out your every order. But I&#146;m a little worried about the reaction of the press.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph -->Tarun and the chief ghost went to the minister&#146;s residence in his car.

<a name="110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->The reporter ghost replied, &ldquo;You know very well that the paper is my only source of income.

<a name="111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why&#146;s that?&rdquo; said the minister ghost. &ldquo;We&#146;ve been paying your dues month after month. When you were criticizing us so bitterly we paid you handsomely to keep you quiet. Since that time you&#146;ve been praising us and have been enjoying a regular monthly allowance, haven&#146;t you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph -->The reporter closed his eyes and smiled. He replied, &ldquo;Sir, you&#146;ve been giving me money for my personal use, but the paper is a commercial concern.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; agreed the minister, &ldquo;the advertising quota will be slightly increased. Are you going to your office now?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=114 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the reporter ghost. &ldquo;A great sage of the ghost society has taken shelter under a banyan tree outside the town.

<a name="117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->The minister, Shriijukta Bhutanarayan Sharma replied, &ldquo;Why are you so worried? We&#146;ve been bribing the reporters month after month. Have we done that only to face defeat?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->Mr. Bhutananda Singh replied, &ldquo;Sir, the reporters can do nothing unless we establish a good relationship with the public. We must make extensive public contacts.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->The ministers were talking over their meal. Tarun was surprised to see that they were eating far more than the ordinary ghosts. Their menu was altogether different from that of the common ghosts who had to chew dry bones and lick the salty earth.

They had sunken eyes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->Bhutanarayanji said, &ldquo;Sir, perhaps this is our chance to contact the public.&rdquo; He then turned to the boys and said, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->One of them, a smart looking young man, stepped forward. &ldquo;We are organizing a variety show, sir, and humbly request your cooperation.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->The group of boys replied feebly, &ldquo;In the cremation ground.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->The minister, said, &ldquo;But an epidemic has broken out there.

<a name="129"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=129 type=paragraph -->The boys said, &ldquo;Sir, we are holding the variety show there for that very reason.

<a name="130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph -->The ministers reached the cremation ground in time to keep their promise.

The ministers lavished them with praise and said that, considering the present condition of the Kingdom of Ghosts, such cultural programmes were badly needed. They claimed that the original culture of the Kingdom of Ghosts was being destroyed by foreign influences. The ministers were exulted to see that the younger generation had started working enthusiastically to counteract this trend. The foreigners alleged that the beneficial application of science as well as economic development were required to fight famine and epidemics. What they failed to realize, explained the ministers, was that art could not survive without the existence of such calamities. Art is dependent on these calamities; its very effectiveness is in their portrayal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="131"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=131 type=paragraph -->The ghosts were very happy to hear such words from the ministers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="132"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=132 type=paragraph -->The ministers said, &ldquo;We will be very busy during the forthcoming election, but if we win, by your grace, we shall immediately start a ghost culture club financed entirely by the government.

<a name="133"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=133 type=paragraph -->After the speech, Shriijukta Bhutananda Singh whispered something in the ear of Shriijukta Bhutanarayan Sharma and they decided to visit the Great Sage to have their fate told by him.

<a name="136"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=136 type=paragraph -->Bhutanandaji was observing silence during the day, and so the ministers had to wait until evening for his reply. After breaking his silence, Bhutanandaji inquired,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="137"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=137 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Have you come to ask if you&#146;re going to win the election?

<a name="138"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=138 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes we have, Your Holiness,&rdquo; replied the ministers, &ldquo;but we don&#146;t have much faith in them.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Don&#146;t put too much pressure on them to pay unpaid bills, income-tax, sales-tax and other taxes. Oh, one more thing, have you given them ample scope for black marketeering?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="140"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=140 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes, Your Holiness,&rdquo; replied the ministers. &ldquo;We have made the seven-year plans in such a way that they, as contractors, will be able to extract the lion&#146;s share of the money invested by the government. Moreover, we have not put the responsibility for these projects in the hands of the learned experts, but have given it to people selected by ourselves whether they know anything about planning or not.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="141"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=141 type=paragraph -->Bhutanandaji said, &ldquo;What is the gist of your psychological propaganda among the chief ghosts?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="142"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=142 type=paragraph -->The minister ghosts replied, &ldquo;We have told them that as the Kingdom of Ghosts is still in its infancy we must all labour hard to build it up.

<a name="152"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=152 type=paragraph -->The next day, at the crack of dawn, Tarun and the chief ghost saw Bhutananda Maharaja sitting in the middle of a group of disciples. The holy fire was burning in front of him. Crowds of followers were coming from nearby villages. They brought thousands of varieties of fruits, nuts and other delicacies as well as various narcotics such as marijuana, opium and hashish. Bhutanandaji was chanting the &ldquo;bhu&#x301;ta&rdquo; mantra with closed eyes which he half opened from time to time to study the sumptuous fruits and delicacies. He always observed a vow of silence during the day in case a disciple would ask him a difficult question. In this way he avoided embarrassing situations.<!-- /block --></p>

You should always remember that such deceitful businessmen generally become very greedy and stupid. Within a few days they will be fully convinced and will lay all their ornaments in front of you.

<a name="171"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=171 type=paragraph -->Then His Holiness turned around in search of the malpo sweets. He was amazed to see that there was nothing there. The sweets were missing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="172"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=172 type=paragraph -->His Holiness was beside himself with anger. &ldquo;Hey you fellows, who ate the malpos?

<a name="178"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=178 type=paragraph -->After giving some hefty tips Bhutanandaji and his disciples were freed and allowed to return home. His Holiness, however, stayed at the police station to try and persuade the sub-inspector ghost that the ministers Bhutananda Singh and Bhutanarayan Sharma were his followers. It would therefore be improper for the sub-inspector ghost to accept a bribe from him. Anyway, the sub-inspector didn&#146;t believe him and he was only released after giving the bribe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="179"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=179 type=paragraph -->When he returned to the banyan tree his disciples apologized. His Holiness said, &ldquo;Let bygones be bygones. Let us now engage ourselves in ghost meditation.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="180"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=180 type=paragraph -->The next day saw an increase in the rush of devotees to Bhutanandaji&#146;s ashram. They were all saying,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="183"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=183 type=paragraph -->That day the crowd of smugglers was larger than on other occasions. In order to give them some befitting advice His Holiness decided not to observe his usual vow of silence that day. The smugglers, on receiving suitable instructions paid their dues and started to leave. Just then the sub-inspector ghost came running in.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="184"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=184 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What&#146;s the matter?&rdquo; asked His Holiness. &ldquo;Why are you gasping for breath?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="186"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=186 type=paragraph -->By the time the followers had left it was already evening. Bhutananda Maharaja had another desire to secretly eat malpo sweets. However, when he remembered that they had all vanished, he was totally upset and flew into another rage. His disciple ghosts were again benumbed with fear. The police were called to start an immediate investigation. It was already quite late and if they delayed the sweets would never be found.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="187"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=187 type=paragraph -->His Holiness was a staunch supporter of the government. Therefore the ministers also became very active. With a great show of strength the highest ranking officer down to the petty constable started ransacking and looting. They started their raid by entering the kitchens of the female ghosts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="188"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=188 type=paragraph -->The police, who normally showed no interest at in apprehending the real thieves, rogues, bribe-takers and smugglers became so active that the sea-girt earth started trembling. Male and female ghosts were arrested in large numbers. Many of them were beaten with sticks to get a forced confession that they had eaten the malpo sweets. No one, however, would confess to such a downright falsehood. Even those people in whose houses flour, sugar and milk were found were also arrested. It was claimed that they had used some scientific process to extract the ingredients from the sweets. Those who hadn&#146;t voted for the government were thrown into jail on some pretext or other. Those who secretly promised to vote for the government in the coming election, however, were set free.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="189"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=189 type=paragraph -->Tarun asked the chief ghost, &ldquo;Are these things I&#146;m seeing actually happening, brother?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="191"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=191 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No, brother,&rdquo; said Tarun, &ldquo;I haven&#146;t forgotten the name. But the question is will you people ever be able to lead honourable lives if this continues?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="192"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=192 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost replied, &ldquo;We lost our honour long ago. Now the question is how to survive. We also have some doubts in our minds whether we are alive or not. That is, are we living ghosts or dead ghosts?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="193"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=193 type=paragraph -->Tarun said, &ldquo;Such things cannot be tolerated for long. Come on, brother, let&#146;s go somewhere else.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="194"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=194 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes, let&#146;s go,&rdquo; said the chief ghost.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="195"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=195 type=paragraph -->After walking a little way they saw a huge crowd. They discovered that a certain ghost had died of prolonged starvation. Tarun saw that about one thousand young people had gathered around the dead body carrying different coloured posters, festoons and leaflets.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="196"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=196 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What&#146;s going on?&rdquo; asked the chief ghost. The crowd of ghosts replied, &ldquo;Nothing extraordinary. Such things happen all the time in this kingdom. That man died of starvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="197"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=197 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;We don&#146;t want to hear any more of the government&#146;s &lsquo;official statements.&rsquo; We propose that since it is a government of the ghosts for the ghosts and by the ghosts it will have to take the responsibility of cremating the dead body. We are just about to start a demonstration to force the government to acknowledge our demands. You may also join us.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="198"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=198 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost was about to reply when a rather domineering leader ghost reached the scene. On inquiry it was discovered that he was an important member of the ghost parliament, that is, he was an MP. The MP Ghost quickly climbed to the top of a Siamese rough bush and delivered a spirited lecture:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="199"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=199 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Dear friends. We are all fellow ghosts, citizens of the Independent Republic of Ghosts. After much toil we have just built the foundations of the Republic. At present, it would not be wise, therefore, to waste our time holding meetings and processions to unduly embarrass the state machinery. Rather, we should follow the traditions which we have inherited from the former great leaders of the ghost society. We should never do anything in the excitement of the moment which may harm our ghost culture. Dear friends, you must surely be aware that our neighbouring states, the Kingdom of the Mamdos (evil spirits) and the Kingdom of the Pishach (vampires) are encroaching on our territory. I am sure you will agree that the Mamdos are terrible enemies. It is said in the scriptures:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="201"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=201 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That is, &lsquo;The Mamdos are the most dangerous of all the ghosts. You should always stay at least 50 yards away from them.&rsquo; A dead Mamdo even murders others by rising from the grave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="202"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=202 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Dear friends! We are divided into seven hundred and fifty different caste groups whereas the Mamdos don&#146;t have any caste distinctions at all. They all sit together for their feasts. A Mamdo can suck the blood of any ghost of any caste at any time of day or night, even on a cold winter&#146;s night, because they don&#146;t follow the basic principles of casteism. They don&#146;t need to take a purifying bath in the river Ganges after touching a member of a lower caste.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="203"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=203 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Dear friends! We must prepare ourselves to fight these Mamdos. Therefore, instead of quarrelling splitting up into different factions, or staging demonstrations, we must prepare ourselves according to the dictates of our ancient customs. Let us not forget our age-old traditions. Now, let us all sit in Bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;sana<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn28"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn28">28</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> close our eyes, and with a garland of bones in our hands chant the non-violent Bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; mantra.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn29"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn29">29</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="204"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=204 type=paragraph -->The assembled ghosts were moved by his eloquent speech, and were totally convinced. The MP encouraged by the response, continued:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="205"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=205 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Dear friends! The demands you have raised today are just. It is my duty, as your obedient servant, to convey these demands to parliament. It is true that the State is duty-bound to cremate each dead body in the Republic of Ghosts. I request you to return home with an undisturbed mind. After just one month the July sitting of parliament will convene. At that time I shall raise a hue and cry about the issue. I shall also hold a secret parley with the opposition members. I expect to get the dead body cremated quickly, within the next three months at least, with my best efforts.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="206"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=206 type=paragraph -->Tarun said, &ldquo;Dear friend, what are these things I&#146;m hearing?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="207"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=207 type=paragraph -->The chief ghost replied: &ldquo;We&#146;ve been hearing such things day and night.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="210"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=210 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I wasn&#146;t merely sleeping,&rdquo; said Tarun. &ldquo;I went to a dark kingdom in my dreams.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
