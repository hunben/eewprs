<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The inner import of society is collective movement. The primary stage of this movement is morality. The idealistic element of mind which inspires the human beings towards the cosmic goal is moralism. Social life has to start its journey from this moralism. The journey will end at the point where universal humanism encompasses every human being in the universe. The only resource needed on the journey is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Hence it is said, morality is the base of life, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the means and divine life is the goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ananda Marga wants to build up an ideal society such as this. So there should be a congenial environment where people will get the opportunity to enhance their physical, psychic and spiritual progress, and advance rhythmically and in unison towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence, Ananda Marga has formulated a social treatise for the establishment of a congenial social structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The social code of Manu helped to build the Hindu social system, although the same social code has been the cause of degeneration in Hindu society. Manu wanted to bind the various aspects of social life together with rigid laws and regulations. Because of the rigidity and harshness of the laws, many common people could not follow them, and as a result, they approached the priests [[for concessions]]. This led to slackness in the observation of the laws and social codes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Manu&#146;s social code, the penal code was so severe that people were always afraid. There was no congenial atmosphere for [[freedom and full growth]]. Morality was confused with dharma, so people accused of social crimes were given religious punishments. This thwarted the spiritual growth of people at every step. Obviously, Manu&#146;s social code is totally unacceptable in the society which Ananda Marga wants to establish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The specialities of the Ananda Marga social system are as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->1) Social laws and regulations have been framed in accordance with the needs and [[prevalent moods]] of the people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->2) [[That which is true]] has been accepted, and the dark aspects of life have not been given any scope to flourish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->3) The physical, psychic and spiritual progress of all people has been stressed and promoted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->To build an ideal social system, the following factors are essential &ndash; unity, social security and peace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Unity<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In any society or social structure, unity among its members is indispensable. Otherwise, the structure will crumble down. Social disunity, economic self-interest, lack of [[openness of mind to]] others&#146; actions or viewpoints, are factors which not only degrade society, but also cause the complete eradication of society from the face of the earth. In the short annals of human history, there are many societies which have completely disappeared, leaving very little trace. So the most important thing is to know how to maintain social unity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Social unity and solidarity are only possible if the members of society are inspired with the following ideals &ndash; a common ideology, a caste-less society, collective social functions and no capital punishment. In the Ananda Marga social system, all these four factors are present.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>1) A common ideology</b>. At an early age, that is, at the age of five, when a child starts acquiring knowledge, it should be taught how to imbibe cosmic ideation. Ananda Marga society is based on a common ideological goal &ndash; the attainment of Brahma. Brahma is the Eternal and Supreme entity. Abiding peace is possible if Parama Purus&#x301;a is accepted as the goal of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the economic sphere also, Ananda Marga has accepted this common goal. The entire wealth of the universe is the common patrimony of all human beings, and all are equally entitled to enjoy this wealth. At the outset of any festival or social function, the Sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&#x301; mantra is recited so that everyone can reflect on the significance of the common ideal. A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga promotes love for the entire humanity and the proper utilization of all wealth for the benefit of all. Those participating in the child-naming ceremony take the collective responsibility for the physical, psychic and spiritual development of the child. This clearly demonstrates that Ananda Marga has a common ideology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><b>2) A caste-less society</b>. Any society which gives predominance to a particular class or caste is bound to disintegrate. The curse of caste divisions is not found in any country of the world except India. Small parties and groups seeking various social and economic privileges should not be [[permitted to be formed]]. In our Ananda Marga, the entire human race is considered one family, bound by the common bonds of love. In A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga, one introduces oneself as a mere living being, so here it is impossible to establish anything but a caste-less society. The head, the directors and the general members are not only the [[fellow]] members of the society, they are also mutual spiritual associates, sharing the common spiritual ideology. They may have belonged to any other class or caste, but Brahma is accepted as the common goal for all. A social structure has been evolved in which all members consider themselves only as living beings. The entire family is not deprived of the joy of attending a social function if an individual family member makes a mistake. This precludes the possibility of forming a dissident group of excommunicated members. There is no special requirement for marriage, studying the scriptures or any [[programme]]. In Ananda Marga, looking after children is considered a social responsibility. There is no caste or colour bar for learning spiritual practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><b>3) Collective social functions</b>. Many social problems arise due to lack of magnanimity, such as not properly understanding or respecting the views of others. This not only keeps people apart, but also makes them hostile to each other. People come together in different festivals and social functions which foster mutual bonds of unity. When they participate in such activities and remain engaged in the same type of collective action, they develop the feeling of temporary affinity. Ananda Marga encourages these types of social functions. Collective bathing and collective meditation on special occasions are as good as common social functions. No ceremony or festival in Ananda Marga is performed in the presence of one a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya [[only]]. [[At]] least five Ananda Margis also have to be present.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><b>4) No capital punishment</b>. Capital punishment degenerates the moral standard of the society. It also checks the progress of those who are punished. In addition, people who are penalized with severe social punishment form bands or groups with the help of antisocial elements, and aggravate the problem of indiscipline and crime in society. In our Ananda Marga, capital punishment or social punishment is not supported. As a punitive measure, wrongdoers are not permitted to attend social functions for a certain period of time. After the period is over, they are again allowed to attend social functions as before. This system of punishment does not affect the other members of their family. Nor does it affect the moral standard of those being punished, which excommunication or penal servitude does.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Another punishment is that one must bring ten people to the path of spirituality. Only then will one be permitted to attend social functions. This system of punishment is corrective in nature. Wrongdoers have the opportunity to rectify themselves instead of having their progress checked. This system of punishment does not cast any aspersions on the concerned people or their families, and hence it does not foment further indiscipline or crime. On the contrary, those undergoing punishment utilize their time in a better way than other people when they try to inspire ten persons to embrace spirituality. They do good to both themselves and society by teaching a noble ideology. [[Nobody]] should be punished in hot haste. In the first stage, people should be given a chance to rectify themselves. It has been stated in &ldquo;Carya&#x301;carya Part 2&rdquo;:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->1) Criminals should first be persuaded to mend their ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->2) In the second stage, they should be bluntly commanded to mend their ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->3) In the third stage, they should be informed of the probable punitive measures that will be taken against him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->4) In the fourth stage, disciplinary measures must be taken against the offenders. Naturally [[would-be]] criminals will live in constant fear of punishment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Social Security<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The absence of social security may create disunity in the society. A society cannot last long if it does not guarantee the safety or security of its members against [[wrongs]] and injustice. In the absence of discipline, social security may be endangered. So for social security, both justice and discipline are essential.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><b>1) Justice</b>. To ensure social security, people should not be subjected to any form of injustice because of their economic status, sex or caste. Economic injustice springs mainly from lack of respect for the dignity of labour. That is, it takes place due to occupational differences. In Ananda Marga, the life of a scavenger is considered more respectable than of that of a social parasite. Injustices are bound to be eradicated from society when great importance is given to people&#146;s independent means of livelihood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Economic injustice may also arise from people&#146;s excessive desire to accumulate wealth. Selfish human beings want to appropriate all resources for themselves. But if they would realize that all members of  society have an equal right to utilize these resources, the economic problems confronting society will be greatly reduced. In Ananda Marga, the entire property of the universe is considered to be the property of all. In a society imbued with such a common ideal, there is little scope for economic injustice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Discrimination between men and women also encourages injustice. In human society, there is a marked tendency to consider women inferior to men. In many parts of the world, women are looked upon as mere objects of enjoyment. In some countries, they are even considered unfit for learning spiritual practice. Our Ananda Marga gives equal rights [[and responsibilities]] to men and women. [[In the Ananda Marga marriage system, the man and the woman both take on equal responsibilities. In Ananda Marga the female race is not considered unfit to learn spiritual practices.]] Both men and women are given [[respect]] in our social system, thus there is no scope for men to be considered superior to women.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Similarly, if the people of a particular caste are considered superior to other castes, economic injustice will be encouraged. In India, the so-called upper-caste Hindus perpetrate injustice on the Harijan community (the so-called untouchables). This has created a serious rift in the society. To eradicate this sort of social injustice, caste divisions should be completely abolished. In Ananda Marga, in the very first phase of initiation, a new member is taught to forget both their caste and colour. In the functions and festivals of a society based on caste divisions, the influence of caste prejudice is tremendous. In the collective functions and festivals of Ananda Marga, everyone, irrespective of caste, community or colour, can freely participate. In the society in general, the difference between castes and communities is given too much importance. Ananda Marga rejects these narrow sentiments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph --><b>2) Discipline</b>. Throughout history it can be observed that in the absence of discipline, many societies have been obliterated from the surface of the earth. Undisciplined behaviour by a handful of people severely disrupts the lives of others. For the sake of social security, discipline is essential. Normally, social indiscipline arises when a few people think that the existing social laws and regulations are defective and inadequate. If such thinking remains confined to debate and discussion, it will not cause any major social problems. However, to ensure discipline in society, the laws and regulations should be rational and capable of amendments. In Ananda Marga, there is no place for irrationality. In a society where rationality is given so much importance that amendments are permitted, discontent and indiscipline can hardly be contemplated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga, rationality follows obedience as the means to maintain social harmony. People should first be obedient to the social codes, and then if they find a few defects, they should have the right to initiate debates and discussions, and suggest amendments to the defective laws. But if people starts arguing without showing obedience, social indiscipline will be the result. The social code of conduct of Ananda Marga gives more importance to rationality than blind obedience. Thus, there is little scope for jeopardizing the system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Peace<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->A state of mental equilibrium and equipoise is called peace. It is important to know how the state of peace is attained, and how it is disturbed. A systematic, spiritual practice leads to psychic balance, whereas dogmatic faith in superstitions disturbs mental peace. Spiritual discipline and relentless struggle against superstition are required to maintain psychic peace. The principal aim of human life is to be free of sorrow and misery. Otherwise, one cannot hope to attain peace. The cessation of sorrow is of two types &ndash; temporary and permanent. That which brings about temporary cessation of sorrow is called artha (psycho-physical). But artha is a crude object, thus it can only bring crude and temporary satisfaction. To attain permanent relief from sorrow and affliction, Parama&#x301;rtha is the only means. Parama&#x301;rtha can only be attained through spiritual practice. That is why in Ananda Marga, each member is encouraged to practice from the age of five. As one grows, one acquires tremendous physical, psychic and spiritual benefits. The Ananda Marga method of spiritual practice does not encourage a person to give up all worldly duties, rather it teaches one how to make the best utilization of physical, subtle and causal potentialities to attain permanent mental balance and peace, and to enhance physical, mental and spiritual progress. Ananda Marga teaches a methodical and scientific system of spiritual practices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Our social code provides clear guidelines on how members will adapt to this modern, rapidly changing world. There have been more changes in the past 200 years than in the 800 years prior to that. In education, culture, dress and food habits major changes have taken place. Old, outdated wooden shoes, turbans, etc. have been replaced by modern shoes, hats and clothes made from scientific fabrics with contemporary designs. Primitive bullock carts, horse-drawn carriages, hackney coaches, etc., have been replaced with fast-moving cars, trains, and aeroplanes. In the past, people used to travel by elephant, but now they can travel to other planets by rocket. There should be a proper adjustment between the body and the mind to keep pace with the fast speed of the development in the world. For this reason, Ananda Marga spiritual practices place much importance on a&#x301;sanas, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->In a word, Ananda Marga&#146;s social code fulfils all the conditions of an ideal social code &ndash; it is universal, rational and psychological. It is eminently suited to the development of a dynamic social structure in this rapidly-changing world. As it has been formulated in conformity with the physical, psychic and social needs of human beings, people from all walks of life fully support it and are enthusiastically engaged in its implementation.<!-- /block --></p>
