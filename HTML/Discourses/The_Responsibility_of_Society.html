<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The essence of the parallel psychic waves of society is influenced by the resultant median of the following factors: 1) common language; 2) similar manners and customs; 3) similar mode of living; 4) similar traditions; 5) racial similarity; 6) regional similarity; 7) common culture; and 8) common objective or goal. Unfortunately, these factors are generally neglected while structuring society because they are the means through which the collective psychology flows and not the causes of the collective psychology. In fact this very common sentiment &ndash; or the common psychic waves &ndash; forms the essential vital force of a social structure. This is the reason why we say that society is actually the expression of parallel psychic waves, and originates because of the mental tendency of moving together in unison.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is clear that behind society there is the support of the immense collective power of many individuals. This is why the popular conception of society is that of a collection of individuals. But a mere aggregate of numerous individuals whose psychic waves move in different directions &ndash; that is, the psychic waves are not parallel but fragmented and disrupted by dissension &ndash; cannot be called a society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In a family, where each individual gives importance to the comforts and well-being of the other members, however physically or intellectually underdeveloped they may be, we see a society in miniature form. There are many families in the world where each member is concerned for the welfare of the others, despite differences in their physical or intellectual capacity. This is an ideal family. This should also be the ideal form of society, although this is extremely rare today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is the responsibility of society to preserve and utilize the common property of the society in a proper way. Society should utilize this properly to ensure that all may enjoy equal usufructuary rights so that all can live together with a healthy body and a healthy mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Today the world is following either capitalism or extreme materialism &ndash; that is, communism. According to these systems, those who are endowed with greater knowledge, intellect or physical power are continuously misappropriating increasing material wealth. People have forgotten that subtle wealth along with physical wealth is received from the Supreme Operative Faculty. A member of a family who does not feel a sense of unity with the other family members, and does not recognize the logically acceptable truth and lofty principle of joint rights, cannot be regarded as a social being. According to universal spiritual ideology, the system of individual ownership cannot be regarded as absolute. This is why Ananda Marga&#146;s concept of society does not support capitalism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In a joint family every member satisfies his or her longings and needs for food, clothing, medical care and other comforts according to the financial capacity of the family. If a certain member of the family accumulates more food, clothes, books or medicine than what he or she needs, will not the other members of the family face difficulty? In such circumstances, his or her actions will be ultravires to righteousness and society. It is the responsibility of society to demolish such a defective social system immediately.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the present world, capitalists accumulate increasing wealth and possessions for themselves, leaving others to suffer acute pangs of hunger. They force people to wear tattered rags so that they can parade in ostentatious clothing. To increase their own strength, they even suck the vital juice of others. It is the responsibility of society to make these people understand their mistakes by every possible means so that they stop their antisocial activities, because the very aspiration to become rich by exploiting others is a kind of psychic ailment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Capitalists argue, &ldquo;We amass wealth by dint of our intellect and labour. Let others also procure wealth in the same way if they have the intellect or labour. What stops them?&rdquo; These people do not want to realize that the amount of consumable commodities in the world is limited, but the basic necessities are common to all. If one person rolls in affluence, in most cases others will be deprived of even their minimum requirements. The failure to recognize the needs of others is itself a disease. But those who are the victims of this ailment are also our brothers and sisters &ndash; members of one and the same human family. Either by human appeals or circumstantial pressure, these people must be cured of this psychic ailment. In order to achieve this, people&#146;s obsession with material wealth will have to be channelized to mental and spiritual wealth. While satisfying their hunger and thirst everyone should be freely taught scientific processes to fulfil their psychic longings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There should be a social order in which every person will work according to his or her capacity. Those with greater physical capacity will provide physical labour, and those with greater psychic capacity will provide psychic labour. It is the responsibility of society to look after those who cannot render either physical or psychic labour because of their inability.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Society will not grant social rights to only those who have the physical capacity to work. All will have equal rights &ndash; and the rights of one individual will not violate the rights of others. Everybody should be guaranteed the absolute right to make psychic and spiritual progress according to their maximum capacity. There will be no obstructions of any kind. But so that peace and joy can be preserved in society, the individual right to go against the collective interest in the physical sphere will be snatched away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->While structuring society, the spiritual goal deserves the highest priority. Everybody will have to realize this. Even with psychic expansion, human beings become self-centred in the absence of a spiritual goal, and group sentiments grow in people&#146;s minds. Such people cultivate mundane knowledge but not spirituality. Spirituality means that people start contemplating such queries as, &ldquo;Who am I? What is my goal? How can I reach my goal? etc.&rdquo; Today&#146;s intellectuals have become impediments to the cause of spreading spirituality because they are deficient in morality and their psychic waves go against the collective interest. Consequently, immorality, corruption and dishonesty are rampant in society. A strong and healthy society will stop this trend.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The study of history makes it clear that a strong and healthy society has not yet evolved on this planet. This was mainly due to the inadequate propagation of a comprehensive spiritual ideology. Although a few people thought to establish a strong and healthy society, they adopted argument and debate instead of deliberation and reason to convince the people of the need for such a society, and ultimately ended up projecting themselves instead of the ideology. Thus, the ideology became secondary and was ultimately swept away because people started worshipping them as Mahatmas and Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;as. This was why, in the absence of an ideology, a strong society could not be established, and many defects crept into individual and collective life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was the first to attempt to build a strong and healthy society, but due to the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata war, much of His time was lost. As He did not find enough time to build a society, a human society could not come into existence. Similarly, Lord Sada&#x301;shiva, the original provider of Tantra, had to devote much of His time to building a strong foundation for spirituality, and despite His immense desire, He could not build a strong social order. Today, the combined power of both will help in building a healthy human society.<!-- /block --></p>
