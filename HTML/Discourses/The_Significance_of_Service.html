<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The aim of human life is to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; no other goal can be accepted. But human beings live in a relative world. They have to remain within the spatial, temporal, and personal boundaries. Hence one has to pass ones life maintaining proper adjustment with time, space and person. The goal of human beings is Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; He is the Supreme Entity &ndash; the absolute entity. When human beings move towards the absolute world from the relative world they have to maintain proper adjustment with everything. This very adjustment, this very balance brings about benediction to the society. And the individual entity is also benefited. If someone does not maintain adjustment, the society is not benefited, nor is anyone individually. Due to the absence of balance, one&#146;s individual spiritual practice is also disturbed. As a result, one&#146;s individual progress is hampered. Not only this, retardation starts taking place. One&#146;s aim should be a proper, well-balanced continuous journey. One has to move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. Human beings are travellers on the path of eternity, marching ahead without stopping anywhere is their characteristics. They have not to stop under any circumstance. The greatest shelter of human beings is Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence they have to move ahead fearlessly. They must be fearless because the most powerful entity of the world is with them. There is no cause for fear, there is no cause for timidity. Whom should one fear if the Supreme power is with one? Why should one fear? But one has to move ahead in a balanced way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->While rendering service to the entire society, you will have to move ahead because on the one hand you will be blessed by society, and on the other you will take inspiration from it enabling you to march ahead with much more speed. You must always bear in mind that this created world is created by Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus it is very very dear to Him. When you render service to created beings it is as good as serving Him. Human beings are entities who have rationality and intellect. The extent to which human beings can render service to the world is more than that of any other creature. Hence you will always bear in mind that you are the oldest sons and daughters of Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; His dear sons and dear daughters. Hence your duty is to utilize totally and properly this physical body and mind. By thinking always of Him and talking of Him psychic elevation takes place. Go on moving towards Him. In Him alone lies Your individual good and social good. You have come with human body, human intellect. Your human life will become fruitful. By His grace you have a human body and human mind and you should also bear in mind that by His grace alone you have to move ahead in life. By His grace alone He is to be attained. You will attain Him &ndash; certainly you will attain Him.<!-- /block --></p>
