<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Ghosts and Evil Spirits&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now let us see what happens when a person dies. When a person dies, their physical body, along with the nerve cells and nerve fibres, remains in the earth and finally becomes one with the earth. When death takes place, the mind, along with the reactive momenta and the non-cerebral memory, leaves the body and moves here in the universe, with the help of rajogun&#x301;a [the mutative principle], till it gets another body, a suitable body to quench its thirst and satisfy its reactive momenta. Those reactive momenta, in the second body, are known as sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The mind, along with the reactive momenta and non-cerebral memory, is not visible. One cannot see it. And when it is not visible, it is not possible for anybody to say, &ldquo;I have seen that mind, that videhii a&#x301;tma&#x301; [disembodied spirit].&rdquo; But we should remember that the dissociated mind is not alone. In that mind there are the reactive momenta and also the non-cerebral memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->(That mind moving in the universe with the mutative power of the Cosmic Operative Principle is not visible, and at the same time, for want of a nucleus, a seat for the mind, and nerve cells, the mind cannot function properly. For proper functioning it requires ectoplasmic stuff, a body of ectoplasm. So even for ectoplasmic expression it requires a new body. In proper time, due to the mixture of ova and spermatozoa, what happens? The mind becomes associated with a new structure, and the original minds and lives of both the ova and the spermatozoa cease to exist. But those ova and spermatozoa are selected to suit the purpose of this detached mind with its reactive momenta.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now during this period, this transitional period, when the mind has left the previous body, before it gets the new body, what happens? It moves in the universe, invisible and inaudible. But you know, by dint of Tantric practice, anybody can develop their ectoplasmic structure. They may be a Vidya&#x301; Tantric, they may be an Avidya&#x301; Tantric, but the ectoplasmic development is there. So such Tantrics can, with the help of their own ectoplasmic stuff, help the detached mind to get a temporary ectoplasmic body. And for the time being that detached mind, with the help of the ectoplasmic stuff of that Tantric &ndash; Vidya&#x301; Tantric or Avidya&#x301; Tantric &ndash; gets that ectoplasmic structure, and when that ectoplasmic structure is a bit solidified it becomes visible, and due to its vibrational frequency it may become audible too, but only for a short span of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You have heard stories about bones being thrown into a particular house, bricks being thrown into a particular house, a cot moving upwards, etc. You have heard these ghost stories about certain haunted houses. What are these things? A Tantric, certainly not a Vidya&#x301; Tantric, but an Avidya&#x301; Tantric, with the help of a certain portion of their own ectoplasmic stuff, sits tight in an a&#x301;sana [meditation posture], and, with the help of their ectoplasmic stuff, creates an ectoplasmic body for a detached mind (known as preta in Sanskrit). And with the help of their ectoplasmic stuff, attached to the detached mind, they do all these things. But at the time their body remains motionless. So these things are actually not done by ghosts. They are actually done by that Avidya&#x301; Tantric with the help of that detached mind. One may say that these things have been done by ghosts, but they were not actually.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And there is another type of being also. I say &ldquo;being&rdquo; because it is difficult for me to say that they are living beings or that they are dead beings. What happens? There are seven recognized devayonis, divine entities. They are called &ldquo;divine&rdquo;, though actually they are not divine, because they are better, or higher, than ordinary human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Suppose a person is practising spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; regularly, properly, and with proper inspiration and sincerity, but some other desires, some other longings, remain coverted in the person&#146;s mind. The person is a good person, he or she is sincerely doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but in his mind he thinks, &ldquo;If Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; gives me ten lakhs &ndash; or five lakhs &ndash; or only two lakhs &ndash; everything will be managed properly. Oh, no! I won&#146;t ask for these things. No, no, no, it is bad, it is bad.&rdquo; That desire, that longing for money, remains in him, although he or she is a developed soul, not a bad person, not at all a bad person. So what happens? Because of his piety, after death he gives up the physical structure, the solid body, and gives up the aquatic structure, that is, apatattva, also; but the other three factors &ndash; tejas [luminous factor], marut [aerial factor], vyoma [ethereal factor] &ndash; remain with him, with his detached mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->These beings are called devayonis. They are of seven types &ndash; yaks&#x301;a, raks&#x301;a, kinnara, gandharva, vidya&#x301;dhara, siddha and Prakrtiliina. In the example I gave, the person had a longing for money, but was a developed soul. Unknowingly or unconsciously the desire came into his or her mind, and that desire was the cause of his or her downfall, degradation, depravation. This type of being is called yaks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In Bihar, particularly in the northern portion of Bihar, in most but not all of the villages, you will find a place just outside the village, known as the Brahmastha&#x301;na. That Brahmastha&#x301;na is the place where the villagers used to assemble to worship the yaks&#x301;a. In the images of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika [Puranic] gods and goddesses you will find the yaks&#x301;a and yaks&#x301;inii standing just to the right and left of the deity; a yaks&#x301;a and yaks&#x301;inii with ca&#x301;maras [ceremonial whisks] in their hands. What is a yaks&#x301;a? It has a body, but not a quinquelemental body; a body with three factors, tejas, marut and vyoma. That luminous body cannot be touched, but it can be seen sometimes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Raks&#x301;a. People with fighting spirit, with proper dedication and proper spiritual aspiration, but who sometimes think, &ldquo;If I get the blessing I will kill those antisocial elements &ndash; No, no, no, during pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [worship, meditation] I should not think like this.&rdquo; You have understood, I think? Those thoughts coming in the mind during pu&#x301;ja&#x301; become the cause of degradation. After death the person won&#146;t have a physical body or aquatic body, but tejas, marut and vyoma will be there. This type is called raks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Kinnara. &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; has given me everything, but I am not good-looking. I want to be very good-looking, so that people will say &ndash; No, no, no, it is very bad.&rdquo; Such good persons, good souls (and they are good people, not ordinary people) after death also acquire this type of three-elemented body. They are called kinnara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301;dhara. &ldquo;I am a good sa&#x301;dhaka, but haven&#146;t any vocal power. I can&#146;t dance properly, I can&#146;t sing properly, my vocal cord doesn&#146;t function well. I require more attributions, more qualifications &ndash; and if I get more qualifications I will get promotion in the service also. Oh, no, no, no. These are all bad things. These are all bad desires. A person should not have any desires.&rdquo; When such a person dies, they also get that type of body, luminous, gaseous and ethereal. These three bhu&#x301;tas are there. These people are called vidya&#x301;dhara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Next &ndash; a person is doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, there is no longing. Then, &ldquo;I sing bhajanas, but my sound is not good. My vocal cords don&#146;t function properly. My vocal expression should be a bit more sweet and rhythmic &ndash; No, no, no, these are all bad things, bad things.&rdquo; This type of good person, in the body they take in their next life (not &ldquo;next life&rdquo;, but &ldquo;post-physical life&rdquo;), is known as gandharva. They have a longing for music. And that is why music is called gandharva vidya&#x301; in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The sixth is the siddha. What is a siddha? Suppose there is a good soul, a good person who has no physical desire. But during sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;Yes, love for God has been created. Yes, people love me, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; loves me. But I should have some occult power, so that people will say, &lsquo;This person has power, and is not an ordinary person. This person has occult power &ndash; alaokika shakti &ndash; aeshvarya &ndash; vibhu&#x301;ti&rsquo; &ndash; No, no, no, these are bad thoughts, bad thoughts.&rdquo; When this type of person dies, their post-physical body is known as siddha. They are the best among the devayonis. I will say something regarding these siddhas later on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->And the seventh is Prakrtiliina &ndash; those who worship idols, ascribing Brahma-hood to that idol, thinking that the very idol is God, the very image is God; worshipping stone, worshipping wood, worshipping metal. Tantra says, Mrcchila&#x301;dha&#x301;tuda&#x301;rva&#x301;dimu&#x301;rtta&#x301;viishvaro buddhayo&#8230; [&ldquo;Those who think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is confined within idols made of clay, stone, metal or wood&#8230;&rdquo;] Mrt means &ldquo;earthen image&rdquo;; shila&#x301; means &ldquo;made of stone&rdquo;; dha&#x301;tu means &ldquo;made of metal&rdquo;; and da&#x301;ru means &ldquo;made of wood&rdquo;. And they ascribe Godhood to that wood or to that metal or to that stone. Then what happens? The person is ideating on that stone, or wood, or metal, and what happens? Yadrshii bha&#x301;vana&#x301; yasya siddhir bhavati ta&#x301;drshii &ndash; &ldquo;A person adopts a body according to their object of ideation.&rdquo; Their own self is transformed into that entity, the entity which was their object of meditation. Now such people worshipping different forms of Prakrti finally take the form of those entities, and become stone, become wood, become metal. They are called Prakrtiliina. They become one with Prakrti and remain there for an indefinite period. What a durdaeva, I will say! What a painful state of existence!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now, among these seven types of devayoni, the siddha is the best. Siddhas perform their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; remaining just at the half-way point. And whenever there is an assemblage of singers or dancers, what happens? Gandharvas, with their mental bodies, their reactive momenta and non-cerebral memories, assemble. Wherever there is any programme of music, there they assemble, but invisible. Sometimes, though, they become visible. I will explain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Wherever there is any spiritual gathering, siddhas come. And during a musical function, whenever the mind of a particular artist becomes concentrated, they will see the luminous bodies of gandharvas. Similarly, during meditation, or particularly during kiirtana, when a spiritual aspirant&#146;s mind becomes concentrated, they will feel the existence of those siddhas. In Jamalpur, in the area of the tiger&#146;s grave, there were assemblages of large numbers of siddhas. One of our senior grhii a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas [married spiritual teachers] used to see them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->I will narrate a very short story. A few years back, two of our ka&#x301;pa&#x301;lika sa&#x301;dhakas<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> came to a river. That river is not a big one, but the depth is there. They were at a loss to decide how to cross the river. Just on the other side of the river there was a burial ground, a cremation ground. They were thinking hard, at midnight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->All of a sudden, they saw a luminous body just in front of them. The luminous body began moving, and these two boys followed it. Coming to a particular point, that luminous body started crossing the river, and these two boys followed him. And that particular portion of the river was very shallow, knee-deep. They easily crossed the river and reached the other side. Just on the other bank there was a tree. From there they went two different ways to do their night practice. And after night practice they came back to the tree. They again saw that luminous body and again followed it and crossed the river.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->After coming to the original bank, the junior boy addressed the senior man, &ldquo;Oh Da&#x301;da&#x301;, let us request that luminous body to bless us.&rdquo; As soon as he said this, the luminous body disappeared. What was that luminous body? A siddha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Now what happens when a person sees some unnatural picture or unnatural image or unnatural being? One possibility I have already explained &ndash; it may be that a Tantric, with the help of his or her ectoplasmic structure, has created a body for a disembodied mind just to terrorize others. A Vidya&#x301; Tantric will not do these things, but an Avidya&#x301; Tantric may do so just to terrorize others, as they used to do in the past. After getting some money they would stop the practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->And suppose that some time you go to a particular house which people say is haunted. There are some haunted houses in every town, and I have already told you that if you find any haunted house, you just purchase it and use it. Ghosts won&#146;t terrorize Ananda Margis, because every Ananda Margi is a ghost. [laughter] &ldquo;They are the followers of Shiva.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Ghosts will not terrorize ghosts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->What happens there? Due to terror, due to pre-imposed terror, a person&#146;s mind gets concentrated. Due to fear the mind gets concentrated, and due to concentration, what happens? A certain portion of the person&#146;s own ectoplasmic stuff goes to help a detached mind in creating a body, an ectoplasmic body. So you see your own creation; the creation has been made out of your own ectoplasmic stuff. But that detached mind was also there. It was not a ghost. And those Brahmapisha&#x301;ca, or several kinds of &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo;, are all of your creation. Your ectoplasmic stuff is transferred to that detached mind due to your mental concentration, temporary concentration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->And this type of concentration takes place under five types of circumstance &ndash; ks&#x301;ipta, mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha, viks&#x301;ipta, eka&#x301;gra and nirodha. Ks&#x301;ipta is when the mind is very perturbed, full of worries and anxieties. At that time, due to sudden, short concentration, such a thing may happen. Mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha is when your brain fails to decide what to do or what not to do &ndash; you are at a loss for what to do. This is called mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha &ndash; mu&#x301;h plus kta. Viks&#x301;ipta &ndash; you are not concentrating on a particular point, but finally your mind becomes tired and, in that state, you see those things. You know by lullabies we make the minds of children viks&#x301;ipta and they fall asleep. (Lullabies, you know? &ndash; poems recited in the ears to put children into deep slumber, not ordinary sleep.) Eka&#x301;gra is when your mind gets pointed. And the fifth is nirodha, when you suspend all the expressions of your propensities. In these five conditions you may see those things and you may, knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously, transfer certain portions of your ectoplasmic body to a detached mind and create a positive hallucination of this kind.<!-- /block --></p>
