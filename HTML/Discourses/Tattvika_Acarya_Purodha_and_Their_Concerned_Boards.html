Depending on the results of the examination, the Central Ta&#x301;ttvika Board, Central A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Board, or Central Purodha&#x301; Board will issue certificates to the persons concerned. Each certificate will bear the registration number, and also the signatures of the examiners.<!-- /block --></p>

Therefore, if for any reason except old age or deformity any ta&#x301;ttvika, a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;, or purodha&#x301; is unable to discharge his/her respective duties, the power to cancel the certificate will be with the Central Ta&#x301;ttvika Board, Central A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Board, or Central Purodha&#x301; Board, respectively. An appeal for reconsideration against the decision of the Central Ta&#x301;ttvika Board can be made to the Central A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Board, and in that case the verdict of the latter will be final. Accordingly, an appeal for reconsideration against the decision of the Central A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Board can be made to the Central Purodha&#x301; Board, and in that case the verdict of the latter will be final and binding. Ta&#x301;ttvika, a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya, purodha&#x301; and such terms represent one&#146;s individual ability and are not hereditary.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the event of any complicated problem or serious controversy in Ananda Marga, the decision of the Central Purodha&#x301; Board will be considered supreme. The decision which the members of the Central Purodha&#x301; Board arrive at unanimously will be binding on the society. If there is no unanimity among the members of the Board, the decision of the majority will be the Board&#146;s decision. If two groups are equal in votes, the single vote of the chairperson will be considered as the vote of the Board. Each and every Ananda Margi must obey the decision of the Purodha&#x301; Board without any argument. The chairperson of the Purodha&#x301; Board will be designated as the purodha&#x301; pramukha. The decision of the purodha&#x301; pramukha will be considered correct and final. No one can alter the decision of the purodha&#x301; pramukha. But if he considers it necessary, the purodha&#x301; pramukha can change his previous decision. The purodha&#x301; pramukha will hold his post for life, but he can resign from the post for reasons of ill-health.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The purodha&#x301; pramukha will be elected by the votes of the purodha&#x301;s. The purodha&#x301;s will also elect the other three members of the Purodha&#x301; Board, and their tenure will be five years. If, before the completion of five years, anyone dies or is compelled to resign due to illness, the post will be filled by re-election. If the majority of the purodha&#x301;s in a vote express dissatisfaction with the work of any member of the Purodha&#x301; Board, a re-election can be held for this post, depending on the consent of the purodha&#x301; pramukha.<!-- /block --></p>
