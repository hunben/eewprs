<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know that humans are gregarious beings. There are some living beings who live in groups or clans, and some who live in isolation. In very olden days, human beings lived in clans, and the leader of such a clan would invariably be a lady then known as the gotrama&#x301;trka&#x301; [clan-mother]. But subsequently this system was replaced by another system in which the leader of the clan would be a man, known as gotrapita&#x301; [clan-father]. When the leadership of a clan was vested in the clan-mother, there was both a matrilineal order and a matriarchal system of inheritance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->An example of the matrilineal order: Suppose a person asked your name. You would reply, &ldquo;My name is such-and-such, my mother&#146;s name is such-and-such, and my grandmother&#146;s name is such-and-such.&rdquo; No one bothered to know who the father was, and in fact, there was no system of marriage prior to Shiva. Shiva was the first person to marry, and the oldest system of marriage is known as the Shiva system of marriage. This introduction of the system of marriage raised human beings one step higher than the animals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->But everyone knew who the mother was, so the order was a matrilineal order. Often the sons were named after their mothers. For instance, if the mother&#146;s name was Maodgalii, the son would be named Maodgalya&#x301;yan; if her name was Ru&#x301;pasa&#x301;ri, the son would be named Sa&#x301;riputta. If the mother&#146;s name was Maha&#x301;pa&#x301;t&#x301;alii, obviously the son&#146;s name would be Pat&#x301;aliiputra &ndash; the one who built the city of Patna. Thus the sons would be known to the society through their mothers. If the mother&#146;s name was Prtha&#x301; or Prthu, the son&#146;s name would be Pa&#x301;rtha. One of the names of Arjuna was Pa&#x301;rtha. Arjuna&#146;s mother&#146;s name was Kuntii, so Arjuna was also known as Kaonteya. In those days of matrilineal order, the mother&#146;s name was very important.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And the system of inheritance was matriarchal, that is, the daughters would inherit the property. From the mother, the daughter would receive the property; from her, her daughter; and so on. This sort of matriarchal system of inheritance is still found in Meghalaya, among the Nayars of Kerala and also partly, not fully, among the people of Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Later the matrilineal order was replaced by the patrilineal order. If you asked people about their gotra, they would at once mention the name of the first gotrapita&#x301;. Gradually the system of inheritance changed to a patriarchal one. The son would inherit his father&#146;s property; from him, his son would inherit the property; and so on. The daughters were almost completely deprived of ancestral property.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In some places there is a mixed system, as in Bengal, where both the sons and daughters inherit paternal property. In Bengal a sister&#146;s sons are entitled to inherit their maternal uncle&#146;s property after his death. This is in contrast to the system practised in other parts of India, where the property is not transferred to a different gotra because the system is a totally patriarchal one. Anyway, in those days of matrilineal order, women enjoyed unlimited freedom and influence in society, while men had practically no rights at all. I say that this was not an ideal system. In the patriarchal social system, men enjoy unlimited freedom, which is not an ideal arrangement either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Saba&#x301;i ma&#x301;nus&#x301;a, saba&#x301;ika&#x301;r<br>Niktir ojane sama&#x301;n adhika&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[All are human beings, All are entitled to equal rights.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The way women are being deprived of their rights today is something criminal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In those days of matrilineal order, people introduced the system of mother worship, and from that emerged the custom of can&#x301;d&#x301;ii pu&#x301;ja&#x301;, the worship of can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301; shakti, the power of the group-mother. In those days the leader of a clan would invariably be a woman, a clan-mother.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Ya&#x301; devii sarvabhu&#x301;tes&#x301;u Matrru&#x301;pen&#x301;a sam&#x301;sthita&#x301;<br>Namastasyae namastasyae namastasyae namo namah.<br>Ya&#x301; devii sarvabhu&#x301;tes&#x301;u Shaktiru&#x301;pen&#x301;a sam&#x301;sthita&#x301;<br>Namastasyae namastasyae namastasyae namo namah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[I offer my deepest salutations to that goddess who is in all created beings in the form of the Universal Mother. I offer my deepest salutations to the goddess who is immanent in all created beings in the form of the Supreme Force.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Thus the people, being inspired by this idea, developed the system of mother worship in early stages of the Puranic Shakti Cult, in the last phase of Post-Shiva Tantra. Alongside this developed the custom of kuma&#x301;rii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [virgin worship], just to please the future clan-mothers. So the custom of can&#x301;d&#x301;ii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; gave rise to the custom of virgin worship. One who is a maiden today will be a clan-mother in due course; so it was wise to please these clan-mothers-to-be by offering them something.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Thus we see that can&#x301;d&#x301;ii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; or kuma&#x301;rii pu&#x301;ja&#x301; was essentially a social affair, but in Post-Shiva Tantra and in the first phase of the Puranic Shakti Cult, a religious tinge was added to it. This is how the worship of virgins originated. Now this system has almost disappeared.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The situation changed a great deal in subsequent periods. The matrilineal order was stopped, and the supremacy of gotrama&#x301;ta&#x301; came to an end. Then came the age of the patriarchal system, and along with it the leadership of the clan vested in the gotrapita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The same tradition perpetuated itself even in the patriarchal system; that is, the head of the clan had to be kept in good humour with gifts and offerings. He enjoyed unlimited power, as the clan-mother did in the heyday of the matrilineal order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301; shakti is the can&#x301;d&#x301;a shakti, the great power exercised by the clan-mother. This can&#x301;d&#x301;ii shakti or can&#x301;d&#x301;a shakti reached its climax during the days of Post-Shiva Tantra and the Puranic Shakti Cult. We shall say more about the Puranic Shakti Cult later. So you understand how the concept of can&#x301;d&#x301;ii originated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Now, unless related to Shiva, no one will be given any recognition or status; so there was no other way than to declare Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii to be the wife of Shiva, although the idea of can&#x301;d&#x301;ii represents the social history of collective living of prehistoric human beings. The prehistoric age has also its own history &ndash; of course, unwritten history. Many things happen which remain unrecorded; often people suffer from agonies which remain unexpressed. The sufferers have to endure silently, suppressing their inner pains. Similarly, the prehistoric age carries its unrecorded history silently.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In the case of Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii, an attempt was made to find some relationship between Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii and Shiva, and it was given a religious and social colour. During the days of the supremacy of the clan-mothers, they were approached with folded hands and flattered in all respects, and people requested everything from them &ndash; food, clothes, etc. The subservient people would pray to them, Ru&#x301;pam&#x301; dehi, jayam&#x301; dehi, yasho dehi, dvis&#x301;o jahi &ndash; &ldquo;Give me beauty, give me victory, give me fame and kill my enemies.&rdquo; Without the express approval of the clan-mother, the other members of the clan would not fight for victory. Hence the prayer, &ldquo;Kill my enemies.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The days of can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301; shakti in this world passed, and the males became the heads of clans: the patriarchal system came into being. Now both the patrilineal order of society and the patriarchal system are found everywhere in the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The members of a tribe used to live in a group, and each group had its leader. All the members of the society used to obey his orders. He was always given the highest honour and the first preference, and was honoured first in all social functions. In Sanskrit the word for group is gan&#x301;a, so gan&#x301;esha or gan&#x301;apati means the group leader, the head of the clan. The Bengali or Sanskrit equivalent for gan&#x301;apati is dalapati. From dalapati, it becomes da-la-a-i or dalai; in Bengali dalui. There is a surname Dalui in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The idea of Gan&#x301;esha is a prehistoric one: it proves the supremacy of the group leader, or the head of the clan, of prehistoric days. With the decline of the matrilineal order, and with the increasing growth of the patrilineal order, the group leader became more and more powerful. Thus Gan&#x301;esha precedes all other entities in order of preference. Some people humorously say that since the worship of Gan&#x301;esha precedes the worship of all other gods, Gan&#x301;esha must have been worshipped just before Shiva&#146;s marriage was solemnized.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> This may be true, perhaps he was worshipped. But such worship may indeed not have been performed, because though Shiva was not an Aryan, the marriage was held at the residence of the father of Gaorii, who was an Aryan girl.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->This Gan&#x301;esha was the son neither of Shiva nor of Pa&#x301;rvatii nor of Durga&#x301;, because he was a group deity, a social deity of prehistoric times. His worship has nothing to do with dharma: the worship of a group leader is in no way related to dharma. That is why the Sanskrit equivalents for gan&#x301;esha are gan&#x301;apati and vina&#x301;yaka. Vina&#x301;yaka means an ideal leader, a very powerful leader.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->So when we reflect on the prehistoric stage of human society, we find that Gan&#x301;esha has no relation to Shiva or His wife Pa&#x301;rvatii, far less to Durga&#x301;, a Puranic goddess who came later than Shiva by many thousand years. Now people may ask two things about Gan&#x301;esha: Why is he so fat? And why does his face resemble that of an elephant?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->There must be some reasons for this. In my childhood days, when I was reluctant to eat rice, my aunt would psychologically try to make me eat it. She would say, &ldquo;Why don&#146;t you like to eat rice? Look, Brother Gan&#x301;esha is so fat because he eats a lot of rice!&rdquo; Then she would recite,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Gan&#x301;esha Da&#x301;da&#x301; pet&#x301;t&#x301;i na&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;<br>Bha&#x301;t kha&#x301;y ga&#x301;da&#x301; ga&#x301;da&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->[Brother Gan&#x301;esha has a belly like a pot;<br>The reason is, he eats a lot.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->On hearing this, I would burst into laughter, and taking advantage of this opportunity, she would push morsels of rice into my mouth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Why is he so fat? All people want their leader to be a stout, strong personality. With this end in view, when they started making images of Gan&#x301;esha, they created a powerfully-built figure. This is the secret behind Gan&#x301;esha&#146;s heavy build. The members of a particular clan would naturally desire their group leader to be a strong and stout person: &ldquo;Our leader &ndash; is he an ordinary person? No, he is not just like any Tom, Dick or Harry. The face of our leader is like that of the biggest animal in the world!&rdquo; So an elephant&#146;s head was placed on the body of Gan&#x301;esha. Thus the primitive humans have struggled up to the present day; and that is why they portrayed Gan&#x301;esha as a fat god with the face of an elephant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->But then he was elevated to the status of a god of religion in the days of the Puranic Gan&#x301;apati Cult. What is this Gan&#x301;apati Cult? There is a story in the Puranas that the mother of Gan&#x301;esha was Durga&#x301;. Now when Gan&#x301;esha was born, his maternal uncle, Shani, came to pay a visit to his nephew. In mythology, Shani is the name of a god and a planet also: Shani, or Saturn, is one of the planets of the sun. However, when Shani&#146;s eyes fell on the newborn babe, the child&#146;s head disappeared. What was to be done in that predicament? So the severed head of an elephant was grafted onto the child&#146;s body, and since then Gan&#x301;esha&#146;s face has resembled that of an elephant. This is just a mythological story, and the story has nothing to do with Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii, for Gan&#x301;esha is the son neither of Shiva nor of Pa&#x301;rvatii. According to mythology, he is the son of Durga&#x301;, a Puranic goddess.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Thus far we have discussed the physical appearance of Gan&#x301;esha. But this is not all; one more interesting thing should be mentioned here, which concerns the collective psychology of human beings. You know that the ancient environment in which human beings lived was fraught with danger on all sides. Not only that, there were frequent severe clashes among individuals and also among clans. Thus in those days the growth in the number of members of a society was very important; and this is the reason why ancient humans started phallic worship. Now, pigs and mice multiply faster than other animals, but pigs are dirty creatures &ndash; they eat dirty things &ndash; so pigs could not be considered as a fit mount for the group leader. For that reason mice were considered: they also multiply by leaps and bounds. People wanted their leader&#146;s mount to be a creature whose numbers increased in the shortest possible time; then naturally their numbers would also multiply, giving them an edge over their enemies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Even today, in those areas of India, particularly the western areas, where there is the influence of Gan&#x301;apati or Gan&#x301;esha, the mice are not killed. There are temples in many parts of India where the mice are worshipped. Thousands and thousands of mice are heartily fed there; nobody kills them. Some people say humorously, &ldquo;Gan&#x301;esha is such a corpulent person, he must be very wealthy also. He must be the owner of warehouses, and wherever there is a warehouse there must be mice. That&#146;s why mice are selected as mounts for Gan&#x301;esha.&rdquo; This is just a joke, not a fact.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Now, it is necessary to say something here about Gan&#x301;esha&#146;s wife. You will understand later why it is necessary. By now you must have understood the origin of the idea of Gan&#x301;esha. He represents the group leader of the prehistoric humans. But in the age of the Puranas, many, many stories were created about the different gods and goddesses. According to one story, the wife of Gan&#x301;esha is Tulasii, but according to some Puranas, S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii is the wife of Gan&#x301;esha. In Puranic society, the goddess S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii is worshipped once a month after a child is born. According to other Puranas, S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii is the wife of Ka&#x301;rttika, while in some local Puranas in certain parts of India, the wife of Gan&#x301;esha is the goddess Santos&#x301;ii. So there is a tremendous difference of opinion among the Puranas. Now the question arises, &ldquo;What about Kala&#x301;bao, who is beside Gan&#x301;esha? Is she not then the wife of Gan&#x301;esha?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The prehistoric human beings were completely unaware of chemistry. They would procure medicines mostly from plants and herbs. They considered those plants and herbs having medicinal values as gods. In fact, all the important a&#x301;yurvaedik treatises mentioned that almost all trees and plants have some kind of medicinal value. But of those trees and plants, the few that have greater medicinal value are more loved and respected by the people. They take special care to plant those species.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The prehistoric human beings did not know the science of pharmacology; they directly used the plants and herbs to cure diseases. In those days people, particularly in India, came in contact with nine kinds of special plants having special values, such as medicinal value, food value, etc. They worshipped these nine kinds of plants not as gods and goddesses of religion, but as very useful things. Of course godhood was imposed on trees afterwards, and I will mention later, when I describe the teachings of Shiva, what Shiva said in this connection. These nine kinds of plants, in which the people discovered special medicinal and food values, were kadalii, kacu,  haridra&#x301;, jayantii, ashoka, bilva, da&#x301;d&#x301;imba, ma&#x301;n and dha&#x301;nya.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Kadalii is a very nutritious food item. In case of intermittent fever, kadalii [plantain] is a very good medicine. Moreover, it helps the liver, pancreas, and kidneys to function smoothly, and it is also a good medicine for dysentery. Moreover, it is an ideal food for those mothers whose children die young. Overripe bananas (preferably with black patches) are a very good medicine for children who develop rickets because of the scarcity of milk after their mother&#146;s death. If you make a paste of them, this has even greater value than mother&#146;s milk. In the case of calves who lose their mothers, they too become healthy if they are fed one part paste of overripe bananas to two parts cha&#x301;tu.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Thus plantains and bananas have numerous qualities, and hence the people of those days began to worship them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The second plant is kacu, arum. Arum has less food value, but it is very good for the kidneys.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The third plant is haridra&#x301;, turmeric. Turmeric is a good spice and is highly antiseptic also. Here haridra&#x301; does not mean dry turmeric, but green turmeric (ka&#x301;nca&#x301; halud) taken fresh from the earth. The turmeric which is dried in the sun is called shun&#x301;t&#x301; halud, which people buy in the market for cooking purposes. Green turmeric is not used in cooking; it has a poisonous effect. People may die if they consume much of it. But it is antiseptic; it cures skin diseases and purifies the blood. However, it is so poisonous in large amounts that even crocodiles die of it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->When many people gather together in one place, there is every possibility of the spread of disease. So there was a practice in ancient Bengal and India that before any social festival, people would bathe, applying a paste made from green turmeric. And this practice continues to some extent even today; normally it is done before weddings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Next is jayantii. Its roots have great medicinal value, especially for white leprosy. In fact, jayantii is a medicine for four out of the seven kinds of discolouring skin diseases. That is why the people used to worship jayantii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Next is ashoka, which is called in Hindi siita&#x301; ashoka. Simply ashoka, in Hindi, is devaduru [pine-tree]. But the ashoka which has medicinal value is siita&#x301; ashoka. It is an ideal medicine for all kinds of female diseases. The wine made out of ashoka is ashokaris&#x301;t&#x301;a or ashoka&#x301;sava. Thus ashoka has great medicinal value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Next is bilva, bel-fruit. Unripe bel is the best medicine for all stomach diseases. Unripe bel should be eaten after roasting; ripe bel is not very good. Bil means &ldquo;minute hole&rdquo;: the fruit which enters the minute holes and does good to the stomach is called bilva. Because of its extraordinary qualities, it has another name &ndash; shriiphala [&ldquo;a fruit with excellent qualities&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Next is da&#x301;d&#x301;imba. Its bark, roots and fruits are all very good medicines for all kinds of female diseases. In a&#x301;yurvaedik schools of medicine, as practised both in India and in China, these qualities of da&#x301;d&#x301;imba are recognized. Next is ma&#x301;n. Of all the varieties of starchy food that help in building flesh in the human body, ma&#x301;n is unique. It has better qualities than potatoes or even jackfruit seeds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Jackfruit seeds have two-and-a-half times more food value than potatoes. Prior to the arrival of potatoes in India, people here used to eat jackfruit seeds. And ma&#x301;n is even higher in food value than jackfruit seeds. Besides this, ma&#x301;n has a cooling effect on the body. It is a good medicine in the summer, when the body becomes very heated and people get nosebleeds. It is both food and medicine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Next is dha&#x301;nya, paddy. It has numerous qualities.

The divine power latent in arum was called Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; shakti. The one in turmeric was Durga&#x301; shakti. The power in jayantii was Ka&#x301;rttikii shakti.

Some time after Post-Shiva Tantra, in the Puranic Age, a special cult, the Gan&#x301;apati Cult, arose centring around Gan&#x301;apati. You should remember that some five cults arose following the Puranic doctrine that had its origin some 1300 or 1400 years back: Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra and Saora&#x301;ca&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Let us throw some light on Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra [the Shiva Cult]. The main goal of human beings is Shivasama&#x301;dhi [final enlightenment].

And then the mutative principle has to be withdrawn from Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; shakti and merged in Bhaeravii shakti (the acoustic root of Bhaeravii shakti is sham&#x301;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Bhaeravii shakti means energy in action. All people want to come into contact with the mutative force.

So they crave for sha + ra = shra (in the feminine gender, shrii, beauty). Thus there was a custom in olden days for people to prefix their names with the word shrii. The old custom has fallen into some disuse: shrii is used less nowadays. But I hope that these days people will not become vishrii [ugly]! Then the sentient forces [or principles] have to be withdrawn from Bhaeravii shakti, and merged in Kaos&#x301;ikii shakti, or Maha&#x301;sarasvatii, the spiritual effulgence.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->Last is the Saora [Sun] Cult. This cult was propagated by the Brahmans who came from Sha&#x301;kadviipa. Sha&#x301;kadviipa was the southern part of Russia, with its capital at Tashkent. The original Greek name of this area was Sacdonia. These Brahmans who migrated to India from Sacdonia did not recognize the Vedas or anything else; they were astrologers and teachers of a&#x301;yurveda. Since they cultivated the science of astrology and astronomy, they used to worship the sun-god, Su&#x301;rya. The word saora is derived from su&#x301;rya plus the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;a, giving the sense of &ldquo;offspring&rdquo;; saora means &ldquo;one who is the worshipper of the sun-god&rdquo;. When it developed into a full-fledged cult, the idea behind it was that the sun-god, who was the creator of this world, was also the creator of the solar system; that is, all the planets &ndash; earth, Mars, Mercury, etc. &ndash; have come from the sun. The sun is their father. Similarly, the father of this universe is the sun-like Parama Purus&#x301;a; so the sun is worshipped as the Supreme Progenitor of this universe. This is the inner essence of the Su&#x301;rya Cult, which was spread by the Sacdonian Brahmans.

<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->These were the five main cults of the Puranic Age. None of them became widely established.

But Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&#146;s son, Ka&#x301;rttika, was very extroversive in outlook. He was more fascinated with the external world, with less interest in the subjective world. This did not please Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. So in order to remove Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&#146;s sorrow, Shiva was very affectionate towards her, and for that reason, people used to say jokingly that Shiva was dancing with Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; on His head.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The fact was different, as I have explained.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->The author of the Purana has said something more about Ka&#x301;rttika which does not seem to be reasonable: he imagined that Ka&#x301;rttika was the son of the River Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;, or Ganges. Now the question is, how can a river be the mother of a human baby? Common sense does not accept this view, but the Puranas clearly state that Ka&#x301;rttika was the son of the River Ganges, and that while floating in the current, he got stuck on a sandbar. In that situation, the boy started crying bitterly, and the six stars in the sky took pity on the crying child. As the boy sucked the breast milk of these six stars, he was called S&#x301;ad&#x301;a&#x301;nana [Having Six Faces], or Murugam, or Balasubrahmanyam or Ka&#x301;rttikeyam. According to the Purana, since the boy sucked the breast milk of the star Krttika&#x301; with his principal face, the boy was named Ka&#x301;rttika. Krttika&#x301; is one of the twelve stars after which the months of the Bengali calendar are named.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->Though a little off the subject, let us mention that the name of the star is Krttika&#x301;, with double &ldquo;t&rdquo;. Krttika&#x301; + sna = Ka&#x301;rttika, so in the spelling of Ka&#x301;rttika, there should be two &ldquo;ta&#146;s&rdquo;. According to the rules of Sanskrit grammar, the consonant after r may be double; that is, r  may be followed by one consonant or two consonants. For instance, in the spelling of dharma and karma, one is at liberty to use either one &ldquo;m&rdquo; or two &ldquo;m&#146;s&rdquo;. But in the spelling of Ka&#x301;rttika, two &ldquo;ta&#146;s&rdquo; must be there, because the original word was Krttika&#x301;, not Krtika&#x301;. Had the mother&#146;s name been Krtika&#x301;, then one &ldquo;t&rdquo; would have been permissible.

<a name="77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->There is a popular belief that Ka&#x301;rttika was a bachelor. In the folk-songs current in the districts of Hooghly, 24 Parganas, etc., Ka&#x301;rttika is referred to as unmarried. This is wrong. According to some Puranas, his wife&#146;s name is S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hii, but according to other Puranas, his wife&#146;s name is Devasena&#x301;. (In ancient times the ladies had names like Vasantasena&#x301;, Sharatsena&#x301;, Devasena&#x301;, etc. So in that sense, Ka&#x301;rttika was &ldquo;Devasena&#x301;pati&rdquo;, that is, the &ldquo;Husband of Devasena&#x301;&rdquo;.
