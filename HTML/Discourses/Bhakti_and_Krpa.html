<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Bhaktirbhagavato seva&#x301; bhaktih premasvarupinii;<br>Bhaktira&#x301;nandarupa&#x301;ca bhaktih bhaktasya jiivanam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Bhakti or devotion is service to Parama Purus&#x301;a. It is love and bliss personified, the very breath of devotee. Now what is meant by devotion?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The word bhakti is defined as bhaj + ktin. Bhakti means &ldquo;to praise with love&rdquo;, &ldquo;to worship someone&rdquo;. Two entities are required &ndash; the one who is eulogized, and the other who eulogizes. Here the two entities are the Lord and the devotee.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ananda Su&#x301;tram defines bhakti as &ldquo;Bhaktirbhagavadbha&#x301;vana&#x301; na stutirna&#x301;rchana&#x301;&rdquo;. Bhakti means ideation on the Supreme, neither eulogy nor ritualistic worship. Stuti is derived as stu+ktin &ndash; which means to praise the one in front. This is nothing but flattery. If a son praises his father in front of him, the father gets angry instead of being pleased. The word archana&#x301; has come from the root verb arc. Archana&#x301; means to worship a deity with flowers and other paraphernalia like vilva leaves, ganga water etc. In this ritualistic worship, how much genuine love is there. The ritualistic worship with paraphernalia is done in the midst of time space and person. The difference between time place and person brings difference in ritualistic paraphernalia. So in external rituals, the spatial and personal difference between the Lord and the devotee is not obliterated. But with cosmic ideation people advance towards Parama Purus&#x301;a a bit by bit. The more the sa&#x301;dhaka comes close to him, the greater will be the degree of devotion. At that time the devotee will realize Parama Purus&#x301;a as his or her own, as the soul of souls and will surrender his or her unit existence in the Macrocosmic flow. If human beings cannot surrender themselves at the altar of Parama Purus&#x301;a they can never attain spiritual progress in life. Without total surrender, Macrocosmic grace is not attained, and without Macrocosmic grace nothing is attained. Besides this there is no other way, (Na&#x301;nyah Pantha&#x301; Vidyateyana&#x301;ya).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Another definition of bhakti or devotion is &ldquo;Sa&#x301; Para&#x301;nuraktiriishvare&rdquo;. The word rakti means colour, attraction. Anura&#x301;ga means attraction for something. The attraction is of two types: 1) attraction for aparabrahma or finite objects and, 2) attraction for Parama Brahma or the Infinite entity. Attraction is the law of nature, repulsion is negative attraction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In creation one object attracts another. The sun as the nucleus of the solar universe attracts the different planets and satellites. Similarly the planet earth is attracting various objects lying on the surface of the earth. Just as honey bees rush towards beehives, greedy for honey, the people of country-sides flock to towns and cities in search for food, clothes and accommodation. It is notice that people rush towards those objects or shelters which are lasting and dependable, which can guarantee greater safety and security. The same psychology prevails behind the human desire to possess properties, name and fame, sons and daughters. But unfortunately although these finite objects and entities provide apparent happiness to people, they ultimately bring sorrow and pain. A billionaire undergoes heart rending grief at the death of his only son. No finite object can ensure permanent happiness or eternal peace to human beings. Only the infinite, imperishable, deathless Brahma can be the Supreme object of ideation. &ldquo;Satyam jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nanantam A&#x301;nandam Brahma&rdquo;. Only the people with all the warmth of their hearts move steadily towards the god of their hearts (just as a person, under the spell of Avidya&#x301; Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, moves towards finite objects can attain Parama Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In philosophical language, this love for the finite is called a&#x301;sakti. The transactional relationship of human beings based on a&#x301;sakti is business and attraction or love for Parama Purus&#x301;a is called devotion. The relationship between the Lord and the devotees is the relationship of service. The devotees want to serve the Lord out of pure love, to please Him, and wish for nothing and return.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->On a deeper analysis, it is found that human beings have nothing to call their own. They may boast about their intellect, intelligence, power and influence but the real owner of these is Parama Purus&#x301;a. By His grace, alone can one utilize or enjoy objects. If Parama Purus&#x301;a so desires. He can snatch away all these possessions from humans, And the humans will be unable to do anything about it. After realizing the Supreme truth intelligent people should endeavour to realize Parama Purus&#x301;a with the power He has given them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This realization of the Supreme also depends on His grace. In order to merit Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s grace, unit beings will also have to do something. Their duty is to contemplate or ideate on Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Tha&#x301;kur Ra&#x301;makrs&#x301;n&#x301;a used to say, kr means &ldquo;do something&rdquo; and pa&#x301; means &ldquo;get something&rdquo;. It is the birth right of unit beings to attain cosmic grace. Rights and duties are inseparably related. So if one wants to attain cosmic grace, one will have to arouse devotion in one&#146;s heart. The one who feels this devotion is a blessed person. He has nothing else to do. He is sure to realize Brahma with that devotion. The main purpose behind intuitional practice is to arouse and develop devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->A person who wants to realize Brahma and has the required devotion in Him is sure to attain Him. But suppose a person lacks devotion, does not perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, does not understand philosophy, is an ordinary neglected illiterate villager having no social prestige can such a person attain liberation? Can he attain Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The answer is simple: Yes, certainly he can attain Brahma. To attain salvation is the birth right of all individual beings. Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; makes no difference between educated and uneducated, rich and poor, young and old &ndash; no such external difference has any meaning to Him. He is the all-knowing entity. He judges everything by studying the inner sentiments of individuals. Even the most sinful and most virtuous people are equally entitled to salvation in the eyes of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; only considers the inner thoughts and devotional sentiments of people. The intense desire to know Him, the deep urge to attain Him, the intense longing for Him &ndash; these are the qualities which Parama Purus&#x301;a values.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now the question is, How can this latent devotion be aroused? One of the ways is through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and accumulated virtues in previous lives. People of this category are really fortunate, because with that devotion, they will be able to attain Cosmic grace. But suppose one does not possess the accumulated virtue of previous lives &ndash; what will happen? Will one&#146;s latent devotion not be aroused? Will one remain deprived of the Cosmic grace? Through one day&#146;s intense longing for Him can one&#146;s supreme devotion be aroused? Yes that is enough to attain His grace. The life of the bandit Ratna&#x301;kar is a good example of this. The world has witnessed few bandits as cruel as Ratnakar was in his younger days. It is said that in only a few years he took the lives of a few thousand people. But even such a confirmed criminal is not deprived of divine grace. The moment he developed an intense desire to switch over to an honest life, a pure sentient and divine life, discarding his previous criminal ways, he receive Cosmic grace in abundance. This transformation of the ignoble life of the bandit Ratna&#x301;kar to the devotional life of the holy Ratna&#x301;kar took place within a few years only. The life of a bandit Ratna&#x301;kar was worse than that of ordinary men, but because he developed an intense desire to lead a pure spiritual life, he became a noble man. So every person like Ratna&#x301;kar through pious thought, benevolent deed and constant spiritual practice can become extraordinary. Should such a person still be called sinful or dishonest?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Everyone invariably lived an ordinary life or sub-standard life in the past. This is only natural, because although everyone has become from the same source, yet everyone has come through the process of Sain&#x32D;cara and Pratisain&#x32D;cara. Naturally, however black one&#146;s past life might have been one should erase it from one&#146;s mind. Human beings have no control over the past events. They can only build their future by making use of the present. God has put eyes in the front of the person&#146;s head. Hence the sages of the Upanisads say, &ldquo;Caraeveti, caraeveti,&rdquo; &ldquo;Proceed on, proceed on,&rdquo; make proper utilization of the present and build your future. Direct your propensities all your longings towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. Remember that you have none as your own except Parama Purus&#x301;a or Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->This intense love, this tremendous attraction for Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u is called Haribhakti. One who possesses Haribhakti is a blessed soul.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The derivative meaning of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u is all pervading, i.e. the entity who pervades everything from molecules to atoms to the greater creator Brahma is Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u. He is sarvabhu&#x301;tanta&#x301;ratma&#x301;, i.e. He lies quiescent in and every entity. To one who will run towards Him with undiverted attention, with deep devotion and pure mind Parama Purus&#x301;a will spontaneously reveal Himself. At that time the individual existence of sa&#x301;dhaka will be merged in Parama Purus&#x301;a. Even the thoughts and feelings of the sa&#x301;dhakas, the very function of the nerves, veins arteries will be controlled by the Macrocosmic mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->There are some people who give indulgence to inferiority complex and fear complex. But when we know as a matter of logic that every individual can attain the highest stance of spirituality by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; can become an elevated person through culture of devotion, then why should anyone be afraid or hesitant?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Human beings are the progeny of the almighty Lord. Why should His children suffer from any weakness &ndash; inferiority complex or fear complex? Weakness is sin. So one must shake off all sorts of weakness and fearlessness, irresistible. Therefore you have no right to hate yourself, if you hate yourself, it means you are hating God.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->On the basis of some characteristics, bhakti or devotion is divided into a few categories;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph --><b>1) Nirgun&#x301;a&#x301; Bhakti</b>: Where the sa&#x301;dhaka without any motive runs towards the goal out of his intense love for Him, the psychology is: I do not know why I love my Lord, but I love Him because that gives me joy. I love Him for, I feel that he is the life of my life, the soul of my soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph --><b>2) Vaedhi Bhakti</b>: Where there is no exclusive devotion for the Lord but the sa&#x301;dhaka observes some ostensible vows, sprinkles cow dung and holy ganga-water, decorates the idols with gorgeous apparels and ornaments, offers flowers and bilva leaves, and chants mantras it is called vaedhii bhakti. Whatever might be in this brand of bhakti, there is the lack of expression of simplicity of the devotee&#146;s heart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><b>3) Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; Bhakti</b>: when a sentient sa&#x301;dhaka does not forget Parama Brahma even after attaining the highest fulfilment, then self-knowledge begins to unfold itself in the devotee&#146;s heart. This category of devotion is called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; bhakti. Although this is a kind of nirgun&#x301;a bhakti, yet it contains a slight vanity of occult power and knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph --><b>4) Kevala&#x301; bhakti</b>: When one is identified with the goal there remains only one entity. This is called kevala&#x301; bhakti. This category of devotion is not attainable by one&#146;s individual effort. One can attain it by the grace of great personalities or Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is the highest stage of devotion. In this devotion the sa&#x301;dhaka remains oblivious of the differences and distinctions. This is called mahimna jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. As long as the sense of differentiation will exist, the sa&#x301;dhaka will hesitate to be one with Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph --><b>6) Ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; Bhakti</b>: When the s&#x301;adhaka will say, &ldquo;I love Him because I feel pleasure by loving Him; I love him because I cannot remain without loving Him&rdquo; &ndash; this is the stage of ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti. The stage prior to the stage of ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti is ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; Bhakti. The difference between the two stages is that in ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; Bhakti, to get pleasure is the main thing but in ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301;, to give pleasure to the Lord is the main thing. In Ananda Marga, there is no place for vaedhii bhakti or jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; bhakti. Here every sa&#x301;dhaka is a follower of ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301;, but they will not stop there. In the process of strengthening their devotion through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one will attain kevala&#x301; bhakti. For the one who has attained the kevala&#x301; bhakti what else is left unattained? While depicting the state the sa&#x301;dhaka attains bhakti. Na&#x301;rada says,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Every human being is entitled to the above mentioned stage of devotion. Therefore O sons and daughters of immortality, you are the sons of the almighty Lord, you have the potentiality of infinite knowledge, power and valour. How can you fall victims to weakness and staticity, inferiority complex of any sort? Your sure bright future is in your hand. So do not waste your time and vain. Awaken your latent devotion by dint of hard penance, and with the bonds of profound devotion, Make Parama Purus&#x301;a your own. You are not a small or insignificant human being, you are the very child of Parama Purus&#x301;a. It is your birth right to be established in the immortality of infinite life. Keeping this supreme fixed in your memory, proceed to the supreme goal with utmost devotion, and you are destined to attain the greatest fulfilment.<!-- /block --></p>
