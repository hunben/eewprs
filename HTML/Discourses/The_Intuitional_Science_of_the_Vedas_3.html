<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The one who has known the Supreme Brahma has really known Him as the refuge of this universe. The One Who is the ultimate refuge of each and everything, animate and inanimate, movable and immovable, from the Supreme creation&#8230; Brahma &ndash; to the lowliest blade of grass, is the supreme goal, the final beatitude. The universe has been created within Him and is indeed radiant with His radiance. That the universe is created within Him is not all that can be said. It is the transformation of His own Self. It is evolved by Him. He is the substance as well as the cause of this universe. It is the cooperative creation of the sixteenfold distortions (ten sensory and motor organs, the mind and the five Tanma&#x301;tras or inferences) and the eight binding factors of Prakrti that are there as the cause and effect of His qualitative manifestations. The seeds and potentials of this universe are also inherent in them. It is for this vastness that He has been called Brahma, which means Great (Brahatva&#x301;d Brahma). Then again the One who makes another great, the One with whose thought and bearing the small unit establishes itself in the vastness, is also called Brahma (Brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d Brahma). When this world is within Him, then He must necessarily be greater than the world. Suppose there is a box in a room; then the room must be greater than the box. That is why there is space for the box, otherwise it could not have been accommodated. That in which this universe is implanted is naturally greater than the universe. The entire universe is pivoting around its knower, its Nucleus, in a cyclic order in the vast body of Purus&#x301;a. Revolving thus in this cycle the one who progresses towards the knowing Entity by virtue of one&#146;s spiritual force attains unity with Him, becomes one with Him. They become Brahma themselves, and that is why He has the quality of making one great.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Brahma is effulgent in white radiance. The Shruti says that Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are indivisible and inseparable. Where Prakrti (the operative principle) is active over Purus&#x301;a, Purus&#x301;a is of white radiance. In the Ga&#x301;yattri mantra the word, &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo;, is used in the sense of white radiance, and that is why this &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo; and Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (The subjectivated Transcendentality) are inseparable. The inseparability of Brahma and His Radiance is fully substantiated by the real meaning and analysis of the word &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo;. It is trilateral, the combination of three letters, viz., &ldquo;Bha&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ra&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ga&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Generally speaking, the word, &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo; is used verily in the sense of Brahmic effulgence. Now the question arises, whether Brahma and His radiance are two different entities. If we say Ra&#x301;ma has such and such qualities or Shya&#x301;ma has such and such qualities &ndash; aren&#146;t the individuals and their qualities two absolutely separate entities? Such distinctiveness is not applicable to limitless, integral, Brahma, who is without a second. Brahma and His radiance are not two separate entities, for He is autophanous &ndash; self-luminous. Citing the instance of Ra&#x301;hu&#146;s<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (Dragon&#146;s) head we have to say that He is characteristically radiant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This creation is triple-attributional. The game of the three attributes goes on in everything and everywhere in the universe, and they have not spared the human body. The region below the navel is dominated by Tamogun&#x301;a (Static principle), the region from navel to throat, by Rajogun&#x301;a (Mutative influence) and the region from throat to Trikuti (the junction of the two eyebrows, where the seat of the mind is located,) by Sattvagun&#x301;a (Sentient influence). Normally, a particular region in the body becomes more active in accordance with the Vrtti or epithymetic influence or the inter- and intra-ectoplasmic occupation of an individual. When a Sa&#x301;dhaka is established in his/her mental seat by virtue of his/her hearing, thinking and profound meditation, he or she being then established in Sattvagun&#x301;a (Sentient quality), realizes the Supreme Being in His Super-white glory, as is the wont of Sentient quality. When one goes beyond the mental sphere, one merges in the objectlessness of the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma in the Brahmarondhra (An aperture in the crown of the head) and thus reaches beyond the scope of colors. Bharga or white color also disappears from him. A desireless person, who worships this Supreme Purus&#x301;a absolves himself from the momenta of rebirths due to mind being objectless or desire-free. Such an individual goes beyond the cycle of ordinary birth and death. In other words, one&#146;s mental force goes beyond the stars (&#146;Shukra&#x301; means Venus, a planet) due to one&#146;s being established in the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;ma&#x301; yah ka&#x301;mayate manyama&#x301;nah<br>Sa ka&#x301;ma&#x301;bhirjja&#x301;yate tatra tatra<br>Parya&#x301;ptaka&#x301;masya krta&#x301;tmanastu<br>ihaeva sarve praviliiyanti ka&#x301;ma&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->According to human longings and desires or according to human propensive pursuit, their minds take form i.e., they will gradually acquire the like Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or reactive momenta. They first see within themselves what they aspire for and then let their minds flow towards it. Thereafter the external organs i.e., hands and feet, etc., set about achieving it. And so it is generally seen that the desires that they had been giving indulgence to throughout their lives, come hurtling over to them in a condensed form at the last hour, i.e., their mind-stuff takes the like mental form for the last time in order to shape itself into a fitting medium of the like Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Even during the life-time as well it is seen that the mind-stuff of a drunkard, which imbibes within it an indomitable desire or Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra for wine, turns into a vantage ground for undergoing the next Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or momenta of pleasure and pain. That is to say, such a person gets scent of the wine shop by the sheer propulsion of his acquired mental propensity, if he happens to go to a new and unfamiliar place. A man who has cultivated dog-like or swine-like desires all his life, dies with the same dog-like or swine-like frame of mind. Thereafter with the help of Prakrti&#146;s Mutative force he acquires the form of a dog or swine in order to undergo the dog-like or swine-like Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. The great ascetic, King Bharata, died thinking of a fawn, and that was why it is written in the Pura&#x301;n&#x301;as (Indian mythologies) that he had to take the body of a deer at his next birth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->But he who is fully satiated, i.e., he whose longings and desires have consumed themselves, obliviates even the possibility of any such thought-wave later because of the absence of any Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra. Such all-satiated persons are indeed self-purified. How can final satiety possibly come unless and until that Whole &ndash; that Supreme Spirit &ndash; is achieved? Hence he who has attained full satiety has indeed reduced all his Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras to nothingness right here in this world and so he has gone beyond the cycle of life and death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->From the inanimate to the animate goes the process of evolution. Take a piece of stone for instance. It has neither the power of action nor the sensation of mind. What is the reason? It is because hitherto there has been no manifestation of mind in the stone at all. Thought-wave or sensation can take place or an action can take a form only if there is a mind. Take, for instance, trees and plants which are more animate than stones. There are activities in them. They grow, draw the vital juice from the earth, maintain their species by creating seeds in their own bodies and enjoy and suffer pleasure and pain, when taken care of or smitten. We see in them the manifestation of consciousness or animation, for the mind has awakened in them. Thus progressing on the path of psychogenesis or mental development we see in humans the greatest manifestation. Just as during the Cosmic thought-process the evolution takes place from the subtle to the crude, similarly the unit retroverts step by step from the crude to the subtle, towards the same Absolute Consciousness from where it had come. It is just like the waves of the sea rippling back from the shore to the ocean from where they had originally come. Now, just how much should a person strive on his return journey? He has got to be alert, so that he may easily end the journey in his characteristic Self. Then alone shall we call him self-purified. Then alone shall he become saturated with Brahma, within and without.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->To become self-purified one has got to make some effort &ndash; this effort is what is known as Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The greatest Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is that which comprises three aspects viz., devotion, action and cognition. Medium Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is that which comprises two aspects i.e., devotion and action, and the inferior Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is that which consists of only tall talk (cognition or knowledge cannot exist singly without action and devotion &ndash; whatever may exist will be merely the debris of knowledge). The ability of a Sa&#x301;dhaka cannot be based on his common or worldly knowledge alone. It can only stand on the firm base of his knowledge, devotion and action (Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, Bhakti and Karma). By firmness I mean unflinching intensity of zeal and earnestness. By just saying that Rasagolla&#x301; is sweet, one cannot get the taste of a Rasagolla&#x301; (a spongy and juicy sweetmeat). One has got to make some efforts to obtain it and eat it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->By tall talks alone one cannot achieve Brahma. An almanac forecasts that there will be so much rain this year. But mere knowledge of such a forecast will not save the crops of a farmer. No amount of squeezing the almanac will produce even a drop of water. One has got to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to habituate one&#146;s mind to Brhamaward projection in order to attain Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->If a person, without Anubhu&#x301;ti or intuitional susceptibility, studies scriptures a million times or lectures on Brahma, his Brahma will ever remain a bookish Brahma, not the Brahma of one&#146;s conception or realization. Just as one seeing in water the reflection of fruit dangling overhead from the branch of a tree cannot taste the fruit, similarly an erudite scholar, versed in the six philosophies, will remain far away from Brahma if one refrains from Brahma-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. No matter how vastly learned you may become in worldly knowledge, without Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you can know nothing about Brahma, for along with your knowledge of these lores, a vanity of knowledge will also grow in you. With this result, you will go on enhancing the volume of your burden unnecessarily by habitually giving importance to your small ego. This burden becomes the cause of your sufferings and enjoyments, not of your salvation. A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Sham&#x301;kar said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->You will come across many such people who do not practice spiritual meditation themselves but will run after great spiritual men in order to hear their sermons. These people are totally wrong. Only running after great men will be of no avail. A person has got to establish himself in the path of realization of Brahma by doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; himself. God does not bestow His mercy upon anybody after seeing how great a speaker he is or how many books he has read. Only one who has devotion can exact His mercy. The great devotee, Mahars&#x301;i Na&#x301;rada said.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->That is, Brahma can be realized by achieving even a tiny bit of God&#146;s grace or that of a great person. Take a very intelligent boy for instance. If his teacher does not teach him how to read and write, he will not be able to become a great scholar in spite of having the potential for becoming one. Similarly, all persons have the ability or potentiality of achieving spiritual development or of establishing themselves in the Brahmic stance, but for want of a worthy guide it cannot take practical shape. That is why a spiritual Preceptor or Sadguru is necessary &ndash; his grace is indispensable. His grace is but God&#146;s grace, for God is the ocean of grace.<!-- /block --></p>

Indifference to mundane duties or flying above the world with a resolute detachment is but a mental disease. Those who want to give themselves up to divine contemplation in the cave of the Himalayas, leaving their homes, are misguided. The word, Sannya&#x301;sa, means to dedicate oneself for the attainment of God. When Brahma is everything, whatever you are, you must behave properly with everything around you. Hence to be callous about family and society is completely contrary to Brahma Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (Divine Contemplation). One cannot know Brahma through showy, superficial knowledge. You can only attain Brahma, when your knowledge has become strong and powerful through austere devotion to Truth. Only the soul of the one whose knowledge is identified with austerity, enters the abode of Brahma. Ultimately the united qualities of sedateness, mental and spiritual force, firmness, devotion to Truth, knowledge, the proper use of mundane things etc. will certainly enable a Sa&#x301;dhaka to attain unity with Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;Rs&#x301;i&rdquo;, means a Sa&#x301;dhaka who has cultivated Brahma within himself. So long as a Sa&#x301;dhaka does not attain Brahma, there exists in him a feeling of incompleteness. Suppose you want a thousand rupees. If you are given a thousand rupees, will you be contented? No, you will then ask for more. Such is the characteristic of human mind. Man has a limitless thirst. He keeps on harping ceaselessly, &ldquo;I am hungry.&rdquo; The hunger for a thousand will change into hunger for a lakh, and hunger for a lakh will make room for hunger for a crore. Thus the amount of hunger goes on increasing until a limitless amount of money is attained. This limitlessness is inherent in Brahma, and so your hunger can be satiated in Brahma alone. Hence when a &ldquo;Rs&#x301;i&rdquo; attains complete self-control (krta&#x301;tman), he goes beyond the sphere of attachment and detachment, and attains full realization of his characteristic Self. He becomes imperturbably tranquil, i.e. he reaches the stage which lies beyond the momentum of rebirth or regeneration. Attachment and repulsion exist so long as the proclivities of fascination and contempt exist. For instance, a puritanical sa&#x301;dhaka will consider wine as an object of disdain and will regard touching it as an act of impiety. A wine addict, however, regarding it as an object of greed, will run after it with total disregard for all social conventions and norms. But he who has become really desireless as the result of self-realization, will keep himself above these two. He will take wine as medicine under medical advice, otherwise he will carefully keep it away from the sight of people. He will have neither attachment nor aversion for the wine.<!-- /block --></p>

The Bay of Bengal is not very deep and so there are as much waves as roars, and the Arabian Sea, which is very deep, remains calm and meditative. Similarly, he who is satiated of knowledge and desireless, remains calm and tranquil. Why on earth should he indulge in self-publicity? To whom will he publicize himself? Such acts are the antics of common, avaricious people with beggar-like mentality. Man who has attained Brahma will see His Glory in everything and feel that nothing is separate from Him. Where is the fear of any Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra or reactive momentum for the one who has surrendered himself to Brahma?<!-- /block --></p>

Brahma is the combined name of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti.

But when Prakrti is inactive, i.e., when Purus&#x301;a is predominant, in that case the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra&#x301; sound also stops. By a slight transposition of A. U. Ma the three constituent letters of the ideogram ([DEVANAGARI CHARACTER] or On&#x32D;m&#x301;), i.e., placing, &ldquo;A&rdquo; at the end, we get the word UMA&#x301;. That is why Umapati (Pati means husband) means Purus&#x301;a. Brahma, in conjucation with Prakrti, is the cause of creation. In a particular content He may also be called Iisvara, means Controller Brahma is the controller of the organs and their gods directly and indirectly. His cognitive eyes are not two but three, i.e., He is the seer of all the three &ndash; past, present and future.

His throat is not limited and demarcated like that of a unit. The entire creation is within Him. His depth is unfathomable and hence He is calm and tranquil.

[It is] said in the Bible, &ldquo;In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>) Ra&#x301;hu being the head itself. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  Of the countless number of veins or tubular organs of the human body, thirty-three are most important. The controlling entities of these thirty-three veins or tubes are called thirty-three gods, vid, eleven Rudras, eight Vasus, twelve Adityas, Indra and Praja&#x301;pati. The Chief manifestation of the Cosmic Force is called Indra, which controls the human body entirely.<br> <br> (a) The eleven rudras: Ten organs (sensory and motor) and the mind. &ldquo;Rudra&rdquo; means that which makes one cry. At the time of death when all the organs merge into their corresponding counter-gods, the mind becomes inactive and the human body becomes still and immobile. Due to this near and dear ones of the dead person cry piteously. These eleven gods make the human cry, and hence they are called Rudras. <br> (b) The eight vasus: Vasu means the habitat of the units; that is to say, those that are receptacles, shelters, or objects of the organs are called Vasu. The sun, the moon, the stars, the sky, the ether, the air, the fire and the earth are the eight Vasus. <br> (c) The twelve A&#x301;dityas: A&#x301;ditya means Collector. Here it means that all those which takes or take away the consequences of deeds and life. Every moment the duration of life is being reduced, and the unit is being compelled to undergo the process of metamorphosis in order to enjoy or endure the consequences of his deeds. All these are taking place through the passage of time. Hence time is A&#x301;ditya, for it takes away the life and the consequential moments of deeds. The twelve months are the twelve A&#x301;dityas. <br> (d) Indra: Indra means lightning, thunder or actional force. <br> (e) Praja&#x301;pati: Praja&#x301;pati means Yajin&#x32D;a (sacrifice) or action.<br> <br> Some are of the opinion that the veins of the human body are uncountable. Others say that they are a few crores, as if they had counted them all. Many people say that the number of veins totals thirty three crores and so the gods are also of the same number. Truly speaking it is due to ignorance and blind faith that the controlling nerves and veins of the human body have been converted into thirty-three crores of gods, having so many different names and forms. Sham&#x301;kara said in reference to gods &ndash;<br> <br> &ldquo;Sarvadyotana&#x301;tmaka akhan&#x301;dacidaekarasah.&rdquo;<br> <br> Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;avalkya said &ndash;<br> <br> Dyotate kriidate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divi<br> Tasma&#x301;ddeva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<br> <br> The gods are of two kinds &ndash; (1) Daehik Devata&#x301; (the physical gods). The manifestation of soul is accomplished through the organs, and so the organs are called Daehik Devata&#x301; and (2) Brahmik Devata&#x301; (Cosmic gods through whom the whole universe is manifested and controlled). Both are thirty-three in number. Each of the Cosmic gods is the counter-god of the respective physical gods. These physical gods get merged into the counter-gods, which again merge in Brahma, and that is why the liberated Sa&#x301;dhaka becomes Brahma Himself.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  Author&#146;s footnote on the other two meanings of kula omitted here. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)  It is the Supreme Brahma Who is the creator of the universe and to create is also an act. Where there is action, there is sound. The pran&#x301;ava or On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is indeed the sound of the creative thought-process of the Supreme Spirit and he who has merged himself in Brahma due to the absence of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra or reactive momentum, has attained a position even above Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Maheshvara. <br> Of the three letters (A, U, Ma) of the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra &ldquo;A&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x0985;</span>) is the seed of creations, &ldquo;U&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x0989;</span>) is the seed of stability or preservation and &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AE;</span>) is the seed of destruction. &ldquo;A&rdquo; being the creative alphabet, Brahma is called Brahma&#x301; (Brahma + a) in reference to creation. Suppose a man&#146;s name is Ra&#x301;mbabu. His son will call him &ldquo;father&rdquo; and his pupil will call him &ldquo;sir&rdquo;; these are but the titles of Ra&#x301;mbabu applied to his specific occupational conditions, Actually Ra&#x301;mbabu is one, Sagun&#x301;a&#x301; Brahma imbibes three chief acts, viz., creation, preservation and destruction. These acts of creation, preservation and destruction are taking place in the psychic sphere of Brahma. With the termination of its thought process all the manifestations of these three kinds of acts will also cease. For instance, when we think of Bhagalpur, a clear picture of Bhagalpur gets projected on our mental plate and when we give up the thought of Bhagalpur, the picture of Bhagalpur gets lost in that very mental plate. If afterwards we cease to think at all, the mind also loses its existence. So Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Mahesh are the nomenclatures of the different psychic acts of Brahma Himself. When a Sa&#x301;dhaka, having gone beyond the mental stratum, gets ensconced in the immutable, pure Brahmic region, he certainly enjoys greater importance or superiority over these three gods. That state is the characteristic state of the unit &ndash; the supreme state of Shiva or Cosmic Transcendentality. Asked to reveal his identity, Lord Sam&#x301;kara&#x301;car&#x301;ya said &ndash;<br> <br> Manobuddhyaham&#x301;ka&#x301;ro cittani na&#x301;ham<br> Na ca shrotrajihave na ca ghra&#x301;n&#x301;a netre<br> Na&#x301;vyoma bhu&#x301;mirna tejo na va&#x301;yuh<br> Cida&#x301;nandaru&#x301;po&#146;shivo&#146;ham&#x301; shivo ham.<br> <br> That is,<br> <br> Not mind nor I-feeling nor ego am I<br> Nor ear nor tongue nor nose nor eye<br> Nor air nor earth nor sun nor sky<br> The Soul Eternal am I, am I.</p>
