Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, apa&#x301;na, sama&#x301;na, uda&#x301;na, vya&#x301;na, na&#x301;ga, ku&#x301;rma, krkara, devadatta, and dhanain&#x32D;jaya &ndash; the collective name of these ten vital forces is pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h. If you wish to increase your apperceptive power you must control the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h. Through regular practice, the mind will become concentrated. Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma is meant for sa&#x301;dhakas &ndash; it is better for non-sa&#x301;dhakas not to take the risk of injuring themselves by doing pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Closing the eyes, sit in either siddha&#x301;sana, padma&#x301;sana or bhojana&#x301;sana. Do bhu&#x301;tashuddhi. After doing a&#x301;sana shuddhi, concentrate your mind on the point that the a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya will fix. Then, after doing cittashuddhi, ideate on the first syllable of your Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra, press and close the right nostril with the thumb of the right hand, and draw in a deep breath through the left nostril. During inhalation, ideate that infinite vital energy is entering the point from the infinite Brahma who is existing all around. After taking a full breath close the left nostril with the middle, ring and little fingers, and, taking the thumb away from the right nostril, slowly let out the air (Ideate that the infinite vital energy is returning from the point to that Infinite Brahma). During exhalation ideate on the remaining syllable of your Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra. When the breath has been fully expelled from the right nostril, inhale as fully as possible again through the right nostril. Afterwards, closing the right nostril with the thumb and removing the fingers, exhale the air through the left nostril. This completes one round.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma can be practised up to four times in a day. If a person practising pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma twice daily wishes to practise three times on any particular day, he/she may do so, but the person who practises twice daily must not suddenly increase to four times, because that will result in the body falling sick. Therefore it is advisable at first to do the practise twice daily, increasing it by one round per week. If, however, on any day two times pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma is not completed, then at the end of the week, the number of times missed must be practised in compensation before increasing the number of rounds.<!-- /block --></p>

And in this way, as the condition of the disease improves, move the point away from the heart to the next bone-joint or gland. In the case of arms, the tip of the middle finger, and in the case of legs, the tip of the big toe, will be considered as the last point of pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma. (In other parts of the body, the last point of the diseased area.)
