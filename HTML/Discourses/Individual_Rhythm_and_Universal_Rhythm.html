<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This vast universe is the greatest expansion of the Macrocosmic mind, now the question is, how was this universe created? The fact is that the Macrocosmic citta is the material stuff of this universe. The mind can have a form when it is vibrated by the cosmic mind. Hence this universe is made out of his mind stuff. In the extroversial flow of the cosmic cycle of creation the different tanma&#x301;tras are created &ndash; sound, touch, taste, form, smell &ndash; as a result of crudification of cosmic citta. These tanma&#x301;tras are the analytical forms of universal rhythm. The inanimate matter, plants and animals, etc., originate in the evolutionary flow of the Macrocosmic imagination. It flows from subtle to crude in Sain&#x32D;cara and in Pratisain&#x32D;cara flows from crude to subtle. In this second phase of the cosmic flow the evolved human beings emerged and carry the flow of creation to its successful fruition. In the observable world that is the macrocosmic imagination, the numerous forms have emerged &ndash; forms after forms, waves after waves, ideas after ideas. He is the noumenal cause of this phenomenal world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Each and every created entity &ndash; whether crude, subtle or causal &ndash; is vibrational and rhythmic. Suppose there is a man he has a body, mind and soul. His body is composed of eyes, nose, ears, tongue, skin, vocal cords, hands, legs, excretory and genital organs, ten vayus, blood vessels, nerves, blood, flesh and so on. Each of this parts of the body has its distinctive rhythm. The difference between two human beings or two objects is due to the vibrational or rhythmic differences. That no two entities in this world look similar is due to this vibrational differences. Thus this world is full of diversity &ndash; this is the inexorable law of nature.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[Diversity is the law of nature, uniformity will never be.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The average of rhythms of all rhythms &ndash; the rhythm of body, mind and soul, and the individual organs etc., of the body &ndash; is called individual rhythm. The individual entity has five kos&#x301;as [layers of mind], rather like a plantain flower. Similarly, this universe is the collective form of countless vibrations and rhythms. Every animate and inanimate object of creation emanates its own vibrations &ndash; the mighty mountains, the flowing rivers, the lovely forests &ndash; none is mute, none is silent. Each of them is resounding with an inexplicable eternal vibration, as if in deep meditation. The collective rhythms of all the rhythms emanating every moment from the countless objects of the cosmic imagination is called &ldquo;universal rhythm&rdquo;. The existence and growth of finite, living entities are dependent on this universal rhythm, whether they realize it or not. A microcosm, due to its limited capacity, cannot fully grasp this universal rhythm, although it tries to do so. To catch the vibration of this vast, endless universal rhythm the microcosms will have to unify all the capacity of their indriyas and minds. Only then will they be totally identified with the universal rhythm and become absorbed in a blissful vibration. The auspicious moment when the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; and big &ldquo;I&rdquo; are harmoniously united, will [[result in the restlessness of the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; coming to a standstill. The result will]] be an unending flow of bliss in the cosmos. Let me try to explain the nature of the mutual relationship between the microcosm and universal rhythms with a simple analogy. Suppose a young boy is flying a kite high in the sky. It seems the kite has an apparent link with someone on earth, but that is not the fact. The kite has a link with the spindle in the hands of the boy through a thin thread. The kite flies at a certain altitude according to the sweet will of the boy. The microcosm and universal rhythm also are linked by an invisible spiritual bond in exactly the same way. That&#146;s why it is said that microcosms are only granted &ldquo; dominion status&rdquo;; whereas a complete independence is vested with the universal rhythm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->How can we understand that there is a spiritual link between the unit and universal rhythms. In daily life everyone realizes that if their lives are troubled their dear and near ones will feel great pain, whereas if their lives are filled with joy, their relative will be happy too. Even sometimes we feel a kind of pain in our hearts when we see the pale, sickly faces of those who are not even related to us. Sometimes people even forget their enmity out of deep sympathy for their sworn enemies. Who does not like the spontaneous joy of the innocent faces of children? This is all due to the invisible spiritual link between unit rhythm and universal rhythm. Thus those who are able to connect themselves with the universal rhythm will attain permanent composure. Their existence will acquire a new meaning. This universal rhythm is unfolding itself in innumerable rhythms in the vast bosom of this universe. He wants the living beings also to keep moving in harmony with the universal rhythm. If we call this endless, vibrating rhythm of the Macrocosmic entity Paramra&#x301;sa, then the individual rhythm of the microcosm should be called svarasa. The actual significance of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to merge the individual flow into the Macrocosmic flow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Those who seek to attain the permanent cessation of afflictions in their lives, have no other way than to follow this path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Very often it is found that a certain person is in possession of vast wealth due to his life long&#146;s diligent labour. It may be that the person, in the days of his prosperity, was a central figure in the society. But at the end of his life he may suffered a wretched existence, bemoaning his losses in the arid desert of his heart. The reason is that the person had an insatiable thirst for material objects and never tried to identify his individual flow with the cosmic flow. On the contrary, a person living in a thatched hut did not forget Parama Purus&#x301;a even in the midst of abject poverty and never deviated from the goal of his life. Such a persons life can never lose its charm. Every dust particle of this earth will seem to be as sweet as honey to him. Likewise, his existence will acquire the sweetness of honey.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Liberated souls or jiivanmukta are truly blessed individuals. How is this unification of the unit flow with the cosmic flow possible? It is only possible through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. When sa&#x301;dhakas ideate on the Supreme, their individual flow tries to maintain a parallelism with the universal rhythm. The bridge connecting the unit rhythm with the cosmic rhythm is the incantative rhythm. The individual rhythm vibrated by the incantative rhythm rushes to be united with the universal rhythm. When the unit entity feels the existence of the universal rhythm but fails to attain Him, it feels a psychic affliction. The great poet Rabindranath Tagore has expressed this so beautifully in one of his poems.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The universal life is unfolding itself in so many rhythms, tunes and melodies, in light waves and sound waves, etc. A microcosm which is about to touch Him, but fails to do so, carries the agony of his incapacity. But the wavelength of unit mind will increase by intensive efforts and one day will be one with that universal rhythm and will finally merge in the Macrocosmic wave. This merger is termed &ldquo; self-surrender&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->This universe lies embedded in the macrocosmic flow of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The imperfect microcosms have no instrument to measure this endless cosmic flow. Each and every atom and molecule of this universe, matter, mind, in fact everything, is floating on this Macrocosmic waves. A person whose mind is free from the load of crudity can easily float along the cosmic wave. One who is overloaded with sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras cannot float at all. Buddha in one of his teachings says, &ldquo;Sinca bhikkhu imam&#x301; na&#x301;vam&#x301; miktate lahu messatti&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;O monk, if you want to cross to the other bank, make the boat of your mind light.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Whether the same wavelength or a different wavelength each and every molecule and atom of the universe is bobbing up and down on the ocean of cosmic flow. This is the mysterious and eternal dance of the universe. The continuous dance of microcosms around Purus&#x301;ottama, floating on the Cosmic flow is called ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
