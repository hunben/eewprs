<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In each and every corner of the world there is some usage or other prevalent among the human race of that area regarding their duty to deceased persons, to the dead. This event, this observance, is known as &ldquo;shra&#x301;ddha&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta. There are innumerable types of observances, but they all come under the same heading, shra&#x301;ddha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What&#146;s the meaning of shra&#x301;ddha&#x301;? &ldquo;Shraddhaya&#x301; diiyate yastu ityarthe shra&#x301;ddhah&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;that which is offered with shraddha&#x301; is shra&#x301;ddha.&rdquo; And what is shraddha&#x301;? &ldquo;Shrat satyam iti dhiiyata ityarthe shraddha&#x301;&rdquo;, that is, when an idea or a culminating point is accepted as supreme, then that idea or culminating point is called &ldquo;shrat&rdquo;; and when the mind, with its propensities, moves towards that object, that movement is called shraddha&#x301;. Shrat + dha is shraddha&#x301;. Now let us see some of the prevalent usages of the world in connection with this shraddha&#x301;, or shra&#x301;ddha. When you offer something with shraddha&#x301;, it is shra&#x301;ddha. A priest may say that your father will die only once, and so after his death you should arrange for a sufficient quantity of food-stuffs, a sufficient quantity of edibles, a sufficient quantity of clothes, etc., for him. And that has been done in India for about five thousand years, since the time of the Atharva Veda. And people have generally offered rice and sesame, also honey and ghee, to be consumed by that person who has left the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Regarding these things, Maharshi Charvaka (he lived in India about 2500 years ago, during the time of Lord Buddha. He was a bit senior to Lord Buddha. Charvaka&#146;s disciple, Ajit Kusum, was a contemporary of Lord Buddha) said &ldquo;If you are in a room, and another man is in the courtyard a few yards away, and you offer rice and sesame for that man, he won&#146;t get that rice and sesame, and his hunger won&#146;t be satisfied. And if a man is in another world, Aparaloka, and you are offering rice and sesame for him, will he get them? Is it reasonable? No, no. All these things are exploitation by the privileged class.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->After offering rice, sesame, clothes, etc., what do you find? The rice is consumed by the purohita in his house. Go to his kitchen, and all that rice is being consumed by his family. That dhuti which is being offered by you for your late father is being used by the purohita, and the sha&#x301;r&#x301;ii by the purohita patnii; and the gamci, the towel, if it is surplus, is sold in the market. And the utensils are also sold in the market. So your deceased father, your parents, who are now inhabitants of Aparaloka, won&#146;t get anything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And the second thing you will see, or you will feel, is that they do not require these things. The microcosm, or unit spirit, does not require any food or clothes or sesame or utensils. All these ideas are scoundrels&#146; philosophy. And they have been doing this type of exploitation for the last five thousand years, since the time of the Atharva Veda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In some other corners of the world, people wait for forty days, and after forty days they offer a particular type of prayer, and that prayer is supposed to make the position of the dead person secure. Is this logical? Certainly not. All these things done in the name of shra&#x301;ddha are nothing but a cheating business.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In prehistoric times also, those people of less-developed intellect used to think in this same way, that even after death people require worldly objects. So in prehistoric times also you would find, looking within the graves, that they used to offer barley (at that time wheat was not popular), wine, honey, such things. And even now in India during shra&#x301;ddha they use these things &ndash; barley, wine, wool &ndash; so that the dead person will wrap that woollen ca&#x301;dar<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> around themself, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now, as I told you, in all corners of the world this type of exploitation is going on. And why are the people being exploited? Because they are under the veil of superstition. They are superstitious people. They are less developed in intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->I remember a short story. In my town there was a businessman. Say his name was D&#x301;oman Sa&#x301;hu. And his father was also a businessman. During the day he was a businessman, and at night he was a d&#x301;a&#x301;ku<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> . Say D&#x301;oman&#146;s father&#146;s name was Mohan Sa&#x301;hu. Now a big pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita came from Kashmir to my home town and said that he had the capacity with the strength of his mantra, to arrange heaven for all pa&#x301;piis, all degraded persons, all degraded souls. Then D&#x301;oman thought, &ldquo;My father Mohan is a d&#x301;a&#x301;ku. Let me take the help of this big pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita and arrange heaven for my d&#x301;a&#x301;ku father.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So the pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita said, &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes. I will do everything, but I want fifty guineas as a fee for the purpose.&rdquo; And D&#x301;oman agreed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->But D&#x301;oman&#146;s friend was one Mr. Ravi Ghose, a very intelligent man. Ravi Ghose said, &ldquo;You see, D&#x301;oman, that pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita is a businessman, that is why he wants fifty guineas. You do one thing. Let there be bargaining. Tell the pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita, &lsquo;You see, pan&#x301;d&#x301;itajii, I can offer only fifty silver coins, fifty rupees. Please agree.&rsquo;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Then the pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita said, &ldquo;Yes, it will be done, but had it been fifty guineas, your father would have reached just below the Pa&#x301;rija&#x301;ta tree of Nandana Ka&#x301;nana of heaven. If you give fifty silver coins, fifty rupees, he will reach the main gate of heaven, but not near that Parijata tree.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->D&#x301;oman thought, &ldquo;Right near the gate. Then that short distance will be covered by my father on foot. Then let me spend only fifty rupees.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Then again he went to Ravi Ghose, that crooked and intelligent fellow. Ravi Ghose said, &ldquo;You see, D&#x301;oman, our first attempt has been a success. Now you just tell him, &lsquo;Pan&#x301;d&#x301;itajii, I will spend only forty rupees; not fifty.&rsquo;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Pan&#x301;d&#x301;itajii said, &ldquo;In that case, there will be a short gap.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Then next day D&#x301;oman said, &ldquo;No, I will spend thirty rupees,&rdquo; and so on. And finally the settlement was for ten rupees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->So this is the commercial story regarding shra&#x301;ddha. There is nothing in it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So what should one do? Haven&#146;t we any social responsibility for dead persons? When the necessity arises, we should offer shraddha&#x301; for them, not barley or wheat or woollen clothes or wrappers or ghee or sesame. What can we do? As long as a man is here in our society we have a social responsibility for him. Human beings are social beings, we have a social responsibility for them. And when the leave this world and go to the other world, they go beyond the scope of our responsibility. We cannot render any service to them. Our social responsibility is over as soon as the cremation is done.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->So what can we do? We can say &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, while that man was with us we tried our best to do whatever we could do. But now they are beyond our scope, they are beyond our jurisdiction, so please do take care of them.&rdquo; This much of a request can be made by us, and nothing more than that. And the Ananda Marga shra&#x301;ddha is just like that. Here we require no edibles, no clothes or anything else. We offer our shraddha&#x301;, and we do nothing else, and we can do nothing else.<!-- /block --></p>
