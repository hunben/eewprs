<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In some limited cases the verbal root anc means &ldquo;to move&rdquo;. Its usual meaning is &ldquo;to determine&rdquo;, or &ldquo;to demonstrate&rdquo; or &ldquo;to point out&rdquo;. We use our finger to point out some sight or a spot on a map and say &ldquo;that place&rdquo;. For this, the root anc is used. From the root anc and the suffix ka we get the word aun&#x32D;ka. Since the n here is apada&#x301;nta [not at the end of the word], then in this case the construction is made with the fifth varn&#x301;a, that is, it becomes aun&#x32D;ka rather than am&#x301;ka. The etymological meaning of aun&#x32D;ka is &ldquo;that which has been fixed&rdquo;, and the colloquial meaning is &ldquo;lap&rdquo;. The science which is based on fixed numbers, such as four, five, ten, twelve, is aun&#x32D;kasha&#x301;stra or mathematics &ndash; algebra, arithmetic, trigonometry, surveying, etc. are all part of mathematics. Aun&#x32D;ka is also used to mean &ldquo;part&rdquo;. That drama which has only one aun&#x32D;ka [act] is called eka&#x301;unkika&#x301; drama. The Bengali word a&#x301;nka has come from aun&#x32D;ka. (It also means &ldquo;arithmetic&rdquo;. In the rural language, a&#x301;nka kas&#x301;a&#x301; [to count] is still common.) By adding the suffix lyut&#x301; to anc we get the word aun&#x32D;kana which means &ldquo;drawing&rdquo;. Its spoken form is a&#x301;nka&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix ka to the root anc we also get the word aun&#x32D;ga which means &ldquo;to determine&rdquo;. &ldquo;This is a hand, this is a foot&rdquo;. In this way whatever has been fixed we call aun&#x32D;ga [limb]. In the construction of aun&#x32D;ga, m&#x301; cannot be used; the fifth varna una must be used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Anc suffixed by alac gives us the word ain&#x32D;cala which means &ldquo;a fixed place&rdquo;. In the construction of ain&#x32D;cala also, m&#x301; should not be used; rather it should be written with the fifth varn&#x301;a, ina, because here the fundamental root uses an apada&#x301;nta n.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Aun&#x32D;ga<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the root anj is &ldquo;to grow&rdquo;, &ldquo;to increase&rdquo; or &ldquo;to extend&rdquo;. To welcome a guest we extend our hand or we extend a garland of flowers. Since, at the time of welcoming, something is extended, we use the word sam&#x301;varddhana&#x301; (from sam&#x301;varddhan, &ldquo;to increase&rdquo; or &ldquo;to extend&rdquo;) for &ldquo;welcoming&rdquo;. We also get the word aun&#x32D;ga when we add the suffix ac to anj; its meaning is &ldquo;that which has grown&rdquo;. All those parts which have grown from the main body, or any portion of that growth, is thus also called aun&#x32D;ga. For this reason hands, feet, eyes and ears are all classified as aun&#x32D;ga. In olden days, that country that was situated at the far border of northern India was considered an outgrowth of northern India and so its name was Angadesh [the country of aun&#x32D;ga]. It was between Barendrabhumi and Mithila which were on the north bank of the Ganges. South of the Ganges was Magadha and the land of Rarh, and within them was this Angadesh. Karna was probably a famous king of this Angadesh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->If we add lyut&#x301; to anj we get the word aun&#x32D;gana which means &ldquo;the growth of a house&rdquo;, or courtyard (angane a&#x301;o ab java rasiya [come in my courtyard now, Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a] &ndash; Vidyapati). In ancient days, during the height of male-domination, women used to be confined to the courtyard. Other than women who worked as physical labourers, no one was allowed outside the courtyard. Thus the women of that time were called aun&#x32D;gana&#x301;. Would it not be desirable to abolish the use of this word<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in this modern era?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->By adding lyut&#x301; to anj we also get the word ain&#x32D;jana [sulphate of antimony used as collyrium] which means &ldquo;that which increases lustre&rdquo;. Needless to say, the fifth varn&#x301;a in&#x32D;a is used; am&#x301; is not used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Ad&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The word ad&#x301;d&#x301;a is old Bengali. Many believe that the word is perhaps of foreign origin. The actual meaning of the word is &ldquo;many coming together in a single place&rdquo;. Later, the word ad&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; became transformed into a&#x301;d&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;. The word a&#x301;d&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; [dwelling place, rendezvous] is still used in Bengali today.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root n&#x301;u is &ldquo;to deliver&rdquo;. The formal meaning of pran&#x301;ava (pra &ndash; n&#x301;u + al) is &ldquo;that which has been delivered excellently&rdquo;, in other words, that which has been successfully delivered to Parama Purus&#x301;a. The colloquial meaning of pran&#x301;ava is on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra [the sound of on&#x32D;m]. According to certain scriptures, by fixing one&#146;s concentration on the pran&#x301;ava sound one will arrive at the original source, the Purus&#x301;ottama [Cosmic nucleus]. In the Shruti it is said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The Tripa&#x301;davibhu&#x301;ti Narayan&#x301;a Shruti has clearly said:  Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma. The vibrational flow of the Cosmic Self oscillates the universe through innumerable expressions. Each individual expression is known as deva and the original source from which they emanate, that Supreme source, is known as Maha&#x301;deva. That is, this pran&#x301;ava, being emitted from the nucleus of the universe, flows in waves through the different levels of matter and mind and continues on to limitlessness. It is not destroyed. It only knows how to move ahead. All kinds of inferential manifestation, all kinds of expressions originating in the nerve fibres, vibrate in that series of waves. Even when those waves pass into the far distance where the sky can place no obstacle in their path, even in that abstract world, they are expressed in the flow of inferences. Whatever sound is emitted continues eternally, whether or not we are able to perceive it. Whatever form vibrations have come into existence will continue endlessly, whether or not our optic nerve is able to catch them. This flow of waves is the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. On the one side it is the Macrocosm and on the other, innumerable microcosms, molecules dancing around the Macrocosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->What does not do what the root n&#x301;u does is an&#x301;u [molecule]. From n&#x301;u plus the suffix d&#x301;rn&#x301; we get the word n&#x301;u. Here the a is a negation. An&#x301;u means &ldquo;that which does not deliver anyone anywhere&rdquo;. It has come by itself. The microcosm dances around the Macrocosm, but the Macrocosm does not dance around the microcosm. Hence the an&#x301;u does not deliver anyone; it arrives by itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->When the an&#x301;u goes from distant to close, when it goes from a partially manifest vibration and arrives at the original base of that vibration with the help of the series of waves through vibrational simulation, it arrives at its supreme station. Thus the Macrocosm is great and the microcosm small. The smallest portion of any entity that carries its fundamental characteristics is known as an&#x301;u. Still, colloquially, any small entity can be, or is, called an&#x301;u. The living being is an an&#x301;u of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Molecular existence is all an&#x301;u, though there are individual differences at the molecular level. The smaller portion of the an&#x301;u, which does not carry its fundamental characteristics, is known as parama&#x301;n&#x301;u [atom].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->An&#x301;u must be written with n&#x301;. If it is written with n it becomes a prefix. The meaning of the prefix anu is &ldquo;back&rdquo; or &ldquo;behind&rdquo;. If anyone arrives (gamana) somewhere after another person arrives, then we say that he has &ldquo;followed&rdquo; (anugamana). If someone moves (saran&#x301;a) somewhere, that is, if he walks or moves aside, and meanwhile someone else moves behind him we say that they have &ldquo;followed&rdquo; (anusaran&#x301;a). If someone does something or has done something or has been doing something, and someone else also does that something after him, we call that &ldquo;imitating&rdquo; (anukaran&#x301;a). To indicate the desire to do this we add ap after the suffix san which gives the word anucikiirs&#x301;a [the desire to imitate].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The word atah means &ldquo;from here&rdquo; or &ldquo;from now on&rdquo;. What happens after &ldquo;from here&rdquo; or &ldquo;from now on&rdquo; is called atahpar [afterwards].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Tal + ac = tala. By adding the negation a before tala we get atala. The natural or etymological meaning of the word atala is &ldquo;that whose bottom is too deep to be found&rdquo; &ndash; in spoken Bengali we say Ya&#x301;r thai pa&#x301;cchi na&#x301;. The colloquial meaning of atala is &ldquo;the third level down in the successive order of crudeness&rdquo;. Just as when we ascend we have bhu&#x301;-bhuvah-svah-maha-jana-tapa-satya with satya loka being the subtlest, when we descend we find tala right below bhu&#x301;loka, below that atala, and then similarly tala&#x301;tala, pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, atipa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, and rasa&#x301;tala. Rasa&#x301;tala is considered the crudest. Of course, the word rasa&#x301;tala is used to mean the worst kind of hell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Atiisha<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The word ati has various meanings. Sometimes it implies &ldquo;abundance&rdquo;, sometimes it signifies &ldquo;excess&rdquo;, sometimes &ldquo;that part of growth which is unnecessary&rdquo;. The word iisha means &ldquo;lord&rdquo;, &ldquo;controller&rdquo;, &ldquo;director&rdquo;, &ldquo;ruler&rdquo;; the formal meaning of atiisha is &ldquo;formidable ruler&rdquo; or Maha&#x301;kaola. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;fit to be welcomed by all&rdquo; &ndash; wise sage. During the Buddhist era, those who were firmly established in profound wisdom used to be known as atiisha.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Atha means &ldquo;this is&rdquo; or &ldquo;this will be&rdquo;. Atha svarn&#x301;anakulakatha&#x301; means &ldquo;this was a story about a golden mongoose&rdquo;. Katha&#x301; means &ldquo;story&rdquo;. Katha&#x301;nika&#x301; means &ldquo;assorted short tales&rdquo;. Katha&#x301;nika&#x301; &rarr; kaha&#x301;nia&#x301; &rarr; kaha&#x301;ni &rarr; kahinii [anecdote, story].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Anna<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root ad is &ldquo;to eat&rdquo;. Atta&#x301; means &ldquo;eater&rdquo;. In the Vedas it is said: Atta&#x301; vishvasya satpatih. We get the word anna from the root ad. Ad + na = anna. If hasanta da [where the a after the d is omitted] is followed by na, then na is inserted in place of d. The etymological meaning of anna is &ldquo;that which is eaten&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which can be eaten&rdquo;. The colloquial meaning of anna is &ldquo;the chief food of any area&rdquo; &ndash; in some places rice, in others bread, or potato or porridge. Just as a Bengalee is correct to call rice anna, so would an Irishman be correct to call potato anna. A&#x301;luka &rarr; a&#x301;lua &rarr; a&#x301;lu [potato]. What we call a&#x301;lu came to India from abroad about 400, 450 years ago. Thus it has no separate name in Sanskrit. A&#x301;luka used to be used for sweet potato. (Shakarakanda: Sharkara&#x301;kanda &rarr; shakkarakanda &rarr; shakarakanda) In some parts of India this sweet potato or shakarakanda is anna for the poor people. Although it is tasty, it has little nutritive value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Apa<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Apa is a prefix. It denotes opposition. That which goes against karma [deed] is apakarma [misdeed]. When we say devata&#x301; we mean &ldquo;one who has many kinds of good qualities&rdquo;. One who does not have good qualities is called apadevata&#x301;. Imaginary ghosts are thus called apadevata&#x301;. The antonym of utkrs&#x301;t&#x301;a [excellent] is apakrs&#x301;t&#x301;a [inferior]. The antonym of sain&#x32D;caya [accumulation] (sam &ndash; ci + al = sain&#x32D;caya) is apacaya [squandering] (apa &ndash; ci + al = apacaya). Caya is created by adding the suffix al to the root ci. But if ghain&#x32D; is the suffix, then in place of the letter ca, ka is inserted, that is, ci + ghain&#x32D; = ka&#x301;ya, not ca&#x301;ya (the spelling ka&#x301;ya&#x301; is incorrect). Apakrti can be used as the antonym of sam&#x301;skrti [culture] but apa-sam&#x301;skrti cannot because sam&#x301;skrti means &ldquo;that which has ascended to an advanced level of krti [deed]&rdquo;. Apa means a degraded condition. How can the two then go together? Can a stone bowl be made of gold? Furthermore, apakrti also means &ldquo;misdeed&rdquo;. Thus asam&#x301;skrti, rather, should be used as the antonym of sam&#x301;skrti.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->A (negation) + Pa&#x301; + lyut&#x301; = apa&#x301;na. The etymological meaning of apa&#x301;na is &ldquo;that which does not help in increasing fluidity&rdquo;. According to the yogic scriptures, apa&#x301;na is one of the five internal va&#x301;yus [vital forces]. There are ten different internal and external va&#x301;yus. The internal va&#x301;yus are pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, apa&#x301;na, sama&#x301;na, uda&#x301;na, and vya&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->1) Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a: The pra&#x301;n&#x301;a va&#x301;yu is situated in the area from the navel to the throat. It helps with the respiratory functions and the circulation of vital energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->2) Apa&#x301;na: This va&#x301;yu functions in the area from the navel down. It helps in the excretion of urine and stool.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->3) Sama&#x301;na: Sama&#x301;na va&#x301;yu is situated at the navel region and maintains equilibrium between the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a and apa&#x301;na va&#x301;yus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->4) Uda&#x301;na: The uda&#x301;na va&#x301;yu is situated in the throat. It helps in vocalization and expression of thought. If someone uses very emotional language we say &ldquo;tini uda&#x301;tta kan&#x301;the a&#x301;hva&#x301;n Ja&#x301;na&#x301;len.&rdquo; [He issued a clarion call.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->5) Vya&#x301;na: The vya&#x301;na va&#x301;yu functions throughout the body. It helps in the circulation of vital fluids and blood, and in the perception and non-perception of experience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->The five external va&#x301;yus are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->1) Na&#x301;ga: It resides in the joints. This na&#x301;ga va&#x301;yu helps with jumping and extending the body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->2) Ku&#x301;rma: It is found in the different glands of the body. Ku&#x301;rma va&#x301;yu helps with the action of contraction. The way a turtle contracts by withdrawing its limbs into its body is called ku&#x301;rmabha&#x301;va. Since this va&#x301;yu helps in effecting ku&#x301;rmabha&#x301;va, it is called ku&#x301;rma va&#x301;yu. One should keep in mind that ku&#x301;rmabha&#x301;va and ku&#x301;rmana&#x301;d&#x301;ii are not the same thing. Ku&#x301;rmana&#x301;d&#x301;ii is a point in the throat at the bottom-most portion of the periphery of Vishuddha cakra. If mental equipoise is brought about in the ku&#x301;rmana&#x301;d&#x301;ii then the body&#146;s vibrations can be temporarily stopped. (According to yogis, bulls have the capacity to fix their mind in the ku&#x301;rmana&#x301;d&#x301;ii, thereby achieving a state where they can go without moving for a long time. To see them, it would appear as if they were not a living being but a statue chiselled out of stone.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->3) Krkara: Krkara va&#x301;yu is scattered throughout the body. It expresses itself in the increase or decrease of air pressure. Krkara va&#x301;yu helps in yawning and stretching. Ordinarily, yawning happens right before falling asleep, and stretching, right after waking up. In the spoken languages of north India, yawning is called jemna&#x301; and stretching is called a&#x301;m&#x301;d&#x301;e lena&#x301; &ndash; in Bengali we say a&#x301;d&#x301;mor&#x301;a&#x301; bha&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->4) Devadatta: The devadatta va&#x301;yu bases its action on the increased or decreased pressure of food and water in the stomach. Devadatta va&#x301;yu rouses thirst and hunger.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->5) Dhanain&#x32D;jaya: As a result of internal or external labour, the body feels the need for sleep. The feeling of sleep or drowsiness comes from this dhanain&#x32D;jaya va&#x301;yu which pervades the body, and so the living being drowses or falls asleep.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Due to illness, old age or an unexpected injury, the region inhabited by pra&#x301;n&#x301;a va&#x301;yu degenerates and the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a va&#x301;yu can no longer maintain its natural functional capacity and flow. In this unnatural condition it strikes against the sama&#x301;na va&#x301;yu causing the sama&#x301;na va&#x301;yu to lose its equilibrium. As a result, the navelly-situated sama&#x301;na va&#x301;yu and the upper body pra&#x301;n&#x301;a va&#x301;yu quit their respective areas and merge; the two then create pressure on apa&#x301;na va&#x301;yu. In this condition the uda&#x301;na va&#x301;yu loses its normal ability to function under the united pressure of pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, sama&#x301;na and apa&#x301;na. This condition we call &ldquo;navel breathing&rdquo;. As a result of the uda&#x301;na va&#x301;yu losing its normal functioning, a rattling sound is produced in the throat. This is an indication of imminent natural death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->At the time of leaving the body, the four united va&#x301;yus &ndash; pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, apa&#x301;na, sama&#x301;na, and uda&#x301;na &ndash; join with the vya&#x301;na va&#x301;yu, which is present throughout the body. These five vital forces, having become one, leave the body and join the aerial factor or merge in Maha&#x301;pra&#x301;n&#x301;a [Cosmic Life]. At the time that the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a va&#x301;yu leaves the body, four of the five external va&#x301;yus, namely na&#x301;ga, devadatta, ku&#x301;rma, and krkara, join with the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a va&#x301;yu and leave the body together with it. Only the dhanain&#x32D;jaya va&#x301;yu remains in the body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Sleep and drowsiness is the work of dhanain&#x32D;jaya va&#x301;yu. The body being in a state of permanent repose, dhanain&#x32D;jaya va&#x301;yu remains.

<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->The collective name of the five internal va&#x301;yus and five external va&#x301;yus is the five pra&#x301;n&#x301;as or the ten pra&#x301;n&#x301;as. The process by which we try to bring the vital forces under control is called pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma in the yogic scriptures. Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;n yamayatyes&#x301;a pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;mah. Of course, there is another explication of pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma: Tasmin sati shva&#x301;saprashva&#x301;sayorgativicchedah pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;mah. Its meaning also ends up being essentially the same, that is, the special effort whereby the normal flow of inhalation and respiration is altered and a temporary cessation of respiration is introduced by special means, is called pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->It sometimes happens that due to sudden accident or the attack of a deadly disease, the body is so disturbed that its vital force becomes paralysed. This can happen with cholera (visu&#x301;cika&#x301; in Sanskrit), pox (ma&#x301;riigut&#x301;ika&#x301; in Sanskrit), snakebite, death by poisoning, and death by hanging.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Suddenly, there is an accidental death, but the body is not broken into pieces. Since the vital energy is paralysed, there is no opportunity for navel breathing or only very little. When the vital energy has been paralysed, it seems apparently as if death has occurred while actually it has not &ndash; that comes a little later. During this condition, if the respiration can be reestablished by an artificial process, the vital energy wakes up and becomes active or can do so.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->As long as the vital energy is paralysed, there will be no sign of decay in the body. In olden days, whenever a person&#146;s vital energy became paralysed for one of these reasons, the people, rather than cremating or interring the so-called dead body, used to attach it to a raft and float it in water. In the open environment or atmosphere of the river, the vital energy, in some cases, used to become fully active again. Thus, in those days, especially in cases of cholera, pox or snakebite, the people used to float the dead patient in water out of a spirit of welfare. In such cases, where the vital energy is paralysed, there is absolutely no chance of it returning if the body is cremated. If the body is interred underground it becomes even more grievous because that vital energy may reawaken for some time in the grave. After a short struggle the person falls again into eternal sleep in the darkness of the tomb. Thus, after these types of death it is better not to burn or bury the deceased until they have been examined by a competent physician.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->I remember a story now about paralysed vital energy that I have not thought about for many years. I was going from Biharshariif to Ranchi via Gaya. It would have been shorter and faster to go via Nawada, Jhumri-Tilaiya, but since I had some<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> work in Gaya I had to take the long route. It was late in the evening when I arrived in Gaya, about a quarter past eight. After finishing my work, I decided that if I spent the night in Gaya I would be late when I got to Ranchi the next morning. Instead, why not go on ahead as far as I could? I could stay at some resthouse along the way. Then I could start at dawn the next morning and arrive early in Ranchi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->So that is what I did.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Around 10:00 at night I reached the Gobhi dak-bungalow. After a few shouts, the caretaker woke up. I told him I wanted to spend the night there and leave at dawn. He seemed like a good man but he replied, &ldquo;Look, Sahib, no one stays in this resthouse at night. As you can see, the jungle is not far from here. There are ferocious animals in the jungle, bears and some tigers also. After a little while you&#146;ll hear the tigers roar. Four or five years ago the bathroom was broken; no one uses it. The authorities don&#146;t want to repair it either so it&#146;s really not possible for you to sleep in the room tonight. As you can see, we still haven&#146;t gotten electricity in our rest house. We have the old-fashioned pull-fan<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> but we haven&#146;t had a fan-puller for two years. The authorites are thinking to bring electricity here so they&#146;ve left that position vacant.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Now it&#146;s cold season,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What&#146;s the harm if there is no fan-puller?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What can I say, sir,&rdquo; replied the caretaker. &ldquo;Until now, I haven&#146;t seen anyone who has been able to remain in any of the rooms of this house. So I can&#146;t advise you to stay here.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ll sleep outside in the garden,&rdquo; I said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Like I told you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There&#146;s the danger of bears and tigers. I&#146;m also afraid to stay here at night. How can I let you stay alone at night outside in the garden?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ll sleep under a mosquito net,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Bears and tigers won&#146;t come through the net. You don&#146;t have to worry.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->The man reluctantly agreed. He arranged a cot, some bedding and a mosquito net for me. When I laid down for the night I saw something white a little distance from the bungalow in the soft light of the waxing moon. I asked the caretaker if he knew what it was.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sir, I don&#146;t see very well at night,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&#146;ll tell you in the morning.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->I had some fruits with me, so I ate something and lay down. The caretaker started heading home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->At that time British rule had just ended. The pressure of British domination was felt everywhere. But in this Gobhi area there was virtually no sign of the civilized world. It was completely jungle, and in the middle of it this little dak-bungalow. There were no houses, no market, no din and bustle nearby. If you shouted there would be very little hope that anyone would hear you. The caretaker said he would come at five in the morning. Until then I would be completely alone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, feeling tired, I laid my torch next to my pillow and went to bed. After a few minutes my eyelids grew heavy and I dropped off to sleep. Some time later I was roused by a rustling sound. What do I see? At the foot of the bed two hands were lifting up the mosquito net and coming in, human hands. There was no need of the torch because there was enough moonlight to see by.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Who&#8230; who&#8230; who,&rdquo; I said. Slowly the mosquito net rose up and the upper portion of a human body entered along with the two hands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->Was it a man? The image of a man created by the play of light and shadow? The glorious treasure of a human being vibrant with life? But why was it so silent? I could feel the touch of the cold air coming in from the forest at the foot of my bed. Was this heaven or hell? Or some other place, beyond either one?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->The fellow stood there like a statue chiselled out of monolithic rock. I became very annoyed and turned over on my other side. From the forest I could hear the constant drone of crickets, ghostly owl cries, and the occasional sound of a va&#x301;rshim&#x301;ha deer. One sound in particular, I assumed, was the call of a deer. I could also hear the strange cries of hyenas. I had heard that there were bears, pythons, wild boars and a few man-eating tigers in this forest, but I didn&#146;t hear any. Hunters say that the calls of deers and tigers never come from the same part of the jungle at the same time because deer won&#146;t go anywhere near an area where a tiger is roaring, so if you hear the call of a deer you can be sure that there are no tigers nearby.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->I tried to sleep a little. But who can sleep through misfortune? At the foot of the bed cold air was still coming in from the forest so I knew that the figure was still standing there lifting up the mosquito net. I got more and more annoyed. I decided to ignore him for a little while, but if he still didn&#146;t go away I would scold him mercilessly and compel him to leave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->Two or three minutes passed. He continued to stand there, holding up the mosquito net and staring at me. Then I rebuked him severely in the local Magahii language: &ldquo;What are you doing here? Whom do you want? If you&#146;ve got no business here, well I have! I&#146;m trying to sleep.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->He started to tremble and I could see that he was embarrassed. Then he started speaking in a very sweet, soft voice: &ldquo;I came to make sure that you could sleep properly.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->He had answered me in Bengali. Seeing his gentlemanly behaviour, my mind softened. Looking closely, I could see that my visitor was a young man about twenty-two or twenty-three years old, wearing winter clothes. Judging by his face I could see that he was well-educated and from a good family.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;My name is Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana Bhain&#x32D;ja. My home is in Hazaribag. But it seems I am bound here by my strong attachment to the place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I saw how late you arrived and I knew the night would be troublesome for you. The caretaker of this place is a very good man. He was right to try to get you to stay in the next dak-bungalow at Caopa&#x301;ran&#x301; instead of staying here. That&#146;s a very good dak-bungalow. Everything he said was quite correct. It&#146;s his duty to stay here at night, but he doesn&#146;t do so out of fear. He leaves at 10:00 every night and comes back around five in the morning. His village is about a mile from here. Whenever he goes and whenever he comes he gets eerie feelings and becomes afraid. It&#146;s like that. If I had to come then I&#146;d also feel the same way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I saw that you had bananas and guavas for dinner. Imagine how I felt. You wanted to take a bath but the water from the well here is not fit for use. Even though the caretaker left a bucket of water before he left, thinking you might need it, still you didn&#146;t use it to bathe. Imagine how we felt. Finally you went to bed on a cot in the garden and fell asleep. I didn&#146;t get any chance to speak with you. Then I thought, let me lift up the mosquito net and tickle the bottom of your feet a little. If you woke up, then I would ask you if you wanted to come to my house.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What would be the inconvenience if I remained outside?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Two inconveniences,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;As you can see, there&#146;s a cold breeze coming from the jungle. It&#146;ll get even colder as the night goes on. All you have is an endi [rough silk] shawl to cover yourself. You&#146;ll be very uncomfortable. Secondly, the wild animals from the forest make noise all night long and they&#146;ll keep waking you up. You see how much trouble it is? So we want to make the best of a bad situation and give you the best room in the bungalow. We&#146;ve cleaned the room and arranged everything. You won&#146;t have any problems there.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The keys are underneath my pillow,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Where did you get the keys from?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I have a duplicate set of keys,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We often go back and forth to the bungalow at night. If we see any guest having problems at night we also feel troubled. Even more so with you since you are very close to us, as close as can be.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why do you keep saying  &lsquo;we&rsquo;? Who else is with you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana replied: &ldquo;My sister is with me &ndash; Mainjula&#x301; Bhain&#x32D;ja. Didi has been doing research for a long time into Gondwanaland&#146;s prehistoric age. Our Gobhi here was also a part of Gondwanaland. Didi&#146;s friend Va&#x301;savii Vasu is also here. Va&#x301;savii has been doing long-term research on Magdha&#146;s gods and goddesses during the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na Buddhist era. Once she visited with you the rocky land that is in front of Sha&#x301;masuddin Miyan&#146;s house in Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;d&#x301;iya&#x301; village. In that rocky land there were different figures of gods and goddesses from Magadha&#146;s Buddhist era, some broken or half-broken, and others still intact. Va&#x301;savii said that you helped her in many ways. So I can&#146;t let you remain in such a troublesome situation. Please heed what I am saying and come to the room.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->Rather than give a direct answer, I asked Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana if he was doing research on anything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ve done a little research on the river civilizations of Rarh and Jharkhanda. But you can hardly find a single book on the subject so I haven&#146;t been able to go very far in my research.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Once you went to Hazaribag. My sister Mainjula&#x301; and I also went. You were standing near the Canary Hills. I was walking behind you but I didn&#146;t have an opportunity to say anything. Had you looked behind you, even by mistake, I would&#146;ve spoken a few urgent words to you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->Then I asked: &ldquo;In your opinion, are your sister Mainjula&#x301; and her friend Va&#x301;savii Vasu also bound here by the same attachment to the place?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->He smiled a little and replied: &ldquo;Exactly as you say. Please come now. The ladies have finished getting the room ready.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The caretaker was saying that there is no fan-puller,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It may get uncomfortably hot during the night.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That&#146;s partly correct. But as you can see, it&#146;s cold outside. And besides, what am I here for? Myself, my sister, and Va&#x301;savii will take turns fanning you by hand. And so that you won&#146;t be in any kind of danger while you&#146;re asleep, I&#146;ll stand watch. The only trouble you have to take is to go to the room. You don&#146;t have to think for anything else.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana started for the room and I followed after him. By the way, there is one thing I should mention about our walk over. My shoes were squeaking as I walked but Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana&#146;s were absolutely silent. It was as if his feet weren&#146;t touching the ground at all, or if they were, they were touching it so lightly that no sound was coming. It was quite strange. Like being in a spectral world. There was some moonlight so there were very few fireflies. Those few that were there moved aside when they saw me, but when they saw Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana they did not move at all, as if they did not acknowledge his existence. Such a thing! As if he was a phantom moving in a phantom world, lost in a magical inner realm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->I arrived at a large room. Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana really did have a duplicate set of keys. Otherwise how could they have opened the room? I could see from the decaying condition of the earth and brick walls that the house had been built either at the beginning of the British era or at the end of the Mughal era. It was along this road that they used to send the mail from Bengal to Delhi with mounted postal bearers. At points along the way there were arrangements for food and lodging for the riders and their horses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->As I entered the room I was keenly aware of the strangeness of the situation. There was no light on in the caretaker&#146;s room but here they had lit a wall-lamp. Although one could more or less make things out in its dim light, one couldn&#146;t see very well. From the open door that white apparition from the forest could still be seen indistinctly, the same white apparition that the caretaker had told me he couldn&#146;t see clearly at night and would inform me about in the morning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->The bed was laid out. I lay down and covered myself with my en&#x301;di shawl. The room was fairly warm. Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana pulled up a stool and began fanning me.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why should you stay awake so late at night,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You should go to bed. Just let me know which room you are going to sleep in and I will call you if I need to.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

How long was I holding up the mosquito net and letting the cold air in?&#8230; It never occurred to me that you were getting cold. Here, let me warm up a flannel for you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Don&#146;t put me into debt like that. You can stay in my room if you like, but you don&#146;t have to do anything more for me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&#146;ll stay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&#146;ll fan you; Besides it wouldn&#146;t be right for me to lie down now. Who knows when some danger might present itself. The three of us will take turns staying awake. My sister will take the duty after me. Then I&#146;ll go out on the road to Caopa&#x301;ran&#x301;. It&#146;s also important to see if there&#146;s anything dangerous on the road. When you&#146;re crossing Caopa&#x301;ran&#x301; it&#146;ll be dawn. Whoever is going to look after you on your way out of Caopa&#x301;ran&#x301; will have to have a word with me then. I can&#146;t come so easily or talk so easily in the daylight as I can at night, you understand.

<a name="100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The region where we are now used to be the far eastern part of ancient Gondwanaland. I can&#146;t say it was the farthest eastern part because the farthest eastern part was that part of Gondwanaland that people nowadays call Rarh. The eastern mountains of Gondwanaland ran parallel from west to east. Only the Rajmahal Hills in the north ran northeast instead of due east, near Sahebganj and away from the Ganges. I say the Ganges although at that time the Ganges wasn&#146;t there &ndash; the ocean was.

To the east of this Pareshna&#x301;th was the ancient land of Rarh and to the west was Jharkhanda. Of course this was before human beings came to the earth.<!-- /block --></p>

It is not only that these rivers carried vital force for existence. They also led the irresistible attainment of civilization and culture swiftly toward union with the sea. That civilization that is founded upstream in the river reaches its fullness downstream. No two rivers carry identical civilizations. Thus, after two rivers merge, their combined flow carries yet a third civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="105"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=105 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Take, for instance, a small example. In our Birbhum there are two very small rivers: the Kopa&#x301;i and the Vakreshvara. The flow of these two civilizations and cultures is nearly the same. The spoken language of the people who live on their banks is also almost the same. But notice, I say &lsquo;almost&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;the same&rsquo; because they are not identical. Afterwards, when they join each other in Mela&#x301;npur near Inda&#x301;sa village (the famous Indraha&#x301;sa from the Jain era) and become the Kuye river, then its accompanying civilization and culture becomes a little altered. The people who live on the banks of the Kuye river enjoy the blessings of both the Kopa&#x301;i and Vakreshvara rivers.<!-- /block --></p>

Their customs, behaviour, mode of living, and spoken language are the same but the Mandar hill, which is very near Dumka&#x301;, is situated on the Chandan river and thus the customs, comportment and language there is different than Dumka&#x301;&#146;s. Kandi is quite far from Dumka&#x301; but they are alike in all ways. Moreover, Ka&#x301;ndi is very close to Jangipur but Jangipur&#146;s culture is different; its spoken language is Shershahabad Bengali. You will find this kind of history with all rivers. The rivers of Rarh did not simply carry sand and alluvium to the sea, thereby making the Bengali plains, they also brought the verdant riches of civilization and culture to Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;After the rise of the Himalayas from the ocean, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers brought the flow of civilization and culture with the current of their waters. The Ganges brought the Indo-Aryan culture, but near Sahebganj, where the Ganges turns south, the Gaorhiya [a portion of Bengal] influence over the cultural life increased. Similarly, as the Brahmaputra reached the Assam valley near Sadiya there was a mixture of the Tibetan and Burmese civilizations. The triple mixture of these two with the Indo-Aryan gave rise to the Kamarupa civilization which a little downriver became transformed into the Bengali culture.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You have learned so much at such a young age!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->I looked and saw Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana&#146;s pen glittering on the table.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=114 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I also left my wristwatch beside it,&rdquo; said Mainjula&#x301;.

<a name="115"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=115 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I hope you&#146;re not feeling any inconvenience. If you do, you must let me know.

All this time I&#146;ve been busy trying to think of what might help you fall asleep quicker. You didn&#146;t really have a chance to eat, but it wasn&#146;t the right time to bring you food. After my duty is finished, I&#146;ll make you some breakfast and leave it in the car. You certainly have to eat on your way to Caopa&#x301;ran&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Of course, I have a strong attraction to the terrain of Gondwanaland,&rdquo; continued Mainjula&#x301;. &ldquo;But I feel more attraction for the different plants and wild animals of this area, in a word, the flora and fauna. In the laterite soil of this land you find mostly piya&#x301;l (piya&#x301;sha&#x301;l), pala&#x301;sh, kus&#x301;um, sha&#x301;l, and kendu trees. You also come across wild jackfruit, wild mango and custard-apple trees. Was the tree-life and different birds and beasts of this area the same during the end of the Pleiocene or beginning of the Meoiscene ages when ape-men first appeared?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Well keep in mind,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that the custard-apple trees you find here in the wild were brought by the Portuguese about 450 years ago. What do you know about pala&#x301;sh?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Well, looking at the colour of the flower and its qualities, it seems to me that rather than the three varieties we have nowadays, white, red and yellow, there was only the red variety. The tree was ten times taller than the pala&#x301;sh trees of today. The flowers were bright red but very big in size, and the fruits were quite small but sweet and juicy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Your thinking is correct,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;because there are more pala&#x301;sh trees in the eastern portion of Gondwanaland. Where rivers have more or less level land on both sides you get this red soil that the pala&#x301;sh tree favours. The interesting thing is that in all the river basins of that area, especially the Damodar, Ajaya, Ushri, Konar, Barakar, and the Mahanadii&#146;s central river basin, you get ample amounts of coal &ndash; high quality coal. The primary source of material for this coal is decomposed pala&#x301;sh trees. Those pala&#x301;sh trees were not like the pala&#x301;sh trees of today but they were the forefathers of today&#146;s pala&#x301;sh trees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The part of Gondwanaland in which we are now is more or less divided into east and west by the Koyel river. The difference between east and west is not only evidenced in the terrain, but also in the flora and fauna. I would guess that the western mountains that we now call the Vindhya and Sa&#x301;tpura&#x301; mountains were once much higher. They had peaks higher than the Himalayas. Flora and fauna could not evolve there in the ancient past due to excessive snowfall, but the eastern mountains, although very high and snow-capped, were not as high as the western mountains. It is likely that the first appearance in the world of both flora and fauna was here, in this area where we find our ancient Rarh and Jharkhanda. In the west, the melted ice ran into the Arabian Sea. Although there was water, the soil was unfertile, so there was little flora and naturally little fauna as well. But in the east, where the water from the melted snows became rivers, the cold was not so severe. So the first expression of developed life was in the land of Rarh &ndash; this we can be certain of.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Thus we find an abundance of prehistoric fossils in the eastern portion of the Ramgarh Hills, the Dalma&#x301; Hills, the Megha&#x301;sinii belt, and the southeast portion of the Rajmahal Hills (Pa&#x301;kud&#x301;a and Rajmahal sub-divisions). The small hills of Bankura District, especially the Shushuniya&#x301; Hills, are also an extension of this Ramgarh range. Fossils of various types of ancient animals have been found near these hills. Still, the greatest amount of fossils are lying in the areas closest to the Suvarn&#x301;arehka&#x301;, Kam&#x301;sa&#x301;vatii, and Damodara rivers. It is quite clear that the brontosaurus and other dinosaurs lived in this region. Rhinoceroses also used to roam the extremely high grasses of this area. Just two hundred years ago rhinoceroses were living in Birbhum and Kandi sub-division. Only 125 years ago rhinoceroses were spotted in Rajmahal and Pa&#x301;kurh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There were also huge birds of the phinge variety with loose, hanging tails. I would guess that the size of a single bird was about five or six feet. Their tales used to trail on the ground and the sabre-toothed tigers of that day used to catch them easily by stepping on their tails with their paws. But when the sabre-toothed tiger disappeared from Rarh about 700,000 years ago, these large-bodied birds also became extinct. The descendants of these huge birds, the phinge and doyel birds of today, are much smaller in size. The hyena (gova&#x301;gha&#x301;, hud&#x301;a&#x301;l, hud&#x301;a&#x301;r, or hun&#x301;da&#x301;r in rural Bengali; in Madhya Pradesh vighava&#x301;) of today is the descendant of this sabre-toothed tiger.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;In those ancient days there was a great deal of fighting between the ape-men and man-apes.

During the British era also, the Biirhorhs used to burn apes to death and eat them. They also had some attraction to cannibalism, however, there is no proof that they ever ate human beings.

<a name="130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph -->I continued. &ldquo;Near the high mountains of this Gondwanaland there were many huge pits. With the passage of time the mountains eroded and became large hills, then smaller hills, knolls and mounds. Today also, Rarh and Jharkhanda are full of these hills, hillocks and knolls. Thus the land is undulating. What is today the lowest portion of this undulating land was at one time deep pits. And the upper portions were very tall mountains. Although many large pits have filled up, not all of them have. In Rarhii Bengali they are called ka&#x301;ndar (from kandara in Sanskrit). Still there are a few very large pits.

As we were approaching Gobhi our car had to swerve to avoid getting hit by a truck and it fell in a huge gorge. Oh! If I think about it, even today, I lose consciousness. The last thing I heard was Niila&#x301;in&#x32D;jana crying &lsquo;Didi&rsquo;. I can still hear him. He was driving the car. We all fell in the gorge and were severely hurt but no one died.

But one or two hours after the accident some dacoits arrived and robbed us of all our possessions. They took my notebook and whatever money and other property we had with us, but they didn&#146;t bother to call a doctor or to try to save us by taking us to a hospital.

We found both Ha&#x301;riiti and Ma&#x301;riici in the Ks&#x301;uri river basin. One can deduce from this that in this part of Magadha both Buddhism and Jainism existed side by side. Whether as enemies or friends, they lived together.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="151"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=151 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;It may also be, moreover, that this river basin was the original centre of Mahayana Buddhism.

At one time, the river had a very sharp (ks&#x301;uradha&#x301;ra&#x301;vat), strong current. Thus in Sanskrit its name became ks&#x301;urika&#x301;. Later that became ks&#x301;uri in Bengali.

Thus ana&#x301;ha&#x301;ra means &ldquo;not eating carefully selected items&rdquo; &ndash; filling the stomach with worthless edibles. Hence ana&#x301;ha&#x301;ra and anashana are not identical. The meaning of upava&#x301;sa is completely opposite. Upa means &ldquo;near&rdquo;. Upava&#x301;sa means &ldquo;to stay in close proximity&rdquo;. Most of the year people are busy with matter.

If we mark off another line parallel to the equator, then that line is also called aks&#x301;a or aks&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;sha [latitude].

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)  Kuruka and the Muriya&#x301; and Ma&#x301;riya&#x301; languages in the southwestern portion of the Ora&#x301;no area of Gondwanaland, are part of the Dravidian group, although they still show significant Austric influence. There is, moreover, a clear influence of Bengali in their very close neighbour, the Ha&#x301;lavi language. In these languages the Dravidian influence is also quite clear, but by comparison, the Austric influence is much greater.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn6">6</a></b>)   Biir means &ldquo;forest&rdquo;. Hor&#x301; means &ldquo;man&rdquo;. Biirhor&#x301; means &ldquo;forest-man&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn7">7</a></b>)  Many people mistakenly say ra&#x301;jagrha. This is incorrect. If the word had been ra&#x301;jagrha then in modern Magahii its name would have become ra&#x301;jaghara. Rather the word is ra&#x301;jagiri or &ldquo;royal mountain&rdquo;. Ra&#x301;jagira was not only the ancient capital of Magadha, it was its cultural centre as well, the crown jewel of Magadha civilization. For that reason I have said many times that the spoken language of Ra&#x301;jagira should be accepted as standard Magahii.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn8">8</a></b>)   The river flows just past Nawada station.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn9">9</a></b>)  Near Sametashikhara is the combined border of Rarh, Magadha, and Jharkhanda. Of course, in the &ldquo;Jha&#x301;d&#x301;akhan&#x301;d&#x301;e Vaedyana&#x301;thah&rdquo; Shloka a slightly different opinion is expressed but there is no historical evidence to support that opinion; both Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a Mountain and Cakravartii Mountain are historically in Magadha.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn10"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn10">10</a></b>)  In those days a lamp was hung on the wall which was used both in the cities and in the villages during British rule. They used to spill less oil than the hurricane lanterns but they were inconvenient to move from one place to another. Some people used to call them deya&#x301;lgiis.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn11"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn11">11</a></b>)  During British rule the house-servants used to address the daughters of the house as mishiba&#x301;ba&#x301;. Most probably the word was created by joining the word &ldquo;miss&rdquo; to the respectful word ba&#x301;ba&#x301;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn12"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn12">12</a></b>)  In the Magahii language, the banyan tree is called bar&#x301;ke rukh. At one time yaks&#x301;a [a mythological race of demons] worship used to be performed at the foot of the banyan tree. The people used to have both devotion and fear for that place. Even today people do not go there alone after dark. That place is called &ldquo;the abode of Brahma&rdquo;.</p>
