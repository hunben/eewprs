<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The entire expression of this Universe is vibrational. Whenever there is vibration, there is sound, there is colour. So whatever you see or whatever you feel has an inference or inferences that come in contact with your sensory or motor organs &ndash; has some sound. You see, when you are moving, you are walking, a particular sound &ndash; <i>t&#x301;ak, t&#x301;ak, kat&#x301;, kat&#x301;</i> &ndash; is created. That particular sound, sound representing an action, is called &ldquo;acoustic root&rdquo; &ndash; in Sanskrit, <i>biija mantra</i>. There is a sound just to represent the spirit of that being, of that deed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->While you sit you are doing something, that is, your respiratory organ is functioning. When a man is dead, the physical body also does something, though it is done not by that man but as per the direction of the Supreme Entity that controls matter, that controls the inanimate objects of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Similarly, some of those sounds are audible to us, some are inaudible. Certain waves of short length or of very long wavelength cannot be understood or are not audible to us.  Similarly, there are waves and colours, and each and every existence has its own colour. That colour or those colours may or may not be visible, but the colours are there. These are ocular roots, in Sanskrit <i>varn&#x301;a matrka&#x301;,</i> or &ldquo;colour matrix&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So all these inferences come within the scope of the word <i>sarva</i> in Sanskrit. The sound <i>sa</i> represents the sentient principle, and due to the effect of the sentient principle the feeling of existence comes. There is no bondage, but there is the feeling of existence; no particular location, but just the feeling of existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And in the word <i>sarva</i> there are three sounds. The second one is <i>ra; ra</i> represents energy, all sorts of energies. And what is energy? Energy is the released force of the creative principle. And when this energy gets bottled up, it is matter.  So the sound <i>ra</i> represents energy. The third sound, <i>va,</i> represents special wonts, the special qualities or characteristics. I said nothing is unimportant in this world, because each and every entity has its peculiar wonts, peculiar qualifications. Nobody is inferior to others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><i>Sa-ra-va</i> means that the sentient principle creating the feeling of existence is there; the energy is there; and the special characteristics are there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now the sentient principle cannot function, and the energy cannot function, and the characteristics cannot function, without the support of an intellectual force, intellectual entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There is electricity. But without the help of the human intellect it cannot be properly utilized. Similarly, the sentient principle, the crude energies, and the many characteristics of so many articles, so many entities, become meaningless if they do not get the support of the Supreme intellect. But here, in the case of the Supreme intellect, we will not use the word &ldquo;intellect&rdquo;, we will use the word &ldquo;intuition&rdquo;. What is the fundamental difference between intellect and intuition? Intellect is an ectoplasmic function, but intuition is above the periphery of the ectoplasm. It is the flow of the Cognitive Principle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> the Supreme Cognitive Principle, is within each and every expression. He may be in the desert, He may be in the ocean. He may be, say, on top of a high mountain. Wherever you go, the <i>sa, ra</i> and <i>va,</i> the sentient principle, the energy, and the special characteristics are there. So <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is also there, because He is the intuitional support of these functions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->A man may or may not be highly educated, may or may not be an intellectual, but he has these three requisite factors in him; that is why <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is always with him. He is with his physical body, with his ectoplasmic body, and with his spirit also. So a man, an expression, is never alone, can never be alone, because if anything is alone it cannot function. To function it requires the support of the supreme intuition, and this supreme intuition is the Noumenal Entity for all individual and collective phenomenal expressions. You must remember this fact.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now in the individual capacity, so many works are done by so many people, but from where do they take the energy? &ldquo;I have done this, I have done that.&rdquo; But to do, one requires energy; is that energy the person&#146;s individual one, is that energy created by him? No, man cannot create anything. Man cannot create any original entity. What a man can do, he can create physical mixtures and chemical compounds with the elements he gets from the universe, the elements created by <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. So a man is never the actional faculty; the actional faculty in him is His; and not only that, He is the Supreme shelter of everything.  A man cannot be the shelter. <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> is the shelter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->For example, this city of Stockholm is sheltered in the country of Sweden. Sweden is a bigger space than the city of Stockholm.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> This country of Sweden is sheltered in the continent of Europa, whose shelter is this planet earth; the shelter of this planet earth<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  is the solar system, and the shelter of this solar system is the Cosmological Order. And this Cosmological Order is nothing but an internal psychic<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  projection of <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. So He is the Supreme Shelter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And not only that. Because of His intuitional entity&#146;s presence in each and every expression, He witnesses everything. Nothing is secret for Him. You may think that those<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> affairs, those things that I did, perhaps <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> did not see those. [laughter] &ldquo;He is so busy in so many works, perhaps He neglected it.&rdquo; No, He sees everything, because it is His duty to see. He sees, but it does not mean that He hates. Because He sees, but He has sympathy for each and every expression. Why? Because each and every expression is an emanated expression of His cordiality. So each and every expression is an object of affection for Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->A bad man is a misguided son of <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. A father must have,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and actually a father has got, immense love for all his children. Son or daughter, good boy or bad boy; but when a son or a daughter is misguided, he wants that he or she should come to the proper way, he or she should resort to the proper path. This is the [[difference]].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  It is His duty to see that everyone moves towards the Supreme Goal, towards the Supreme Desideratum.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  And He is always ready to help anybody and everybody; and He helps, and He will be helping in future, because it is His only [duty]. And for the created beings, their only duty is to move along the path of beatitude shown by the Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->So in the case of <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> and His progeniture, the love is mutual. He loves His progeniture not for the purpose of getting love from the progeniture. But in the case of the progeniture, it is just the reverse.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> [[So I say it is mutual.]] Suppose He says, &ldquo;No, from this very moment I will not love My creation,&rdquo; then and there the creation will cease to function. Because the movement starts from love, the movement resides on love, and the movement finally goeth back to love. So I said love is mutual.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->And when His progeny sing <i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; na&#x301;m kevalam</i> openly, He sings <i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; na&#x301;m kevalam</i> secretly. Because the Progenitor is the nearest and dearest one for the progeny, hence the progeny also is the nearest and dearest one for the Supreme Progenitor. Both are <i>ba&#x301;ba&#x301;</i> to each other and one another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The entire creation is the creation of that Singular Entity. So everybody comes from a very high family, a very noble family. Nobody is unimportant.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn9"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn9">9</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Nobody deserves hatred.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Sarve&#146;tra sukhinah bhavantu sarve santu nira&#x301;maya&#x301;h;<br>Sarve bhadra&#x301;n&#x301;i pashyantu na kashcid duhkhama&#x301;pnuya&#x301;t.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Let everybody be happy; let everybody be free from all psychic ailments; let everybody see the bright side of everything; let nobody suffer from [any trouble under pressure of circumstances].&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
