<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the earlier span, while explaining the root meaning of the word &ldquo;Bha&#x301;rata&rdquo;,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> I said the root verb tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. Now, the practical approach, that is, the actual spiritual endeavour, actual spiritual practice, is called Tantra. Here also the root verb is tan. Tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;, and tra means &ldquo;liberator&rdquo;. The cult that liberates the spiritual aspirant by helping him in expanding his mind and spirit is Tantra, &ldquo;liberation through expansion&rdquo;. Unless and until the mind becomes great, one cannot get liberation, one cannot attain spiritual salvation. That&#146;s why the spiritual cult is called Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now, this expansion, this expansion of mind, expansion of ideas, expansion of human spirit, is the<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  only sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And when a sa&#x301;dhaka, a spiritual aspirant, tries to enlarge his mind, naturally debasing forces become very active. The depraving forces, debasing forces, become very active, and the sa&#x301;dhaka is to enlarge his mind and spirit by fighting at each and every step, each and every stage of life. In his mind there will be those two belligerent forces; that is, the spiritual force and the debasing material force will start fighting amongst each other in the mind. In family life also,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in social life, in national life, in each and every stratum of life, there will be fight. That is, those two fundamental belligerent forces will become active. One force will try to exalt you towards the Supreme Self, another force will want to degrade you, goad you towards crude materialism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now, a Tantric is called, a sa&#x301;dhaka is called, a soldier. [Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;samara] [&ldquo;the battle of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;&rdquo;]. Samara means &ldquo;war&rdquo;, &ldquo;battle&rdquo;, &ldquo;fight&rdquo;. The sa&#x301;dhaka is engaged in fight. It is for the brave, it is for courageous people. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;samara. And this cult is the cult of Tantra. He who wants to keep himself away from fight is unknowingly committing suicide, mental and spiritual suicide. Each and every man should be ready for fight &ndash; fight in the mental stratum, fight in the family stratum, fight in each and every stratum of life. This is Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, in the realm of spirituality there is little scope for theoreticians. It is ninety-nine per cent practical. Sa&#x301;dhaka means a practical man. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is a cult, not a theory. Now, what is this cult? Now, this cult is subjective movement through objective adjustment. Here we see regarding your indriyas, that is, the motor and sensory organs, that this world is the object and they are the subjects. But when the relationship between the indriyas and the citta [objective mind, mind-stuff] is concerned, the indriyas are the objects and the citta is the subject. And when the relationship of citta and<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the ego, or aham, is concerned, the citta is the object, and the aham is the subject. Now in the case of aham and mahat (aham means doer &ldquo;I&rdquo; and mahat means pure &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;), the aham is the object and the mahat &ndash; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; &ldquo;I exist,&rdquo; aham asmi &ndash; is the subject. And in case of this pure &ldquo;I&rdquo; and the a&#x301;tman [soul], this &ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I exist,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am&rdquo; &ndash; is the object and the a&#x301;tman is the subject.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I exist&rdquo; &ndash; this feeling exists within each and every living being. In every being there is an &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I am Narayanaswami, I belong to Salem, I exist.&rdquo; So this &ldquo;I&rdquo;, this &ldquo;I-exist&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo;, is the mahat. And you know &ndash; you know &ndash; that there is a feeling of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; in you. And I know that there is a feeling of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; in me. This &ldquo;I know&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I know&rdquo; &ndash; is the a&#x301;tman. The &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I know&rdquo; is the a&#x301;tman, and the &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; is the mahat, the mahattattva, the pure mental &ldquo;I&rdquo;, the supreme mental &ldquo;I&rdquo;, the subtlest part of the mind. But &ldquo;I know I exist&rdquo; &ndash; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I know&rdquo; &ndash; is the a&#x301;tman. It is not mind, it is the knower of mind, knower of &ndash; what? The feeling that &ldquo;I exist.&rdquo; So the a&#x301;tman is the subject within your structure, within your existence. Within the realm of the microcosm, the a&#x301;tman is the subject, and all other objects are either its direct object or its indirect objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now regarding the relationship of a&#x301;tman and Parama&#x301;tman, the a&#x301;tman is the object and the Parama&#x301;tman is the subject. So Parama&#x301;tman is the Supreme Subjectivity. He is the Supreme Subject of all other subjects. He is the supreme multiple of all other expressed multiplicities. Because He is the supreme &ndash; in Sanskrit &ldquo;supreme&rdquo; is parama &ndash; He is known as Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. He is the Supreme Subject.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->I said: &ldquo;What is cult?&rdquo; It is subjective approach, that is, your movement is towards that Supreme Subject, not towards bookish knowledge. Not to aggrandize yourself, but to goad yourself unto the path of beatitude, towards the Supreme Subject. Hence the approach of cult is a subjective approach. Yours is a subjective approach. But while moving towards the Supreme Subject, while moving towards the Terminus of your life, while moving towards the culminating point of your life, you have to pass through the world of objectivities. You are born; the things of this physical earth are all objectivities; but your march is towards the Supreme Subjectivity. So in you there must be an equilibrium, a balance, an equipoise, between subjective approach and objective adjustment. You must pass through this world of objects keeping a close contact and a balance<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> with this objective world; you must not ignore this world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->You must not neglect this world, you must not cheat yourself by saying that everything is illusory, it is nothing. No, it is not nothing, it is something. When you are speaking these words with the help of physical energy, then that physical energy is also nothing, and when you say, &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; then that &ldquo;It is nothing&rdquo; is also nothing. Because you are speaking with the help of energy. But energy is nothing, vocal cord is nothing, sound is nothing, so your utterance is also nothing. So a sa&#x301;dhaka must not cheat himself by saying this. A sa&#x301;dhaka must not engage in a self-cheating business. His should be a clear-cut approach, a subjective approach through objective adjustment. So this is the supreme path. It is the proper path. It is <i>the</i> path. You have got nothing to do with the intellectual extravaganza of so-called logicians and philosophers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Yudhisthira said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->He said: Shrut[ayo] vibhinna&#x301;h. What is shruti? Shruti means &ldquo;spiritual book&rdquo; &ndash; the Vedas. Why shruti? Because in ancient times the Aryans who came here to India from central Asia were illiterate, they couldn&#146;t write. Their language, the Vedic language, was a spoken language, not a written language.  There was no script.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The Vedic language had no script. When they came here they learned how to write.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And finally so many Indian scripts have developed.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Those who composed Vedic hymns were called rs&#x301;is. Whatever the rs&#x301;is uttered, the disciple, the student, learned through the ear. The ear was called shruti in Sanskrit. That&#146;s why the Vedas are known as shruti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now, Shrut[ayo] vibhinna&#x301;h. Yudhisthira, wise Yudhisthira, said: Shrut[ayo] vibhinna&#x301;h &ndash; &ldquo;These shrutis &ndash; the Rgveda, the Yajurveda, the Atharvaveda and so many other spiritual scriptures &ndash; differ from each other, differ from one another.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn9"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn9">9</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> They differ from one another.

<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Shrut[ayo] vibhinna&#x301;h smrtayo vibhinna&#x301;h. Smrti means &ldquo;social code&rdquo;. Shruti means &ldquo;spiritual code&rdquo; and smrti means &ldquo;social code&rdquo;. So social codes also vary from one another. In ancient times there was Vya&#x301;sa Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn10"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn10">10</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> There was the Na&#x301;rada Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;. There was the Manu Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;. In the Manu Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;, there are two main schools, Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga and Mita&#x301;ks&#x301;ara&#x301;: Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga for Bengal, Mita&#x301;ks&#x301;ara&#x301; for the rest of India.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn11"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn11">11</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Somewhere there is patrilineal order &ndash; that is, the father&#146;s property will be inherited by the son &ndash; and somewhere there is matrilineal order.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn12"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn12">12</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Somewhere there is a mixture of patrilineal order<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn13"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn13">13</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and matrilineal order.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn14"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn14">14</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And somewhere there is a blending of patrilineal and matrilineal order.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn15"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn15">15</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So social codes vary from one another.

<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Naekamuniryasya matam&#x301; na bhinnam &ndash; &ldquo;and each and every muni varies from other munis.&rdquo; Muni means &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;. In the realm of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, Na munirdughdaba&#x301;lakah munih sam&#x301;liinama&#x301;nasah [&ldquo;A muni is not a small child at his mother&#146;s breast, a muni is one who has merged his mind (in the Supreme)&rdquo;]. If a particular man says, &ldquo;I am a muni,&rdquo; he is not a muni. Muni means &ldquo;he who has ensconced his personality, ensconced his everything, in the supreme stance.&rdquo; That is, he who has merged himself in the Supreme Purus&#x301;a is a muni. Munih sam&#x301;liinama&#x301;nasah &ndash; &ldquo;He who has merged his mind in the Supreme Purus&#x301;a is a muni.&rdquo; Naekamuniryasya matam&#x301; na bhinnam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So whom to follow? What is to be done by common people? What is to be done by spiritual aspirants? Whom to follow? It is a very difficult problem.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Now, Yudhisthira says: Dharmasya tattvam&#x301; nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;ya&#x301;m &ndash; &ldquo;The spirit of dharma, the essence of dharma&rdquo; &ndash; [nihitam&#x301;] &ndash; &ldquo;lies covert in&rdquo; &ndash; nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;ya&#x301;m. In Sanskrit the word guha&#x301; has got two imports, two meanings.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn18"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn18">18</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> One is &ldquo;cave&rdquo; &ndash; caves of the Himalayas where the rs&#x301;is used to sit in meditation. Another meaning of guha&#x301;, which I just now mentioned, is mahattattva, &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; This feeling of &ldquo;I am&rdquo; is called guha&#x301;. Now, [Yudhisthira] says: &ldquo;The essence of dharma, the supreme spirit of dharma, lies covert in your own &lsquo;I&rsquo; feeling.&rdquo; You have not to go to the caves of the Himalayas and to so many tiirthas [places of pilgrimage] in search of your own inner spirit. It lies covert within yourself. Your heart is the best tiirtha. It is the supreme tiirtha. Lord Shiva said:<!-- /block --></p>
