<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In ancient society, men and women had equal rights. Later, when some distinguished women such as Gargii, Maetreyii and others excelled their male counterparts in intellect, learning, humanity and power of contemplation, a group of male conspirators started curtailing their rights one after another in order to engender an inferiority complex in their minds. In the varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama [caste] system, women and Shu&#x301;dras as groups were segregated. That was a dark chapter in human history indeed. Human beings conspired against their fellow humans to deprive them of their legitimate human rights. It can be said that the seeds of exploitation, imperialism and colonialism were sown at that time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Long before that, weaving was done mostly by women because the capacity to care for minute detail which is so essential for handiwork is found more in women than men. Even today weaving is done by women in many parts of the world. Obviously, when women became segregated, then weaving, too, as a hobby or profession came to be considered inferior. All this happened due to the conspiracies of a few men. Usually people indulge in such acts to revenge themselves on others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This phrase, &ldquo;revenge oneself&rdquo;, reminds me of a story &ndash; the story of how King Ballal Sen revenged himself on the Suvarna Vanik [merchants] of Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The royal treasury of Bengal was controlled by a handful wealthy merchants. Their principal centre was Suvarnagram. King Ballal Sen was given to much pomp and luxury and was a man of lecherous nature. His son, Laksman Sen, was extremely unhappy with his father. King Ballal Sen often demanded more and more funds from the treasury. Since it was the king&#146;s order, the merchants could not object. But later, when the economy was being terribly affected and still the king did not keep his promises to return the funds, they spoke to Prince Laksman Sen. Through him they conveyed to the king that if he continued to draw funds from the royal treasury, the country&#146;s economy would meet with disaster. King Ballal Sen was enraged by the merchants&#146; wise advice. He vindictively retaliated and declared the whole community of Suvarna Vaniks &ndash; well-educated, intelligent and talented men &ndash; as outcastes. Thus he revenged himself against them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the same way, a section of selfish men curtailed women&#146;s rights and hatched a conspiracy against women and Shu&#x301;dras to keep them downtrodden and under their feet forever.<!-- /block --></p>
