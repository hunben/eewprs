<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In our philosophical treatise, A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram, it has been enunciated, Bha&#x301;va bha&#x301;va&#x301;tiitayoh setuh Ta&#x301;rakabrahma &ndash; &ldquo;The common point bridging together the empirical state of Sagun&#x301;a and the metempirical state of Nirgun&#x301;a is called Ta&#x301;raka Brahma.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In Brahma Cakra (the collective name of sain&#x32D;cara and pratisain&#x32D;cara<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->) there is no uniformity of flow. The speed of the sentient force is greater than that of the mutative, and the mutative has more speed than the static. Thus in the beginning of sain&#x32D;cara the speed is greater. Similarly, after elevation, under the influence of the sentient force or reaching sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya deha (a stage beyond the hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a [subtle causal mind] where the unit mind experiences only the sentient force), the speed is greater. The speed of the unit mind far exceeds the normal flow in the Cosmos, and it gets accelerated if the unit mind as a result of spiritual practice tends itself towards the Nucleus Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Since the beginning of creation humans have been aspiring for this merger with the Nucleus Consciousness. The non-uniformity of speed changes the movement of the unit mind to an elliptical force, and the motion changes to oval from circular.&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[In Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or in Ananda Marga sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one whose goal is Purus&#x301;ottama (Nucleus Consciousness) merges in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (Qualified Supreme Entity), and one who aims at Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma (Non-Qualified Supreme Entity)] get[s] out of this Brahma Cakra by a tangential touch. At this point of tangential touch is the abode of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma (who resides within the scope of both Nirgun&#x301;a and Sagun&#x301;a Brahma). Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is a concept of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Tantra the whole creation is known as sambhu&#x301;ti. When Ta&#x301;raka Brahma by His own will takes the help of the five fundamental factors (the pain&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tas), His physical entity comes within the scope of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, otherwise He is Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. When Ta&#x301;raka Brahma takes the assistance of the five fundamental factors, according to Tantra it is called His Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti.&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Sagun&#x301;a Brahma has infinite sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta], and so for an infinite time to come Sagun&#x301;a Brahma will continue to enjoy the fruit of Its own past actions. Nirgun&#x301;a is the Objectless Entity with no action or derivation, but Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is the middle point and can fulfil the function of both. He guides, loves and favours His affectionate sons and daughters. His children say that He cannot live without loving them [and with deepest reverence and complete surrender proceed to Him]. (Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti, &ldquo;A&#x301;tman, Parama&#x301;tman and Sa&#x301;dha&#x301;na&#x301;&rdquo; in Idea and Ideology, 1993)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When Does He Appear?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->He comes on earth when there is too much sin and it is difficult for virtuous people to live on this earth. When dharma declines and adharma, or sin, gets the upper hand; when the virtuous and the pious are tortured and the dishonest and evil-doers tyrannize over the good; in a word, when the human intellect is guided along degraded and destructive channels; Ta&#x301;raka Brahma forms a desire to come on earth with a specific mission of restoring dharma by launching a ceaseless fight against all injustice and sin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There are a few notable criteria by which to distinguish Ta&#x301;raka Brahma from other maha&#x301;purus&#x301;as: <ol> <li>He Himself is a born guru and has no spiritual guru. <li>He comes with a specific mission, which is to restore morality and dharma. The entire society becomes divided between moralists and immoralists. A fight between them is inevitable, and ultimately dharma comes out victorious. <li>His emergence means a new era of white peace and dharma. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->He needs no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but just to set an example to others, He performs sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; with the masses.<!-- /block --></p>
