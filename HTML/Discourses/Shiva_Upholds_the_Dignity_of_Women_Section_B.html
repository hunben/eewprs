<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This Shaeva Dharma became the essential dharma of India. In this dharma no one was ignored neither the non-Aryans nor the women nor the untouchables.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the Vedic Age, women as a class were neglected and treated as mere commodities of enjoyment; whereas in the age of Shiva they were proclaimed as a class of mothers. As the influence of Shiva was comparatively great in Bengal, there we still find the custom of addressing unknown ladies as Ma&#x301; [&ldquo;Mother&rdquo;]. In Bengali, aunts are called ma&#x301;sima&#x301; [mother&#146;s sister], pishima&#x301; [father&#146;s sister], etc.; that is, the word ma&#x301; is respectfully added when addressing women. And as the matriarchal system is still prevalent in Bengal to some extent, there the women are not altogether separated from the father&#146;s lineage. After marriage their gotra changes, no doubt, but they still have some relation with their father&#146;s lineage. For this reason a nephew, a sister&#146;s son, inherits the properties of his maternal uncle if he dies without heirs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Shaeva Dharma is the dharma for attaining Parama Purus&#x301;a, and thus there is no external ritual in it. It does not enjoin any ritualistic offering of ghee, or any sacrifice of animals&#146; blood in yajin&#x32D;a; it is not a path of self-gratification. The followers of Shaeva Dharma proclaimed in a thundering voice that dharma is the path leading to supreme attainment not the path of animal enjoyment.<!-- /block --></p>
