<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Q. 1.  Why is happiness sought for?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Citta or mind is governed by the collection of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. When mind is under the influence of a set of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras it can remain in that mental tendency for a long period.  Happiness is derived from being able to remain in a particular tendency or form for a long period.  For instance, a mind under the influence of evil Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras is happy only when evil talk is taking place; such a mind will find itself ill at ease in other environments. In other words, a mind which [[is]] under the influence of evil Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras can exist freely only in evil company; it will feel suffocated in other company and will try to return to that evil company where alone it finds happiness.  It is thus evident that happiness can be derived only in such circumstances which are conducive to its collection of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  To exist in any other set of circumstances is not only undesirable but also not even possible; for the set of circumstances which impart happiness are indeed necessary for existence.  The mind desires a particular environment to make its existence possible.  Since the existence of mind in any other form not in keeping with its collection of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, is not possible thus the mind seeks happiness to preserve its very existence.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Dharma is different from the English word &ldquo;religion&rdquo; or the Urdu &ldquo;Mazhab&rdquo; which means a system of faith of worship.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Dharma means property or characteristics.  It is derived from the Sanskrit root dhr + man: The verb form is dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a, to hold and the noun is Dharma, that which &ldquo;holds&rdquo; an entity in existence.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Q. 3.  What is Svabha&#x301;va?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Svabha&#x301;va is derived from the Sanskrit root: sva (&ldquo;own&rdquo;) + bha&#x301;va (&ldquo;idea&rdquo;).  Svabha&#x301;va therefore, means one&#146;s own ideas can only be formed in the mind, therefore the Svabha&#x301;va of a person can be only psychic and not physical.  The mind is influenced by various factors, primarily inborn or imposed Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  The Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of different individuals are different and so is their Svabha&#x301;va.  Svabha&#x301;va is one&#146;s own psychic creation, it is the habit or nature of an individual. Svabha&#x301;va unlike Dharma, is different in different individuals and undergoes change, while Dharma is unchanging and is a property common to one and all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Q. 4.  Why is Moks&#x301;a necessary?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Ans.  A&#x301;tman is a pure consciousness with no property or characteristic except that of knowing the existence of Prakrti, the creative Principle.  A&#x301;tman cannot perform any function by itself, rather Prakrti which creates Ma&#x301;nas or mind reflects its actions on the A&#x301;tman. [[The a&#x301;tman is not affected by any of the actions of mind or Prakrti. It only witnesses what the mind is doing; the mind&#146;s actions are reflected in it like reflections in a mirror.]] Just as a red flower placed in front of a mirror makes the mirror look red without affecting the mirror, similarly the actions of mind which form the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are reflected on the a&#x301;tman which remains unaffected (anupahata).  It is according to these sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras that the individual mind or jiivabha&#x301;va is created by Prakrti.  Prakrti in Its form of dormancy in cosmic consciousness or Brahma is called Mu&#x301;la&#x301; Prakrti.  When It becomes active and starts influencing the cosmic consciousness and transmuting it into Sagun&#x301;a Brahma.  Prakrti creates the following eight forms: 1. Mu&#x301;la Prakrti, 2. Mahattattva, 3. Aham&#x301;tattva, 4-8. Pain&#x32D;ca Bhu&#x301;ta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->When Prakrti is dormant in cosmic consciousness, no indriyas (sense or motor organs) exist, for cosmic consciousness is infinite or ananta and there is nothing beyond or outside It for which the indriyas are required.  In Sagun&#x301;a Brahma therefore, the seven Praka&#x301;ra of Prakrti form the Antahkaran&#x301;a while in the A&#x301;tman or unit consciousness only the mahattattva and ahamtattva form the antahkaran&#x301;a; the rest form vahihkaran&#x301;a.  When the a&#x301;tman is influenced by Prakrti it becomes vikrta or distorted, and the eight forms become sixteen in number, called sodas&#x301;a vikrti: the Citta (antahkaran&#x301;a vahihkanan&#x301;a), the ten indriyas, and the five tanmantras.  These sixteen forms of jiivabha&#x301;va or unit consciousness plus the eight of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma and the one combinedly form twenty five tattvas or factors.  The citta is a common factor for both the unit and the cosmic consciousness. The function of the citta in the cosmic consciousness is purely internal (antahkaran&#x301;ika).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->It is due to this vikrti or distortion in the a&#x301;tman that the mind or jiivabha&#x301;va is formed.  The a&#x301;tman is in fact in bondage due to this vikrti and desires to escape from it.  The a&#x301;tman has to perform Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but it cannot perform any function by itself; hence it has to seek some a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra or base through which it can perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.  A&#x301;tman can only give inspiration or prerana&#x301; as it is not capable of performing any function without the help of Prakrti, although the desire to seek freedom from the bondage of its vikrti is very great.  Jiivabha&#x301;va is created by Prakrti in the process of metamorphosis from crude to subtle. Jiivabha&#x301;va is capable of experiencing both duhkha and sukha (grief and happiness).  This characteristic or property of experiencing duhkha or sukha makes it dissatisfied with its present position. It is created by Prakrti and is thus under the influence of Prakrti; yet it tries to escape from the influence of Prakrti, not knowing that Prakrti is its creator, and escaping Her influence would mean destroying Prakrti and also itself with Her.  A&#x301;tman gives the inspiration and the mind perform the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of struggling against Prakrti.  Since both the a&#x301;tman or consciousness and the mind are in bondage and dissatisfied with their position they find it necessary to strive for moks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Q. 5.  Why a&#x301;tman is called Citi-Shakti?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Ans.  A&#x301;tman is incapable of performing any function by itself, but is called citishakti or force of consciousness.  The a&#x301;tman or consciousness can only provide inspiration or prerana&#x301;; that is the only action it can perform without the help of Prakrti and while under the influence of Prakrti.  That is the only contribution of a&#x301;tman towards the endeavour to free itself from the bondage of Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->How does the a&#x301;tman give inspiration?  The a&#x301;tman is compared to a magnet and the mind to iron; the a&#x301;tman attracts the mind towards itself like a magnet.  The attraction makes the mind struggle against Prakrti and strive to merge with a&#x301;tman.  The inspiration that the a&#x301;tman gives to mind is the form of this attraction.  The question therefore arises that if the a&#x301;tman is like a magnet and the mind like a piece of iron, why should the mind not be always attracted towards a&#x301;tman &ndash; and why should it be necessary for mind to struggle in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to escape the influence of Prakrti?  The mind is not always attracted towards a&#x301;tman only due to its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  If a piece of iron is full of impurities it will not be attracted by the magnet, or even if it is attracted, it will move towards it only very slowly, depending on the degree of impurity in it.  The mind of an individual is constituted according to the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of the person.  If the influence of the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras on the mind is very great it will not be much attracted by the a&#x301;tman and the inspiration that the a&#x301;tman will be able to give to the mind will be limited only to making the mind aware of the need to fight against its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  The sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras in a mind are created by Tamogun&#x301;a because sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, like Tamogun&#x301;a, are static. When the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of mind are so great that the mind itself becomes dominated by Tamogun&#x301;a, there the inspiration from a&#x301;tman is not able to do anything and the mind goes on working under the influence of Prakrti.  Since the contribution of a&#x301;tman in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to attract the mind towards itself, this attraction can only be completely successful if the mind is free from sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  But the a&#x301;tman is not able to make the mind free of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras as it has no power to work.  The freedom from sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras has to be obtained by the mind itself.  The sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or the struggle against Prakrti, the mind seeks to free itself from the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which are created by the tamogun&#x301;ii influence by Prakrti.  The mind&#146;s role in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; therefore, is limited only to the effort to remove all sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  This effort is inspired by the power of attraction of the a&#x301;tman, it is because of this force of consciousness that the a&#x301;tman is called Citi Shakti.  The other name of the a&#x301;tman besides Citishakti are; Purus&#x301;a, Caetanya and Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Q. 6.  Why did the Supreme Consciousness create the universe?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma has no qualities but the influence of Prakrti transforms some portion of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma into Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, that is, having qualities.  Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma is not devoid of Prakrti nor is Prakrti outside It, for It is Ananta there is nothing beyond or outside It. Prakrti remains in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma in the form of Mu&#x301;la Prakrti, in a latent or dormant stage and like the power of germination in the seed of a plant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->When Mu&#x301;la Prakrti becomes active in the infinite Sagun&#x301;a Brahma it manifests itself into the following eight Praka&#x301;ras: Mu&#x301;la Prakrti, Mahattattva, Vyoma (ether), Va&#x301;yu (air), Agni (fire), Jala (water) and Prthivii (earth). Mu&#x301;la Prakrti, although manifesting itself in these forms remains as Mu&#x301;la Prakrti in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. These manifestations of Prakrti are from subtle to crude; and the final manifestation Prthivii is the ultimate in crudeness, since it includes the qualities of all the other forms.  In other words there is no further stage of crudeness which the Prakrti can adopt in its manifestation from subtlety to crudity.  It should be clarified here that all these manifestations of Prakrti are within Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, which is also infinite or ananta.  Since there cannot be anything beyond or outside Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, all these manifestations take place within It.  These manifestations, except Mu&#x301;la Prakrti, of which these are the different forms, are called antahkarana of Brahma as they all function with It only and have contact with anything outside.  However the antahka&#x301;rana in the unit consciousness comprises two vikrti only, mahattattva and ahamttattva; the rest are vahihkarana or outside.  In both the individual and the Cosmic mind the citta is the portion of mind where the thought waves occur; thus all the cruder manifestations of Prakrti occur as thought waves in the citta of Brahma.  The universe is thus created in the Citta of Brahma as thought waves of It, imagination (Kalpana&#x301;), proceed from subtle to crude, from Vyoma or ether to Prthvii or earth.  As stated above, Prthvii is the crudest manifestation, and thus there is no scope for these thought waves to adopt any cruder metamorphosis; the only course left for them is to go back to their source.  The crude thought waves therefore embark on their journey and have to pass through more or less the same stages through which they passed on their original journey from subtle to crude.  This portion of the cycle of thought waves in their return journey is completed through the different forms of unit beings from solid matter to plant life, from plant life to animal life, from animal life to human beings and finally back to the cosmic consciousness again.  It thus seems that there would be a time when all the thought waves will come to an end, when they will all return to their source.  Such a time can only come when Sagun&#x301;a Brahma attains moks&#x301;a (Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi).  In fact, Sagun&#x301;a Brahma would have attained nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi long ago, but due to the presence of tamagun&#x301;ii citta, Its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which are the result of tamogun&#x301;a have not been completely exhausted, and hence the cycle of thought waves continues as long as the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are not completely exhausted, their result (pra&#x301;rabdha) will have to be undergone.  The creation and maintenance of the universe is nothing but the requital or bhoga of the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Q. 7.  Which of the three qualities &ndash; Sattvagun&#x301;a, Ragogun&#x301;a or Tamagun&#x301;a &ndash; is predominant in Brahma?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Ans.  The whole universe is created by the Brahma manas or cosmic mind.  When the unit beings were created from the cosmic mind the practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; was given to them to free themselves from bondage.  The idea of the cosmic thought waves to inspire the unit being to perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for the upliftment of all, can only come from a source in which a Sattvagun&#x301;a, the sentient principle predominates.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Brahma attracts all entities towards itself.  This attraction, too, is with the intention of liberating all beings.  Brahma created minds in the unit beings to enable them to perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.  The mind has the characteristic of taking the form of its object.  If the mind did not possess this characteristic then its attraction for Brahma would not have been of any use; It is this dharma or characteristic of the mind and its attraction for Brahma, that ultimately helps it to attain liberation.  Brahma does all this only for the welfare of all; the thought waves of Brahma by which the mind in unit beings is evolved, in the unit beings have only the intention of doing good to all.  Only that entity in which Sattvagun&#x301;a predominates can perform actions for the welfare of all; thus Brahma cannot have any other quality but Sattvagun&#x301;a as its predominant quality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->These thought waves of Brahma are unending and the cycle of these waves goes on without a break.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Citation"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->&ndash;The Vedas<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Where such a constant action is occurring, rajogun&#x301;a (the mutative principle) must also be present.  But it has to take a second place, for the thought waves are not just occurring only for the sake of action, without any purpose; the purpose is the welfare of all, which is motivated by sattvagun&#x301;a and not rajogun&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Such thought waves which evolve minds for the unit beings to perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, require the presence of Citta in Brahma. Citta is created by the influence of tamogun&#x301;a, the static principle. Thus tamogun&#x301;a is also present in Brahma but it occupies a very unimportant place: It has no other influences on the actions or thought-waves and thus it occupies a very insignificant position compared to the other two gun&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Q. 8.  What is Dharana and Dhya&#x301;na and what is the difference between the two?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Citta has the characteristic of becoming like its object. For example, when Citta is in contact with a tree it becomes like the tree.  To do this citta has to depend on external sensations which convey that shape to the citta with the help of the indriyas or organs.  Citta performs two types of functions: gra&#x301;haka and vikshepaka.  The gra&#x301;haka function is performed with the help of the five jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nendriyas or sense organs with their afferent nerves, which carry sensations of external objects to the citta; then the citta takes the form of the sensations carried by the nerves.  The second function of Vikshepaka is performed with the help of the five karmendriyas or motor organs and their efferent nerves, which transform sensations into physical action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Thus the citta takes the forms of the image or sensation which is carried to it with the help of the sensory nerves.  The property of citta to become like its object is called dha&#x301;rana&#x301; which means &ldquo;to hold&rdquo;: the citta holds an image and becomes like that. The image is carried to the citta from external sensations, and since these sensations are not continuous, the image which is formed on the citta is also not continuous.  There is always a gap between two successive images, but due to the rapid succession of the images, the gap is not perceived.  It is just like the images of the cinema screen which appear to be continuous and constant; but when the film is examined it is seen that the images on the screen are formed from a succession of many different pictures.  In Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, citta becomes like that with which it comes in contact in the external world through the sensations; since the sensations of the external object are not continuous, the image in the citta is also not continuous.  Thus Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a is not dynamic, for individual images which are formed on the citta, are all static and will not remain unless immediately followed by another image.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Dhya&#x301;na is also a state of citta like Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, but since dhya&#x301;na can never be of any external object so the citta does not have to depend on external sensations.  The object in dhya&#x301;na is always internal and so citta can take its form without the help of any external sensations.  When there is no necessity of external sensations, there is also no gap between one sensation and another; and the form which the citta adopts in dhya&#x301;na is continuous.  Dhya&#x301;na is thus not static but a continuous process; and this continuity cannot be broken because the citta exists in the same state and takes the same form throughout the period of dhya&#x301;na.  Since the form is the same throughout, no gaps exist as in dha&#x301;rana&#x301;, and there is no succession of individual static images either dhya&#x301;na is compared to the continuity of a stream of oil which flows without any apparent movement.  Taela dha&#x301;ra&#x301; vat ekata&#x301;nata&#x301;: &ldquo;Meditation or dhya&#x301;na is a constant remembrance, flowing like an unbroken stream of oil from one vessel to another.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The result of action in dhya&#x301;na is inaction.  The process of dhya&#x301;na is so continuous that all capacity of action is exhausted in maintaining this continuity, and the resultant therefore is inaction.  When there is a cessation of action, the mind ceases to exist, and that is called sama&#x301;dhi.  Sama&#x301;dhi is also called karma sama&#x301;dhi &ndash; the actionless state when all karma ceases (karmana&#x301;sha).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->There is another action &ndash; the attractive power of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This attractive power which originates from Parama Purus&#x301;a will always remain; but as the object of the attraction is the mind, and when the mind itself does not exist, this attractive power will also not exist.  Dhya&#x301;na, therefore results in the complete loss of action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; and Dhya&#x301;na are therefore quite different from each other although both take place in the citta.  Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; is process of the citta taking the shape of external objects, while dhya&#x301;na concerns internal objects only.  Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a is static, while dhya&#x301;na is full of dynamic form.  Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; is non-continuous and momentary, while dhya&#x301;na is continuous. Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; may result in action, but dhya&#x301;na results only in the cessation of actions.  Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; is purely a creation of citta and is tamogun&#x301;i or static, where as dhya&#x301;na is full of dynamism and is rajoguni or mutative by nature.  The resultant cessation of action in dhya&#x301;na shows that its final goal is Sattvagun&#x301;ii Sama&#x301;dhi through the principle of sattvagun&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Q. 9.  What is A&#x301;dha&#x301;ra?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Everything which is limited, which has particular shape or quality, needs an a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra or base.  It is only because of its a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra that one unit or individual is different from another. The a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra of two different individuals are not the same &ndash; they are different.  The a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra of an individual depends on its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->The a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra like everything in this universe, is evolved from the cosmic mind or Brahmamana.  Upon being qualified by the influence of Prakrti, the cosmic mind is metamorphosed into this universe into this universe of five fundamental factors.  And the a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra also is evolved from the cosmic mind according to the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of the individual.  Brahma required no a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra as it is not limited.  It has no demarcation lines.  An a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra is required only in units which are demarcated and distinguished from one another.  Thus Brahma has no physical body: it has only a mental body or Ma&#x301;nasadeha.  This manasdeha of Brahma is evolved due to the influence of Prakrti, which Brahma becomes full of qualities and acquires the three gun&#x301;as &ndash; Sattva, rajah and tamah.  It is because of the influence of these gun&#x301;as of Prakrti that the body come into existence.  The effect of the three gun&#x301;as are as follows: Sattva or the sentient principle gives the knowledge of existence; Rajah or the mutative principle commands the energy which brings about activity; Tamah or the static force is the stationary result of action, which makes things crude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->The effect of these three gun&#x301;as is not uniform but different in different spheres.  For instance, in this universe the influence of tamagun&#x301;a is greatest on the objects created from the five fundamental factors.  But whatever may be the predominant gun&#x301;a, all that exists even in this universe of the five fundamental factors is derived from the cosmic mind, and this universe is in fact the physical body of the cosmic mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->None of these three gun&#x301;as can exist alone: all the three exist together in all entities, but in the different proportions.  For instance, in the physical world tamah is dominant, rajah is less and sattva is least.  We have discussed this universe, the physical body of the cosmic mind.  Apart from this purely physical sphere which we see with our eyes, and where tamah is dominant, there are other spheres or lokas of the cosmic mind as well.  It should be explained here that the cosmic mind means citta only and does not include Mahattattva and ahamtattva which are also formed as a result of the influence of Prakrti on Brahma.  The cosmic mind has the following seven lokas, from crude to subtle:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->1.  Bhu&#x301;rloka &ndash; the physical world exists within this loka: it is the crudest manifestation of the cosmic mind.  All that can be seen in this universe is located within this loka.  In unit beings, this loka is in the form of the physical body and is called annamaya kos&#x301;a, that is, the layer composed of food.  In this loka, tamah is dominant, rajah is less; and sattva is least.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->2.  Bhuvarloka &ndash; this forms the crude or lower mental sphere of the cosmic mind.  All the actions which are apparently performed by the physical body are actually governed by this crude mental sphere.  This loka in the human mind is called the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a or the crude mind, which controls all the actions of the body.  This sphere is therefore limited to all the actions connected with the body.  Here tamah is dominant, sattva is less and rajah is least.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->3.  Svarloka &ndash; this is the pure mental sphere on which sukha and dhuka are experienced; it is also called Manomaya Jagat, Manomaya Kos&#x301;a in individuals.  It is in this sphere that the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras exist.  According to mythology, after the death of the physical body or Annamaya Kos&#x301;a, people go to svarga or naraka&#x301;, heaven or hell.  The fact is that the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which determine the individuality of unit being situated in this svarloka.  The Christian and Muslim ideas of heaven and hell and also svarga in Hindu Karmakandi Jaemini Partna&#x301;, were derived from the fact that the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which determine the requitals of actions exists exits in this loka.  In reality no kos&#x301;a will remain after death. The sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras remains as the object of the a&#x301;tman.  Thus the ideas of heaven and hell of the Hindu, Christian and Muslim mythologies are completely false, because after death there remains no mind at all to experience heaven or hell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->In svarloka, rajah is dominant, tamah is less and sattva is least.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->4.  Maharloka &ndash; This is the supramental sphere, also called Atima&#x301;nas Kos&#x301;a in individuals.  In this loka the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are first manifested, although they exist in the Svarloka.  In the same way, an idea of an event can exist somewhere while the actual happening occurs at a different place.  For instance, one may think, &ldquo;If I go there I will fall ill&rdquo;.  Similarly sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras originate from this loka but are actually experienced in svarloka where sukha and dukha are felt.  The desire for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; also exists in this loka.  In this loka, rajah is dominant, sattva is less and tamah is least.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->5.  Janah loka &ndash; This is also known as vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a in individuals.  In the English language no state beyond the supramental has been described, and hence there is no word in English for it.  In this loka, vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, viveka and vaera&#x301;gya are dominant.  This exists in every person but it is overshadowed by the predominant Bhu and Bhuvar lokas.  In this loka, sattva is dominant, tamah is less, and rajah is least.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->6.  Tapah Loka &ndash; This is also called Hiran&#x301;maya Kos&#x301;a in individuals.  In this loka, sattva is dominant; rajah is less and tamah is least.  This loka vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is hardly in evidence, and even the feeling of existence, the feeling of &ldquo;I&rdquo; is latent. But the actual existence of &ldquo;I&rdquo; is still present.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Hiran&#x301;maya means &ldquo;made of gold&rdquo; &ndash; this state is as pure and radiant as gold.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->7.  Satya Loka &ndash; all the three gun&#x301;as are present in this loka but they are dormant.  In this loka only Parama Purus&#x301;a exists; the gun&#x301;as exist only in dormant state just as in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. Thus, in this universe there are seven spheres of Sapta Loka&#x301;tmaka. Six of them possess qualities while the seventh is the state of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, without any qualities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->The unit consciousness or jiiva needs an a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra: without any a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra it would merge in the ocean of Brahma.  The water in a bowl placed in a pond retains its individual identity only until the bowl is broken &ndash; then the water contained in it loses its individual identity and merges in the pond water which surrounds it.  Hence as long as the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are present, an a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra is necessary to maintain one&#146;s identity.  Without any a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra the a&#x301;tman will merge with Brahma.  The five kos&#x301;as plus the physical body are as follows: Annamaya Kos&#x301;a &ndash; This crudest layer is the physical body which is made of the five fundamental factors and is dependent on food for its maintenance.  This is the crudest shell around a&#x301;tman.  In this Kos&#x301;a tamah is dominant; rajah is less and sattva is least.  This annamaya kos&#x301;a is derived from the Bhu&#x301;r loka of the cosmic mind.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->Q. 10.  What is Truth or Satya?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Truth is that which never changes: it always remains in the same condition throughout eternity.  Satya is not only unchangeable throughout eternity but it is also unlimited: there is nothing beyond it.  Satya also does not change from place to place: it remains the same whether in one place or another.  Thus Satya is not affected by time, place and person; it is Ka&#x301;la&#x301;tiita, Desha&#x301;tiita and Pa&#x301;tratiita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->There is no difference in the portions of satya within itself; it is an unbroken undifferentiated continuity.  There is nothing outside it, and so there is nothing else which is different from satya, and there is nothing else which is like satya.  Thus Satya has no vija&#x301;tiita, svajatiita and svagat differences.  Satya is different from relative truth.  Relative truth is something which appears through a particular time of place or to a particular person.  It may not appear to be true for all time or at all places or to all persons.  For instances the size of the moon is a relative truth, it may appear to be of one size if seen from the planet Earth but if seen from another planet it will seem to be of different size.  This is called relative truth or Asatya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->Historical events are also relative truth.  An incident which happens on Earth in the last century is a historical event, but as the light from Earth will not have reached another planet for a hundred years, on that planet the event has not yet occurred. Thus historical events also depend on time, place and person and are changing from time to time, place to place and person to person.  This cannot be called absolute truth or satya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->Relative truth and falsehood are only shadows of satya; they can be mistaken for satya but if put to the test, they clearly reveal themselves as asatya.  Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the only way to remove the shadow of Asatya and reach Satya &ndash; to become trika&#x301;lajiana, the knower of past, present and future.  For such persons there is no difference in anything because they see satya in everything.  By dissolving the mind one can become trikalajin&#x32D;a and attain satya. But as long as the mind is present, one cannot know Satya, because the mind is limited and cannot realize an absolute entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->It is said that kale or time is eternal, but this is an incorrect statement.  Time is only a mental measurement of the motivity of action.  Where there is no actions there cannot be any measurement.  Since actions are performed by the mind they are dependent on the existence of the mind which itself perishable and relative truth; hence time also is a relative truth.  Time is dependent on place and person, hence it cannot be absolute truth or Satya.  If place and person do not exist, time also will not exist.  The unit entity wants happiness, but relative truth will give only temporary happiness which will disappear in the course of time.  Hence to desire or strive for relative truth, something will disappear with time, is foolishness.  One&#146;s sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or effort should be only for that which is beyond time, and satya is the only thing beyond time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->Q. 11.  How are the Kos&#x301;as or layers of existence influenced?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->Ans.  The crudest of the five kos&#x301;as is the annamaya kos&#x301;a or physical body.  It is not capable of doing anything by itself: it is lifeless by itself.  Those organisms which have no consciousness and which are lifeless, are only annamaya kos&#x301;a. The other kos&#x301;as, even the a&#x301;tman are also there, but they are all in a dormant condition, and thus the object cannot perform any action. The annamaya kos&#x301;a can perform actions only when it is influenced by ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a or crude mind.  The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a is a lifeless thing, just as a stone is dormant; and thus if any action is to be performed by a stone it must be influenced by the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of another entity.  When a stone is thrown, the action is performed by the influence of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the person who throws the stone.  Similarly, the physical body which comprises the annamaya kos&#x301;a cannot perform any function without the influence of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a.  All the actions that the body performs are carried out by the influence of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a.  Without this influence the body will remain a crude, lifeless object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->Just as annamaya kos&#x301;a performs all the actions by the influence of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a, the manomaya kos&#x301;a can also influence the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a.  When the manomaya kos&#x301;a of one person influences the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of another person the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the influenced person makes its annamaya kos&#x301;a work according to the dictates of the manomaya kos&#x301;a of the other person who is influencing it.  For example, when the manomaya kos&#x301;a of one person wills that another person should see seven o&#146;clock on his watch, when actually his watch shows fifteen minutes past seven, the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a is influenced, and this makes the annamaya kos&#x301;a of the influenced person see the time to be seven o&#146;clock on his watch.  This influencing of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a is called Bhu&#x301;tavidya in Sanskrit, in English it is called hypnotism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->Similarly, manomaya kos&#x301;a or pure mental body can also be influenced by the Atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a.  This is known as Paesha&#x301;cii Vidya&#x301; in Sanskrit; there is no English equivalent.  By means of this influence a person can convert mental force into physical force and carry out physical actions by mental force only, without the use of the annamaya kos&#x301;a of another person.  When vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a of an individual influences the atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a of another person or persons it is called Ga&#x301;ndharva vidya&#x301;.  By this influence other persons can be enchanted and attracted.  This is the influence which is expressed in arts like music, dancing, painting, etc.  In music and dancing the annamaya and ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;as of others are attracted, while in painting the attraction is purely mental; hence painting is said to be a higher art than dancing and music.  This influence can hold any audience spellbound if used in speech, music, dancing or painting.  When vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a of a person is influenced by the hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a of another is called Daevii vidya.  It is by this influence and also by Gandharva vidya&#x301; that lesser Gurus guide their disciples.  Gandharva vidya&#x301; is used in this way in the form of kiirtana and bhajana, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->When satya loka or a&#x301;tman of one person influences the Hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a of another person it is called Bra&#x301;hmii vidya&#x301; and when the a&#x301;tman of one person influences the a&#x301;tman of another person it is called Brahmii A&#x301;kars&#x301;an&#x301;a or Krpa&#x301;.  It is by means of these two, Bra&#x301;hmii vidya&#x301; and Bra&#x301;hmii A&#x301;kars&#x301;an&#x301;a or krpa&#x301;, that Sadgurus guide their disciples.  From the above description of how kos&#x301;as are influenced it is evident that the process is purely mental: it is a result of the activity of mind that the kos&#x301;as can be influenced.  It should not be forgotten here that the mind has the characteristic of becoming like its object.  If these processes of influencing the kos&#x301;as are used for crude objects, then the mind will also become crude and will ultimately lose its finer faculties.  As a result the finest kos&#x301;a will no longer be able to influence the cruder kos&#x301;as, and the greater portion of the mind will become crude.  To use the mind for influencing cruder objects is thus the very opposite of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practice, in which all the cruder manifestations move towards finer and subtler realms.  The use of these influences or vidya&#x301;s on crude objects not only deprives one of the powers which might have been developed, but degrades the mind to a lower kos&#x301;a, and degenerates the mind from subtler to cruder spheres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->Q. 12.  What is Karma and Karmaphala?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Karma is any action.  In the physical world when we see any action being performed, we say that a kriya is being performed. But behind every kriya there is a reason for the performance of such an action.  Karma can be purely psychic or it may be psychic and physical.  No action can be performed without psychic influence: any kriya or action performed by the physical body is always influenced by the mind.  For instance, even the feeling of pain in the body cannot be present if the mental influence which registers the sensation in the mind is absent.  Hence every action is psycho-physical, no action can be purely physical. Every physical action has a reason for its performance &ndash; and that reason is the psychic influence or wave which is called Samvedana.  It is because of this samvedana that the physical body performs an action which we call kriya&#x301;.  So for every action there is a sam&#x301;vedana; and for every sam&#x301;vedana there is a reason or ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a.  Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a is also of two types: the root cause or Mu&#x301;laka&#x301;ran&#x301;a and subsidiary cause or apa&#x301;tah ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a, A&#x301;patah ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a is further divided into two types: Upa&#x301;dana ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a (the material cause) and Nimitta ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a (the efficient cause).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->For instance, when a man sets fire to a house, there may be a reason behind his setting the fire, but to the immediate spectators the cause for the burning would be the fire and the hand which kindled it.  Here fire is Upa&#x301;da&#x301;na Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a and the hand is Nimitta Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a.  Actions or kriya&#x301;s and sam&#x301;vedana travel in waves.  At one end of the wave where the action is complete, the immediate cause appears to be the nimitta ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a. If one thinks beyond this, the cause appears to be the upa&#x301;da&#x301;na ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a.  Still further analysis will show that the immediate cause was the subsidiary cause or a&#x301;patah ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a; and thus the root cause or Mu&#x301;la ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a was something different.  The Mu&#x301;la ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a for all actions are the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of a person.  These sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras give rise to sam&#x301;vedana and then the sam&#x301;vedana is converted into psycho-physical actions.  The other causes which appear to be the immediate causes, are only due to the wave-like motion of the sam&#x301;vedana and kriya&#x301;, which makes the subsidiary cause, and then the upa&#x301;dana and finally the nimitta ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a, to appear to be the main causes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->Just as the upa&#x301;da&#x301;na and nimitta ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a appear to be the main and immediate causes when an action is performed, so the updatta karya&#x301; and naemittika kriya&#x301; appear to be the main action performed, so updatta karya&#x301; and naemittika kriya&#x301; appear to be the main actions performed.  It is said that every action or kriya&#x301; has a reaction or pratikriya&#x301;.  This reaction is physico-psychic and gives rise to a pra&#x301;ti-sam&#x301;vedana, or psychic reaction.  That is psychic reaction to every psychic action. These psychic reactions or pra&#x301;ti-sam&#x301;vedana give rise to the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of a person.  It has been said earlier that sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are the Mu&#x301;la ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a or root causes of action.  It is quite often observed that a child suffers from some disease without any apparent fault on her part.  The disease is attributed to her being affected by the germs of that disease, and thus the germs appear to be the cause.  In fact, the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of that child give rise to the sam&#x301;vedana or psychic action which then activates the germs of that particular disease in the body.  The mu&#x301;la ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a or root cause for the suffering of the child is sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, due to which sam&#x301;vedana arises and ultimately brings about the disease.  It is therefore wrong to think that the child is suffering without any reason and for no fault of its own.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->This wave of action and reaction, whether psychic or psycho-physical, goes on, and the sam&#x301;vedana manifests into physical action or kriya&#x301;.  Physical reaction results ultimately in psychic reaction which may result in the formation of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  The combination of psycho-physical and psychic action is called karma.  Karmaphala is the result of an action in the form of a reaction.  Karmaphala to the observer is the reaction itself as seen immediately after an action; for example, the apparent Karmaphala of putting one&#146;s finger in the fire is that the finger gets burnt.  This is the immediate physical reaction and not the final Karmaphala.  This physical reaction or pratikriya&#x301; will give rise to pratisam&#x301;vedana or psychic reaction and this may form a sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra, which then becomes the Mu&#x301;la ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a or root cause for further psychic or physical actions (sam&#x301;vedana and kriya&#x301;).  In fact, the karmaphala of the previous karma will be experienced only then.  So just as nimiita and upa&#x301;da&#x301;na ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a appears to be the main cause, the immediate reaction of an action appears to be the result while it is only a physical reaction, and the actual result or phala will be experienced later on.  Karma and karmaphala travel in a wave and at one stage one becomes the ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a for the other.  This wave is unending, until karma ceases absolutely, karma and karmaphala are the ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a or causes for each other, which travel in a never ending waves, until the karma and along with it, the formation of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras finally ceases.<!-- /block --></p>
