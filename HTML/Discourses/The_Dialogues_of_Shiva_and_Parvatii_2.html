<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The Formulation of A&#x301;gama and Nigama<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Questions related to spiritual practice and spiritual progress &ndash; questions not simply for inquiry&#146;s sake but for the sake of understanding and for the sake of following the instructions given &ndash; are known as pariprashnas (for example, questions put by disciples to their gurus as to how to sit, how to bid pran&#x301;a&#x301;ma [respectful salutations], and how to repeat mantra). Pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;tena pariprashnena seva&#x301;ya&#x301; [&ldquo;By surrender, spiritual questioning, and servicefulness&rdquo;]. Questions put only for logic&#146;s sake are not pariprashnas; with such questions the time of the questioner and that of the answerer is wasted. And sometimes questions are put not in order to know but in order to test the scholarship of the guru &ndash; such questions are not pariprashnas either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If pariprashnas are put and answered, and then recorded, or if people somehow get acquainted with such questions and answers, people will be benefited. But during the time of Sada&#x301;shiva nobody was there to put such questions. Pa&#x301;rvatii learned sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; from Shiva (as did their son Bhaerava). Pa&#x301;rvatii and Shiva decided that the former would pose the questions, and the latter would reply, and thus people would get acquainted with the questions and answers and be benefited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->They decided to formulate these questions and answers for the all-round development of human society. They decided to cover all branches of knowledge &ndash; art, architecture, literature, medical science, spiritual science, etc. For example, you know that in ancient times there was [a simple form of] giita [song]. There was also [va&#x301;dya, basic instrumental music]. And people were performing some mudra&#x301;s unconsciously with their hands and feet. So Lord Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii decided to coordinate and systematize giita, [va&#x301;dya] and mudra&#x301;. Pa&#x301;rvatii began to pose questions, and Shiva began to answer; and the sam&#x301;giita sha&#x301;stra [science of music] was produced. (The combined name of nrtya [dance], giita and va&#x301;dya is sam&#x301;giita.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Dance was known in quite a primitive age. This kind of dance was rhythmic. Even now the dances of soldiers are mainly rhythmic. There is no important role of mudra&#x301; in their dance. The rule is that rhythmic dance requires strength; only males can do it; because it is tiring. But Pa&#x301;rvatii gave lalita nrtya, in which mudra&#x301; has an important role. Indian dances and other Oriental dances are mudra&#x301;pradha&#x301;na [dominated by mudra&#x301;]. And Occidental dances are chandapradha&#x301;na [rhythmic].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->They decided to categorize mudra&#x301;. So Pa&#x301;rvatii questioned and Shiva answered. Pa&#x301;rvatii would ask, &ldquo;What is the meaning of such and such mudra&#x301;?&rdquo; and Shiva would reply. In this way mudra&#x301; sha&#x301;stra came about, sam&#x301;giita sha&#x301;stra came about. Shiva invented a rhythmic dance and Pa&#x301;rvatii created a dance dominated by mudra&#x301;. In Shiva&#146;s rhythmic dance one has to jump. In Sanskrit tan&#x301;d&#x301;u&#x301; means &ldquo;to jump&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So the dance dominated by jumping is known as ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava. The dance of Shiva is ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava &ndash; &ldquo;dominated by jumping&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Mudra&#x301; directly touches the mind. For instance, if one calls to a person, as soon as the sound vibrations of &ldquo;Come&rdquo; touch the person&#146;s ears, they directly reach the mind. But the person can be made to understand through mudra&#x301;s [gestures of the fingers] also. Similar are the cases of expressing that one feels hot and sweaty, that one feels thirsty, etc., without speaking, through different physical gestures. Hence, mudra&#x301; has sha&#x301;nta bha&#x301;va [it is peaceful, calm]. It is just the opposite of ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava, and that is why it is known as lalita [graceful].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The posture of sitting which creates madhura bha&#x301;va in the body is known as lalita mudra&#x301; or lalita&#x301;sana. You will see different idols from ancient times of devadeviis [gods and goddesses] sitting on lotus flowers in lalita mudra&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->[In the beginning everyone is a pashu, an animal. But when spiritual thirst develops, these people become viira, heroic. And when they are firmly established in viirabha&#x301;va, they become devata&#x301;s.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->When people were being taught ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava and lalita, they found difficulty with both. With ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava they found difficulty in jumping, and with lalita they felt troubled in expressing the correct bha&#x301;va [ideation] through mudra&#x301;. Therefore they requested Lord Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii to bring about a balance between the two. Pa&#x301;rvatii posed some questions, Shiva replied, and a balance was brought about for the good of the people. The new [beat or rhythmic expression] thus produced was called ta&#x301;la &ndash; ta&#x301; from ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava and la from lalita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In spiritual practice only a few get the chance to listen to spiritual discourses, and only a few among those few understand. And fewer yet are there who follow the path. And among those who follow the path, only a counted few reach the goal. Therefore, that Pa&#x301;rvatii got the opportunity to ask spiritual questions and to listen to the answers, and that Shiva could make her understand, was a very rare thing. The questions of Pa&#x301;rvatii, together with Shiva&#146;s practical answers, can be called &ldquo;philosophico-spiritual cult&rdquo;. This means the combination of all philosophy, pariprashna, and spiritual practice, along with Shiva&#146;s practical answers. The questions of Pa&#x301;rvatii are known as nigama sha&#x301;stra, and the answers of Shiva are known as a&#x301;gama sha&#x301;stra. The combined name of a&#x301;gama and nigama is Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Moks&#x301;a is a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. What is a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na? A&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means &ldquo;self-realization&rdquo; &ndash; not &ldquo;self-knowledge&rdquo; [in the ordinary sense]. Suppose you know of a flower. Here there are three &ndash; the knower, you; the known, the flower; and the knowledge, the link between you and the flower. But in the case of self-realization, the knower, the known, and the knowledge are all one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->If you know your self [in the sense of a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na], knower and known are one.

<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Self-realization is moks&#x301;a. What happens there is oneness. Oneness means seeing Brahma in all objects. And who is competent to get moks&#x301;a? Sukrtaerma&#x301;navo bhu&#x301;tva&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niicenmoks&#x301;ama&#x301;pnuya&#x301;t &ndash; &ldquo;When one attains human form through good actions, one becomes adhikarii (competent) to attain moks&#x301;a.&rdquo; What is the meaning of sukrti? In laokik [comparatively recent] Sanskrit, su means &ldquo;good&rdquo; and krta means &ldquo;that which is done&rdquo;. But in Vedic Sanskrit, su means sva [own, self] &ndash; that is, when the jiiva attains humanity due to its own actions, it becomes fit to attain moks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->What is the stage of ma&#x301;nava (humanity)? I remember having told you at Allahabad Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> that humanity is obtained after reaching a particular standard of intellectuality. Animals and inanimate objects are at a lower standard. At this lower standard, the spirit is personal [or individual] and the medium impersonal [or Cosmic]. Animals and inanimate objects progress due to an impersonal medium. Therefore they can only progress &ndash; they cannot have a downfall. But if a human, with a particular intellectual standard, makes good use of that intellect, he or she will have progress, whereas if he or she abuses that intellect, he or she will have a downfall. So a human has intellect, but the intellect is double-edged. Therefore one must be very careful in making use of one&#146;s intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
