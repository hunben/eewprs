<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Pariprashna. Pari is a Sanskrit prefix. It means &ldquo;well&rdquo;, or &ldquo;in a nice way&rdquo;. Hence pariprashna means those questions which when answered can lead to the all-round welfare of human beings. And one should bear in mind that the first and foremost factor for all-round welfare is spiritual elevation. If a person is spiritually elevated, not only does that individual benefit, but the whole society derives benefit from that spiritually-evolved person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->If we want to analyse Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi from the viewpoint of pariprashna, then two main questions arise. The first is, &ldquo;Is Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Bhagava&#x301;n [God]?&rdquo; And the second is, &ldquo;If He is Bhagava&#x301;n, then what is His actual status?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Is Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Bhagava&#x301;n?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Let us analyse the scriptural interpretation of the term bhagava&#x301;n. The word bhaga plus the Sanskrit suffix matup becomes bhagavata, and bhagava&#x301;n when declined in the first case, singular number. From the spiritual point of view, the word bhaga has two meanings &ndash; the first &ldquo;spiritual effulgence&rdquo; and the second, a combination of six qualities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The bha of bhagava&#x301;n signifies bheti bha&#x301;sayate loka&#x301;n &ndash; &ldquo;one who illumines all the lokas by one&#146;s own aura&rdquo; &ndash; by the excellence of infinite vitality, wisdom and greatness. Bha represents all these superhuman qualities. Bha is an acoustic root having immense attribution. Human beings owe their radiance to Him alone. The earth receives its light from the sun, the sun receives its light from the stars, and the stars receive their light from Parama Purus&#x301;a alone. Tasya bha&#x301;sa&#x301; sarvamidam&#x301; vibha&#x301;ti &ndash; &ldquo;Everyone is radiant with His light.&rdquo; Where does human intellect originate from? It emanates from Him. People learn by reading books or by hearing and understanding discourses. These faculties of hearing, reading and understanding are not human creations. They are the gentle rise and fall of the waves flowing in the vast body of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Jiivas have nothing of their own. Everything they receive is from Him alone. They get food from Him and they get air from Him. Everything is a gift from Him. Thus bha is an adequate description of His immense attribution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Next is ga. Itya&#x301;gacchatyajasram&#x301; gacchati yasmin ima&#x301; praja&#x301; a&#x301;gacchati yasma&#x301;t &ndash; &ldquo;the Entity to whom all microcosms return&rdquo;. Gacchati means &ldquo;goes&rdquo;, yasmin means &ldquo;to whom&rdquo; and a&#x301;gacchati yasma&#x301;t means &ldquo;from whom all jiivas originate&rdquo;. Countless are the creations which issue forth from Him and return back to Him. So bha and ga together make the word bhaga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Bhaga has another interpretation. It means a combination of six superhuman qualities. They are:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->[Bha&#x301;ga is a collection of six attributes: aeshvarya, viirya, yasha, shrii, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and vaera&#x301;gya.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>Aeshvarya</b>: While discussing the topic of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi in the light of bhaktitattva the other day, I said that all eight aeshvaryas were found combined in Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi &ndash; a&#x301;nima&#x301;, mahima&#x301;, laghima&#x301;, pra&#x301;pti, iishitva, vashitva, praka&#x301;mya and antarya&#x301;mitva. One possessing all eight occult powers is known as Iishvara. The Latin equivalent of aeshvarya is &ldquo;occult power&rdquo;. &ldquo;Occult&rdquo; means &ldquo;that which comes as a result of cult&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><b>Viirya</b>: Viirya means &ldquo;valour&rdquo;. One whose very presence strikes fear into the hearts of his or her enemies, who is a competent administrator, who can successfully command others to action and who can assume an awesome countenance at will [has viirya].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><b>Yasha</b>: Yasha means &ldquo;fame&rdquo;. When people loudly and wildly acclaim a person for his or her sterling qualities, this acclaim is known as yasha. And how do we explain yashasah, meaning &ldquo;all kinds of name and fame&rdquo;? It is because when Parama Purus&#x301;a brings about social welfare by speaking truthfully and unambiguously and performing many good deeds, good people, common people, derive the benefit and speak highly of His deeds. They are full of praise for Him. They love Him and they revere Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Tomari geche pa&#x301;lcha snehe Tumi-i dhanya dhanya he,<br>A&#x301;ma&#x301;ri pra&#x301;n Toma&#x301;ri da&#x301;n, Tumi-i dhanya dhanya he.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->[You are taking affectionate care of people in Your sweet home; You are really blessed; victory unto You. My very life is Your gift, You are really blessed, victory unto You.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Then there is another category of people whose vested interests are adversely affected by His words and deeds. When their hard-wrought empire falls to pieces at His touch, they become filled with rage at Him. They go to any length to slander and malign Him. One section of the people &ndash; those who have suffered under the thumb of these vested interests &ndash; sing His praises, while His adversaries spit venom at Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Much time has passed since Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a left the earth, but still today thousands of people praise Him, and at the same time many people continue to slander Him. I will not call them wicked; let the people pronounce judgement. Thus yashasah implies both yasha [fame] and apayasha [infamy]. Positive and negative go hand in hand. Interestingly, a clear polarization emerges in the minds of people. Two unmistakable lines are drawn; two opposing camps are formed &ndash; the Kaoravas and the Pandavas. This is yasha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><b>Shrii</b>: Sha is the acoustic root of rajogun&#x301;a [the mutative principle] and the ra of energy. When people plunge headlong into the field of action with all the rajas [mutative force] at their disposal, and backed by this stored-up energy take to karma yoga, that is, when they take up the challenge with all the inherent force and vigour of their personality, we say that sha and ra are well-blended in them. So sha + ra = shra. The word is in the feminine gender, so it becomes shrii when suffixed by uniis&#x301;. Shrii means the power of attraction &ndash; a unique combination of mutative lustre and inner vitality. All human beings covet this rare quality, shrii, so even those who are devoid of shrii like to prefix their names with shrii. This is a very old custom in India. One may not have shrii, but one wants it, so that person adds it to his name.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><b>Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam</b>: Here jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam means spiritual knowledge. Suppose there are four sub-divisions in the Hooghly District [in West Bengal, India]. This is knowledge. It is not altogether useless. Such knowledge is called apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [worldly or ordinary knowledge]. It may be of some help in the physical sphere, but in the higher psychic planes it becomes useless. In the psycho-spiritual sphere, as well as the spiritual sphere, it is useless. This is apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. It comes from its terrestrial source and is thrown back once again. It is like banana skins which someone picks up from the road and throws in the dustbin. But jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na as a bhaga does not imply apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na at all, for apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na cannot elevate human beings to higher spheres. Here jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [self-knowledge], because para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, when associated with social service, can associate with apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, but apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na cannot under any circumstances associate with parajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na if it wants to maintain its separate identity. Apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na as mere apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na remains confined to the mundane sphere, whereas para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na elevates human beings to the spiritual sphere and at the same time serves as an invaluable aid to apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Here jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, that is, spiritual jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, which is actually para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. One who has acquired para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na will automatically develop apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. He or she need not take the trouble to read voluminous books.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii asked Shiva, &ldquo;When do people attain salvation?&rdquo; Shiva replied, &ldquo;People attain salvation the moment they acquire self-knowledge.

<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><b>Vaera&#x301;gya</b>: The word vaera&#x301;gya [renunciation] is derived from the prefix vi, the root verb rainj and the suffix ghain&#x32D;.

So here the verb rainj implies freeing the mind from all colours. All longings and aspirations, thoughts of the present and dreams of the future, and all sorts of colourful thoughts flow from the mind like water from a spring. That is why Buddha said:<!-- /block --></p>

One who remains unassailed by the colour of any object is said to be established in vaera&#x301;gya. To attain this vaera&#x301;gya one need not flee to the Himalayas or smear the body with holy ashes. One must free the mind from the influence of all colours.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->At the time of Mahaprabhu, there was one very rich zamindar in Bengal. He was held in high esteem by the people as a wealthy man. Mahaprabhu sent one man to see just how far this gentleman was established in vaera&#x301;gya. Upon returning, the emissary reported to Mahaprabhu: &ldquo;Well, I went and saw that that man was enjoying life, eating sumptuous food.&rdquo; In his view, this gentleman was far from being established in vaera&#x301;gya. Then Mahaprabhu sent another man to verify this. The second man reported to Mahaprabhu that the person had acquired deep self-knowledge and the spirit of true renunciation. Then Mahaprabhu said, &ldquo;Tell him to come, for he has come all the way from Chittagong to see me.&rdquo; He was a great devotee even though he enjoyed his physical wealth. Devotion is something internal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->So these are the qualities. The collective name of these six qualities is bhaga, and one who has fully imbibed these six qualities is bhagava&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Any great person can be called bhagava&#x301;n in this sense, but my Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is not such a one. What is He? Krs&#x301;n&#x301;astu Bhagava&#x301;n svayam &ndash; that is, &ldquo;He is God incarnate.&rdquo; He is Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;a Brahma, Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;a Bhagava&#x301;n. We can illustrate this point with a story from the Mahabha&#x301;rata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->You know what happened at the time of Jayadratha&#146;s death. Arjuna, as per his vow, was supposed to go to the funeral pyre immediately after sunset in order to keep his promise.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Suddenly people observed that the sun was no longer in the sky and that it had become dark all around. Everyone thought that the sun had already set. Those who were devotees, not philosophers, commented that Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had covered the sun with His Sudarshana Cakra [His special discus]. Now you can imagine that it is impossible to cover the sun with a discus. Is it possible to cover the sun with a dinner plate? When you observe a dinner plate close up, it seems to be about this large. But if you could see the sun close up, how big it would appear! If the dinner plate were placed near the sun, it would be a mere speck. No, the discus could never cover the sun! Though the devotees claim that it did, I take this as a mere story. But then the question arises how the sun was in fact covered. The answer is that Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a willed it so. He had mastery over praka&#x301;mya siddhi, one of the eight occult powers. He willed the sun to be covered by clouds, and so it happened. The sun was covered by clouds, and people thought that the sun had gone down. Soon Arjuna was able to keep his promise and kill Jayadratha. To perform such a miraculous feat by going against the natural order cannot be accomplished by even a first-grade bhagava&#x301;n, not to speak of a second- or third-grade one. Only Parama Purus&#x301;a can do this. This is only one story. Dozens of similar stories can be found in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->What is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s Status?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Next comes the question, what is the status of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? Krs&#x301;n&#x301;astu Bhagava&#x301;n svayam&#x301;. What does it really signify? Together with this [preceding it] Maharshi Garga has also said, Tula&#x301; va&#x301; upama&#x301; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asya na&#x301;sti [&ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a has no parallel or equal&rdquo;]. While adoring a baby we say, &ldquo;How lovely is this child! It&#146;s as lovely as the moon.&rdquo; But Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s beauty far exceeds that of the moon. Again we say, &ldquo;How lustrous is the baby! There is nothing as beautiful as this little baby.&rdquo; Or we may say, &ldquo;How intelligent this man is! He is like Veda Vyasa [the sage who compiled the Vedas].&rdquo; By comparison, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was by far the most intelligent personality in existence. He had no parallel in intellect or wisdom. Thus if we analyse each and every limb of His body we find Him incomparable, unparalleled.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->He promised that He would free sinners from sins, so the future of humanity is unmistakably bright. No one should worry about the past. It is useless to waste mental energy on sin and its atonement. If people constantly think of their Is&#x301;t&#x301;a with undivided attention and repeat their Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra with conceptual understanding, their future is certainly glorious. They will never have any cause to lament or cry in sorrow. Only Parama Purus&#x301;a can state this so emphatically. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s assertion shows that He is not a god, but God Himself. That is, He is the highest expression of spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->It has been mentioned in the scriptures that Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;a Brahma exists on the highest plane, and that through the partial manifestation of His power, khan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;vata&#x301;ra or am&#x301;sha&#x301;vata&#x301;ra or kala&#x301;vata&#x301;ra is born.

If we call Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi bhagava&#x301;n, it will bring Him down to the level of a maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a. This cannot be for we cannot compare any other entity with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. He is beyond comparison. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said in the Giita&#x301;, as well as elsewhere, that all must follow the path shown by Him.

<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Various scriptures have laid down different injunctions for the atonement of different sins. Some say that for such-and-such sin you must atone in such-and-such way. Others say you must go to hell for this or that sin. These interpretations vary from scripture to scripture. About these Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a says, &ldquo;I have only one word to say. If you walk down a road you are bound to get dirty. Those who have abandoned all their previous sins and come to Me, accepting Me as their final refuge, I will free from the bondage of sin. Their future is certainly glorious. No one need worry about their past. It is senseless to worry about atonement for past misdeeds. If one is able to think of his or her Is&#x301;t&#x301;a to the exclusion of everything else and repeat his or her Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra with proper understanding of its meaning, his or her future is bright. He or she will have no cause to weep.&rdquo; Only Parama Purus&#x301;a can assure jiivas so unequivocally. This goes to show beyond any shadow of a doubt that He is not bhagava&#x301;n in the philosophical sense, but the veritable manifestation of divinity. He cannot be compared to either khan&#x301;da&#x301;vata&#x301;ra, am&#x301;sha&#x301;vata&#x301;ra or kala&#x301;vata&#x301;ra. They may be bhagava&#x301;n due to their possession of the six qualities, but none among them is the Supreme Entity. &ldquo;I will forgive your sins. I will free you from all sins, I will take away your sins.&rdquo; No one but Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Supreme Entity, has the right to say this. No one has ever said this in the past, nor will anyone say it in the future. If anyone claims this, it would be only the highest audacity on his or her part. But my Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi has proclaimed it loudly and openly: Aham&#x301; tva&#x301;m&#x301; sarvapa&#x301;pebhyo moks&#x301;ayis&#x301;ya&#x301;mi ma&#x301;shucah &ndash; &ldquo;I will liberate you from all sins.
