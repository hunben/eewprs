<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Earlier I said that the letters included within the five vargas &ndash; ka, ca, t&#x301;a, ta, and pa &ndash; are pure consonants. The remaining consonants are not pure consonants. I also pointed out that sa, sha, s&#x301;a, ha, and ks&#x301;a are not pure consonants because they are pronounced with a whistle. They are whistled aspirates (us&#x301;mavarn&#x301;a). At the time of pronunciation they produce some slight heat in the lips and tongue. Ya, ra, la, and va are also not pure consonants because they are diphthongs of multiple vowels. These kinds of diphthongs were prevalent in old English, for example &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;, but not in modern English.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In Bengali both hard ja and light ya are used. Ya is a diphthong composed of i and a. Hard ja is pronounced by touching the tongue to the upper palate while light ya is pronounced by thrusting the tongue towards the teeth&#146;s lower gum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Earlier I said that when ra is at the beginning of a word it is called a&#x301;di ra, as in ran&#x301;a. It is pronounced by touching the tongue to the teeth of the upper palate. If it occurs in the middle or at the end of a word then it is pronounced as a light ra without the tongue touching the teeth of the upper palate, as in caran&#x301;a. Unfortunately, some Sanskrit pandits overlook this speciality of ra&#x301;s pronunciation. I hope they will pay sufficient attention to this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now as for la, it is called a&#x301;di la when it comes at the beginning of a word and its pronunciation is a straightforward la sound, as in lata&#x301;. When it is in the middle or at the end of a word then its pronunciation changes. The Rgvedic pronunciation becomes lra, the Yajurvedic pronunciation becomes lri, and the Atharvavedic pronunciation becomes lru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The addition of the vowel a to long r (rr) or to long lr (lrr) does not create an antahsthavarn&#x301;a. In the Rgveda the pronunciation of rr and lrr respectively are rr and lrr and in the Yajurveda they are rri and lrri. In the Atharvaveda they are rru and lrru, however, they are, for all intents and purposes, non-existent in the Atharvaveda. Both Panini and Vopadeva [famous Sanskrit grammarians] use them infrequently. In their opinion there is not much need for them. The Vedas only have a few words that contain lrr. Afterwards it disappeared. However, rr continues to be used to a small extent. Lr was also used here and there about twelve or thirteen hundred years ago. Now it has completely disappeared.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Primary school children are mistakenly taught lr for licu. Now the vowel lr is pronounced lri, not li, but the fruit&#146;s name is licu, not lricu. There is a small anecdote about the naming of the licu fruit. Two Chinese horticulturists, Mr. Pi Si and Mr. Li Chi, were conducting research on wild fruits to improve them. The high quality fruit that Mr. Pi Si developed was named &ldquo;peach&rdquo; (in Hindi, sa&#x301;ta&#x301;lu) after the associated researcher, and the fruit that Mr. Li Chi developed was given his name, &ldquo;litchi&rdquo;. Mr. Li Chi&#146;s father&#146;s name was Fi Chu. Many people felt that since the father&#146;s name was Fi Chu then the son&#146;s name should have been Li Chu. Thus the fruit is called licu in some parts of China and in Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the Rgveda there is a difference between the pronunciation of the short anusva&#x301;ra, the long anusva&#x301;ra and the extended anusva&#x301;ra. However, a separate letter was not used for the extended anusva&#x301;ra when the Vedas were written down later on, though there were separate letters for the short and long anusva&#x301;ra. Its pronunciation had to be learned by ear.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Next comes antahstha va. At the beginning of a word it is pronounced like the English &ldquo;va&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;van&rdquo;. The word vis&#x301;n&#x301;u is pronounced with this &ldquo;va&rdquo;. In the middle or at the end of a word it is pronounced like &ldquo;wa&rdquo;. Vidva&#x301;n, for example, becomes &ldquo;vidwan&rdquo;; dva&#x301;dashii becomes &ldquo;dwadashii&rdquo;, and so on. In Calcutta these two words are pronounced vidda&#x301;n and da&#x301;dashii respectively. In Bengali the pronunciation of Calcutta is accepted as standard pronunciation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->When a conjunct has va, ya or ma as the second letter then the word is pronounced as if that letter were not there, and the pronunciation of the letter to which it is attached is doubled. For example, vidva&#x301;n = vidda&#x301;n, padma&#x301; = padda&#x301;, vidya&#x301; = vidda&#x301;, and so on. Only in Rarh, especially in Burdwan, are there exceptions to this. For example, not long ago Laks&#x301;mii used to be pronounced &ldquo;Lachmii&rdquo;. Sva&#x301;mii is still pronounced &ldquo;swami&rdquo; and dva&#x301;dashii, &ldquo;dwadashii&rdquo;; jya&#x301;nta is pronounced jiia&#x301;nta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->According to the rules of Sanskrit grammar, if a ref is placed above a letter (<span class=Bengali>&#x09F4;</span>) then the spelling of the concerned letter can be doubled as an alternative, for example, dharma, dharmma; karma, karmma; etc. Fifty years ago this doubled spelling was still very much in evidence. The spelling dharmma used to be common.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Another rule that used to be in force was that whenever a ref was added to an aspirated letter then at the time of pronunciation it would be placed above the corresponding non-aspirated letter, for example, arddha, garbbha, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->According to Sanskrit grammar, if there is a doubled letter in a root word then the doubling must be retained in words derived from that root with the ref added to that consonant. Take, for example, ka&#x301;rttika. Since it comes from the root word krttika&#x301;, not krtika&#x301;, ka&#x301;rttika is spelled with two t&#146;s. Similar is the case with parivarttana, anuvarttana, etc. Recently a committee was formed by the Calcutta University authorities to look into spelling conventions. After some discussion the committee issued some statements regarding this matter but they did not give any clear instruction on the subject.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now let us come to vargiiya ba: antahstha va and vargiiya ba are pronounced and spelled the same in Bengali. However in the Rgveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda, vargiiya ba is used separately, although its use is limited. Generally, it is used in four specific cases with, of course, some exceptions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->1) Words formed from ba&#x301;la&#x301;: ba&#x301;la&#x301;, ba&#x301;laka, ba&#x301;lika&#x301;, priyaba&#x301;la&#x301;, etc. 2) Words formed from bodha: buddha, buddhi, bodhi, prabodha, udbodhana, etc. 3) Words formed from brhat: brhat, brahma, bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a, bra&#x301;hma, etc. 4) Words formed from bandhana: bandhu, bandhana, ba&#x301;ndhava, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In addition to this there are also a few other instances where vargiiya ba is used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Vargiiya ba is pronounced like the English &ldquo;ba&rdquo;. Antahstha va is sometimes pronounced like the English &ldquo;va&rdquo; and sometimes like the English &ldquo;wa&rdquo;. In English, in order to lengthen the pronunciation of &ldquo;u&rdquo;, two &ldquo;u&rdquo;s are added together to make &ldquo;w&rdquo; (double &ldquo;u&rdquo;). In French two &ldquo;v&rdquo;s are added together which they call double v. The French would commonly use this double v at the beginning of non-French words in order to render them properly. This double v was not used in old Latin but later on it was accepted in order to facilitate proper pronunciation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In English the accented letter &ldquo;d&rdquo; is pronounced in two different ways. The Anglo-Saxon style of pronunciation is similar to ja, for example, &ldquo;ejucation&rdquo;, &ldquo;immejiate&rdquo;, &ldquo;guarjian&rdquo;. In the Norman style of pronunciation &ldquo;d&rdquo; is pronounced like d&#x301;a, for example, &ldquo;education&rdquo;, &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;, &ldquo;guardian&rdquo;. Both kinds of pronunciation are correct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The various letters are divided into palatal, cerebral and dental letters according to the differences in pronunciation. The palatal letters are pronounced by touching the tongue to the upper palate. For example, ca, cha, ja, jha, ina, and sha are palatal letters. The cerebral letters are pronounced by touching the tongue to the mu&#x301;rdha. The passageway by which water exits when you draw water up through the nose and then expel it through the mouth is known as mu&#x301;rdha. T&#x301;a, t&#x301;ha, d&#x301;a, d&#x301;ha, n&#x301;a, and s&#x301;a are cerebral letters. The name given to those letters that are pronounced by pushing the tongue against the teeth is &ldquo;dental letters&rdquo;. For example, ta, tha, da, dha, na and sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In phonetics there is a hard and fast rule that members from the three different groups of letters cannot combine together to form diphthongs. For example, in the word nishcala, ca is a palatal letter, thus it must have sha as its conjunct, not s&#x301;a or sa. Similarly, cain&#x32D;cala combines ina + ca, not n + ca. Kas&#x301;t&#x301;a cannot be spelled kast&#x301;a. Thus, s&#x301;t&#x301;eshan [station] and pra&#x301;utis&#x301;t&#x301; [Proutist] are always spelled with s&#x301; + t&#x301;a. The only exception is prashna [question]. Prashina would be correct (ina is the palatal na), however for ease of pronunciation both grammarians, Panini and Vopadeva, accepted the substitution of na for the palatal ina in prashna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->For every rule there is some exception or another. For example, if the English root verb ends in &ldquo;t&rdquo; then the noun is created from that root by adding &ldquo;ion&rdquo;. For example, the noun for the verb &ldquo;opt&rdquo; is &ldquo;option&rdquo;. If it does not end in &ldquo;t&rdquo; then &ldquo;sion&rdquo; is added instead. For example, &ldquo;di &ndash; vide&rdquo; + &ldquo;sion&rdquo; = &ldquo;division&rdquo;, &ldquo;revision&rdquo;, etc. If the root verb has a long vowel then the noun is formed by adding only &ldquo;ion&rdquo;, but instead of pronouncing it shya&#x301;n, it is pronounced tian. For example, &ldquo;question&rdquo; is pronounced &ldquo;quest-i-un&rdquo;, not &ldquo;quest-chen&rdquo;. The one exception is the verb &ldquo;mit&rdquo;. If the root verb is &ldquo;mit&rdquo; then the noun is formed by adding &ldquo;ssion&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;ion&rdquo;. In other words, the correct spelling is &ldquo;mission&rdquo;, not &ldquo;mition&rdquo;, for example, &ldquo;permission&rdquo;, &ldquo;submission&rdquo;, &ldquo;omission&rdquo;, &ldquo;commission&rdquo;, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Then comes na and ma when they are at the end of the root word and na and ma when they are not at the end of the word. If ma or na come at the end of the root and are followed by a consonant then the fifth letter of that varga is used, or else m&#x301;. For example, sham + kara = shaun&#x32D;kara or sham&#x301;kara. Both are correct. However, m&#x301; is not used to spell saun&#x32D;ga because the na in the verbal root sanj is not a root-ending na. Gaun&#x32D;ga cannot be spelled with m&#x301; because the initial word gam is not a verbal root. It is the singular second-case form of the word ga. Here the word ga means &ldquo;vast land&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Both hard ja and light ya are used in Bengali, however Bengali does not have a letter that corresponds to the English &ldquo;z&rdquo; so its pronunciation can be indicated by adding a dot below the hard ja. This is what I do. The writer Ra&#x301;jashekhar Bose (Parashura&#x301;ma) used the English letter &ldquo;z&rdquo; in his compositions and added an a&#x301; after it &ndash; z<span class=Bengali>&#x09BE;&#x09A8;&#x09A4;&#x09BF; &#x09AA;&#x09BE;&#x09B0; &#x09A8;&#x09BE;</span>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Arabic, Farsi, English, Latin and French all have the letter &ldquo;f&rdquo; but Sanskrit does not. Thus words like takhlif, &ldquo;Finish&rdquo;, &ldquo;fain&rdquo;, kanif, &ldquo;fraternal&rdquo;, etc. cannot be written properly in Sanskrit. I am in favour of adding a dot below the letter pha (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AB;&#x09BC;</span>) for this purpose. However, if it is written with a dot below it then great care must be taken because if the dot is written a little to one side or the other it can create confusion in both pronunciation and meaning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Some people use the Bengali letter cha to indicate the sound of the heavily aspirated Arabic sa, for example, chaeyad, echla&#x301;m, etc. I have no objection to this because although the letter does not exist in Bengali its pronunciation has to be indicated in some way. In this case I am personally in favour of adding a dot below the letter sa (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B8;&#x09BC;</span>). However I do not see any reason to object to using cha instead. For example, what is the harm in writing chahii ha&#x301;dich for sahiih ha&#x301;dis.<!-- /block --></p>
