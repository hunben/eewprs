<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Dynamicity or velocity is life. Where there is no speed, where the characteristics of mobility are lost, there is no life, there is no existence. Parama Purus&#x301;a, by dint of His psychic mobility, is maintaining the creation, preservation and destruction of this universe. He is not stationary. He is not fixed. Even the internal ectoplasmic cells of human beings are in a state of motion. Nothing in this universe is stationary: the earth moves around the sun, the sun, together with the entire solar system, moves one. It has to move, it must move, because movement in the fundamental characteristic of each and every thing. Regarding Parama Purus&#x301;a it has been said, &ldquo;Raso vae sah&rdquo;. That is, the Supreme Entity is a flowing entity. Due to the cosmic flow, everything is taking place, the universe is being created endlessly. It exists and will continue to exist. In our Ananda Marga philosophy it is said, &ldquo;Human existence is an ideological flow&rdquo;. That is, in human existence there is complete mobility. Those who are static, those who are stationary, those who are against change, go against the very spirit of mobility. But the fact is, no one can survive, no one can preserve one&#146;s existence, by going against the spirit of mobility. Doing that would mean to court death. One will have to move forward. Rabindranath Tagore said in one of his poems:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Pathik a&#x301;mi pathei ba&#x301;sa&#x301;<br>A&#x301;ma&#x301;r jeman ya&#x301;oya&#x301; temani a&#x301;sa&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[I am a traveller, the path is my resting place. My coming and going are one and the same.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the past we observed that those who lost the very spirit of dynamism were the first to be thrown into the dustbin of history. We shall also see this in the future. Those who have become immobile, those who have lost the capacity to move forward, obstruct the path of dynamism. Those who don&#146;t have the inborn capacity to move forward, that is the plants and animals, should not be criticized. But those who have the capacity, but don&#146;t have the desire to use it, should be condemned, not because they are immobile, but because they are knowingly or unknowingly obstructing the movement of others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->At certain times, due to social, economic, or other necessities, the speed of movement should be increased. The speed of social movement does not remain uniform at all times &ndash; no two things in the world are uniform &ndash; but either increases or decreases. When the speed decreases, society is thrown into the mire, life becomes inert. Those who don&#146;t work, who simply waste their time sleeping, eating and resting day after day feel bored with life and complain about its monotony. Boredom occurs when the same thing happens in ones life again and again, day after day. When people are forced to eat the same type of food for days together, it becomes bland. People are fond of change. So when, due to certain circumstances, mobility lessens, society&#146;s garbage starts to pile up. This stagnancy must be followed by an acceleration in the speed of movement. To simply resume the normal speed in such situations will not be enough because it is imperative to remove the garbage that has piled up during the period of stagnancy. The present humanity is in such a situation today and the speed of social movement will have to be accelerated: there is no other way to protect society from being submerged under that huge heap of garbage. We cannot and will not allow that to happen. The rs&#x301;is of Vedic age also said, &ldquo;Caraeveti, caraeveti&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In those days there was a great scholar named Rohita. He was like an ocean of knowledge, but was adverse to physical work and wouldn&#146;t do anything except study the scriptures for days together. Neither did he do any remarkable service to the world, nor was he useful to himself or to the society. So one day, his father decided to teach him a lesson, saying, &ldquo;Look, Rohita, the one who works hard, braving the scorching summer heat, has a divine beauty reflecting on his sweat covered face. Even Indra, the king of the gods, welcomes such a person as His companion, because the characteristics of mobility are clearly reflected on his face. (Here Indra means &lsquo;energy&rsquo;.) Such a person is respected and adored by all. You should remember this thing, Rohita. You should also remember that the greatest slogan for human existence is, &lsquo;Caraeveti, caraeveti&rsquo;: &lsquo;move on, move on&rsquo;. Don&#146;t stop.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The fate (bha&#x301;gya) of a person who lies down in idle speculation, also lies down. In ancient Sam&#x301;skrta, the meaning of the word &ldquo;bha&#x301;ga&rdquo; was fortune or luck. A lucky person was called &ldquo;bhaga dha&#x301;ra&#x301;&rdquo;. This became &ldquo;bakadhara&rdquo; in old Pra&#x301;krta (3500 years ago) from which it has become &ldquo;ba&#x301;ha&#x301;dara&rdquo; in modern Punjabi and &ldquo;ba&#x301;ha&#x301;dar&rdquo; in Urdu and &ldquo;ba&#x301;ha&#x301;dur&rdquo; in Bengali. So, if people lie down, their fate also lies down &ndash; bereft of the quality of dynamism, they cannot do any service to the world at large. The most prominent characteristics of pra&#x301;n&#x301;a dharma (vitality) is conspicuously absent in them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->However, when people finally wake up and sit up, they can do some service for themselves as well as for the world. There is at least some possibility that something will be done by them. And if they decide to do some work and start it without any delay, their fate will also start moving forwards. No force in this universe can stop such people because they have attained the greatest characteristics of Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; mobility. They are sure to enjoy the blessings and support of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->I have already told you in many of my messages that Parama Purus&#x301;a is with you. You will surely be victorious because you possess that inherent dynamism. I say this with great joy, and I anticipate with greater joy that your dynamism will increase more and more. As I said, when human beings start moving, their fate or fortune also starts moving. But you should remember that your forward movement is not for the promotion of your own welfare. Rather it should be your vow to lead the entire humanity towards the great and supreme fulfilment. No one today is alone; even the small countries of the world cannot live separately. We will all have to move together in unison &ndash; this will be the model for the future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Kalao shaya&#x301;no bhavati sain&#x32D;jiha&#x301;nastu Dva&#x301;para;<br>Uttis&#x301;t&#x301;han Treta&#x301; bhavati Kratam&#x301; sampadyate caran&#x301;;<br>Caraeveti caraeveti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->You know, there are certain mythological ages (yugas). The word &ldquo;yuga&rdquo; is derived from two Sam&#x301;skrta root verbs: &ldquo;yunj&rdquo; or &ldquo;yuj&rdquo;. Here it is derived from &ldquo;yuj&rdquo; and means &ldquo;transitional period&rdquo;. On analysis of history we notice that as one epoch ends another begins: the ks&#x301;atriya age is followed by the vipra age, the vipra age is followed by the vaeshya age and so on. The intervening period between the two epochs is called a yuga. There is no other age such as &ldquo;golden age&rdquo;, &ldquo;silver age&rdquo;, &ldquo;bronze age&rdquo; and &ldquo;iron age&rdquo; etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Rohita&#146;s father said, &ldquo;Look, when human beings become steeped in ignorance, remain submerged in the slumber of darkness, become engrossed in the state of inaction, and think idly, &lsquo;Will I be able to do it? No, no, it&#146;s impossible&rsquo;, they cannot do any work. Human beings should think internally, &lsquo;I will do the work; I must do the work. When others have been able to do it, I will also be able to do it. I am not inferior to anyone. I have also been born into the glorious human family. I am also a blessed child of Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rsquo; One who has been born a human being will certainly remain a human being if they do glorious deeds and will ultimately become an ideal follower of the Supreme Benevolence. Their life is sure to meet with glorious success.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->A rational person should always think in this way. When a person remains in a state of inaction, it is called &ldquo;kalika&#x301;la&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta. Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;la means &ldquo;period of time&rdquo;. &ldquo;Kalao shaya&#x301;no bhavati&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;The person is sleeping&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sain&#x32D;jhiha&#x301;nastu Dva&#x301;parah.&rdquo; When people wake up and realize that they shouldn&#146;t sleep any more because time is running out and they still have a lot of work to do &ndash; after all, no one has endless time to complete the work &ndash; they get up and prepare themselves for work. When the idea of getting up or the awareness of having to move forwards comes in one&#146;s mind, it is called &ldquo;Dva&#x301;para Yuga&rdquo; (2nd stage). The spirit of movement starts from this stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Uttis&#x301;t&#x301;han Treta&#x301; bhavati.&rdquo; When one gets up, casting lethargy aside, that is the beginning of Treta&#x301; Yuga. There is no other imaginary Treta&#x301; Yuga. &ldquo;Uttis&#x301;t&#x301;han&rdquo; means &ldquo;one who rises up&rdquo;; that is, one who thinks internally, &ldquo;I shall start the work this very moment. I am ready in all respects. I want to work and move ahead. I am no longer prepared to waste the time and energy of this body of flesh and blood.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Kratam&#x301; sampadyate caran&#x301;.&rdquo; The moment one takes the first step forwards, one enters Satya Yuga. &ldquo;Therefore, O Rohit, caraeveti, caraeveti. Move on, move on. Keep moving on. Movement is indispensable for human existence.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->I told you a little while ago, and repeat it again, that you boys and girls possess some degree of mobility. You must endeavour from this very moment to lead your lives into satya yuga. Hence you should accelerate the speed of your life&#146;s movement.<!-- /block --></p>
