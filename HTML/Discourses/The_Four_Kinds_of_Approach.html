<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know, human expressions are trifarious in character. Human beings have so many physical manifestations, psychic desires and longings, and also a spiritual thirst. This spiritual thirst is the specialty, or rather the special characteristic, of human beings, and there lies the difference between man and other animals. Where there is no spiritual thirst in a man, physically he may be like a man, but actually, psychologically, he is not a man. So this special wont of human beings should always be encouraged, so that man may develop from an ordinary human being to a superman.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->His position should be exalted to that of superman. And this is the only way, only secret, to encourage the supreme human propensity towards the Supreme Being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Yes, human expressions are trifarious in character, but human approaches are not trifarious. There are four kinds of human approach. One, the physical approach: Human beings do so many things, have so many physical approaches, they have created so many sciences, just to get more physical pleasure. So many science subjects have been invented and will be invented.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Here &ndash; that is, in inventing so many science subjects &ndash; man does not differentiate himself from animals, because science in some form or other is being invented, is being followed, by other animals also. Birds know how to prepare their nests in a very scientific style. Ants also have very developed science in their society. So this science, this physical science, is not something that may differentiate man from animal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The second human approach is physico-psychic and/or the reverse approach, psycho-physical. Here lie some differences between man and animal. In the case of animals or other creatures, the approach is physico-psychic, no doubt, but it is never psycho-physical. In the case of man, it is both physico-psychic and psycho-physical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->And the third human approach is purely psychic. There are certain developed creatures &ndash; dogs, monkeys &ndash; where there is this psychic approach; a bit psychically-developed animals have this wont.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And the last one, that is absent in all other animals, is the psycho-spiritual approach. This psycho-spiritual approach is developed or is created or can be found only at a certain stage of developed mind. It is a specialty of humans. If we are to establish ourselves in the full glory of humanity, we must encourage this psycho-spiritual approach, that is, spiritual sadhana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This psycho-spiritual approach starts from the realm of the mind, and ends in the jurisdiction of the Supreme Nucleus. Now for this, the movement of our existence should maintain a parallelism with the movement of our idea. Entitative waves maintaining a parallelism with incantative waves. And that&#146;s why I have said that ours is a subjective approach with objective adjustments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Those physical expressions, those psycho-physical or physico-psychic expressions, and also the pure psychic expressions, all come within the scope of objective adjustment; and the last one, that is, the psycho-spiritual approach, is the subjective approach. Ours must be a happy blending of these two.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In the case of the psycho-spiritual approach, or psycho-spiritual movement, we should always remember that human beings are just like electrons moving around the nucleus of an atom. And by dint of our spiritual cult we will have to reduce the difference between the moving electron and its nucleus. The length of the radius is to be lessened by dint of our sadhana. And a day is sure to come when the length of this radius will become zero and the electron will become one with the nucleus; that is, the <i>jiiva,</i> the spiritual aspirant, will be one with <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->While doing spiritual practice, spiritual sadhana, while singing <i>kiirtana</i> and dancing, we should remember the fact that all our spiritual activities are just a dance around <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i>  lessening the distance, lessening the length of the radius, coming from close to closer proximity to our ideological Desideratum. We should always remember this fact. And there cannot be any peace, any happiness or any beatitude till the aspirant comes in tactual contact with the Supreme Self.<!-- /block --></p>
