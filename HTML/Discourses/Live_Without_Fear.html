<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This Universe is the creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Who is this Parama Purus&#x301;a? He is your father. Therefore, this universe is your paternal property. You must not forget it even for a single moment. You have not to be afraid of any immoral or evil force of the world. Fearfulness is not your wont, it is not your Dharma. Your duty is to march forward. You must move forward. You have always the support of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Regarding Parama Purus&#x301;a it is said: Karma&#x301;dhyaks&#x301;a sarvabhu&#x301;ta&#x301;dhiva&#x301;sah. The humans cannot do anything with their own power. They have no power of their own. Those are indeed the greatest fools who think that they work with their own strength. Humans&#146; existence, their actions, their everything is verily dependent upon Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s grace. Those who realize this early in their lives are wise. It is true, humans sometimes feel weak. And when do they feel weak? They feel weak when they isolate themselves from the Supreme Father, drift away from Him. But the moment they again realize Him they begin to realize that they are not low, they are not mean, they are the sons of the Supreme Father, they are the daughters of the Supreme Father, instantly they receive strength. Always remember: Karm&#x301;adhyaks&#x301;ah. You work with His power, you have no power. Hence you must not think as to whether you will be able to do this work, whether this work is possible for you. You will certainly be able to do it if there is the grace of the Supreme Father. Why should you not be able to do it? You will surely be able to do it. While doing work you are always in His sight. He is always seeing you, you are not alone, you are never alone. In no circumstances are you alone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Humans are never alone, but when they realize this, there is an advantage as well as a disadvantage in it. The disadvantage is that the Supreme Father&#146;s eye is ever on me, He is constantly watching me. Should I do any wrong action, He will see it then and there. There is no opportunity to do anything secretly. This is the disadvantage, a big disadvantage. And the advantage is that in no circumstances am I alone. Since the Supreme Father is with me, why should I be afraid of anyone? Why should I fear at all? There is no reason to be fearful. I have to move forward. Fearfulness is not my duty. Let the fear fear me, I will not fear.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->I will therefore only tell you to move forward and Parama Purus&#x301;a is certainly with you. And the evil force, what is it? If Parama Purus&#x301;a is the sun, evil force is a firefly. Then what is there to be afraid of in a firefly? Is anybody ever afraid of the pebbles on the track? They move ahead throwing them into the drain with the strokes of their feet. This indeed is the fact. Move forward, live without fear. Continue your movement forward. What more should I say? I have nothing more to say.<!-- /block --></p>
