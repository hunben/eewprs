<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Kakubh<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The root verb kak means &ldquo;to feel pride&#8230; to consider oneself to be someone&rdquo;. By adding the suffix ubhac to kak we get the word kakubh. The etymological meaning of the word kakubh is &ldquo;that which, when focused on, people feel pride&#8230; thinking oneself an important person&rdquo;. The word kakubh is feminine in gender. The colloquial meanings of kakubh are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->1) A particular fraction or arc of the horizon. For example, east, west, northeast, southwest, etc.  Of course, what we call &ldquo;the eastern horizon&rdquo; is where it seems to us that the eastern sky meets the earth, but, if we say &ldquo;eastern horizon&rdquo; it can refer to the entire eastern sky. However, in Bengali we say pu&#x301;rva kakubh for where the eastern sky meets the earth &ndash; for which we have the expression &ldquo;eastern horizon&rdquo; in English; similarly, iisha&#x301;n kakubh [northeast], agni kakubh [southeast], and so on. You can use this word freely.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->2) If many flowers bloom together in a cluster on a tree then that is also called kakubh, or if many flowers are made into a single bouquet or garland then that is also called kakubh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->3) The third meaning of the word kakubh is &ldquo;where many kan&#x301;akaca&#x301;npa&#x301; [kanakacampaka] flowers bloom together in a single bunch on a tree&rdquo;; that is also called kakubh. Kakubh can also be used for a bouquet of [kanakacampaka] flowers, that is, if we say simply kakubh rather than [kanakacampaka]-kakubh, it means a bunch or cluster of [kanakacampaka].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->4) If any song remains confined within the notes of a particular scale (the gat<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> created from it) then the scale (gat) of that song is called kakubh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->5) Kakubh is also the name of a recognized ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii. This ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii is included within the Kakubh raga. The Kakubh raga is masculine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->6) The word kakubh means &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; or &ldquo;fascination&rdquo;. For example, this flower-garden&#146;s kakubh is captivating.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->7) The seventh meaning of the word kakubh is &ldquo;abundance&rdquo; or &ldquo;uncommonness&rdquo;. For example, at that time the kakubh of the agricultural wealth of the Damodar river-valley was unparalleled in the world. It had no equal anywhere in the production of paddy, cotton and sugar cane. This can be deduced from various clues from the time of Emperor Akbar. Actually, it is perhaps for this reason that some people used to think that because of the area&#146;s gradual increase of kakubh it became known by the name of Varddhama&#x301;na [Burdwan].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->8) The eighth meaning of the word kakubh is &ldquo;loose hair&rdquo;. In olden times, loose hair was often considered a sign of beauty in women. This loose hair is also called kakubh as an expression of praise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->9) The ninth meaning of the word kakubh is &ldquo;loose hair which has been decorated&rdquo;, that is, the hair is loose, it has not been braided or plaited or bound in tresses, but different kinds of decorations have been put in the hair &ndash; this kind of loose hair is also called kakubh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Kakubha<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Ka means &ldquo;water&rdquo;. Ka + skubh +ac = kakubha. The dropping of the sa leaves kakubha. The word is masculine in gender. It is also worth noting that there is no hasanta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  at the end of the word. The etymological meaning of the word kakubha is &ldquo;that which is obtained when water is stirred or agitated or put to work&rdquo;. It has many colloquial meanings. For example:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->1) The tree we get when we soak the ground with water; kakubha means &ldquo;tree&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->2) The material produced from trees is wood. Thus wood furniture is called kakubha, such as &ldquo;chair&rdquo;, &ldquo;table&rdquo;, &ldquo;stool&rdquo;, &ldquo;wooden box&rdquo;, and the small, forward-sloping table in grocery shops which can be used as both a table and a box.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->3) The word kakubha can also be used for wooden pots and pans such as khora&#x301; [a large cup without handles], ket&#x301;ho [wooden vessel], varakos&#x301;a [serving tray], etc. The half-portion of the coconut shell which is used in housework is called kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->4) Water vessels made of wood (such as wooden glasses) are also called kakubha. The word gela&#x301;s which is prevalent in Bengali has come from the English &ldquo;glass tumbler&rdquo;. Actually, &ldquo;glass&rdquo; means ka&#x301;ca [the material glass]. That water vessel which is made from glass is a glass tumbler. The word [glass] is fundamentally incorrect, so it is not bad at all if kakubha is used for &ldquo;water-glass&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->5) Any kind of water vessel, or something that can be sipped from (such as a saucer, water-pot, etc.), is called kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->6) One of the names of the kaman&#x301;d&#x301;alu [a traditional water-pot used by mendicants and students] that students and renunciants used to use in olden times is kakubha. This kaman&#x301;d&#x301;alu generally used to be made from wood or from the shell of a ripe gourd.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->7) The covered water container which was used out of necessity in olden times for travel to far-off countries, and is still used today (such as a canteen or such types of things), is also called kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->8) Those wooden vessels which are hollow, or have cavities, and are covered with skin for producing sound, such as tabla, d&#x301;ugi, mrdaun&#x32D;ga, d&#x301;hol, d&#x301;ha&#x301;k, d&#x301;holak, jayd&#x301;ha&#x301;k, da&#x301;ma&#x301;ma&#x301;, ma&#x301;dal, khol, and so forth, are also called kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->9) The instrumental system known as jaltaraun&#x32D;ga which works by producing sound waves from water-filled vessels of either wood, glass or stone, is also called kakubha. The special vessel which is used is also called kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->10) The dry shell of a ripe gourd which used to be used, or still is, as part of a stringed instrument is also called kakubha. In olden days, the bitter gourd shell was generally used. The bitter gourd used to be called kat&#x301;utumbi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->11) Kakubha is the name of an accepted raga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->12) The ripe gourd shell which forms part of the ekta&#x301;ra&#x301; [a one-stringed instrument] is called ba&#x301;is or ba&#x301;yes in certain parts of Bengal; its refined Bengali [or Sanskrit] name is also kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->13) The hookah which is made from coconut shell with holes in it and used for smoking tobacco, and which is called da&#x301;ba&#x301; or da&#x301;ba&#x301;hunka&#x301; in Bengali, is also called kakubha in the refined language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Kadara<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Although kadara is certainly a Sanskrit word of Vedic origin, it is also a Persian word of Vedic origin. When the word is in the form of the Persian word of Vedic origin then its meaning is &ldquo;proper assessment&rdquo; or &ldquo;proper evaluation&rdquo;. For example, if we see a talented, educated person being insulted then we tell them: &ldquo;Don&#146;t listen to them. They are uneducated people; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii-gun&#x301;iir kadar bujhbe na&#x301; [they can&#146;t understand the kadara of the well-educated]&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In the Vedic language we get the word kadara from the stem ka and the verbal root dr. One meaning of the word kadara is &ldquo;vakul flower&rdquo;. The vakul is an Indica variety of forest tree, that is, its original home is in the vast forests of this country. The flowers of this very tall tree are, however, extremely small. In spring and summer mornings this sweet-smelling flower drops to the ground at the base of the tree. Because the flower has a natural hole in it, it is easily strung for garlands. Ita&#x301;r [essence] and a fragrant oil are made from its extract. Its fragrance helps to maintain mental equipoise. Although the use of its fragrance is forbidden for renunciants, it is not forbidden for family people because it is sattvagun&#x301;ii [sentient] in nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The vakul fruit has been used as a food since ancient times. It has small seeds, and the oil obtained from its seeds is suitable for cooking, but since there are insufficient quantities available, it is not used for cooking. This oil is, however, used in the family cooking pots in those village areas in forest surroundings where there are sufficient numbers of vakul trees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Vakul oil is a remedy for arthritis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->In northern India vakul is known by the name of maulshrii. In Rarh the vakul flower is called vaul or bol. The word bolpur has come from vakulpur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The third meaning of the word kadara is ca&#x301;lta&#x301; [an edible acid fruit, or its tree]. In some people&#146;s opinion, this fruit came from southeast Asia, while others believe that it came from South America or South Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;dviipa. As far as I can tell, their assertion is not correct. Since there is a Vedic word, kadara, for ca&#x301;lta&#x301;, it means that the people of India were familiar with it since very ancient times, that is, the statement that it arrived in India at the end of the Pathan era is incorrect. This Liliam indica variety of fruit stimulates the appetite, and in small quantities it is good for the liver and kidneys. However, in greater quantities it can lead to an excess creation of bile. In cases of insanity the ca&#x301;lta&#x301; fruit should be avoided.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The ca&#x301;lta&#x301; likes humid air, thus it is usually seen within one hundred and fifty miles of the sea. The ca&#x301;lta&#x301; grows, or can grow far from the sea, but in that case it grows on the banks of ponds or reservoirs. In one riddle it is said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;r ba&#x301;r&#x301;iir pa&#x301;tiha&#x301;ns<br>Kha&#x301;y khola&#x301; phele sha&#x301;ns<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The ca&#x301;lta&#x301; shell, that is, rind, is a food and what is inside it is fit to be thrown.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->In general parlance kadara also refers to the barley spike, as well as to the top portion of the spike of any crop. The top of the paddy spike we can call vriihi-kadara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The fifth meaning of the word kadara is &ldquo;hand-saw&rdquo; or &ldquo;saw&rdquo;. Although generally kadara can mean any kind of saw, it also refers more specifically to that small kind of saw that cuts on both sides, such as a conch-saw. This kadara variety of saw has an inseparable relationship with the conch-craft industry. The conch shells that come from that part of the Bay of Bengal which is near Shri Lanka are of the highest quality. The conches that come from the central part of the Bay of Bengal are not such a high quality. Because high quality conch shells are in short supply nowadays (red and white), girls are using them less, and as a result, the conch-crafts industry is in peril. The Sha&#x301;nka&#x301;ris [Hindu caste specializing in conch-shell crafts] and conch traders are practically out of work these days. In olden times, three places in Bengal &ndash; Dhaka, Murshidabad and Bankura &ndash; were famous for their conch-shell crafts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The sixth meaning of the word kadara is laohashala&#x301;ka&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;iron rod&rdquo;. The word shala&#x301;ka&#x301; is also used to mean &ldquo;stick&rdquo; (in Rarhi Bengali, kha&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;). Diipashala&#x301;ka&#x301; &rarr; diiashala&#x301;a&#x301; &rarr; diiya&#x301;shala&#x301;y &rarr; deshla&#x301;i [matchstick].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->The seventh meaning of the word kadara is aun&#x301;kusha [prod]. Most of us are familiar with the object called aunkusha with whose help a small human being is able to make a huge and powerful animal like an elephant sit. In old Sanskrit the word kadara was more common than the word aunkusha, but in the Sanskrit of subsequent times, especially the Sanskrit of the Buddhist era, the use of the word kadara decreased significantly. We see the word aunkusha used in all cases for the weapon in the hand of the Buddhist gods and goddesses; the word kadara has not been used. About the Buddhist Tantric goddess, S&#x301;od&#x301;ashii, it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;sha&#x301;nkushasharaca&#x301;padha&#x301;rin&#x301;ii<br>Shiva&#x301; S&#x301;od&#x301;ashiiru&#x301;pa&#x301; shivabha&#x301;vinii<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->The eighth meaning of the word kadara is &ldquo;purdah&rdquo;. The word parda&#x301; [purdah] is of Persian origin. &ldquo;Purdah&rdquo; means not only a curtain on the window or over the door, it means a piece of cloth covering the head and face of a woman (i.e., a veil); it means that a woman must not move freely outside the house; it also means keeping the women covered in burkas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->The purdah was not in use among the ancient Aryans. It was originally a Semitic concept. Indian women did not use the purdah before the Pathan rule.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  The Sanskrit word avagun&#x301;t&#x301;hana [&ldquo;veil&rdquo;] is not an ancient word. (The Hindustani word ghunghat&#x301; [&ldquo;veil&rdquo;] was used in the olden days in the sense of covering.) In those parts of India where the Pathans were not firmly established, for instance in south India and Maharastra, the veil was not introduced at all; to this day there is no such custom. Married women in ancient Maharastra never used to veil themselves &ndash; it was optional. Widows did not need to use a veil if they chose not to. Even where the Pathans were firmly established, the aborigines living in the hills and forests did not use the purdah. Today as well there is no custom of veiling oneself among the tribal women of Bengal and north India. Although the Santhals of Bengal are now totally identified with the Bengali mainstream, Santhal women do not use veils to this day.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Although the burka or veil was not in use in ancient times, and women were not prohibited from leaving their own houses, the system of using purdahs on doors and windows has been customary since ancient times.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In those few pictures as well that remain in existence from the pre-Pathan era, purdahs can be seen on the doors and windows of the royal palaces. In Sanskrit, as well as in old Bengali, the word kadara was used for the purdah over doorways and windows. In Bengali you can quite properly use this word kadara. You can use it because, as I said, while purdah refers to this living-behind-the-purdah, kadara doesn&#146;t &ndash; it only means the English &ldquo;curtain&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The ninth meaning of the word kadara is &ldquo;miserly&rdquo; or &ldquo;follower of undesirable nature&rdquo;. Among the several meanings of the Sanskrit word kadarya, the two most important are: (1) &ldquo;one who maintains an undesirable nature&rdquo;; and (2), &ldquo;miserly&rdquo;. The word had two prevalent forms: one was kadarya and the other was kadariya, or kadara. In this case also, one meaning of the word kadariya or kadara was &ldquo;miserly&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Kandarpa<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->The colloquial meaning of the word kandarpa is &ldquo;the god of love&rdquo;, that is Madana, or Atanu &ndash; Cupid in western mythology. The word&#146;s etymological meaning is as follows: The meaning of the word kam is &ldquo;worldly desire&rdquo; &ndash; getting name and fame, or realizing different other types of worldly desires. Worldly desire creates heat in a person&#146;s brain and that heat afflicts the mental body as well; much of the person&#146;s potential is thoroughly wiped out. Excessive fascination with matter destroys the vast potential of human beings. There was one famous Bengali philologist who was ruined by drinking too much wine; there was a famous poet who lost the vibrational power of his brain through excessive attraction to matter. This dwelling-on-matter thrusts the human being down the path of destruction; dwelling on matter engulfs one&#146;s entire existence in flames and puts an end to it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Kam + darpa = kandarpa. Kam means &ldquo;the desire to obtain something worldly&rdquo;; the verbal root drp means &ldquo;to burn furiously&rdquo;. By adding the suffix ac it becomes darpa. Thus the etymological meaning of the word kandarpa is &ldquo;one who burns up their entire existence through worldly thinking&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

Its etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which, when wet, gets thoroughly soaked&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is ka&#x301;ntha&#x301; [a patchwork cotton sheet]. Another meaning of the word kantha&#x301; or kanthika&#x301; is &ldquo;veil&rdquo;, or that which is used to cover the body. As you all are certainly aware, that region which at one time was covered with a veil of knowledge was called kanthika&#x301; in Sanskrit. From this word kanthika&#x301; we get the word ka&#x301;nthi which is a subdivisional town in present-day Midnapore District.<!-- /block --></p>

Originally, balls used to be made from cloth, but since cloth balls did not last very long people in ancient Bengal started making balls from the shoots of young bamboo. The well-known modern game of polo originated in Manipur&#146;s Kobe Valley. After the defeat of Tikendrajit, when Manipur became a tributary state under the British, they included the Kobe Valley in the then British province of Burma. After the British left Burma and India, the Kobe Valley remained a part of Burma. Nowadays the part of Manipur which is accepted as Indian territory is a state in India, but the Kobe Valley is part of Burma. Originally, only royal princes used to play the horse-riding game of polo. For that a very hard ball was needed. The kind of bamboo that was used, used to grow in the eastern portion of Rarh in slightly salty soil. Still today the best bamboo for making polo balls grows in the Uluberia subdivision of Howrah District and in Midnapore District&#146;s Tamluk subdivision.<!-- /block --></p>

I went to Allahabad to deliver a lecture on Indian philosophy in response to an invitation from the university. Usually I don&#146;t accept such invitations, but this particular case was a little different and more significant for me. First I knew many of the university administration and teaching staff, and secondly the university of Allahabad was highly reputed and influential. My lecture was complete by evening and I left Allahabad city without delay for Muzaffarpur, where I had some important work. Suddenly, at the waiting room at Rambag railway station I happened to meet Sutanuka&#x301; and her son Himava&#x301;n.

<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->I realized her difficulty.

It was expected that Aru&#x301;pratan take a local train from Calcutta to Burdwan and reach home at about 10 A.M. the same day. That was finally decided.

<a name="76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->Though Sutanuka&#x301; and her family were living at Burdwan they originally belonged to the Mitra family of Konnagar. Towards the end of Pathan rule, an intellectual society grew up in Hooghly District on the west bank of the river Bha&#x301;giirathii. Konnagar was one of the intellectual centres. In those days the Ra&#x301;y Mitras of Konnagar were the landlords. Konnagar was considered as one of the most cultured and well-educated villages of Hooghly District of Rarh. Moreover it was one of the most famous places in the whole of Bengal. Its original name was Karn&#x301;anagar. The people said that in Bengal if there was only one nagar or town it would be Karn&#x301;anagar. That is why the town&#146;s name could often be heard during a conversation between intellectuals. If anyone was asked, &ldquo;Which is the best town to go to?&rdquo; he or she would reply, &ldquo;There is only one town. Why should you ask &lsquo;Which town [Kon nagar in Bengali]?&rsquo; &ndash; There is only one town: Konnagar.&rdquo; And that is how the place became known as Konnagar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->I said to Sutanuka&#x301;, &ldquo;The name of the city we&#146;re about to leave is known as Allahabad city, but formerly it was called Praya&#x301;ga. It&#146;s a fact that Praya&#x301;ga is older than Konnagar. It was built towards the end of the Yajurvedic period six thousand years ago. But Burdwan is even more ancient than Praya&#x301;ga. During Pathan rule Praya&#x301;ga was renamed Allahabad (Abode of Allah). Since then its popularity has been increasing. The Shia Moslems named the city Illahabad, but during the Mughal period, the prosperous growth of the city was checked. Thereafter, the city again began to flourish towards the end of the British rule when it became the capital of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (UP for short).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;In the pre-Buddhist era Burdwan was the capital of Rarh. In the Buddhist and Jain era it remained Rarh&#146;s capital.

It was just a cultured village of Burdwan District (the district of Hooghly was not created then). Iishan Chandra Ghosh, the renowned Bengali scholar of medieval Bengal; Rama Chandra Ghosh, the illustrious logician and author of scriptures; Pra&#x301;n&#x301;atosa&#x301; Biswas, the most erudite Sanskrit and scriptural scholar; and Dr. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;adhan Ghosh (Aurobinda&#146;s father), the first Bengali District Medical Officer (DMO) and Civil Surgeon, were all born in Konnagar.&rdquo; Then I turned towards Himava&#x301;n and said, &ldquo;Your father was born at Konnagar but you belong to Burdwan.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->He pointed out, &ldquo;You told us a little while ago that Konnagar was within Burdwan District.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->I said, &ldquo;That&#146;s a hundred per cent true.&rdquo; We were travelling from west to east &ndash; from ancient Brahma&#x301;vartta or Brahmars&#x301;idesh to the ancient Ka&#x301;shii kingdom. That part of the Gangetic valley is considered as the middle part of the Ganges river civilization. The Praya&#x301;ga area is considered as the upper part of the Ganges river civilization. The area stretching from Praya&#x301;ga to the confluence of the rivers Shone and Ganges is the middle part of the Ganges river civilization. And the area from the Shone-Ganges confluence to Sahebganj is considered as the Gaod&#x301;a&#x301; part of the Ganges river civilization. The area from Sahebganj, where the Ganges starts flowing southward, to Gangasagar is known as the final part of the Ganges valley civilization or Gaod&#x301;iiya civilization. The Gaod&#x301;iiya civilization is most developed where the rivers of Rarh &ndash; carrying with them the local cultural specialities of Rarh civilization &ndash; and the Brahmaputra river, coming from the northeast &ndash; carrying with it the flow of Mongolian civilization merge into the Ganges. The part of the Ganges valley civilization which was the home land of the pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya and Gaod&#x301;iiya civilization cannot be called the Aryan civilization in the proper sense of the term. Actually, it is the east India civilization or extended Ganges delta civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->So the area from Allahabad to Ka&#x301;shii or Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii (here Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii means Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;ii-Gan&#x301;d&#x301;ak &ndash; not the Bur&#x301;i Gan&#x301;d&#x301;ak of Muzaffarpur and Samastipur) is part of the pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya civilization. Burdwan can be considered as the nucleus of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;iiya civilization, and Konnagar as the main source of the Gaod&#x301;iiya civilization which is itself based on the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;iiya civilization. &ldquo;So you see, Himava&#x301;n, your Burdwan and your father&#146;s Konnagar are both bathed in the light of the same golden moon.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->Himava&#x301;n was a B.Sc. student, but I was amazed by his ardent interest in river-valley civilizations. Even though he was a young boy he had an unusually keen interest in the origins of civilization. He asked me, &ldquo;Uncle, different species of plants, trees and animals and a particular human civilization have followed the Ganges downstream from its source in Gaun&#x32D;gottarii. Similarly, other species of plants, trees and animals as well as a different human civilization have followed the banks of the river Yamuna downstream from its source at Yamunottarii. What is the result of the merging of the two rivers, the Ganges and Yamuna, at Praya&#x301;ga?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->I answered, &ldquo;That&#146;s a good question. Just as the river Ganges has brought with her saffron-coloured clay, special types of flora and fauna and its own alluvium, the river Yamuna has also carried her own distinct characteristics down from her source. A little further downstream, another river, the Charma&#x301;nvatii or Chambal, carrying the special characteristics of the western Indian civilization of Ma&#x301;lava and Bundelkhan&#x301;d&#x301;a merges into the Yamuna. In this area a new mixed civilization occurred which can be called the Baghelii civilization. The Yamuna carried this mixed civilization, and merged its black waters into the Ganges at Praya&#x301;ga. So, the middle stage of the Gangetic valley civilization starts from Praya&#x301;ga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The Gangetic river valley civilizations upriver and downriver from Praya&#x301;ga are not the same. The middle stage lying to the south of the Ganges continues up to the Ganga-Shon&#x301; confluence at Patna, and that lying to the north continues up to the Ganges-Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;ii confluence near Hajipur. After that the pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya civilization starts there. Comparatively speaking the Austric influence is comparatively less than the Mongol-Tantric influence. This area has been known as Trihotriiya Bhu&#x301;mi since ancient times. On the south of the Ganges, after the Ganga-Shon&#x301; confluence, the Pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya civilization starts no doubt, but there the Mongol-Tantric influence is less than the Gondawana influence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;From the ethnological point of view, there is a difference between Trihotriiya Bhu&#x301;mi and Magadha Bhu&#x301;mi. In the physical structure of the people of Trihotriiya Bhu&#x301;mi the Austric influence is less than the Mongolian influence. Black people are few in number. From the complexion of the people in Magadha it is evident that the Mongolian influence is almost nil. Flat-nosed people are very few. There are many black-complexioned people but with aquiline noses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Although Trihotriiya Bhu&#x301;mi (Videha or, Mithila&#x301;) and Magadha belong to the same language group, the Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta group, the Maethilii language belongs to the Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii group, and the Magahii language belongs to the Western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii group. The difference in intonation of the languages is particularly discernible, yet both languages belong to the pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya Gangetic Civilization, is noticed in Anga Bhu&#x301;mi, where the Trihotriiya and Ma&#x301;gadhii cultural characteristics have blended into one. These characteristics came in contact with the Gaod&#x301;iiya civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This Gangetic valley civilization has been transformed into pure Gaod&#x301;iiya civilization or deltaic civilization where the River Ganges and the Vindhya Range have come closest to each other near Sahebganj in Angadesh, and from that point the Ganges flows southwards.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->Himava&#x301;n said, &ldquo; I want to do research on the subject when I&#146;m grown up.

After a while we&#146;ll reach Benares city by narrow gauge. I&#146;d like to know how deep the Vedic influence was in this area which you describe as the second part of the Gangetic Valley civilization.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->I replied, &ldquo;Look, as far as I understand, the land of Rarh is the land where Sanskrit originated. But the ancient language which we describe as the Vedic language came to India from the northwest along with the Aryans. The Aryans first migrated to the Sindhu-Saoviira, and the land of Sapta-Sindhu, the Seven Rivers (Sutlej or Shatadru, Bias or Vipa&#x301;sha, Ravi or Ira&#x301;vatii, Chenub or Candrabha&#x301;ga&#x301;, Jhelum or Vitasta&#x301;, Kabul and Sind). These seven rivers together are known as the Sapta-Sindhu. Later on the land became known as the Punjab, that is, the land of five rivers. The names of two rivers have been dropped, so there remain only five.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This is the first phase of the Vedic influence in India. In the second phase the Aryans moved further southeast: their influence pervaded in the northern part of the Yamuna valley. That area was known as Haritadha&#x301;nya or the &lsquo;Land of Green Vegetation&rsquo; (Haritadha&#x301;nya &rarr; Hariaha&#x301;nna &rarr; Hariha&#x301;na &rarr; Hariya&#x301;na).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Then, in the next phase, the Aryans reached Praya&#x301;ga around the Ganga-Yamuna valley. This we can describe as the third phase of the Vedic influence. Then they moved farther east, and their influence extended to the Gan&#x301;da&#x301;kii river on the north and the Shon River on the south. This can be called the fourth phase of the Vedic influence. In this area was situated the ancient Ka&#x301;shiira&#x301;jya or Kingdom of Ka&#x301;shii. We are now journeying through the Ka&#x301;shiira&#x301;jya. One thing to be noted here is that in the first phase, the Vedic language left two daughters behind: Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya and Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta. In the languages born out of this Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya and Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta (for example, Pashto, Punjabi, etc.) there is a multitude of derived words from the Vedic language. In the second phase, that is, in the Hariya&#x301;navii language, the percentage of Vedic-derived words is somewhat less. In the third stage, the percentage of the Vedic-derived words is still less, for instance in languages like Ma&#x301;r&#x301;oya&#x301;rii, Har&#x301;aotii, Bundelii, Ba&#x301;ghelii, Avadhii, and Vrajabha&#x301;s&#x301;a, etc. And in the languages of the fourth stage, like Bhojpurii, the percentage of Vedic-derived words is still less. But no one should misunderstand that in the fourth stage the Vedic influence was nil. No doubt the direct Vedic influence in the fourth stage was nil, but the indirect influence in pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya and Gaod&#x301;iiya civilizations was tremendous, and that influence still persists even today.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->Sutanuka&#x301; said, &ldquo;I&#146;ve noted with interest that in the fourth stage the external appearance of the people and the size of the cattle are quite different from those of the pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya and Gaod&#x301;iiya civilizations.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->Then I said, &ldquo;You&#146;re right in your observation.

<a name="106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->He answered, &ldquo;Yes, I was,&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Perhaps you know that Great Britain is a small country; the distance from any part of Britain to the ocean is not more than fifty miles. So naturally in that country there cannot be any large river: the distance between the source of a river and the ocean cannot be very great. Yet if we move along the banks of certain rivers, there is a difference between the civilization of the upper areas of the river and the lower ones, and there is also a variation in language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Take for example the case of the river Thames: it is not a big river, either in width or in breadth. The part of the river Thames where the ships sail is not really a river, it is only an estuary of the sea, just like the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; river near Canning. Many people think that the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; is perhaps a wide and large river. They may think that in olden days the southern branch of the river Yamuna (Vidya&#x301;dharii) emerging from the Ganges at Trivenii, moved southwards, and then it and the southeastern tributary of the Ganges (Piya&#x301;lii) both flowed separately for a certain distance and then joined together to form the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; river. Though this is a fact, yet the collective waters of these two combined rivers is quite small. In fact, the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; river is nothing but the estuary of the sea entering into the land.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The deltaic portion of the river Thames is somewhat similar. The more one proceeds down the river from the source of the Thames, the greater is the Anglo-Saxon and Norman influence. If one moves from the southern bank of the Thames towards the Straights of Dover, there is still a tremendous Norman influence, like a subterranean flow. If one moves from the northern side of the river towards the port of Grimsby on the delta at the coast, there is a greater Anglo-Saxon influence than Norman influence. If one moves towards the coast, the Norman influence becomes negligible. Where there is Norman influence, there are large numbers of Latin derivations in the spoken language. Where the Anglo-Saxon influence is predominant, the number of Latin derivative words is comparatively little. The difference in intonation in the respective areas, too, is quite discernible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If one moves towards the opposite part of the Thames river, or towards Wales in the west, the ancient Briton influence is not negligible, even in the spoken language. This is the reason why, though Welsh is a language of a small country, yet it has certain specialities of its own. Even the difference in people&#146;s external appearance, though not very prominent, is not negligible either.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->I said, &ldquo;You are right, Aru&#x301;p, in your observation. I notice that both you and Himava&#x301;n are equally interested in river valley civilizations. I was not aware of this before!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p blushed and smiled faintly. He said, &ldquo;Perhaps you once said that in our land of Rarh, on either bank of the Bakreshvar river in central Birbhum, there is a local civilization which, though small in area, has its own speciality even in the style of its temples and also in its terracotta works. There is also a difference in the use of verbal forms in the spoken language of that area. Similarly, in southern Birbhum also, there is a small river called the Kopa&#x301;i (Kupita or &lsquo;angry&rsquo;) in whose valleys there is also some sort of local civilization. As far as I remember, someone said that the water of the Bakreshvar valley is one of the best for it is full of sulphur. But the water of Kopa&#x301;i valley, though it is as good as that of many places in Bengal, is not as good as that of the Bakreshvar valley. The two small rivers, with their own distinctive streams of water, flow from the west to the east, carrying the rhythmic songs of the most ancient human civilization, in cadence with the dancing rhythms of the land of Rarh. When the two rivers meet at Melanpur (meaning &lsquo;meeting place&rsquo;) at one end of the area under the jurisdiction of the Nanur police station, they are known as Kuye, and at that point both their local civilizations become blended. Melanpur really joins the two rivers in all respects. If one listens intently to the local dialect, one will hear a particular drawled intonation which is lacking in west Birbhum. Besides this, other local variations also came into being there.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph -->I said, &ldquo;You are right, Aru&#x301;p. Really I am delighted by your description. The specialities of the river valley civilizations are very distinct in our Birbhum. In the upper reaches of Birbhum, the spoken language has no drawled intonation: it is one of the flawless branches of the Rarh language. But in the lower reaches of Birbhum, the same Rarh dialect has a local drawl &ndash; have you noticed it?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p said, &ldquo;Yes, I have. This subtle difference in intonation between the area of the Khayra&#x301;sol police station and the La&#x301;bpur police station, and again, between the Khayra&#x301;sol police station and the Mayureshvar police station, can be easily discerned only by listening to it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="114"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=114 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p said, &ldquo;Though it is not directly concerned with culture, still it is a funny story&#8230;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="115"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=115 type=paragraph -->I looked at Aru&#x301;p and asked him, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p said, &ldquo;At Khayra&#x301;sol in the upper reaches of Birbhum, there is a widespread use of poppy seed, whereas in the lower reaches, the use of poppy seed is less by five to seven per cent. That is to say, in the upper reaches there is an empire of poppies, and in the lower reaches there is merely a kingdom of poppies!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p burst into laughter. I too joined in his laughter. To continue, I said, &ldquo;The other symbols of Rarh culture &ndash; like d&#x301;im&#x301;le [a type of pumpkin], kher&#x301;o [another type of pumpkin], green gram, jhumur dance are equally popular in both the upper and lower reaches.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;pratan smiled, and said with a voice growing in excitement, &ldquo;Yes brother, I&#146;ve noticed that too. You see, although I live in Burdwan in central Rarh, I was actually born in Konnagar in the low-lying area of Rarh. In our place also, pumpkin and green gram are very popular, and people can hardly live without poppyseed.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;By the way, Aru&#x301;p&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;you rushed into this compartment at exactly nine o&#146;clock.

<a name="120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;pratan exclaimed in wide-eyed amazement, &ldquo;What! Did Sutanuka&#x301; and Himava&#x301;n come here?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Don&#146;t you know that?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;They accompanied me in this very compartment from Allahabad City and got off the train in Benaras. They were in a hurry to get to Ka&#x301;shii where they were planning to catch an evening train which would get them to Burdwan by dawn on Wednesday morning. They told me that you were expected to land at Dumdum airport at around the same time, and that you would take a local train from Howrah to Burdwan, reaching there at about ten the same day. They have the keys of the house, so if you were to arrive there before them you would be put to great trouble. They knew they had to reach Burdwan by dawn on Wednesday by any means.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No, I didn&#146;t see them,&rdquo; said Aru&#x301;pratan. &ldquo;I missed them at Benaras railway station. But what you said was correct: I was expected to arrive at Burdwan at ten on Wednesday morning.&rdquo; He paused for a while and then continued. &ldquo;They shouldn&#146;t catch any train which will get them there late at night or at dawn &ndash; I apprehend some danger.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If you sense some impending danger, under no circumstances should they catch any Burdwan train at that particular time.

They have to be prevented from taking any of those Burdwan trains.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;That&#146;s a good idea. That&#146;s a good idea.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph -->The train slowed down. We were approaching a station, no doubt. Aru&#x301;pratan jumped to his feet, rushed to the door, and, looking like a bird ruffled by a raging tempest, leapt onto the platform without waiting for the train to stop. He had reason enough to be worried.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->As soon as the train stopped my private secretary hurriedly entered my compartment. I guessed he had just finished his dinner of lit&#x301;t&#x301;i [a type of fried, unleavened bread] with his in-law. Perhaps his in-law had also served him kar&#x301;iibar&#x301;ii [a type of dumpling made of chick-pea flour and served in yoghurt water] and ma&#x301;kha&#x301;na ks&#x301;iir [a type of sweet rice] for dessert. My private secretary sat beside me and asked me if I had been inconvenienced in any way. I said I hadn&#146;t. Our train was moving from west to east across the border of the ancient Ka&#x301;shii state. I had told Himava&#x301;n that this was the last area to come under Aryan influence. In the fourth phase of the Aryan invasion of India, Ka&#x301;shii can be regarded as a border state of northern India (A&#x301;rya&#x301;vartta). The River Sarayu not only carried the Aryan influence along its banks but also Mongol and to some extent Austric influence as well. That is why its eastern bank was considered as non-Aryan land. Later on this boundary was further extended to the River Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii (Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;ii Gan&#x301;d&#x301;ak). The Ka&#x301;nyakubja Brahmans of those days did not like to cross the River Sarayu. As the land on the other bank was non-Aryan it was considered unholy. They were afraid they would lose their Aryan purity. Those Ka&#x301;nyakubja Brahmans who dared to cross the river, being lured by the fertile land of the trans-Sarayu area, were declared outcastes. They lost their identity as Ka&#x301;nyakubja Brahmans and became known as Sa&#x301;rayupa&#x301;rii Brahmans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->During Pathan rule, the last boundary of A&#x301;rya&#x301;vartta was the present Ghazipur District. In those days north India consisted of three Subas [administrative divisions]: Suba Ba&#x301;nga&#x301;l on the east, Suba Punjab on the northwest and Suba Hindostan between the two. Even today, the people of Bengal and the Punjab call the inhabitants of the middle part of northern India &ldquo;Hindustani&rdquo;. Some people are of the opinion that Hindustan means the whole of India and thus why should the inhabitants of a small part of India be called Hindustani. But this is wrong, because the term &ldquo;Hindustani&rdquo; is used for the people who were once the inhabitants of Suba Hindostan, and not in the sense of Hindustan as being the whole of India. During the Mughal period when Akbar divided his empire into fifteen subas, the name of the northern part of Suba Hindostan was Oudh and the southern part, Suba Agra. Ghazipur District was the last boundary of Suba Agra. On the east of Ghazipur District lies Balia District. Previously it was only a subdivision of Ghazipur District. Similarly, there was no Deoria District in those days. It was only a subdivision of Gorakhpur District.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->The British occupied both Agra and Oudh Subas and made one administrative area out of them &ndash; the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (UP for short) with its capital at Allahabad. In the last part of British rule, the capital was moved to Lucknow. Anyway, there was a marked influence of Mongol and Austric cultures on the Aryan society inhabiting the Sarayu&#x301; river valley. Later on many Aryans crossed the Sarayu&#x301; river and declared the banks of the Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii as the boundary line of A&#x301;rya&#x301;vartta. The area lying on the west of the Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii valley was called Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;ya and the area on the east was called Videha or Mithila&#x301;. This latter area was not considered as an Aryan colony. I personally consider it as part of the area covered by the pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya Gangetic valley civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->King Mithi occupied Videha. To sanctify the land he held a Trihotriiya&#x301; Yajin&#x32D;a [a big sacrifice presided over by three priests]. It was then declared sacred. The land sanctified by the performance of a Trihotriiya&#x301; Yajin&#x32D;a was named Trihut. The land of Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;ya, although not widely valued by the Aryans, was respected by the Buddhists. Lord Buddha visited it a couple of times. Later, it became known as Sha&#x301;ran&#x301;a (Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;ya &rarr; Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;a &rarr; Sha&#x301;ran&#x301;a).

<a name="129"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=129 type=paragraph -->On the north of Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;ya was the ancient and famous place, Champaka&#x301;ran&#x301;ya. A reference is made to it in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a [one of the two great Sanskrit epics] (Campaka&#x301;ran&#x301;ya &rarr; Campa&#x301;ran&#x301;ya &rarr; Camparan&#x301;). Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;ya and Campaka&#x301;ran&#x301;ya are situated in the Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;ii-Gan&#x301;d&#x301;aka valley. On the eastern bank is Videha or Mithila&#x301; or Trihut, the land which was occupied by King Mithi. Mithi + la&#x301; [holder] + d&#x301;a [suffix] + a&#x301; [feminine suffix] = Mithila&#x301;. In the Buddhist period one of the famous villages of Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;ya was Hatthiigra&#x301;m (Hastiigra&#x301;ma in Sanskrit). Buddha visited this place a couple of times. It is now known as Ha&#x301;thoya&#x301;. During British rule the Ha&#x301;thoya&#x301; estate was one of the biggest estates in India. Then came the river Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii &ndash; Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;ii Gan&#x301;d&#x301;aka. The biggest cattle fair in India, known as the Hariharks&#x301;etra fair, is held once a year on the banks of this river. Nearby is the Shon&#x301;pur railway station.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="130"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=130 type=paragraph -->Immediately after crossing the Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii river bridge at Shon&#x301;pur we reached Mithila&#x301;. During the Mughal period and the early part of British rule, the Mithila&#x301; division of Bengal Presidency consisted of three districts: Trihut, Champaran and Sha&#x301;ran&#x301;. The district headquarters of Champaran was Motiha&#x301;ri, that of Sha&#x301;ran&#x301; was Cha&#x301;pra, and that of Trihut was Muzaffarpur. This latter district was named after Muzaffar Shah. It covered a wide area and until the early part of the British period its fertile soils were thickly forested. The forests contained abundance of numerous species of flora and fauna, notably tigers, antelopes, crocodiles, panthers and deer. The lake on the ancient river course of the river Lakhandei covered a larger area in those days and was surrounded by extensive forest full of abundant flora and fauna. A major part of the forest was part of the king of Darbhanga&#146;s estate. Some of it was within the Shu&#x301;ras&#x301;an&#x301;d&#x301;a kingdom, and some part belonged to the estate of the Bettiah king. People today, out of necessity, but also out of immense greed have destroyed most of the forest, particularly in Trihut District.<!-- /block --></p>

The Trihut District as well as Mithila&#x301; were located partly in the Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;ii-Gan&#x301;d&#x301;aka valley and partly in the Bur&#x301;igan&#x301;daka and Lakhandei valleys.

<a name="132"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=132 type=paragraph -->Trihut District was quite large in area. The British divided it into two parts: Muzaffarpur District in the west with its headquarters at Muzaffarpur, and Darbhanga District in the west with its headquarters at Laheriasarai village (which has since become so large that it almost touches the city of Darbhanga. The old Muzaffarpur District is now divided into three districts: Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur and Vaeshali (Hazipur). This is the same Muzaffarpur which was considered as one of the most cultured places in the whole of the then Suba Ba&#x301;nga&#x301;l. The old Darbhanga District has since also been divided into three districts: Madhubanii (a place where there is an abundance of forest honey); Darbhanga, named after the famous Da&#x301;r&#x301;ibhanga&#x301; Shah (In Maethilii the town is called &ldquo;Dair&#x301;bhanga&rdquo; but spelt Dar&#x301;ibhanga&#x301;); and Samastipur, named after Samasti Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan Ray).<!-- /block --></p>

King Prthvii Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan Shah established the Gorkha empire in Nepal at this time. The Gorkhas occupied Tirhut District and advanced up to Hazipur. Thereafter they were defeated by the British (The British commander-in-chief was General Octorloney in whose name the Englishmen living in Calcutta built a war memorial. In recent times, the leaders, ignorant of history, have changed the name of the Octorloney Memorial to Shahiid Minar [Martyrs&#146; Column]) and were forced to sign the Treaty of Sugaoli (Champaran District). According to the terms of the treaty, the British got possession of Garhwal and Kumayun regions from Nepal, which was included in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, and they also reclaimed a major portion of Champaran and Trihut Districts. Part of the northern portion of Trihut was left in Nepal and is still part of Nepalese territory. The former capital of Mithila&#x301;, Janakpur, is situated in that area.

I arrived home about a week later, my mind full of pleasant memories. Waiting for me on the table was a letter from Himava&#x301;n, sent from Burdwan, in which he wrote: &ldquo;Dear Uncle, We had an unforgettable experience on our return to Burdwan. We left Ka&#x301;shii late Tuesday evening and were sure that we would reach home either late Tuesday night or Wednesday morning at dawn. Late into the night, mother and I were discussing river-valley civilizations when we suddenly heard a huge crash and felt a severe jolt. I don&#146;t remember ever having heard such a loud noise in all my life. In a fraction of a second the train seemed to be smashed into pieces. There was commotion all around &ndash; people were screaming &ndash; chaos reigned everywhere. Mother and I were violently thrown out of the derailed compartment. Pieces of train and the passengers&#146; baggage were scattered here and there. We realized we were the victims of a tragic accident &ndash; who knows how many were lying dead. Both of us were violently thrown towards part of the derailed train, screaming desperately. Suddenly both of us perceived my father (Sri Aruprathan Mitra) rushing towards us. He grabbed each of us by the hand and pulled us out of the wreckage, saving us from the jaws of inevitable death. What happened next we cannot say, for we both became unconscious.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="135"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When the rays of the rising sun fell onto our faces we regained consciousness and, looking around, discovered that we were lying on a hay-stack on the edge of a paddy field beside the railway line. As we had fallen onto hay our injuries were not severe &ndash; just a few bruises. A crowd of villagers had gathered around us. We saw the wreckage of the train in the distance and heard the pitiful screams and lamentations of the seriously wounded. The local people were very kind, as the people of Burdwan usually are. On seeing the slightest hardship of others, tears come into their eyes. Those people standing around us desperately wanted to help and kept asking what they could do to make us feel more comfortable. They were prepared to do anything to help. We asked them to look for my father and to bring him to where we were lying. They searched everywhere for him, but without success. &lsquo;There&#146;s no one called Aru&#x301;pratan Mitra here,&rsquo; they said. They helped us get to our feet &ndash; which we could only do with great difficulty &ndash; so that we could also look for him. But our search was also unsuccessful &ndash; he was not to be seen anywhere. By that time the railway auxiliary van had arrived from Burdwan. We approached the authorities and with their help returned to Burdwan. The site of the accident was near Burdwan so we didn&#146;t have much difficulty getting home.<!-- /block --></p>

The ground staff informed us that they had received no news as to the plane&#146;s whereabouts, nor was it possible for them to find out for reasons of military security.

Another meaning of kaparda is &ldquo;Shiva&#146;s matted hair&rdquo;. The third meaning of kaparda is &ldquo;a medium of exchange, or buying and selling&rdquo;, or &ldquo;coin&rdquo;. A fourth meaning of kaparda is t&#x301;ya&#x301;na&#x301;, nya&#x301;kr&#x301;a&#x301;, ka&#x301;ni, nya&#x301;ta&#x301; [rag]. A rag is a torn piece of cloth that poor people use as clothes. In earlier days it used to be said: Jeler paran&#x301;e t&#x301;ya&#x301;na&#x301; Nika&#x301;riir ka&#x301;n&#x301;e son&#x301;a&#x301; [&ldquo;The rags worn by the fishermen are gold in the ears of the Nikarii fish merchants&rdquo;]. The people who went out in the burning sun and the rain to catch fish had to spend their entire days wearing rags, while the people who sold the fish became rich and wore ornaments in their ears.<!-- /block --></p>

Nya&#x301;kr&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;a piece of cloth&rdquo;. Ka&#x301;ni has the same meaning. The word nya&#x301;kr&#x301;a&#x301; comes from the word nakartta, and the word ka&#x301;ni comes from the word kan&#x301;ika&#x301; [particle], that is, vastrakan&#x301;ika&#x301; [vastra means &ldquo;cloth&rdquo;]. Nya&#x301;ta&#x301;  also means a piece of cloth which is used for scrubbing or for cleaning with cow-dung. A duster which is used for wiping up something is also called nya&#x301;ta&#x301; in Bengali. It should be borne in mind that neta&#x301; [leader] and nya&#x301;ta&#x301; have different meanings as well as different spellings. We should not let them become one. In Sanskrit nya&#x301;ta&#x301; is potanii.  From this potanii has come the word potan/potana&#x301;  which is used in some parts of Magadh, Rarh and Angadesh.<!-- /block --></p>

Its etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which is dear to monkeys&rdquo; or &ldquo;that in which monkeys reside&rdquo;. The colloquial meaning of the word kapittha is &ldquo;stone-apple&rdquo; (Feronium elephantum). In the opinion of some scholars, the original home of the stone-apple is Southeast Asia; others believe that it comes originally from South America (southern Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;dviipa). Although their opinion may be partially correct, it may also not be because the kapittha  has been found in this country since ancient times. Numerous references to it are found in Sanskrit literature. It is true that mango has been in this country since ancient times, and today also it is a forest tree. Although it is only one of a number of examples demonstrating the ancientness of the mango in this country, according to ancient Sanskrit descriptions Hanuman crossed the sea and brought the mango here. Based on this one can venture a guess that the mango came here from across the sea, but there is no such example in Sanskrit literature concerning the kapittha, or stone-apple. Rather references to the stone-apple are seen in small incidents. For example, gajabhuktakapitthavat.  In the Gola&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya it is said: Kapitthaphalavat vishvam&#x301; daks&#x301;in&#x301;ottarayoh samam&#x301;.

That which does a ship&#146;s work at the time of crossing a large reservoir, lake or sea is kapota. That is its etymological meaning. The colloquial meaning of the word kapota is &ldquo;dove&rdquo; and &ldquo;pigeon&rdquo;. In olden days, when the roads were not well-developed, people used to send messages to distant lands with the help of trained pigeons or doves. Generally a letter used to be attached to one of the bird&#146;s limbs. Once those trained doves or pigeons arrived at their destination they would carry back a reply also. This system of mail delivery with the help of these kinds of birds was prevalent for many years on the battlefield. Pigeon-post was even used in some places in India during British rule. From this word kapota or kapotara we get the word kabutara (in Mymensingh Bengali, kaetara). However, for &ldquo;pigeon&rdquo; the word pa&#x301;yra&#x301; is better than the word kabutara because pa&#x301;yr&#x301;a has come from the Sanskrit word pa&#x301;ra&#x301;vata. [Pa&#x301;ra&#x301;vate &rarr; pa&#x301;ra&#x301;a &rarr; pa&#x301;yra.] Pa&#x301;ra&#x301;vata refers only to &ldquo;pigeon&rdquo; and not to &ldquo;dove&rdquo;, but kapota means both &ldquo;pigeon&rdquo; and &ldquo;dove&rdquo;. The feminine form of kapota is kapotii; another meaning of kapotii is &ldquo;a small, ocean-going vessel&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="159"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=159 type=paragraph -->The original home of our well-known gola&#x301; pigeon is Bengal but the laks&#x301;a pigeon came here from outside.

<a name="160"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=160 type=paragraph -->People scatter kernels of grain in front of pigeons, or in their usual path, for them to eat. This scattering is called &ldquo;pigeon-feeding&rdquo;. At the end of autumn, when the paddy fields are somewhat muddy, kernels of grain are scattered in those paddy lands where it is not possible to sow seeds for cultivation in the winter season, or where those seeds will not sprout in the dead of winter, even if sown, for lack of water. These kernels of grain sprout and grow into plants in the spaces between the paddy. When the paddy is harvested, the tops of these plants are also cut.  As a result, more offshoots grow and at the end of the cold season they yield a generous amount of flowers and pods. This type of seed-scattered crop is called the &ldquo;pigeon-harvest&rdquo;. Small lentils, thikre gram or the blackish-coloured small gram, thikre pea (blackish-coloured, small pea), rapeseed, khesa&#x301;ri or teor&#x301;a&#x301; (trikut&#x301;i or tripurii) &ndash; these crops are generally produced as part of the pigeon-harvest. In most parts of Bihar the pigeon-harvest is called pa&#x301;yruya&#x301;. In land where there is no system of irrigation, or where the soil becomes hard or cracked at the end of winter, the produce from the pigeon-harvest is of great benefit to the farmers. Moreover, this pigeon-harvest increases the soil&#146;s power of production, or fertility. As to the surplus, the stalks, pod husks and chaff make excellent bird food and cattle fodder. If mustard is planted it yields khail which can be used as both fertilizer and bird food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="161"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=161 type=paragraph -->Although it is a bit off the subject, it is worth mentioning that, as far as possible, it is better not to feed pigeons by scattering wheat berries, because in many people&#146;s opinion, pigeons may contract dysentery if they eat too much wheat berry [gam]. Godhu&#x301;ma &rarr; gohu&#x301;ma &rarr; gaham &rarr; gam. The word gaham is prevalent in western Rarh and Orissa. That river-water which is transparent like the eyes of a pigeon is called kapota&#x301;ks&#x301;a in masculine gender and kapota&#x301;ks&#x301;ii in feminine gender.

<a name="163"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=163 type=paragraph -->Just as the suffixes &ldquo;kin&rdquo; (mankin), &ldquo;let&rdquo; (armlet, anklet, rivulet), etc. are used in English as diminutives, in Sanskrit the suffixes ru, raka, ruka, etc. are used. For example, a small ma&#x301;nava [human] is a ma&#x301;navaka,  small niiha&#x301;ra [snow or ice] is niiha&#x301;raka, a wild ucche [a bitter-tasting vegetable] is a utsaka, a small dviipa [island] is a dviiparaka (dviiparaka &rarr; dviiaraa &rarr; diiya&#x301;ra&#x301;), a small govatsa [calf] is a vatsaruka (vatsaruka &rarr; vaccharua &rarr; va&#x301;charu &rarr; va&#x301;chur &ndash; in Angika, leru/leruya&#x301;). Thus, ordinarily, the meaning of kapotaka becomes &ldquo;small pigeon&rdquo; or &ldquo;small dove&rdquo;. Yes, the word kapotaka can certainly be used to mean &ldquo;small pigeon&rdquo; or &ldquo;small dove&rdquo;, but its principal meaning is what we call in English &ldquo;antimony&rdquo;, in Sanskrit, rasa&#x301;in&#x32D;jana, in spoken Bengali, rasa&#x301;na &ndash; some people also call it gha&#x301;mtel. There are different varieties of antimony. Some are used as medicine. Some use it as collyrium for the eyes. For all of these there is the same word, kapotaka. In ancient times the central portion of Bengal, especially the northern part of Samatat, that is, Bagri-Murshidabad, Jessore, Nadia, Kust&#x301;hia, and Faridpur contained garjan forests. Garjan oil used to be called rasa&#x301;in&#x32D;jana. While making idols, the craftsmen used to use this rasa&#x301;in&#x32D;jana to give them lustre.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="164"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=164 type=paragraph -->That was a short aside about the sweet soil of the central Bengal region. In the southern portion of central Bengal where the soil is more saline, that is, in the areas of 24 Paraganas, Khulna, Bakharganj, Calcutta, and so on, there was hardly a single garjan tree; instead one found the forests of saline climates &ndash; betel, areca, mangrove, and henta&#x301;l or hinta&#x301;l [a tree similar to palm] (The old name of that village which was established by cutting down the henta&#x301;l jungle was Henta&#x301;lii or Hinta&#x301;lii. This part of Calcutta is nowadays called Entally). Another particular name of the garjan tree or garjan wood is kapotaka. Its juice or sap can also be put to various uses. Garjan wood does not decay easily, thus a great deal of wood used to be exported from the mangrove swamps of Uluberia and north Calcutta to Bengal and north India. Like sundari wood, garjan wood is used in the construction of boats and local ships.<!-- /block --></p>

As a result of it, the seven formative body elements are created. The third health-determining element is kapha, or the liquid, viscous portion of the body. Excess kapha creates spontaneous heat within the body which manifests externally as fever. In traditional Muslim medicine, of course, blood is also considered a fundamental, health-determining element, but this is not so in ayurveda. The word kapha is old Vedic.
