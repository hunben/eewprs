<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the Vedas it is said that He should be accepted as the only object of ideation and the Tantras also say like this. In Tantra it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Tadekam&#x301; Japa&#x301;mah Tadekam&#x301; Smara&#x301;mah<br>Tadekam&#x301; Jagatsa&#x301;ks&#x301;iirupam&#x301; Nama&#x301;mah<br>Tadekam&#x301; Nidha&#x301;nam&#x301; Nira&#x301;lambamiisham&#x301;<br>Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301; Sharan&#x301;am&#x301; Vraja&#x301;mah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tadekam&#x301; japa&#x301;mah.&rdquo; That is, when one is to do japakriya&#x301; only that entity should be the object of japakriya&#x301;. What is japa? It is internal or extro-internal or auto-suggestion. As a result of internal suggestion or extro-internal suggestion or auto-suggestion, what does happen? Not only the intro-external movement of propensities is withdrawn and goaded towards that singular Entity but also the very ectoplasmic structure of the mind gets still more powdered down and becomes one with the cognitive faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tadekam&#x301; smara&#x301;mah&rdquo;. What is smrti? &ldquo;Anubhu&#x301;tivisaya&#x301;sampramos&#x301;ah smrtih&rdquo;. While you conceive something or feel something with the help of your sensory organs, what does happen? The ectoplasmic structure of your mind takes the shape of that external object. Now when you by your interial force recreate that thing after some time within your mind without the help of any external object then this process of re-creation is known as &ldquo;smrti&rdquo;. Suppose you saw a particular bull or a particular animal ten years ago. Now you created it again &ndash; that is, you recreate it within your mind, then the process is known as &ldquo;smrti&rdquo; &ndash; memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Asampramos&#x301;a&rdquo; means recreating of already perceived things. Now what does happen? According to your favourite propensities you unknowingly or knowingly create many external objects that satisfy your thirst regarding that particular propensity. Suppose you are fond of taking rasagolla. Now you could create rasagolla in your mind. But knowingly or unknowingly rasagolla is often created within your mind and during sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; rasagolla automatically comes in your mind and your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is disturbed. Suppose you are thinking that you will take bribe from that man. While doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, what are you doing? &ldquo;Bribe &ndash; bribe &ndash; bribe &ndash; bribe.&rdquo; Just see, your propensive propulsions are channelized towards bribe which disturb the &ldquo;smrti&rdquo; which you want to develop. Because of coolness of the mind during your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; those undesirable elements create a crowd in your mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tadekam&#x301; smara&#x301;mah&rdquo;. Here it has been said that if you are to create any object in your mind, then that Cosmic Entity alone should be created in your mind and no other object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tadekam&#x301; nidha&#x301;nam&#x301; nira&#x301;lambamiisham&#x301;&rdquo;. Wherever there is existence there is movement and there must be a goal; some terminating point. In this universe every thing is moving. You are also moving physically, mentally and spiritually. So here it is said that when you are moving, you must have some goal, must have a terminus, for all your trifarious movements. And here it is said that He is the culminating point. He is the terminating point. He is the Supreme Desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;A&#x301;lamba&rdquo; means &ldquo;physical container&rdquo; &ndash; a fundament. But mental objective is also a&#x301;lamba. In case of mental a&#x301;lamba there is a special word in Sam&#x301;skrta &ndash; &ldquo;a&#x301;bhoga&rdquo;. No entity, physical, psychic or spiritual, can maintain its existence without a fundament &ndash; a container &ndash; or without a pabulum. But in this case He requires no a&#x301;lamba &ndash; no a&#x301;bhoga. That is why He is Nira&#x301;lamba &ndash; beyond container. He is the goal &ndash; the desideratum, and He requires no pabulum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja&#x301;mah.&rdquo; He is just like a big ship plying across a mighty ocean of bhava. What is bhava? That wee-bit portion of reactive momenta which is the cause of rebirth. Bhava is just like a dangerous ocean and that mighty ocean is insurmountable. So to surmount it you require a good, big and strong ship. &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, You are that ship and we are moving towards that ship to take its shelter in order to cross this ocean of bhava.&rdquo; And there is no other way.<!-- /block --></p>
