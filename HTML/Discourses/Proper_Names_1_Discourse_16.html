<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Last week we discussed the inclination for creating words. Often when we speak we say things like ca&#x301;-t&#x301;a&#x301;, ca&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;-bhu&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;, jal-t&#x301;al, nadii-t&#x301;adi, and so on. When we add a second word whose sound rhymes with the first word, are we doing this in error? Or are these added words completely meaningless?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->No, they are not meaningless. Human beings try to find rhythm in everything because human life itself is rhythmic. Movement is the natural characteristic of life so rhythm must exist within human movement. If life&#146;s movement were continuous or linear then there would be no scope for rhythm, and without rhythm there can be no happiness either. So in this universe all movement flows in the waves of systaltic order. It is in this rhythm that one encounters the sweetness inherent in movement. Thus people want rhythm in their actions; they want to enjoy the sweetness of the rhythmicity of movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Human beings also want to preserve this rhythmicity in their language. Mono-syllabic and bi-syllabic words lack rhythm so in this case an effort is made to introduce some rhythmic order. If one says simply ca&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;, ca&#x301;, jal, nadii, etc. the mind does not feel satisfied due to a lack of rhythm; so instead we say ca&#x301;-t&#x301;a&#x301;, ca&#x301;l-culo, jal-t&#x301;al, ca&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;-bhu&#x301;s&#x301;o. Granted, it does take more time to pronounce but it sounds better because one discovers a sense of rhythmic order there. Thus these kinds of words cannot be considered compound words. Rather they should be considered rhythmic words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This reminds me of an interesting story. Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi was the king of Ka&#x301;simba&#x301;ja&#x301;r. He used to remain busy with charity work, so much so that his charitable activities nearly left him destitute. There is a story about his charitableness. Once, during the time when the Maharaja was nearly destitute, a poor Brahman approached him. He told him about his distressful situation and asked him for money to help with the wedding of his daughter. Manindra Chandra was not in a position to give him anything but this made him feel extremely uncomfortable. Suddenly his eyes fell on the hookah he used for smoking tobacco. The basin of the hookah was covered with silver leaf. He told the Brahman: &ldquo;Look, I don&#146;t have anything to give you, but do one thing. Take my hookah. If you sell the silver in it you can get a little money.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Manindra Chandra had another great quality in addition to his charitableness. He was a very humorous fellow. There was a British magistrate who came to this country and learned Bengali quite well. Once he asked Manindra Chandra, &ldquo;Well now, why do you all say things like bha&#x301;t&#x301;-t&#x301;a&#x301;t, d&#x301;a&#x301;l-t&#x301;a&#x301;l in your Bengali language?&rdquo; I have just said that Manindra Chandra had a very humorous nature. Immediately he replied, &ldquo;Look here, educated people like me don&#146;t say things like this. Esab ca&#x301;s&#x301;a-bhu&#x301;sora&#x301;i bale-t&#x301;ale tha&#x301;ke [Only farmers [ca&#x301;s&#x301;a-bhu&#x301;sora&#x301;] talk [bale-t&#x301;ale] this way].&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->A similar kind of thing also happened in Burdwan although it did not concern rhythmic words but rather the different ways in which words are used. One day the magistrate&#146;s orderly, Bhajahari, did not show up for work. The next day the learned gentleman asked Bhajahari in Bengali, &ldquo;Bhajahari, why didn&#146;t you come to work yesterday?&rdquo; Bhajahari replied, &ldquo;Sir, I had a splitting headache yesterday.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The red face of the magistrate got even redder as he asked &ndash; &ldquo;Your head was caught. Who caught it? Why did they catch it? Who would willingly catch it? Grab them and bring them.&rdquo; Anyhow, there is a tendency to pronounce words in this way in all the world&#146;s languages. This is due to rhythm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The other day I was talking about the inclination for naming different places. That day I discussed how the modern pronunciations of certain historically renowned cities like Londres, Moscova and Roma are distortions of their earlier pronunciations, and that these modern distorted pronunciations are not correct. In the case of these foreign words it is distortion or error. There are also many such errors or distortions in Indian naming. In the case of foreign languages, the proper pronunciation of the capital of France is pa&#x301;rii [Paris] because in French a is pronounced like a&#x301;. Here the &ldquo;Pa&rdquo; is pronounced pa&#x301;, the ri is pronounced rii and the s is silent because there is a rule in French that if any consonant other than &ldquo;c&rdquo;, &ldquo;l&rdquo;, &ldquo;f&rdquo;, or &ldquo;r&rdquo; comes at the end of a word then it is silent. Thus the proper pronunciation of &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; is pa&#x301;rii. However ninety-nine percent of the people that I have heard pronounce it &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; instead of pa&#x301;rii. Another mistaken pronunciation that people make is &ldquo;Chicago&rdquo;. The proper pronunciation is shika&#x301;go. In the European languages &ldquo;ch&rdquo; is typically pronounced like sha rather than ca, so in the United States this city&#146;s name is pronounced shika&#x301;go rather than cika&#x301;go.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There is a similar tendency in India&#146;s Assamese language. In Assamese ca is always pronounced like sha. For example, we write tincukiya&#x301; but we read it tinsukiya&#x301;. We write cit&#x301;iba&#x301;c but we read it sit&#x301;iba&#x301;s. Bear in mind that no word on this earth is meaningless. This should be kept in mind in the case of naming. So the distorted or incorrect pronunciation of proper nouns cannot be supported under any conditions. Proper nouns cannot be changed and must not be changed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->At one time all of Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k, all of Samatat&#x301;-Ba&#x301;grii, the western portion of Cat&#x301;t&#x301;al, the southern part of Barendra and east Rarh, that is, east Midnapore, Hooghly, Howrah, east Burdwan and west Murshidabad, were all under water. Thereafter some land rose from the sea due to the accumulation of silt and sand from the Ganges, the Padma and the rivers of Rarh. This kind of silt and sand bank is called dviipa in Sanskrit &ndash; that is, &ldquo;land enclosed by water&rdquo;. After this alluvial land appeared, groups of people began migrating there from Rarh. When Sanskrit words evolve through the Pra&#x301;krta languages they undergo phonetic changes. According to the style of these phonetic changes, the ka, ta, pa, da in Sanskrit words become a in Pra&#x301;krta, especially in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. Thus the Sanskrit dviipa became diia in Pra&#x301;krta and diiya&#x301; or diya&#x301; in Bengali. Many settlements have the word diiya&#x301; included in their name, for example, Nadiiya&#x301; from Navadviipa, Ha&#x301;thiiya&#x301; from Hastiidviipa, Shriiniva&#x301;sdiiya&#x301; from Shriiniva&#x301;sdviipa; Ma&#x301;jhdiiya&#x301; from Madhyadviipa, etc. Since Madhyadviipa became Majjhdiia and then Ma&#x301;jhdiiya&#x301;, it is spelled with jha and dii. People mistakenly write Ma&#x301;jdiya&#x301;. Incidentally, since western Rarh was never underwater you will not find places in western Rarh that have the word diiya included in their name. For the very same reason there are no villages or cities in the far north of Bengal that have diiya&#x301; in their name. On the other hand, there are a whole host of places with diiya&#x301; in their name in Hooghly, east Burdwan, Nadia, 24 Paraganas, Jessore, Khulna, Chittagong, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->I should point out one more thing in this regards. Approximately seven hundred or seven hundred and fifty years ago a terrible ocean storm caused great swells in the waters of the Bay of Bengal. Due to these swells, the water of the Bay of Bengal inundated one hundred and fifty miles inland. All of the settlements in that hundred and fifty miles were wiped out in the blink of an eye. Millions of people, cattle, animals and plants perished in a instant. Gradually the salt waters of the ocean receded and left behind a vast jungle with saline soil. Afterwards the people of western Rarh came in groups with their axes and scythes and other implements, cut down the jungle and colonized the area anew. If you look at the bloodlines of the people of 24 Paraganas you will find that they have come predominantly from Midnapore. Their surnames also reflect this. The spoken language of this region of 24 Paraganas also shows the influence of the languages spoken in the Contai and Tamaluk regions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Everything was destroyed up to Nadia&#146;s Ranaghat. This jungle became filled with tigers, bears, rhinoceri, huge pythons, king cobras, and so on. As recent as a hundred and fifty years ago there were great numbers of rhinoceri in southern Bengal. Acharya Prafullachandra Roy wrote in his autobiography that during his childhood their tenants used to bring home rhinoceros meat. P. C. Roy was from Ra&#x301;r&#x301;ulii village in Khulna District. This village belongs to Pa&#x301;ikga&#x301;ch Tha&#x301;na&#x301; and a large area of this tha&#x301;na&#x301; falls within the Sundarbans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit and Pra&#x301;krta the suffixes aka, raka, ruka, etc. are added to mean &ldquo;small&rdquo;. For example, ma&#x301;nava [person] becomes ma&#x301;navaka [small boy or dwarf]. In English the suffixes &ldquo;let&rdquo;, &ldquo;kin&rdquo;, &ldquo;ock&rdquo;, etc. are added as diminutives. For example, &ldquo;rivulet&rdquo; comes from &ldquo;river&rdquo;, &ldquo;armlet&rdquo; from &ldquo;arm&rdquo;, &ldquo;mankin&rdquo; from &ldquo;man&rdquo;, &ldquo;hillock&rdquo; from &ldquo;hill&rdquo;, and so on. In Sanskrit vatsaruka &rarr; vaccharua &rarr; ba&#x301;chru. From this comes the word ba&#x301;chur [calf]. Go + ruka = goruka &rarr; gorua &rarr; goru [cow] (thus it is spelled with o &ndash; many people incorrectly spell this word garu). Similarly, the suffix raka is added to dviipa to mean &ldquo;small island&rdquo;. As such, dviiparaka &rarr; diiaraa in Pra&#x301;krta &rarr; diiya&#x301;ra&#x301; in Hindi, diiyar in Bhojpuri, dira&#x301; in Angika. However in Angika the word ca-a-r (car) is more common. In the Shershahabad Bengali dialect of Malda District these two words, dira&#x301; and car, are used side by side.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Earlier it was mentioned that the ka, ta, pa and da in Sanskrit words change into a in Pra&#x301;krta, especially in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. Since the Sanskrit word diipa, which means &ldquo;lamp&rdquo; in English, has a pa at the end it changes into diia in Pra&#x301;krta. In the north Indo-Aryan languages it is called diiya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The word a&#x301;vali in Sanskrit denotes &ldquo;many-ness&rdquo; (a&#x301;valii is also correct, just as both kali and kalii are both correct). Thus diipa&#x301;valii in Sanskrit means &ldquo;many lamps&rdquo;. From this comes diia&#x301;oya&#x301;lii in Pra&#x301;krta and diioya&#x301;li (diiwa&#x301;li) in modern Hindi. In modern Bengali it is deoya&#x301;lii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There are some words which were used in old Bengali and medieval Bengali that are no longer used in modern Bengali, for example, Sanskrit darpan&#x301;a &rarr; Pra&#x301;krta dappana &rarr; old Bengali da&#x301;pan. The word da&#x301;pan was used in old Bengali and medieval Bengali but neither this word nor any corruption of it is used in modern Bengali. In medieval Bengali one comes across these lines:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Ha&#x301;ther ka&#x301;m&#x301;kan ma&#x301; leu da&#x301;pana<br>Appane appa&#x301; bujhata nia mana<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->They mean: &ldquo;Don&#146;t take a mirror to see the bracelets on your wrist/Understand yourself with your own mind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Another Sanskrit synonym for &ldquo;mirror&rdquo;, mukura, used to be used in Bengali. Mukura is not used nowadays in the spoken language but it is used in the literary language. The common modern Bengali word a&#x301;rshii is a Sanskrit-derivative. The original Sanskrit word is a&#x301;darshii or a&#x301;darsha, either one. In Hindi both a&#x301;rshii and a&#x301;rsha&#x301; are used and the same holds true in Marathi. A&#x301;yana&#x301;, however, is a Farsi word. A&#x301;yana&#x301; in Farsi means both &ldquo;glass&rdquo; and &ldquo;mirror&rdquo;. A&#x301;yana&#x301; is an unnecessary Farsi word. There is no particular advantage in using the word a&#x301;yana&#x301; when Bengali already has its own word, a&#x301;rshii. While a&#x301;yana&#x301; means ka&#x301;ca [glass] (ka&#x301;ca is a Sanskrit word), the word siisa&#x301; is also used in Farsi for high-quality or thick glass, what is called sphat&#x301;ika in Sanskrit. In Bengali &ldquo;lead&rdquo; is called siisa&#x301;; its Sanskrit name is siisaka. The word siisa&#x301; does not mean &ldquo;glass&rdquo; in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The word cashm in Farsi means &ldquo;eye&rdquo;. The word cashma&#x301; is used in Farsi to mean &ldquo;near the eyes&rdquo;; its Sanskrit equivalent is upanetram. In Bengali none of us say upanetram, nor do we wear upanetram; we wear cashma&#x301; [eyeglasses]. If we give up Farsi we may become cashamkhor&#x301; [shameless] (one who fails to see is called cashamkhor&#x301; in Farsi). Another meaning of the word cashma&#x301; in Farsi is &ldquo;fountain&rdquo;; it also means &ldquo;glass&rdquo; as well. In Kashmiri both cashma&#x301; and na&#x301;ga are used equally for &ldquo;fountain&rdquo;. When fountains or springs are named in Kashmir they are given this kind of name in some places, such as Shes&#x301;na&#x301;g, Anantana&#x301;g, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the word na&#x301;ga has three different meanings. One meaning is &ldquo;mountain spring&rdquo;, the second is &ldquo;mountain python&rdquo;, and the third is &ldquo;mountain mammoth&rdquo;. Samaplus&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; samamashakena samana&#x301;gena sama ebhistribhih lokaeh, that is, no one enjoys any special respect or disrespect from the Supreme Consciousness. A termite or a mosquito is the same as a mountain mammoth, or indeed this entire manifest universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, we were talking about place-names. In Bengal there are a great many native words used for place-names. One such word is d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;. Any settlement which has risen from the sea and which is not very old is a d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;. There are many places in east Rarh and Bagr&#x301;i which include the name d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;, for example, Belda&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;. In Calcutta we find Na&#x301;rkold&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;. The former name of the place in Calcutta which is nowadays called College Square was Pat&#x301;old&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;; that is, the people used to cultivate pat&#x301;ol [wax gourd] in that d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; which has risen from the bosom of the sea. At any rate, if one comes across a settlement with the word d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; included in its name, one can be sure that that settlement has risen from the bottom of the sea. You will come across the word d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; far less in lands which were not under water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Of course the word d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; is also often used to refer to elevated land. In Rarh the word d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;l is used for high land and the word na&#x301;ma&#x301;l is used for low land. There is a locality in Dumka which is called D&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;lpa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;. The town of Suri also has a locality called D&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;lpa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;. There is a place near Asansol, a dry land, called Ta&#x301;ld&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;, however Bankura District&#146;s Ta&#x301;ld&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;ra&#x301; does not come from the word d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In Bengali a very high hill or mountain is called parvata. If it is smaller then it is called pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301; (hill). Even smaller is called pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii (small hill). The station now called Bokaro Steel City was formerly called Mara&#x301; Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;rii. Many people used to mistakenly pronounce it Ma&#x301;ra&#x301;pha&#x301;r&#x301;ii. Mara&#x301; pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii means a small hill of mara&#x301; [dead] stone. I myself have personally crushed and powdered a fistful of the stone from this area with my bare hands; For this reason it has been named Mara&#x301; Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii. Similarly, we get Belpa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii, Senpa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii, Jha&#x301;nt&#x301;ipa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii, Ka&#x301;lipa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii (near Asansol), and so on. Smaller than a pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii is a d&#x301;um&#x301;ri or d&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;ra&#x301; [hillock]. The next smaller is called a t&#x301;ila&#x301; and even smaller is a d&#x301;hibi, for example, ui-d&#x301;hibi [anthill]. Naturally, the name Ta&#x301;ld&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;ra&#x301; comes from the word d&#x301;a&#x301;mra&#x301;. Of course, a cluster of palm trees [ta&#x301;l ga&#x301;ch] is also called ta&#x301;lda&#x301;m&#x301;ra&#x301;. Anyhow it is quite certain that the name does not come from the word d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;. In very old Bengali a t&#x301;ila&#x301; used to be called a t&#x301;a&#x301;l. We come across these lines in the Bengali of twelve hundred years ago:<!-- /block --></p>

Na&#x301;ma&#x301;l land produces a better yield except in the case of paddy which produces a better yield in d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;l land because the soil is clayey. The people of na&#x301;ma&#x301;l land have the conception that if their girls are given in marriage to d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;l boys then they will get bored, because they are forced to eat lots of poppy seed.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So the na&#x301;ma&#x301;l people say &ldquo;Don&#146;t give your daughters in marriage there.

There are many such Austric words used in Bengali and d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; is one of them. These Austric words are also plentiful in the Viirhor&#x301; language. In the Santhali Har&#x301; language Austric words have undergone some alteration. On the other hand, the Ora&#x301;n&#146;s Kuruk language is a Dravidian language. It has very few Austric words. Bengali has many Austric words such as d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;, but Kuruk and other Dravidian languages have very few, although we cannot say that they have none at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The very common Bengali word pallii is originally a Dravidian word. Like Ir&#x301;a&#x301;pallii and Tirucira&#x301;pallii, we also have Bhat&#x301;t&#x301;apallii and Palliigra&#x301;m. No matter how much we try to polish and dress up the word pallii in an effort to pass it off as Sanskrit, it is originally Dravidian. Many people believe that the Bengali word pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; [neighbourhood] is a corruption of the word pallii. In other words, the word Pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;ga&#x301;n comes from Palliigra&#x301;ma. However this is erroneous. It is true that the word ga&#x301;n comes from the word gra&#x301;ma [village] but pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; does not come from pallii. Pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; is an eastern Indian word which is used extensively in Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Nagpuri and Chattisgari. The Hindustani synonym for pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; is muhalla&#x301;. Where we say e pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;y [in this neighbourhood] in Bengali, we say is muhalla&#x301;me in Hindustani. The word muhalla&#x301; comes from Farsi. Incidentally, I should point out that in Sanskrit the word pallii does not mean pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;. In Sanskrit the word pallii means t&#x301;ikt&#x301;iki [a small house lizard] and krkala&#x301;sa means girgit&#x301;i [another variety of lizard]. This t&#x301;ikt&#x301;iki is called chipkalii in Hindi. In Maethilii, Magahii and Bhojpuri it is called bichaotii. In Angika it is called t&#x301;ikt&#x301;ikiya&#x301;, and you all know that in English it is called &ldquo;lizard&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the word nadii refers to both small and large rivers. However in the Austric language common in Rarh all rivers except for very large rivers are called jor&#x301;. In the spoken language of the Ma&#x301;lpa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;ii community of western Rarh the gods used to be called masha&#x301;n. So they named the river which they used to believe was a holy or divine river, the Masha&#x301;n-jor&#x301;. We should not imitate others who say ma&#x301;sha&#x301;injor&#x301; or mya&#x301;sha&#x301;njor.

The common usage of the word har&#x301;ka&#x301; in Rarh is for a flood that comes and goes suddenly. The Austric synonym for &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; is sa&#x301;nko, so the place where there is a sa&#x301;nko over a jor&#x301; is called Jor&#x301;a&#x301;sa&#x301;nko.

<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Sol and suli are both Austric words. A large village built on high land [t&#x301;ila&#x301;] is called a sol; if it is small in size then it is called a suli, for example, Khayrasol. A place where an abundance of khayra&#x301; fish (khadira&#x301; matsya) can be found in its ponds, pools and creeks is called Khayra&#x301;sol (a small town on the outskirts of Birbhum). That which has a lot of sheor&#x301;a&#x301; trees is Siha&#x301;r&#x301;asol (Burdwan District&#146;s Shiya&#x301;rsol). The sol that was founded by a certain gentleman named A&#x301;sa&#x301;n Miina is Asansol (a subdivision town in Burdwan District). It is notable that all three &ndash; Asansol, Khayrasol and Siha&#x301;r&#x301;sol &ndash; are all near each other. In the western part of Midnapore District there is a village of the Lodha&#x301; community called Lodha&#x301;suli.<!-- /block --></p>

Places or villages encircled on all sides by hills used to be called kera&#x301; or kela&#x301; in western Rarh and northern Orissa, for example, Sera&#x301;ikela&#x301;, Keraikela&#x301;, Nandankela&#x301;, etc.<!-- /block --></p>

Needless to say, the words d&#x301;ihi and d&#x301;iha&#x301; are both Austric. It should be noted that the villages and towns named d&#x301;ihi-d&#x301;iha&#x301; are not in the rainy part of Bengal (with a few exceptions). They are all located in western Rarh because western Rarh is a dry land. The localities in east Calcutta named d&#x301;ihi were most likely settled at the time by people from Rarh who cleared the Sundarbans and used the name d&#x301;ihi. Similarly, one does not come across villages or towns in western Rarh with the word diiya&#x301; in their name because diiya&#x301; is another name for dviipa [island]. Where will you find islands in the dry lands of western Rarh? However, the words jor&#x301;a&#x301; or jur&#x301;i are used in western Rarh in the names of villages or towns encircled by rivers, for example, Jerid&#x301;i and Shukjor&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The word ra&#x301;r&#x301;h comes from the old Austric word ra&#x301;r&#x301;ha&#x301; or ra&#x301;r&#x301;ho which means &ldquo;land of red soil&rdquo;. Viirabhu&#x301;mi means viira&#x301;ca&#x301;rin&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; bhu&#x301;mi in Sanskrit and its altered name is Viirabhu&#x301;ma, or Varjyabhu&#x301;mi in Vedic. Its altered form is Varrabhu&#x301;mi and also Viirabhu&#x301;ma. Biira means &ldquo;forest&rdquo; in the Austric language. Biirabhu&#x301;mi means &ldquo;land abounding in forests&rdquo;. If the word is taken to mean &ldquo;forest&rdquo; then undoubtedly this creates an awkward combination because the word biira is Austric and the word bhu&#x301;mi is Sanskrit. Birbhum was undoubtedly once full of forests. Mamudbazaar Tha&#x301;na&#x301;, Rajnagar Tha&#x301;na&#x301;, Khayrasol Tha&#x301;na&#x301;, southwest Dumka, east Deoghar and west Pakur, which until 1855 was a part of Birbhum, were all full of forests. The word ra&#x301;r&#x301;ha&#x301; or ra&#x301;r&#x301;ho which we find in the Austric language means &ldquo;land of red soil&rdquo;. Similarly, if we accept the meaning &ldquo;forest&rdquo; for the Austric word biira then it can definitely offer an explanation behind the name Birbhum, Rarh&#146;s own cultural territory. More research needs to be done on this matter.<!-- /block --></p>

The Bengali word ba&#x301;r&#x301;i comes from the Sanskrit word va&#x301;t&#x301;i and the word ba&#x301;r&#x301;iya&#x301; or ber&#x301;e comes from the word va&#x301;t&#x301;ika&#x301;. Thus bam&#x301;shver&#x301;iya&#x301; or ba&#x301;nshber&#x301;e comes from the Sanskrit vam&#x301;shava&#x301;t&#x301;ika&#x301;. In north Bengal ba&#x301;r&#x301;iya&#x301; has changed into ba&#x301;r&#x301;i instead of ber&#x301;e, for example, Khar&#x301;iba&#x301;r&#x301;i, Kha&#x301;gar&#x301;a&#x301;ba&#x301;r&#x301;i, Nakasa&#x301;lba&#x301;r&#x301;i, etc. The region which had a forest of reeds [nalkha&#x301;gr&#x301;a&#x301;] (ikr&#x301;a&#x301; in old Assamese) is Kha&#x301;gr&#x301;a&#x301;ba&#x301;r&#x301;i. Khar&#x301;iba&#x301;r&#x301;i is where there is a jungle of wood suitable for use as fuel (khar&#x301;i means &ldquo;firewood&rdquo;). Also there is Bagr&#x301;iba&#x301;r&#x301;i (Sanskrit badarii &rarr; bagar&#x301;i, that is, &ldquo;plums&rdquo;), Sha&#x301;luniiba&#x301;r&#x301;i (sha&#x301;l tree, in Assamese sha&#x301;luni), Nalba&#x301;r&#x301;i (reed jungle), etc.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->It was mentioned earlier that Calcutta was once underwater. After those regions rose out of the water, trees that favoured salty soil began growing there, for example, sundari, henta&#x301;l [a type of palm], mangrove, ba&#x301;in, etc. Many places were named after such jungles, such as Gara&#x301;nha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, Henta&#x301;lii, and so forth. The area of Calcutta known nowadays as Entally was formerly called Henta&#x301;lii. There used to be a jungle there of huge hintal trees with thorns and tigers used to hide in it hoping to catch deer. With the distorted English pronunciation it became Entally. At that time different kinds of crops were grown in different areas of Calcutta. These areas were also named according to the local crop; for example, the area where betel was grown was named Guva&#x301;ba&#x301;ga&#x301;n (the Sanskrit word for &ldquo;betel&rdquo; is guva&#x301;ka and from this comes the Bengali guba&#x301;).

He did not name the road after himself. It was the people who gave it the name Badshah Road. Later the British extended the road up to Peshawar and renamed it the Grand Trunk Road. It should be mentioned here that the word saraka [road] is not a foreign word. It is actually a Sanskrit word. Sr + n&#x301;aka = saraka, that is, &ldquo;that which is for moving [sara&#x301;]&rdquo;, not for standing, sitting or lying down. Due to mass confusion, the word saraka was replaced by sar&#x301;aka. Sar&#x301;ak in chaste Hindi is a feminine gender word. Many people well-versed in Hindi do not realize that the correct form of the word sar&#x301;ak is saraka. The words saran&#x301;a, saran&#x301;ii, upasaran&#x301;ii and sa&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;a in Rarhi Bengali all come from the verbal root sr. Incidentally, it is worth mentioning here that the builder of the Badshah Road, Shershah, came from the former Sahabad District&#146;s, modern Rohatas District&#146;s, Sasaram. The word s&#x301;asa&#x301;ra&#x301;m has also undergone distortion.

The British took their army into all those kingdoms where the kings or great landowners did not accept their authority. They allowed those who surrendered to them out of fear to keep their zamindarship, but they snatched away the kingdoms of those who did not accept their authority and fought against them. Then they installed their own obedient zamindars in their place. Something or other was named after all those British officers who achieved success in these campaigns. For example, after the kingdom of Palamu was defeated, the district headquarters city was named Daltonganj after Mr. Dalton. The Octorloney Monument in Calcutta maidan was built in the name of General Octorloney. Nowadays the Octorloney Monument has been renamed Shahid Minar.

Dasta means &ldquo;hand&rdquo;, and if that hand is applied forcibly to something or possesses something forcibly then it is jabardast. In Panjabi &ldquo;general&rdquo; became ja&#x301;rna&#x301;l. If you look around a little you may able to find a couple of Ja&#x301;rna&#x301;l Singhs present.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Even though the English word &ldquo;colonel&rdquo; does not have an &ldquo;r&rdquo; it is pronounced karn&#x301;el. From this comes the Panjabi word ka&#x301;rna&#x301;il. Similarly, the English word &ldquo;recruit&rdquo; has become ram&#x301;rut&#x301; in Panjabi and the English &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; has become sa&#x301;la&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->As a result of the Britishers&#146; distorted pronunciation the names of many famous cities in this country have become distorted. I have already talked about the distortion of the name Kalika&#x301;ta&#x301; (Calcutta) in this regard. A similar thing has happened with the city Bombay. Many fishing families were living in the suburbs of the modern city of Bombay. These fishing families were the old inhabitants of the city before it became Bombay. Their traditional deity was the goddess Mumba&#x301;vatii. Vatii becomes bai in Maha&#x301;ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rii Pra&#x301;krta, so accordingly Mumba&#x301;vatii became Mumba&#x301;bai and, with the passage of time, Mumba&#x301;i. The word mumba&#x301;i has been common in both Marathi and Gujarati since that time and remains so. The British turned this Mumba&#x301;i into Bombay and this &ldquo;Bombay&rdquo; became Bomba&#x301;i in Hindi and Bengali. Kotha&#x301;ka&#x301;r jal kotha&#x301;y ese da&#x301;nr&#x301;a&#x301;la [Where does the water come from; where does it end up?].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn10"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn10">10</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Recently the government of Maharashtra has changed the name Bomba&#x301;i to Mumba&#x301;i. This is a praiseworthy action. Calcutta should promptly be changed to Kalika&#x301;ta&#x301; in English. Why should the same proper noun be called differently by different people! This destroys the sense of value of a proper noun. If you ask someone named Sardar Hazara Singh his name will he say that his name is &ldquo;Leader Thousand Lions&rdquo;? Should we call Krishnanagar &ldquo;Black City&rdquo; in English? Someone who gets a kick out of calling Krishnanagar &ldquo;Black City&rdquo; should follow suit and call Calcutta &ldquo;Lime and Rope&rdquo;. Only then will their penchant for imitation be complete.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  The literal idiom is: &ldquo;My head was badly caught&rdquo;. The words used by the magistrate are all spelt with d&#x301;h instead of dha and t&#x301;a instead of ta to highlight the inability of the English to pronounce the dental letters. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  Poppy seed is a constipative food. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  In the literary language nowadays it has been made into vam&#x301;shava&#x301;t&#x301;i but this is incorrect. The literary form of ba&#x301;m&#x301;shber&#x301;e is not vam&#x301;shava&#x301;t&#x301;i. If the original form had been vam&#x301;shava&#x301;t&#x301;i then language its modern southern Bengali form would have been ba&#x301;m&#x301;shba&#x301;r&#x301;i, not ba&#x301;m&#x301;shber&#x301;e. So since the colloquial name is Ba&#x301;m&#x301;shber&#x301;e then the old name of the place was certainly Vam&#x301;shava&#x301;t&#x301;ika&#x301;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)  I did not use the word vyakti [individual] because this word is incorrect from head to toe. The linguistic scholars may be able to tell us at what auspicious moment the word vyakti came to mean &ldquo;person&rdquo;. That is not a task for ordinary people like myself. The word vyakti means &ldquo;to make manifest&rdquo;. If the needlework that women do on cloth is called su&#x301;ciivyakti then I have no objections. However, calling a person vyakti raises strong cause for objection.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)   Comilla &ndash; Comilla is surrounded by lowlands. Even the two nearby subdivisions, Bra&#x301;hmanber&#x301;iya&#x301; and Ca&#x301;ndpur, are lowlands. However, the city itself of tank, bank, datta and rasamalai, Comilla, is an elevated area [d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;] where the bullock cart is more common than the boat.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn6">6</a></b>)  &ldquo;Steamer&rdquo; is an English word. In Bengali one says ja&#x301;ha&#x301;j, although ja&#x301;ha&#x301;j is a Farsi word. The Sanskrit word is arn&#x301;avapota. The word ja&#x301;ha&#x301;j is more common in Bengali than arn&#x301;avapota.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn7">7</a></b>)   In Bengali the word used for the measurement of the depth of water is ba&#x301;no. The corresponding English word is &ldquo;fathom&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn8">8</a></b>)  In very ancient times boats were used in western Rarh as well. The masts of ships have been discovered while cultivating the extremely fertile region of the Ajay and Mayurakshi rivers. However they are from many ages ago.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn9">9</a></b>)  In old Bengali, rivers used to be called nai or lai. There is a river running through Birbhum and Dumka districts whose proper name is Va&#x301;n&#x32D;shnadii but whose common name in Va&#x301;n&#x32D;shlai.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn10"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn10">10</a></b>)  A proverb implying that its origin was one thing but it ended up as something else. &ndash;Trans.</p>
