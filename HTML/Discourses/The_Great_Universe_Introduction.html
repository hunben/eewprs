<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->For centuries spiritual and religious leaders have been teaching mankind how to realize the Truth within themselves. Some have instructed their followers to shun the world and its temptations; others have preached simply that individuals must lead moral lives in society to attain eternal spiritual happiness. But very few have ever discussed in detail the mundane spheres of government, politics, and economics. Development in these realms, so it seemed, was not important for the spiritual journey of the individual soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti, however, is a most unusual spiritual guide. His view is that this physical, material world is neither an illusion nor a great temptation, but the starting-point of our spiritual journey; thus we must develop it even as we develop ourselves to make it a perfect base for spiritual effort. This effort is not the struggle of a few isolated individuals but the task of humanity as a whole. Human society and its institutions should not impede our progress; rather they should be carefully planned and designed to accelerate our march toward perfection.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In these discourses, Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti discusses all the problems that beset modern mankind &ndash; governmental corruption, economic injustice, overpopulation, crime &ndash; and offers practical solutions for them. Our first step is to realize that the true goal of humanity, the ultimate goal of evolution, is not the amassing of more and more material wealth but the expansion of consciousness. Through proper education and practical techniques of mental expansion, humanity will come to realize that the hoarding of wealth and all the ills of corruption and scarcity it creates, are nothing but the misdirected longing of the human soul for infinite happiness &ndash; a longing which cannot be satisfied by money but only by internal bliss. Thus as human attention and activity is directed more and more toward subtler pursuits such as artistic endeavour and spiritual practice, the selfishness and greed which dominate people&#146;s minds today will be replaced by a new feeling of love and brotherhood. As we expand our minds toward the Infinite and learn to share our mundane treasures, we will realize more and more that we are all indeed one humanity, that we are all the sons and daughters of one Infinite Intelligence Who is guiding us all to perfection. Instead of being based on competition and mutual hostility, society will be operated through mutual cooperation and love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->We are living in a most unusual time. Governmental corruption is becoming more and more painfully evident all over the world; the over-indulgence of a small segment of humanity and the resultant poverty of the majority is creating an imbalance that is upsetting the world&#146;s economy. Today even the wealthy nations are beginning to learn what it means to do without. At this crucial moment in world history, proper leadership is essential. Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti speaks of a new kind of leader, a sadvipra or &ldquo;true spiritual leader.&rdquo; Instead of the most spiritually evolved members of society renouncing the world and seeking their own enlightenment in caves and monasteries and thus leaving the guidance of society to the corrupt politicians, spiritually developed individuals should take on the leadership of the society. Since their goal, developed by regular meditation and uncompromising morality, is only the realization of the Supreme and not any mundane wealth, power or fame, there will be no chance of their corruption. Inspired and guided by them, mankind will accelerate its march toward Absolute Truth and reach new heights of spiritual and material perfection.<!-- /block --></p>
