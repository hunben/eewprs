Notes: <p class="Para_Notes">official source: <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12</i></p>
<p class="Para_Notes">this version: is the printed <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 11 &amp; 12,</i> 1st edition, 2008, version (obvious spelling, punctuation and typographical mistakes only may have been corrected). I.e., this is the most up-to-date version as of the present Electronic Edition.</p>
<p class="Para_Notes"><i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch,</i> which was published in December, 1979, and <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12,</i> which was published in 1980, each contained a version of this discourse. There were slight differences between the versions. The two versions may have resulted from two independent transcriptions of the same tape when the tape was available. The <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 12</i> version was reprinted in <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 11 &amp; 12</i>. Words in double square brackets [[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]] here in the Electronic Edition are corrections that did not appear in the printed <i>A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Parts 11 &amp; 12;</i> they are mostly words incorporated from the <i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch</i> version where that version seemed more logical.</p>
<p class="Para_Notes">Published in <i>Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; in Fiesch</i> as &ldquo;Tantra the Supreme Desideratum&rdquo;.</p>

<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know, the cult of spiritual practice, the cult that leads one to the final desideratum of human life, is called Tantra. In Tantra, there is hardly one percent theory; ninety-nine percent is practice. And you also know that a good theory may not help a person, it is practice that counts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Suppose you know how to prepare a particular sweet, but practically you cannot do it. In such a case, will you get that delicious taste? Theory will not be able to help you. In Tantra there is ninety-nine percent practice, and practice precedes theory. The theory was prepared on the basis of practice and not practice on theory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It may be that a theory is very sweetly worded but cannot be translated into action. In Tantra, the theory succeeds the practice, that is, the practice precedes the theory. And when the Tantras were invented, there was hardly anything in black and white, because it was practice. Later the Tantras were given book form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Tadekam&#x301; japa&#x301;ma tadekam&#x301; smara&#x301;ma<br>Tadekam&#x301; jagatsa&#x301;ks&#x301;iiru&#x301;pam&#x301; nama&#x301;mah;<br>Tadekam&#x301; nidha&#x301;nam&#x301; nira&#x301;lambamiisham<br>Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja&#x301;mah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[<i>Tadekam&#x301; japa&#x301;ma.</i>] You say so many things, and major portions of what you say are meaningless, simply a wastage of time and energy. And not only do you say things, but you speak in your mind. And that is also a wastage of energy. Before going to Stockholm, you may say within your mind a thousand times, &ldquo;I have to go to Stockholm, I have to go to Stockholm, I am to go to Stockholm&rdquo; &ndash; a mere wastage of time and energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What is thought? Thought means to speak within. Thought is closely related to soliloquy. Suppose there is nobody to hear you and you are speaking. What is that? It is just like a thought. When you are speaking to yourself, it is called &ldquo;soliloquy&rdquo;. Thought is also like that. Some of your thoughts are of such a nature that, if others hear them, they will say you are insane.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So here the Tantric says, &ldquo;Look, what I am to say within my mind, speak to myself, I should speak regarding You, and not regarding this or that, that or this; so my time will be properly utilized &ndash; there will not be any wastage of time and energy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><i>Tadekam&#x301; smara&#x301;ma</i>. You may be remembering, &ldquo;Oh, when I went to Alaska, my host served me a very delicious menu.&rdquo; You are thinking like this &ndash; a story of, say, twenty, or perhaps twenty-five or thirty, years ago. You are remembering &ndash; what? It is a sweet memory. What is the necessity?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Memory should be of &ndash; what? A tactual experience that took place in my mind in the course of my sadhana, or the bliss that I enjoyed during <i>kiirtana</i>. Memory should be like this. &ldquo;My memory should also be centred around You, so there will not be any wastage of time and energy.&rdquo; What do people do generally? People generally remember past stories of pain and  happiness, sweet stories of near and dear ones. But all those things are a mere wastage of time and energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><i>Tadekam&#x301; jagatsa&#x301;ks&#x301;iirupam&#x301; nama&#x301;mah</i> &ndash; &ldquo;If I am to pay respect to anybody, I am to pay respect to You only.&rdquo; Because all other objects of this universe are expressions of that very <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. So I pay respect to the Nucleus who created all these great personalities, all these little and big ones.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->As per yoga and Tantra, to <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> one is to do <i>namaste</i>. <i>Namah</i> plus <i>te</i> &ndash; &ldquo;I pay respect to You&rdquo; &ndash; <i>namaste</i>. And <i>namaska&#x301;ra</i> means, &ldquo;I am paying my respects.&rdquo; And that is why you may use the word <i>namaste</i> only for <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> but <i>namaska&#x301;ra</i> for both <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> and the <i>jiiva</i> [unit being]. <i>Tadekam&#x301; jagatsa&#x301;ks&#x301;iirupam&#x301; nama&#x301;mah</i> &ndash; &ldquo;If I am to pay respect to anybody, I am to pay respect to You only.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><i>Tadekam&#x301; nidha&#x301;nam&#x301; nira&#x301;lambamiisham</i>. Whenever one is doing something, there is some goal, there is some objective. Whenever one is moving, one must have some destination, one must have some culminating point, one must have some terminating point. So then, what are You? &ldquo;You are the Terminus of all termini.&rdquo; You are going to Stockholm. Stockholm is the terminus. You are going to London. London is the terminus. But for all these termini, the Supreme Terminus is You.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><i>Nira&#x301;lambamiisham</i> [&ldquo;there is no authority over You, nor are You contained within anything&rdquo;]. Why? All these termini are located within certain boundaries. London, for example, is a city in Great Britain. You are going to Paris, Paris is a town in France. [[That is, they are]] under certain limitations, certain boundaries. But You, the Supreme Terminus, You are beyond the peripheries of time, space and person, above all boundaries, and that is why You are the Supreme Desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->I have said so many times that &ldquo;desideratum&rdquo; is such a point, such a term, that it should not have any plural form. That is, there should not be any word such as &ldquo;desiderata&rdquo;. &ldquo;Desideratum&rdquo; always remains singular. Because You are the Singular Entity, You are the Single Desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><i>Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja&#x301;mah</i>. Say, from here, if you were to go to England &ndash; how are you to go if you are not to take the help of any vehicle? Perhaps running up to the shore and then swimming. But is it practical or practicable? No. Is it feasible? No. Then what will be the better or the practical approach? By truck up to the beach and then a boat or a big steamer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now, if you are to cross the peripheries of time, space and person, what are you to do? You require a big ship. <i>Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja&#x301;mah</i> &ndash; &ldquo;O <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> Thou art a big ship, and we have taken shelter in Thee.&rdquo; <i>Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja&#x301;mah</i> &ndash; &ldquo;O <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>! Thou art the best ship. So I pay my respect to Thee.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><i>Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301;. Bhava</i> means &ldquo;any entity coming within the scope of time, space and person&rdquo;. <i>Ambu</i> means &ldquo;water&rdquo;. <i>Ambodhi</i> means &ldquo;ocean&rdquo;. <i>Potam</i> means &ldquo;ship&rdquo;. &ldquo;Thou art the ship, and taking shelter on this ship, we will cross the <i>ambodhi</i> of <i>bhava,</i> we will cross the ocean of time, space and person.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->This is the spirit of this <i>shloka</i> of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
