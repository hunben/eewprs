<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In this universe, each existence, each action, each inner urge and each individual entity has a flow. It has a source from which it moves like a stream. Some people believe that by eating nutritious food they will acquire more energy to do better work; others expect to get the same results by increasing their intellect through intensive study. Different people have different ideas. On deeper analysis, however, people will realize that the source of permanent wisdom and energy must be a permanent entity. Some people try to attain satisfaction by eating rasagollas [delicious milk sweet]. But rasagollas are transient objects: once gulped down the throat their taste is quickly lost. The source of people&#146;s happiness, strength or intelligence must be an unlimited entity. What can you expect from limited objects? How much light can you expect from a little candle? After a short time it will extinguish itself. The same is the case for each and every mundane object. In winter, some health tonics increase inner strength, but as soon as spring comes, they lose their potency. An intelligent person will naturally depend on that inexhaustible source which will never meet an end and from which people can attain permanent strength, intelligence and courage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is said, &ldquo;Mu&#x301;kam&#x301; karoti va&#x301;ca&#x301;lam&#x301; paun&#x32D;gam&#x301; launghayate girim.&rdquo; With the help of mundane objects, a dumb person will never become fully eloquent, and a lame person will never be able to climb a mountain. However, with the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, the dumb will speak and the lame will scale mountains. If one asks Parama Purus&#x301;a for strength one may get or may not get some. But one should not make any such demands. One should not ask, &ldquo;Oh Parama Purus&#x301;a, please give me this and that.&rdquo; By ideating on Him one may get everything. What is important is His grace which may come whether you ask for it or not. His grace is all important, and that is why it is said, &ldquo; Mukam&#x301; karoti va&#x301;ca&#x301;lam&#x301; paun&#x32D;gam&#x301; launghayate girim.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ananyormamata&#x301; vis&#x301;n&#x301;ormamata&#x301; premasaun&#x32D;gata&#x301;&rdquo;. You will have to concentrate your mind. Instead of developing an attachment for mundane objects, you should develop an attachment for Parama Purus&#x301;a (Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u). Here the word &ldquo;mamata&rdquo; signifies the feeling of being one&#146;s own. None of the objects of this universe can be called your own. You came to this Earth without any possessions and you will leave empty handed, too. So how can any object be called your own? It cannot. This is true knowledge. There is nothing in this universe which you can call your own except Parama Purus&#x301;a. If this idea is not cultivated humans will become inactive and averse to work. In my opinion, the best way is objective adjustment through subjective approach. If you do not feel that all objects and entities are a part of you, you cannot develop any love and affection for His creation. The balance between your unit being and the external world will be impaired and your movement towards Parama Purus&#x301;a will be hindered. Remember that the love you develop for this worldly creation must always be channelized towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. He, being the owner of the external objective world, is the only object for you to possess. When you realize this, adjustment with the objective world will come naturally and effortlessly. All human beings should have the idea in their minds that the only entity in this universe which they can call their own is Parama Purus&#x301;a. &ldquo;Ananyormamata&#x301; vis&#x301;n&#x301;ormamata&#x301; premasaun&#x32D;gata&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Vista&#x301;rah sarvabhu&#x301;tasya Vis&#x301;n&#x301;orvishvamidam&#x301; jagat;<br>Dras&#x301;t&#x301;avyama&#x301;tmavattasma&#x301;dabhedena vicaks&#x301;an&#x301;aeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<p class="Para_Footnote">Vis&#x301;n&#x301;upura&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash;Trans.</p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;vishva&rdquo; is derived from the root verb &ldquo;vish&rdquo; whose inner meaning is to penetrate into every pore of an entity. Thus the entity which lies covert in each and every object in this universe is called &ldquo;Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u&rdquo;. He lies covert in all your nerve cells, in every corner of each of your pores, and in the deepest core of your mind. How can you escape His attention? Do not think that He only resides in the five fundamental factors; He also resides in the deepest recesses of your mind, hearing everything you think.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What is the mental process of thinking? Thinking means to speak within the mind. Suppose someone is thinking, &ldquo;I&#146;ll go to Calcutta to attend DMC. I&#146;d like to go to Delhi, too, but I don&#146;t quite have enough money.&rdquo; Parama Purus&#x301;a has been sitting in that mind listening to the internal talk. He knows everything about that mind. Now, each action is preceded by a preparatory stage. Rice has to be washed clean in water before it is cooked. This is the proper procedure prior to cooking and unless it is done, one should not cook. Similarly, each thought has a preparatory stage. Parama Purus&#x301;a knows about this, too. He knows when a particular person is preparing to think about something. In the case of the person thinking about attending DMC, Parama Purus&#x301;a knows that he will finally decide to go to both Delhi and Calcutta. Thus, one of His names is Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u: the entity which lies covert in everything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->There is no place in the world, nor even in the universe, where one can hide from Him. Even if you think something secretly, He will also come to know about it. Suppose somebody thinks, &ldquo;I&#146;ll do this work tomorrow morning. Most probably Parama Purus&#x301;a is so preoccupied that He won&#146;t worry about the delay. After all, how many things can He see at the same time? And if He overlooks it completely, so much the better.&rdquo; But Parama Purus&#x301;a can also hear these mental words. So what should people do? They should think inwardly, &ldquo;Oh Parama Purus&#x301;a, please make sure that my thoughts move along the right path.&rdquo; Parama Purus&#x301;a will see that even though their minds are not under perfect control, they have a strong desire to tread the right path. He will surely have special love and grace for them. He will think, &ldquo;Basically they are not bad people; they&#146;re simply having trouble controlling their minds.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Since Parama Purus&#x301;a remains covert in each and every entity, human beings should look upon the universe from an integral point of view. They should not allow any inferiority or superiority complex to develop in the mind, but should remain free from both. All are equal, all are bound by the ideals of Neohumanism. Some people may have studied more than others, some may be white, some may be black, but they are all brothers and sisters. If a white man hates a black man, he should realize that the hairs on his skin are also black. Conversely, if a black man hates a white man he should remember that the soles of his feet are white. No one has ever been born with black soles on their feet! One should not allow any type of complex to develop in the mind. A wise person always looks upon all the objects of this universe with equanimity. This is called devotion, that is, when the mind is withdrawn from all objects and channelized towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is the most important state for human beings to attain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->You may or may not have sufficient physical, mental or spiritual power &ndash; it is enough that your mind is concentrated on Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u. How much can you do with your limited capacity, anyway? But if Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u bestows His grace, even a dumb person will be able to deliver a learned discourse at a philosophical or spiritual meeting. Similarly, even though you may be weak or incompetent, you will be able to accomplish great tasks with relative ease. You will be amazed how such tasks could be accomplished with yourself as the medium.<!-- /block --></p>
