<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Giribhu&#x301;h. If you use this word in the feminine gender you must use a visarga [&ldquo;ah&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x0983;</span> &ndash; <span class=Bengali>&#x0997;&#x09BF;&#x09B0;&#x09BF;&#x09AD;&#x09C2;&#x0983;</span>)]. It means Pa&#x301;rvatii, &ldquo;Who Was Born in the Mountains&rdquo;. According to mythology Sati, the daughter of King Daksha and Prasuti, self-immolated in the sacrificial fire at Daksha&#146;s palace and was reborn as Pa&#x301;rvatii, or Gaorii, the daughter of Himalaya and Menaka. She won Shiva as her husband by practising severe penances. As she was born in the mountainous region, as mentioned above, she was called &ldquo;Giribhu&#x301;h&rdquo;. (Giri means &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; and bhu&#x301;h means &ldquo;born out of&rdquo;.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Although it is said that in ancient Aryan society women enjoyed a certain amount of status, they were not accorded full respect. But in the non-Aryan society of India, the status of women was equal to that of the men. They enjoyed equal rights with their male counterparts; they walked side-by-side. Lord Shiva wanted women to be treated as they deserved irrespective of whether they were Aryans or non-Aryans. Most of the arrogant Aryans opposed Him, though some, of course, supported Him. Pa&#x301;rvatii was in the forefront in the fight for women&#146;s rights.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->At that time, the visarga was used with first-case singular-number words to confer special honour. Pa&#x301;rvatii always used the visarga with her name just to assert her sense of dignity. Since then, the visarga has been accepted in the spelling of &ldquo;Giribhu&#x301;h&rdquo;. Whether or not this story is actually a fact, I neither have any objection, nor is there any cause for objection, if the visarga is retained.<!-- /block --></p>
