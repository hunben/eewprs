<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The topic of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Mobility and Movement of Microvita.&rdquo;  As you know, everything in this universe moves.  Speed is not only the essence of life, speed represents existence; that is, there is speed, there is movement wherever there is the existential faculty &ndash;  both animate and inanimate entities are to move.  The position of microvita is just on the silver lining of animate and inanimate.  Microvita also move and they recognize no inter-planetary, no inter-spatial, no celestial hindrance, impediment or barrier.  They move.  How do they move?  Each and every movement of the universe is of systaltic order.  It is not just like a straight line, it is to some extent angular, of angular nature; and where the speed is less &ndash; that is, the speed is not the dominating factor &ndash; it is a bit circular.  Where it is circular in Sam&#x301;skrta it is called &ldquo;kala&#x301;&rdquo; and &ldquo;ka&#x301;sta&#x301;&rdquo;.  Otherwise it is angular.  The greater the speed, the less will be the angle created by it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Microvita move; they recognize no impediment, no barrier, physical or supra-physical; but as their media are of inferential nature, so the movement has something to do with the physical world. As I have clearly told you last year, microvita are of both positive and negative character; those which are of negative character move in the range of physicality and touch the arena of the psychic world, but they cannot cross the threshold of the psychic world. This is the case with negative microvita. Positive microvita move freely in the physical and psychic worlds, and touch the border of the spiritual world, but cannot cross the threshold of the spiritual world.  So for elevation or acceleration, or rather accelerated movement in the spiritual world, microvita may help one indirectly, but direct help in the spiritual world comes from the great grace of the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the physical world, when negative microvita move, they move in systaltic order, creating angles, and where the speed is much accelerated, the angles are smaller, less in degrees.  In their movement they touch all the static items of the physical world, or in the case of living beings, the static portions of the physical body, and these negative microvita maintain a sort of adjustment with the staticity of this physical world and also of the unit physical framework.  But where one angle is in the realm of staticity, what will be the next angle?  Certainly it should be in the realm of mutativity. It tries to maintain a particular type of adjustment with the mutative world, and as a result of the angle created by negative microvita in the mutative world or in the mutative portion of any structure, that mutative entity is to undergo a certain metamorphosis.  Its arena decreases, its density increases, and as a result it is slowly transmuted into staticity, and the realm of the neighbouring staticity increases. Staticity in its own realm increases both in area and density.  The mutative portion also undergoes certain changes and metamorphoses, as a result of which the sentienthood of the sentient portions of the physical world is also changed. That is why one should try to be pure not only in body but in mind also, because a mind engaged in degenerating thought invites negative microvita.  Good company, good books, good literature, good songs, kiirtanas (devotional chanting) elevate the mind and the mind becomes sanctified. That is why negative microvita do not get much scope to touch the mutative and sentient portions of the structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So we see that in the case of negative microvita, not only is the static portion strengthened, but the mutative portion becomes weak and the sentient portion also becomes weak. In the case of the movement of negative microvita, the movement is always of systaltic or angular nature and never of circular nature.  In the case of positive microvita, you know positive microvita can move freely in the physical world or in any physical structure, and they can move freely in psychic structures also, but they cannot cross the arena, the threshold, of the sentient world.  In their movement in the physical structure or in the external physical world, the movement is certainly of angular character, but in the psychic world it is a bit of circular nature. If the mind remains engaged in elevating thoughts, that circular movement is converted into angular movement, that is, the kala&#x301; and ka&#x301;sta&#x301; become angular; and the positive microvita do not touch the static portion of any structure &ndash; they create angles in the sentient portion also as a result of which the neighbouring mutative portion is also influenced; and as a result the static portion also loses its staticity to some extent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So we find that positive microvitum sanctifies the physical body, sanctifies the psychic body and helps in spiritual elevation, not only of the human body but also of any living body; and it helps in the thought of Parama Purus&#x301;a, it helps the Prati-sain&#x32D;cara portion of Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s thought or conation in creating a better world.  We should always try to invite positive microvita for our all-around and integrated development, not merely of a particular human body or a particular living body, but for the all-around development of all existences; that is, all existential faculties are to be benefited by this positive microvitum.  Inanimate objects will become animate, carbon atoms sleeping in an inanimate body will get life, will get the stir of vitality in them, and that vitality is slowly to be transmuted into a gigantic living structure like a human being.  You should remember that here we are to invite positive microvita for our all-around progress and all-around elevation, and we are to denounce the advancement of negative microvita because it is detrimental to the cause of a sweet and beautiful universe.<!-- /block --></p>
