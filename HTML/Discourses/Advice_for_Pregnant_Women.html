<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->When the foetus in the mother&#146;s womb becomes somewhat developed, its hair starts to grow. The mother may develop nausea. Sometimes she develops a special fascination with certain edibles and inedibles, and some peculiar distastes as well. In ancient Bengal there was a social custom to provide an opportunity to a pregnant woman to eat foods of her choice. This was known as sa&#x301;dhbhaks&#x301;an&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Normally, in the advanced stage of pregnancy, women are not permitted to do physical labour. This is wrong. Women in that condition should be allowed to do a little work. (The same principle applies to pregnant animals.) Otherwise, there remains a risk during labour. Pregnant women and female animals may work half of what they usually do at other times; but under no circumstances should they be allowed to do strenuous work, as it may lead to premature delivery or stillbirth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Foods which are highly acidic, such as acidic citrus fruits, overripe pineapples, overripe ja&#x301;m<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->, cottonseed flour and spicy pickles, should be carefully avoided as they may harm the fetus. Bending over in a stooping posture to lift anything heavy is strictly forbidden for pregnant women. Although there is no objection to carrying loads for those who are accustomed to it, they must not stoop over to lift a heavy load onto their heads. It is better if others will help them to lift it up. In this stage of pregnancy a daily bath is a rule, but one must not bathe after sunset. It is better to lie down on a hard bed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is desirable that the best room in the house should be used for the confinement. In certain parts of rural Bengal, the worst room or the cowshed is used for confinement out of superstition. This practice is certainly wrong &ndash; more than that, it is a crime.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There are many people who affect respect, loudly praising women as a race of mothers, but who in practical life suppress them underfoot, sending them into the jaws of premature death by depriving them of happiness and the comforts of life. The conscientious should be vocal against these heinous acts. We must pay due honour to women as mothers and help them to live long lives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The family should see to it that the woman is not forced to walk to the outhouse on foot for at least twenty-four hours after delivery.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The delivery room should be fitted with a bathtub and commode. If a girl is born no one in the family is to point an accusing finger, either directly or indirectly, at the mother. It may create undue pressure on her heart. There was one lady of my acquaintance who was unable to bear the humiliation brought down by her family just after the birth of her seventh daughter. She cried out, &ldquo;Again a daughter, again a daughter, again a daughter!&rdquo; and immediately expired.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->A pregnant woman must certainly be provided with nutritious food. No constipation-creating foods should be supplied to her. (This is as applicable to animal mothers as to human mothers.) Sweet-pea leaves, or if not available, then spinach, nat&#x301;e sha&#x301;k or gourd leaves should be taken daily in small amounts. Pun&#x32D;i sha&#x301;k should be strictly avoided.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->All that I have said in the above is as applicable to pregnant animals as it is to human mothers. In the case of the first delivery one should consult a physician or experienced midwife after one month. If one follows the above instructions, death during delivery will become a rare phenomenon.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  Indian &ldquo;blackberries&rdquo;, Eugenia jambolana Lam. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  This advice is for safety and hygienic reasons in places where the facilities are unclean or unsafe (e.g., a slippery or muddy walkway). &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  There are many varieties of nat&#x301;e sha&#x301;k (Amaranthus oleraceus Linn. or Amaranthus tristis Linn.), and all may be eaten. Pun&#x32D;i sha&#x301;k (Basella rubra Linn.) comes in two varieties, green and red. The red variety is not included in a yogic sentient diet. Green pun&#x32D;i sha&#x301;k should be avoided because of its high acidic content. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)  The following advice was given during a personal audience given by P.R. Sarkar to two wholetime workers of Ananda Marga in 1978. The writer is Avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; A&#x301;nanda Jayashrii A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya&#x301;. (The article has been adapted for this edition; the original article can be found in Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; Bha&#x301;ratii, Sept. 1994.) At the end of the visit, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; said, &ldquo;You may do Guru Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;, if you like,&rdquo; which Avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; A&#x301;nanda Viitashoka&#x301; A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya&#x301; and I did. <br> When we had finished and were preparing to stand up to leave, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; spoke again, &ldquo;No, wait, I have something to tell you. It was a secret before. Tell our girls that during the time of giving birth they should repeat their particular guru mantra in their particular Is&#x301;t&#x301;a cakra (from profile, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; indicated the various Is&#x301;t&#x301;a cakras). If they do so, there will be minimum haemorrhaging and the birth will be safe.&rdquo; <br> Again Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; spoke, &ldquo;Do you know the naming ceremony (of Ananda Marga)? Until the age of six months, the mother should give only her milk, and at the time of nursing, she should sing (the kiirtana mantra) Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; na&#x301;m kevalam in a low voice so that only she and the baby can hear it. If she does so, the baby will have a spiritual start, and at the time of singing kiirtana, her milk will become divine nectar.&rdquo; <br> &ndash;Trans.</p>
