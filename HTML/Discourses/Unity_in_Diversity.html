<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Behind the creation of this universe is a great magician who is creating and controlling this universe. In fact, whatever has been created, and whatever will be created, is due Him alone. One who realizes this truth attains immortality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Eko hi Rudrah na dvitiiya&#x301;ya &ndash; Only the one Parama Brahma, the Singular Entity is exists. There is no second entity. The plethora of objectivities surrounding us is only the creation of the psychic conation of that Supreme magician. Before creation He was the Singular Entity. When he wished to be many the extroversive (Sain&#x32D;cara) and introversive (Pratisain&#x32D;cara) flow of creation started under the crudifying influence of Prakrti &ndash; the emanent principle of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Eko&#146;ham&#x301; bahu sya&#x301;m&rdquo; Now I am one but I shall be many. The variegated expressions of the universe are nothing but the diversified manifestation of that Supreme One. The inanimate world; the animate world of plants, animals, and human beings; the mind, vitality, and intellect are all expressions of the same Supreme Entity. In the philosophical treatise of Ananda Marga, &ldquo;Idea and Ideology,&rdquo; it has been said that the singular Self is the rudimental cause of all diversities; that is, the essence of all physical and metaphysical diversities is the Supreme One &ndash; the noumenal cause of this phenomenal world. One fundamental entity has been creating and controlling the crude, subtle and causal worlds. In due course all created entities finally dissolve in Him. He is the material cause and He is the efficient cause, and at the same time He is the witnessing force of every object. Human beings should completely merge themselves in that Supreme Singular Self.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is the original fundament of this universe. The entire universe originated from Him, is maintained in Him, and finally will dissolve unto Him. The crude, subtle and the causal universe is only the projection of the Macro-psychic imagination. Due to the influence of Prakrti, which was manifested by the will of Parama Purus&#x301;a, the five fundamental factors &ndash; ether, air, fire, liquid and solid &ndash; emerged in the flow of Macrocosmic imagination. This entire colourful universe is a condensed form of countless inferential waves. Pra&#x301;na or life occurred as a result of internal clash and cohesion within the material structure. Subsequently, at different stages of evolution various unicellular living beings emerged, and finally human beings with a developed brain evolved. In the process of evolution from an unknown point the vast creation of nebulae, the solar world, stars, planets and satellites; creepers, shrubs, trees, flowers and foliage; rivers, clouds, oceans, hills, forests and meadows; and towns and cities took shape. But the original cause is the One infinite, omnipresent, omniscient entity &ndash; Parama Purus&#x301;a. People sometimes wrongly think that time, nature, destiny, accident, the fundamental factors or unit consciousness are the fundamental cause of creation. But on deep analysis one can only conclude that none of them can be recognized as an original cause of creation, because each is limited. Materialists accept this perceivable creation as the absolute reality, and deny everything beyond the scope of the senses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This betrays their deep ignorance. They do not want to understand that matter is absolutely dependent on time, space, and person for its existence. Matter comes out of energy and energy comes out of Idea. And Parama Purus&#x301;a is the metempirical entity. They do not want to recognize the Supreme Causal Factor from whom countless vibrations are emanating and in whom all entities finally dissolve. In reality whatever we normally accept as a fundamental material cause of this colourful creation &ndash; whether the molecule, atom, electron or etheron &ndash; is only the expression of energy. Moreover, energy itself is not an original entity, but a particular manifestation of the static influence of Prakrti the emanent principle of Parama Purus&#x301;a. So, to know the fundamental factor of an object, one will have to know Brahma, the composite of Shiva and Shakti. And one who has known Parama Purus&#x301;a the nucleus of all vibrations, has merged into Parama Purus&#x301;a. Brahmavid Brahmaeva Bhavati. Microcosmic bondages will be removed, doubts and confusion will vanish and an unending stream of pure bliss will flow in one&#146;s mind and heart. Each and every dust particle, and every molecule and atom will appear to be as sweet as honey to such a realized person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Idam ma&#x301;nus&#x301;asya Sarvesa&#x301;m&#x301; bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;na&#x301;m<br>Ayama&#x301;tma&#x301; Sarves&#x301;a&#x301;m bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301;<br>Madhvasya A&#x301;tma&#x301;nah Sarva&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni madhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->To a person who visualises that blissful Supreme Entity in every microcosm, everything in this creation appears to be blissful. As this entire universe is the manifestation of the Supreme Entity, everything is equal to such a person. Just as everything is sweet as honey to the A&#x301;tman, to a self-realized person everything of this world is blissful. Nothing should be ignored or neglected. In the external world there are apparent diversities, but internally there is one singular self. The Supreme Entity is One, but He manifests Himself in various forms. Apparently there is a vast assemblage of numerous multiplicities in the outer world, but in the inner world there is only one Supreme self. In the outer world there is a continuous flow of analysis, while in the inner world there reigns a final synthesis. While working in the external world one must not forget this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Seeing the diversities of the expressed universe empiricists conclude that whatever is visible is real. Thus they deny the existence of the Transcendental Entity. If they refuse to accept an unchangeable entity as the prime cause of the causes of different objects in this relative world of mobility, their conclusions will prove to be self-contradictory. That&#146;s why the followers of spirituality affirm:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Sa Brahma&#x301; Sa Shiva Sendrah so&#146;ks&#x301;arah Paramah Svara&#x301;t&#x301;;<br>Sa eva Vis&#x301;n&#x301;uh Sah pra&#x301;n&#x301;ah sa ka&#x301;la&#x301;gnih sa candrama&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->He is Brahma, the creator and the One who permeates each and every molecule and atom of His creation. He witnesses everything. He is Shiva or Consciousness. He is Indra, the Supreme Lord of this universe. He is Aksara for He undergoes no metamorphosis. He is Avaya, the undecayed One. He is Svavat, the self-effulgent One. He is Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, for He lies covert in every entity. He is the life force of everything. He exists and hence other entities have their entitative existence. At the same time He is the destroyer of all entities and hence the epithet &ldquo;Kalagni&rdquo;. And as He remains enthroned in the human heart in the form of Buddhitattva, he is also called Candrama&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Saeva Sarvam&#x301; Yadbhu&#x301;tam&#x301; Yacca bhavyam&#x301; Sana&#x301;tamam&#x301;<br>Ji matva&#x301; tam&#x301; mrtyatyet hanyah pantha&#x301;h vimuktaye.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Whatever exists in this universe is His manifestation. Whatever has been, whatever is and whatever will be is His manifestation. Whatever people can or cannot think of inside or outside the creation is all within Him. The seed of all tanma&#x301;tras, the sprout and this vast fruit tree in the form of the universe are all His manifestations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Hence realized people are never confused at the sight of the endless diversities of nature. Rather, the unity behind this diversity is more discernible to their divine vision. What appears to be many in the outer world is internally one. This is the divine sport of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Intelligent people understand the self-contained eternal stance of Parama Purus&#x301;a behind the changing forms and fully establish themselves spiritually. The wise through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, ardent devotion and sincerity will move along the path of supreme synthesis and merge in the original stance of Parama Purus&#x301;a. They will realize that they are neither the mind nor the indriyas, nor the tanma&#x301;tras, but an unending flow of consciousness and bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
