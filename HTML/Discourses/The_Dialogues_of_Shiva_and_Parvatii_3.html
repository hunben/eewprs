<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Nigama is the collection of all the possible questions of unit minds [regarding spirituality], and a&#x301;gama is the collection of the answers to those questions, those pariprashnas. Once Pa&#x301;rvatii posed a question to Shiva. (Actually she asked it not for herself, but just to make people understand the desideratum of human life.) The question asked was, &ldquo;What should be the object of worship for those who are doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;?&rdquo; Humans create the objects of their worship according to their own intellectual standards. Primitive humans worshipped plants, trees, earth, rivers, etc. It is not logical to think that one can acquire pun&#x301;ya [virtue] by immersing oneself in the Ganges, but cannot acquire it by immersing oneself in the Thames. If pun&#x301;ya can be acquired by immersion, it can be by immersion either in the Ganges or in the Thames. And can there be no pun&#x301;ya from taking a dip in the Yamuna, which originates, like the Ganges, in the Himalayas, and runs side by side with the Ganges? There are some who worship stone: they make idols out of stone, according to their imaginations, and they worship them. How can an idol give you salvation &ndash; an idol made by you? You have shaped the idol with different chisels and hammers; you are its father, its creator; so how can it give you salvation? It is all unscientific.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The reply of Shiva to Pa&#x301;rvatii&#146;s question was as follows: &ldquo;One cannot obtain the unlimited from the limited. Secondly, idol worship is more harmful than the worship of flora and fauna; because the flora and fauna have been created and shaped by the Operative Principle, and not by human beings. Plants and trees are in a process of growth. But the idol has been created and shaped by you, by your chisel and hammer &ndash; how can it give you salvation?&rdquo; Pa&#x301;rvatii then said, &ldquo;[Is] idol worship, too, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Nothing is hateful &ndash; neither cap nor shoes. Each has its respective use. But if you place your shoes on your head and your cap on your feet, people will laugh and take it to be your madness. True, both cap and shoes are Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, but each of them has its proper use. The proper use of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; in the form of shoes is on the feet.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The earth is also the manifestation of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. You address it as &ldquo;Mother Earth&rdquo;. But you set your feet on it. Meaning thereby that you should adopt the proper behaviour with the proper object. You must have reverence for the Ganges, as the land in north India has been made fertile by its waters. But there cannot be any pun&#x301;ya produced from its water &ndash; salvation cannot be obtained from it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Humans create the objects of their worship according to their own intellectual standards&rdquo; &ndash; so said Shiva. In that [process there are] ma&#x301;tra&#x301;bheda [difference in degree] and starabheda [difference in gradation]. So Lord Shiva&#146;s answer to Pa&#x301;rvatii&#146;s question was,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Idol worship is also a form of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but it is the lowest form. Everything has some effect, so an idol also has some effect. Your mind will become confined to the limitations of the idol. But a human being should perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in order to expand his or her mind to infinity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Japastuti [mantra repetition and flattery] is adhama&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. There is no real love for Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;; it is simply flattery. Worshippers address Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; and say, &ldquo;O Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, give us food to eat and clothes to wear.&rdquo; You will find such things said in some places. This is flattery. Stuti means &ldquo;flattery&rdquo;. Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is the Supreme Father; will you flatter the Supreme Father?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Suppose a student is studying for his MA, and during the holidays he has come home. Suppose he stands before his father and starts out by saying, &ldquo;O Father, you are so merciful! Every month you send money. You are having me do my MA studies.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->If he utters such things, the father will say that the son has gone vagabond, and will catch hold of him and give him a good beating. Just think for yourself how unnatural this would be. Flatter you may your boss, but not your father! Hence japastuti is adhama&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Japa [mantra repetition] here really means nirbiija japa. Sabiija japa is a different thing; it comes within the scope of dhya&#x301;na [meditation]. This I will explain later. (It is connected with sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, so it is not proper to discuss it openly.) If you repeat &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; a parrot can also do that! Can that bring about any spiritual progress? Never &ndash; because there is no ideation on the meaning. It is mantra devoid of caetanya.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So one has to ideate. It is through ideation that spiritual elevation is possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Ideation may be either reverent or irreverent &ndash; Shraddhaya&#x301; helaya&#x301; va&#x301;. &ldquo;Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is my Father, hence I am repeating His name&rdquo; &ndash; here elevation is bound to occur. &ldquo;Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is displeased with me, and though I am His child, He does not look at me. Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is very cruel, I will fight against Him.&rdquo; &ndash; here you still repeat Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, but irreverently.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Approached either reverently or irreverently, the desideratum must be Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. Dhruva and Prahlad were votaries of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. And so was Ravana. Ravana repeated Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;&#146;s name irreverently. But irreverence cannot last forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Suppose one goes on repeating &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;, but the idea is also there that one has to go to Meerut tomorrow, that one has to file a case against So-and-so; then finally one again repeats &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. Then, &ldquo;The day after tomorrow there is DMC. I have to attend it in Delhi.&rdquo; Finally the person again repeats &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. What is this? Is this a show?<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Next comes dhya&#x301;nadha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;. It is madhyama&#x301; [second best]. Dhya&#x301;na is taeladha&#x301;ra&#x301;vat [like a flow of oil]. When the mind moves towards Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, that is dhya&#x301;na. Dhya&#x301;na is madhyama&#x301; because there is duality between the sa&#x301;dhaka and the object of his or her worship. And the supreme state, the uttama&#x301;vastha&#x301;, is that where the sa&#x301;dhaka and the object of worship are one &ndash; where the worshipper, the worshipped and the worship unify themselves into one. Therefore, sahaja&#x301;vastha&#x301; is supreme &ndash; it is uttama&#x301;. This is the saying of Shiva. Kabir has also said, Sa&#x301;dhu sahaja sama&#x301;dhi bhalii [&ldquo;The seeker attained sahaja sama&#x301;dhi&rdquo;]. Sahaja is derived from the prefix saha plus the root jan plus the suffix d&#x301;a. Ja means &ldquo;that which is born&rdquo;. With what is it born?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; [unit consciousness] and Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; [Supreme Consciousness] are born together. They are together, but jiivas simply do not look to Him. People think that Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is without, so they are not able to attain Him. When they look within, there is oneness. This alone is sahaja&#x301;vastha&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Sahaja&#x301;vastha&#x301; [also] means &ldquo;[that which] is easily to be attained&rdquo;. (Sahaja means &ldquo;easy&rdquo;.) Bear in mind that the process of dhya&#x301;nadha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; [may lend some of its elements to] Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na, in which there are so many mental processes. Hence sahaja&#x301;vastha&#x301; is uttama&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Now regarding this sahaja&#x301;vastha&#x301;, there is nothing to be had from without &ndash; everything can be had from within. Diiks&#x301;a&#x301; [spiritual initiation] means &ldquo;an inward march&rdquo;. This eternal march has to be learned. This alone is diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. Those who roam about looking for Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; outside themselves, and make [ritual] offerings of water to Him &ndash; all of these people are roaming outside instead of looking inside. It is as if there is plenty of food at home and one is going out to beg. All of you are very rich; you have much wealth within. So why will you roam outside?<!-- /block --></p>

And all the kun&#x301;d&#x301;as which you see nowadays at different places of pilgrimage are full of stinking water!

Shrat means Sat [or Satya], &ldquo;Absolute Reality&rdquo;, Parama Tattva.

If this feeling creeps into the mind, samata&#x301;bha&#x301;va is lost, because then one begins feeling that there is a group of people far inferior to oneself. Such a pattern is to be observed in the case of people who have come to the city from the village. They say that they don&#146;t feel like returning to the village, as the villagers are illiterate and under-developed. This feeling is very dangerous. And if such feelings creep into the mind as a result of having acquired a little intellectual knowledge, the chances of developing this complex are much greater in the realm of spirituality, when a sa&#x301;dhaka begins feeling somewhat elevated with the development of some occult powers and the feeling of a little bliss. In the second stage of spiritual practice every sa&#x301;dhaka faces this test. One must be very, very cautious, so that vanity may not develop.

Just to [limit] the quantity of food will not do &ndash; one will have to take a balanced diet, to make the body and mind strong. Food should be substantial, though moderate in quantity. This is pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  And a statue may have a proper aesthetic use, but it should not be used in an attempt to win salvation. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  The author has explained elsewhere that &ldquo;Sahaja&#x301;vastha&#x301;, the &rdquo;tranquil state&ldquo; of the Buddhists, is no different from the ideation on Brahma of the Hindus.&rdquo; &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)  See &ldquo;Mantra Caetanya&rdquo; in Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha Part 10 or Ananda Marga Ideology and Way of Life in a Nutshell, Part 11 (1990). &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)  If one&#146;s mind is concentrated on Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, even if that concentration is irreverent, one will progress spiritually. Irreverent concentration will eventually become reverent concentration. But even reverent ideation, if constantly broken by thoughts of one&#146;s personal concerns, will be ineffective. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)  A spring (sometimes a hot spring) restricted to use in religous ritual. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn6">6</a></b>)  That which is known as anna (ad + kta) in the Sanskrit language is called pin&#x301;a in the Vedic language. I remember having mentioned before that in ancient times, when the Aryans from Russia came to India, they started cultivation. The border country of Bha&#x301;rata [India] was called Saptanada Desha [Land of Seven Rivers], which later on came to be known as the Punjab. (Those seven rivers were the Jhelam, the Chenub, the Satluj, the Ravi, the Beas, the Kabul and the Sindhu.) The people of that place used to sit together at noon to have their meal &ndash; that is, in the Vedic language, to have their pin&#x301;d&#x301;a. So a place where the farmers would have their meal was called pin&#x301;iika. That pin&#x301;d&#x301;iika in Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta became pin&#x301;d&#x301;ii-a, and this in old Punjabi became changed to pin&#x301;ae, or pin&#x301;d&#x301;ii. In the Punjabi language, pindi means &ldquo;village&rdquo; &ndash; for instance, &ldquo;Rawalpindi&rdquo;, &ldquo;the habitation of the Rawals&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn7">7</a></b>)  Mental crudification is the actual phenomenon of which raorava hell is the mythological representation. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn8">8</a></b>)   Sanskrit that was unclear in the original magazine publication of this discourse omitted here. &ndash;Eds.</p>
