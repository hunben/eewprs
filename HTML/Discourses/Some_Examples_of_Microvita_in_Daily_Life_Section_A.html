<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>Krimi</b>.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Krimi do not always remain in the same form. The form they have at the time of their birth undergoes a radical change. The changes in their forms and sizes take place stage by stage. These stages of metamorphosis are  not the same in all cases. As unicellular creatures, they divide their nuclei and multiply into two or more forms. They have no sex difference and thus there is no distinction between ovum and spermatozoa. These are the creatures  of the primordial stage of creation in this expressed world. But  all the creatures of this group are not of the same type &ndash; some are born from eggs, subsequently taking the form of larvae which undergo external metamorphosis, and acquire their final form as flying creatures. As they have  an orderly growth divided into subsequent stages, they are called &ldquo;krimi&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is worth mentioning that microvita do not belong to the category of krimi. However, like krimi and all other organic and psychic  beings, microvita exist, multiply and die. But unlike krimi and other organic and psychic beings, they are not directly related to carbon atoms or carbon molecules.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Krimi can only survive in certain temperatures and under specific barometric conditions. If there is an extreme temperature or air pressure variation, they will perish. But the jurisdiction of microvita is far greater than that &ndash; they are not subjected to barometric conditions. Krimis live, grow and decay within the scope of the five fundamental factors, whereas the cruder variety of microvita function within the realm of the five inferences. Due to adverse temperatures and barometric conditions, no creatures can go to other planets under normal conditions. Unicellular creatures, however, have some advantages in  this regard. Depending upon their shapes and sizes, krimis can live in stones or any other solid matter, but they normally remain in water and other subtle fundamental factors. For this reason, human beings must ensure that their water and air remain pure. The purity of the Earth should never be neglected. As a  result of air and water pollution, the number of these types of krimi &ndash; particularly disease carrying germs and bacteria &ndash; is on the  constant increase and getting beyond the control of human  beings. The use of pesticides and germicides may be increased, but if the noumenal cause for  disease is not found, and if the degree of pollution continues to increase at the same speed as today, a day is sure to come when the polluted earth, water and air will be the cause of the collective death of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Microvita have no direct relationship to pollution, however they do have an indirect relationship. Even if the earth, air and water are not polluted, microvita will still be produced. Microvita of [[subtler varieties and of the subtlest variety]] may function within the scope of the crude [[mind]] (the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a). [[Collective]] good thoughts can check the flow of negative microvita. For this, mental and physical development is indispensable in collective life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Intellectually and spiritually advanced people, through their thoughts, can destroy or resist the movement of enemy microvita, but if sinful people continue to create newer and newer microvita in their psychic sphere, there will always remain the possibility of the creation of subtler forms of negative microvita. These microvita can cause immense harm in the collective sphere not only of different planets, but of the entire cosmos.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> But not all microvita are the enemies of human beings &ndash; some are inimical, some are friendly and some are neutral. Similarly, some krimi [germs] are inimical, some are friendly and some are neutral.<!-- /block --></p>
