<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Land means <I>vasu</I>. <I>Vasu</I> means &ldquo;where one resides&rdquo;; for example, a planet, a satellite, or any one of a number of such places where one can reside. There are eight of these, hence the word <I>as&#x301;t&#x301;avasu</I> [eight <I>vasus</I>]. Our earth is also a vasu. The one in whose vibration this <I>vasu</I> vibrates is called <I>va&#x301;sudeva. Vasudeva + an&#x301; = va&#x301;sudeva</I>. One name of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is <I>Va&#x301;sudeva</I> because name of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s father was <I>Va&#x301;sudeva</I>. So <I>vasu</I> means &ldquo;a place suitable for residing.&rdquo; In one <I>shloka</I> it is said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Bhu&#x301;-bhu&#x301;mi-dhara&#x301;-dharitrii-sarvam&#x301;saha&#x301;-vasumatii;<br>Gotra&#x301;-ku-prthivii-prthvii-ks&#x301;ama&#x301;vanii-medinii-mahii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[[Thirteen different names of the earth.]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This is <I>vasu</I>. These <I>vasus</I> or lands are vibrated by the vibration of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Not only that, there is something else as well. The English synonym for <I>vasu</I> is &ldquo;abode&rdquo;. The Farsi word is a&#x301;<I>ba&#x301;d</I>. Allahabad means &ldquo;abode of Allah&rdquo;. The word <I>a&#x301;ba&#x301;d</I> has been added to the names of many cities, for example, Allahabad or Elahabad, Jahanabad, Farukhabad, Saedabad, Hyderabad, and so forth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->This <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is not only in <I>vasu</I> or <I>a&#x301;ba&#x301;d</I> but outside it as well. For example, he is in a place measured by ten fingers. Here the literal meaning of the words &ldquo;ten fingers&rdquo; will not do, because it is not correct to always take the philological meaning of something; its inner meaning should be accepted. For example, a certain gentleman is walking along a path. Say his name is Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nan Jha&#x301;. We call him saying: &ldquo;Mr. Pain&#x32D;canan, come over here, please.&rdquo; Does Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nan here mean a man with five faces? No, of course not. Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nan is the name of that man. Here one must not take the literal meaning but rather the inner meaning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Similarly, beyond the <I>vasu</I> where <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is present, He is also there in a land measured by ten fingers. In a <I>shloka</I> we find: <I>sah bhu&#x301;mim&#x301; vishvato vrttva&#x301; atyatis&#x301;t&#x301;haddasha&#x301;un&#x32D;gulam</I> . This <I>shloka</I> has three different versions. In the <I>Rgveda</I> it reads: <I>sah bhu&#x301;mim&#x301; vishvato vrttva&#x301; atyatis&#x301;t&#x301;haddasha&#x301;un&#x32D;gulam</I> . In the <I>Yajurveda</I> it reads: <I>sah bhu&#x301;mirvishvato sprs&#x301;t&#x301;va&#x301; atyatis&#x301;t&#x301;haddasha&#x301;un&#x32D;gulam</I> . And in the Atharvaveda it reads: : <I>sah bhu&#x301;mim&#x301; sarvato vrttva&#x301; atyatis&#x301;t&#x301;haddasha&#x301;un&#x32D;gulam</I> . However, since it is a <I>rk</I> of the <I>Rgveda</I>, here the Rgvedic usage must be accepted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->We have seen that <I>vasu</I> means a habitable place. I want to say one thing in this regard. In ancient India there was a king by the name of Dasharathi Vasu. He used to make living arrangements in his kingdom for destitute people, to give them a place to live, so he was called Dasharathi Vasu by the public. Today also <I>Vasu</I> is one surname.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In this respect, planets and satellites are also <I>vasus</I> because they reverberate with the vibration of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Here the vibrational expression of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is not limited to the eight <I>vasus</I>; outside them as well its actional flow remains unimpeded. Beyond them exists the vast quinquelemental universe and the five sensory organs and five motor organs as well as various psychic planes, such as the conscious, subconscious and causal. The vibrational flow of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is active everywhere. In the flow of <I>Pratisain&#x32D;cara</I> the <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a mana</I> or causal mind is referred to as the <I>sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya mana</I> or microcosmic causal mind because in the path of <I>Pratisain&#x32D;cara</I>, <I></I>the macrocosmic causal mind cannot remain since the microcosmic causal mind is the final stage of this path of <I>Pratisain&#x32D;cara</I> while the macrocosmic causal mind is the first stage in the path of <I>Sain&#x32D;cara</I>. Causal mind means mind in seed form, subconscious mind [subtle mind] means mind in sprout form, and conscious mind [crude mind] means mind in fully expressed form. In causal mind also there are possibilities of vibration. Causal mind is a part of mind but <I>turiiya</I> [a stage of purely spiritual realization] is not a part of mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The combined name of these three states of cosmic mind &ndash; causal, subconscious and causal &ndash; is <I>triloka</I>. But for expression or the possibility of expression to exist, if a relation between <I>turiiya</I> and <I>triloka</I> is not established then that expression is not possible; in spite of some vibration existing it will be extremely limited, partial. Uninterrupted expression is not possible. For example, if you remove one potful of water, then two, then three from a pitcher of water, will any water remain in the pitcher at the end? Certainly not. However, if on the one hand, you keep taking out potfuls of water but at the same time an uninterrupted stream of water is pouring into the neck of the pitcher, then will the pitcher ever become empty? Of course not! Hence <I>turiiya</I> is a state of limitless potential.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In the <I>Shaevatantra</I>, dharma is compared to a four-legged ox. It is said: <I>es&#x301;a dharma catus&#x301;pa&#x301;dah</I> [this dharma has four legs] &ndash; conscious, subconscious, causal and <I>turiiya</I>. You may have noticed that an ox can remain standing still for a long time. The reason is that there is a certain nerve in the bodies of living beings called <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I>. If one can gain control over this <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I> then the body can remain motionless. You will see that apart from two particular animals, this is generally not the case. One of them is the ox. You can see oxen remaining as motionless as a stone in the road. At that time they keep their minds fixed in the <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I>. Human beings can also do this. Another is the lizard. One has to maintain control over this <I>ku&#x301;rma na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I>, the nerve that controls the thyroid gland.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><I>Es&#x301;a dharma catus&#x301;pa&#x301;dah</I>. That is, dharma is a four-legged entity (<I>vista&#x301;ra</I>, i.e., expansion<I>, rasa</I>, i.e., flow<I>, seva&#x301;</I>, i.e., service <I></I>and <I>moks&#x301;a</I> or <I>turiiya</I>). We are familiar with three of these but not with the fourth. The effort to become familiar with that fourth leg is called dharma. Dharma is an all-round effort to become familiar with the state of <I>turiiya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><I>Traelokye ya&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni ta&#x301;ni sarva&#x301;n&#x301;i dehatah</I>. That is, whatever is present in the macrocosm is also present in the microcosm. If an entire ocean is filled with milk, then a drop of that ocean will also be milk. In the same way these eight <I>vasus</I> or eight places are also concealed within the human being and are vibrated with one or another vibration of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Just as there are various crude and subtle expressions within the cosmic mind, there are also different crude and subtle expressions within the human mind, and all these expressions are manifested through the medium of different <I>vrttis</I>. There are six <I>cakras</I> from <I>mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra</I> to <I>a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;</I>. These six <I>cakras</I> are controlled from different places in the body. Each <I>cakra</I> is vibrated in a certain way with the vibration of energy from the cosmic mind. In the same way, the seventh <I>cakra </I>or <I>gurucakra</I> is also vibrated by a special energy of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now this <I>gurucakra</I> or guru entity or form of guru is also him, that is, that Supreme Entity, and he is attracting everything in this universe towards himself with unparalleled affection from one controlling point. The space measured by ten fingers lying between <I>a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;</I> and <I>sahasra&#x301;ra cakras</I> also belongs to him. This ten-fingered space is the abode of <I>Nis&#x301;kala</I> Brahma or pure Brahma. So the spiritual aspirant will have to gradually rise up from the bottom to the top, through <I>mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na, man&#x301;ipura, ana&#x301;hata, vishuddha, a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;</I>, and there, after bathing in the confluence of three rivers [in <I>a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra</I>] and being vibrated by the grace of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, they will gradually rise upwards to the highest point of the ten-fingered abode of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and arriving there they merge into and become one with Him, this being the highest stage of sadhana.
