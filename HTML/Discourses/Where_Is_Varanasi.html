<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of the word &ldquo;Va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii&rdquo;? In both English and Bengali the meaning of the word &ldquo;va&#x301;r&rdquo; is &ldquo;to check&rdquo; or &ldquo;to stop&rdquo;. Va&#x301;r + anat&#x301; = va&#x301;ran&#x301;a which means &ldquo;to forbid&rdquo;. It is a negative command. Similarly, ni &ndash; var + anat&#x301; = niva&#x301;ran&#x301;a. Now, &ldquo;anas&rdquo; means &ldquo;birth&rdquo;. Va&#x301;r + anas = va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;as. In Sam&#x301;skrta, va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;as becomes va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii in the feminine gender. Philosophically, va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii refers to a particular point or &ldquo;vindu&rdquo;. In the spiritual sphere, when one reaches that vindu one no longer takes rebirth &ndash; the cycle of birth and death stops and the aspirant no longer has to return to this world. In va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii there is no rebirth. It should be understood that this va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii does not refer to a particular city of Uttar Pradesh in India but to a point situated between the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; and sahasra&#x301;ra cakras, that is, between the pituitary and pineal glands. Spiritual aspirants, through the practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and with the help of the Divine Spirit, become established in that point, attaining great mental power and omniscience. Such people do not have to take another birth in this world. That is why it is said that if one dies in ka&#x301;shi, one will never be reborn. Ka&#x301;shi does not refer to a city, but to that spiritual point.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Trailokye ya&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;n&#x301;i ta&#x301;n&#x301;i sarva&#x301;ni dehatah&rdquo;. Whatever exists in this world also exists within your body. You are a microcosmic expression of the universe. That is why it has been said, &ldquo;Know thyself. Acquire self-knowledge or a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na&rdquo;. How can you acquire self-knowledge? Go deep within to the centre point of your existence. First, go to your centre plexus and then to your mula&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra. Your mula&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra is an ideational entity orbiting like a satellite around the Supreme Mula&#x301;dha&#x301;ra. If you make the effort to know your inner self, if your desire for self-knowledge is strong, all the secrets will be revealed to you. &ldquo;Trailokye ya&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;n&#x301;i ta&#x301;n&#x301;i sarva&#x301;ni dehatah&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->That point, that va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii, which, as I have said, is situated between a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; and sahasra&#x301;ra cakras, is bright and luminous. It is the true ka&#x301;shi. Ka&#x301;shi is derived from the Sam&#x301;skrta root verb ka&#x301;sh + al + striiya&#x301;m + iniip. Ka&#x301;shi means &ldquo;very luminous entity&rdquo;. I think its meaning is crystal-clear.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Some people say that the town Va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii is so-called because it is situated between the rivers Baruna&#x301; and Ashi, but that is not correct. If that were so, the name would have been Varun&#x301;a&#x301;sii and not Va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii. The correct derivation is va&#x301;r + a&#x301;nas = va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;as which becomes va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii in the feminine gender. Is the meaning clear to you now? &ldquo;Var&rdquo; means &ldquo;to forbid&rdquo; and &ldquo;a&#x301;nas&rdquo; means &ldquo;birth&rdquo;. Those who die at va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii are not reborn. It is not a city in India, but a vindu or point. One may learn the secrets of this point through the practice of vishesha yoga. During this meditation the mind ascends to such a height that there is no further need to acquire a new body. Those who have not yet learnt vishesha yoga will learn it in the future and will come to realize its significance, and will like it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->To establish the mind on this point of va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii or ka&#x301;shi, one has to quickly elevate the mind. Those who have learnt the technique of Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or ka&#x301;pa&#x301;lika sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, know what joy can be derived from this. It helps to establish the practitioner in the cult of va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii. Those who have not yet mastered it, will one day be established in the cult of va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii. Why not? Those who have acquired a human structure will surely be established in va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii.<!-- /block --></p>
