<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The many features of Tantra which distinguish it from other spiritual traditions make definition difficult within a short space. But if we are to focus on the single most characteristic of Tantra&#146;s distinguishing features, surely that must be the spirit of fight. Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti has said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The main characteristic of Tantra is that it represents human vigour. It represents a pactless fight. Where there is no fight there is no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Under such circumstances Tantra cannot be there, where there is no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, no fight. It is an impossibility to conquer a crude idea and to replace it by a subtle idea without a fight. It is not at all possible without sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Hence, Tantra is not only a fight, it is an all-round fight. (&ldquo;Tantra and Its Effect on Society&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Tantra finds or creates circumstances designed expressly to bring out, rather than to intern away, one&#146;s problematic mental tendencies. &ldquo;A practitioner of Tantra becomes elevated and attains mastery over a hostile environment. Tantra does not accept the teaching of the Vedas that human beings should move internally, and carefully avoid any association with their environment.&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Fundamental Difference between Veda and Tantra&rdquo;) So only if a spiritual path at some stage deliberately seeks out fearful, demoralizing or tempting circumstances in order to fight and overcome them by Cosmic ideation and by trust in the guru, does it deserve to be called Tantric.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is not only an external or internal fight, it is simultaneously both. The internal fight is a practice of the subtler portion of Tantra. The external fight is a fight of the cruder portion of Tantra. And the fight both external and internal is a fight in both ways at once. So practice in each and every stratum of life receives due recognition in Tantra.&#8230; The practice for raising the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is the internal sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Tantra, while shattering the bondages of hatred, suspicion, fear, shyness, etc., by direct action is the external sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. (&ldquo;Effect&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Both the &ldquo;internal fight&rdquo; and the &ldquo;external fight&rdquo; refer to the fight against internal enemies &ndash; but the latter uses external means to intensify the fight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The very first night that a Tantric goes to the burial ground, he is stricken with fear.&#8230; But when he returns home after finishing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the mind is much lighter than before. When he goes out for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the next night, he is much less fearful. And thus the Tantric steadily and slowly overcomes fear. This is the applied process of Tantra which will help the practitioner overcome all instincts. (&ldquo;Fundamental Difference&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Though practices such as that of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in a burial ground may be the clearest instances of techniques designed to bring to the surface one&#146;s mental propensities, such practices are not required of all Tantrics. But all Tantrics are brought face to face with their weaknesses in one way or other. A Tantric guru assigns to his disciples tremendous responsibilities for social change. The disciples&#146; participation in an activist movement aimed at a just and spiritually-based society forces them to confront sometimes physical fear, but more routinely the fear of social censure and the fear of the overwhelming task before them. The inferiority complex is the most debilitating fear which most of us must learn to overcome in our lives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Tantra advises, &ldquo;Jump into your environment without the least hesitation. Don&#146;t be afraid. Fear will leave you step by step. Tomorrow you will not be as fearful as you are today, the day after you will be even less fearful, and ten days from now you&#146;ll notice that you are completely fearless.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Fundamental Difference&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Out of the tremendous number of darshans, or discourses, which A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rtijii gave on a great range of subjects during thirty-seven years as preceptor of Ananda Marga, a great many have been carefully preserved in published form and/or on tape. We have drawn on this wealth for the present collection by first assembling all the discourses or sections thereof which related to the topic of Tantra; and by then electing to include all but those few discourses (all related to this part, on The Nature and Practice of Tantra) which were found to contain only topics already covered in other discourses. Though the subject matter may be virtually the same, each discourse will be found to have its own special appeal, and we recommend these discourses to readers, though regrettably they could not be included here:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate here &ndash; in addition to the original language of each speech, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if other than in this book, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In the cases of some of the discourses published here, no written record was found of the language in which the discourse was given; but if the language could be clearly inferred from the location and other circumstances of the discourse, we have cited that language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In all cases where a tape was in existence for a discourse given in English, we have re-edited the published discourse with reference to that tape. The retranslations (from the original Bengali) of &ldquo;The Intuitional Science of Tantra&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prapatti, Vipratti, and Aprapatti&rdquo; were also carried out with reference to the tapes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Wherever it is noted below that there was more than one existing translation of the same discourse, all the existing translations have been consulted in preparing the discourse for this edition. All retranslations (&ldquo;retr.&rdquo;) that were done took all possible material from existing translations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The abbreviation &ldquo;DMC&rdquo; sometimes appears at the end of a discourse. Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra was a special spiritual gathering addressed by the preceptor, or guru. The abbreviation &ldquo;RU&rdquo; at the end of a discourse indicates that the discourse constituted a Presidential speech to Renaissance Universal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the editors have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Eds.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The important early discourse &ldquo;Tantra and Its Effect on Society&rdquo; was given in Hindi, and translated soon thereafter into the English version that appears in this book. That original Hindi can no longer be found.  Because the author used English terms infrequently in the early years, translators often rendered Sanskrit terms into English in a way that was at variance with the author&#146;s preferences as they later came to be known. With this discourse, it was therefore found necessary to provide the preferred renderings, indicating the changes in square brackets.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->It was frequently the author&#146;s practice, in the case of discourses given in a language other than Bengali, to personally review the Bengali translation and to make revisions and additions. Wherever this appeared to have been done, the editors have taken the Bengali version as the basis for the English translation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The cover of the book shows the Bhuvaneshvarii Yantra. The upright and inverted triangles are an ancient Tantric design, also to be found in the Ananda Marga pratiika. (The  yantra and the pratiika should not, however, be confused. For an example of the Ananda Marga pratiika, please see the title page.)<!-- /block --></p>
