<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You all know that the meaning of the Sanskrit word <I>tan&#x301;d&#x301;u</I> is &ldquo;jumping&rdquo; or &ldquo;leaping&rdquo;, and <I>tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula</I> means &ldquo;rice&rdquo;. Rice is called <I>tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula</I> because the rice kernels jump when they are separated from the husk. Thus <I>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I> also means &ldquo;jumping&rdquo;. While jumping, when the knee comes up to the navel or above it then it is called <I>brahmata&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I>, and when the knee goes above the <I>ana&#x301;hata cakra</I> then it is called <I>vis&#x301;n&#x301;uta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I> , and when the knee crosses the <I>vishuddha cakra</I> it is called <I>rudrata&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</I>. All of you should remember this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Today at noon I talked about the fundamental principles of devotion. The subject of discourse was &ldquo;Kiirtaniiyah Sada&#x301; Harih&rdquo;. In it I discussed what should be the cardinal principles of a gentleman, what their nature should be. What is <I>kiirtana</I>, what is Hari? I also talked about that. Did you all understand it properly?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><I>Kiirtaniiyah sada&#x301; Harih</I>. The devotee will do the <I>kiirtana</I> of Hari. At that time what will Hari do? That is one question. The devotee is very dear to Hari and Hari is also very dear to the devotee. And Hari steals the devotee&#146;s sins. All this takes place. But when the devotee does the <I>kiirtana</I> of Hari, what will Hari do then? You know, if, when the devotee does <I>kiirtana</I>, the mantra is a <I>siddha mantra</I> (<I>kiirtana</I> has <I>siddha mantras</I>), an <I>as&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;ks&#x301;arii siddha mantra</I>, that is, having eight syllables and also being <I>siddha</I> [consecrated and infused with tremendous power], then as a result a certain environment is created, a special wave is created. Why is this wave produced? Each spiritual aspirant while doing <I>kiirtana</I> feels that a special wave is produced. How does it happen? Where does this wave come from? When the devotees do <I>kiirtana</I> they themselves create a certain environment. That wave emanates from the nucleus of this environment. The way that the devotees create this environment is called <I>haripariman&#x301;d&#x301;ala </I>in the scriptures. <I>Pariman&#x301;d&#x301;ala</I> means &ldquo;environment&rdquo;. This wave emanates from the <I>haripariman&#x301;d&#x301;ala</I>. At that time where does Hari remain? There is a <I>shloka</I> prevalent in the scriptures &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;ham&#x301; tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;he yogina&#x301;m&#x301; hrdaye na ca;<br>Madbhakta&#x301;h yatra ga&#x301;yanti tatra tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi na&#x301;rada.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;rada asks the question: &ldquo;It is true that you are all-pervading, but while you are everywhere you still control everything while remaining in one specific place. You control everything from one particular nucleus &ndash; this is also true. But where is this nucleus? Where is your actual residence?&rdquo; Na&#x301;rada asks Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What does the word <I>na&#x301;rada</I> mean? The word <I>na&#x301;ra</I> has three meanings in Sanskrit. One meaning of the word <I>na&#x301;ra</I> is <I>niira</I>, that is, &ldquo;water&rdquo;. The second meaning is <I>Parama&#x301; Prakrti</I>, the Supreme Operative Principle. <I>Na&#x301;ra</I> means <I>prakrti</I> and <I>ayan&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;shelter&rdquo;. Thus the one in whom <I>na&#x301;ra</I> or <I>prakrti</I> is sheltered, <I>prakrti</I>&#146;s shelter, is <I>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. <I>Na&#x301;ra</I> means <I>prakrti</I> and <I>ayan&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;shelter&rdquo;. The <I>ayan&#x301;a</I> of <I>na&#x301;ra</I> is <I>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</I>. And the third meaning of the word <I>na&#x301;ra</I> is &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. <I>Na&#x301;ra + da = na&#x301;rada</I>. In Sanskrit <I>da</I> means &ldquo;one who gives&rdquo;. Hence <I>na&#x301;rada</I> means &ldquo;one who gives <I>na&#x301;ra</I>, or devotion, one who distributes devotion&rdquo;. Na&#x301;rada was a great devotee. That Na&#x301;rada&#146;s question was: &ldquo;Lord, where do you stay? Where is your true dwelling? Where is your nucleus really located? You are everywhere but where is your nucleus?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><I>Na&#x301;ham&#x301; tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;he</I>. Some people say that Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a remains in <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I> [heaven]. <I>Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha </I>does not mean a far-away land. <I>Kun&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;contraction.&rdquo; For example, people are contracted in the cold; they are contracted out of fear or shame. So <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha </I>is used in the sense of contraction having passed, that is, where the mind does not undergo any kind of contraction, where it is liberated, free, absorbed in the love of the <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I>. Where there is no <I>kun&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;</I> it is <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I>. <I>Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I> does not mean a distant place. When there is no contraction in your mind then there is the dawn of <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha </I>in your mind. This is <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I>. But here Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a says, &ldquo;I do not remain in <I>vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha</I>&rdquo;&ndash; <I>na&#x301;ham&#x301; tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;he</I>. Why does he not remain there? It is true that where there is no contraction the devotees get the Lord, because the mind is not contracted. However, here there is no emanation of the wave of <I>kiirtana</I>. Only one person will feel it, will attain bliss. It will not be possible for that person to distribute bliss to everyone. Thus He says, <I>na&#x301;ham&#x301; tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;he</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Again He says: <I>yogina&#x301;m&#x301; hrdaye na ca</I>. What does <I>yogii</I> mean? The word <I>yogii</I> has several meanings. One meaning is: <I>sarvacinta&#x301;paritya&#x301;gonishcinto yoga ucyate</I>. Or <I>yogashcittavrttinirodhah</I>. Another meaning is: <I>sam&#x301;yogo yoga ityuktah jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; parama&#x301;tmanah</I>. In this way there are many explanations. But what does a yogi do? The yogi brings the <I>cittavrtti</I>, that is, the mental propensities to cessation, suspends and stops them. In that state all the mental propensities cease, that is, all their mental propensities are suspended, remain in a suspended state; there cannot be expression of any of [[one&#146;s]] feelings. If Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a remains there [[the yogi]] will not have any expression. The yogi feels the presence of the <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> in their heart but in this state there cannot be any outward emanation of that wave, as happens in <I>kiirtana</I>. Although <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> is present in a yogi&#146;s heart, it is a kind of dry desert. It is not sweet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->But <I>kiirtana</I> has <I>raso vae sah</I>. He is full of <I>rasa</I> i.e. sweetness, full of bliss. People derive bliss from it. They get bliss from <I>kiirtana</I>. So if Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a were to reside in a yogi&#146;s heart then no one would enjoy bliss; only that yogi would enjoy bliss. So what does Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a say? <I>Madbhakta&#x301;h yatra ga&#x301;yanti tatra tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi na&#x301;rada</I>. He says: &ldquo;O Na&#x301;rada, I reside where my devotees do my <I>kiirtana</I>.&rdquo; In other words, &ldquo;I go where my devotees are doing <I>kiirtana</I>, where they are creating the <I>Haripariman&#x301;d&#x301;ala</I>.&rdquo; This is why people get bliss from <I>kiirtana</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->I have said that doing <I>kiirtana</I> is the definite duty of every spiritual aspirant. In <I>kiirtana</I> the mind becomes very elevated. One gets bliss. One gets the wave of Hari, and if a person sits for meditation immediately thereafter then they will also experience great bliss in their meditation. Thus doing <I>kiirtana</I> is definitely a necessity for every spiritual aspirant.<!-- /block --></p>
