<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The great Shaun&#x32D;kara&#x301;ca&#x301;rya said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Tyaja durjanasa&#x301;m&#x301;sargam&#x301;, bhaja sa&#x301;dhusama&#x301;gamam<br>Kuru pun&#x301;yamahora&#x301;tram&#x301; smara nityamanityata&#x301;m&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->All creatures are born on this earth, live and then go away. &ldquo;Yah a&#x301;gacchati sah gacchati&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;one who comes goes away&rdquo; &ndash; this is the way of the world. But if certain beings only come, eat food and then die, it is because they do not understand the value of their existence. The creatures who understand the value of their existence are mind-dominated. Only those creatures whose minds are developed can realize this. The mind-dominated beings are known as human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is true that human beings are also born, live and then die, but they also do such work which leaves its impression on the earth. Swami Vivekananda said, &ldquo;As you have come onto this world, you must leave some mark behind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The quality, efficiency and tastes of all human beings are not the same. According to their efficiency and taste, human beings do some great work in the world &ndash; that alone is their impression or mark on the earth. The Bengali word for impression, &ldquo;da&#x301;g&rdquo;, is of Persian origin, while the word &ldquo;cha&#x301;p&rdquo;, is from Portuguese.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->How then should the humans live and work in this world? &ndash; this should be learned if they are to do some work which is truly worth doing. Shankaracarya said, &ldquo;Tyaja durjana sam&#x301;sargam&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;You should keep away from evil-doers (durjana).&rdquo; Who is a durjana? It is a relative term. Those who are bad to someone may be good to others. A notorious criminal may be bad to society, feared by many, yet to his little daughter he is quite dear. To her, he is not a criminal, because he loves his little daughter so much.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The meaning of &ldquo;sujana&rdquo; (good person) is that if you get physico-psycho-spiritual elevation from your association with someone, then that person is &ldquo;sujana&rdquo;. All those in a large gathering of people are usually addressed by the speakers as &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; in order to please them, but it is well known that every person there is not a true gentleman. &ldquo;Sujana&rdquo; are only those in whose company you get mundane, supramundane and spiritual elevation, whereas &ldquo;durjana&rdquo; are those who cause your downfall. Hence &ldquo;durjana&rdquo; is a relative term, for a thief cannot be an evil-doer when he is near a great person, a sannyasin, as he is unable to cause their downfall. For an ordinary person, though, that thief would be a &ldquo;durjana&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Humans will have to move ahead by carefully watching those with whom they will associate. What is the result of keeping good company? By spending time with good persons, a deep impression is imprinted on the mind, causing the desire to be good, to rise in the mind. On the other hand, if one chooses to associate with drunkards, a desire will eventually come in the mind, what is the harm if I drink a little wine? The same sort of thing will happen if one lives with thieves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->To give an example, a person is standing beside a tea-stall. There the flavour of the tea floats to the nose, and then the person says, &ldquo;Bring a cup of tea here, too&rdquo; In this incident, the flavour of the tea affects the mind. If that person had not remained near the tea stall, the smell would not have reached the nose and perhaps that person would not have taken tea for two or three days. This is the influence that association has on the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Hence humans should choose their company very carefully, for, a mistake in this will cause them to repent their whole life. Even parents who are not good should either send their children to live in a student hostel or keep them with some of their relatives who are good. One must be very strict in this. In Tantra it is said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Satsaungena bhavenmuktirasatsaunges&#x301;u bandhanam;<br>Tasma&#x301;dasatsaun&#x32D;gamudran&#x301;am&#x301; sa&#x301; mudra&#x301; parikiirttita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The Tantrik practice of Mudra&#x301; Sadhana means to associate with good human beings in order to attain liberation. Here you must remember that salvation is not only spiritual, it is in all spheres of life, in all the strata of life. In all the spheres of life &ndash; social, economic, etc. &ndash; struggle has to be launched. Wherever there is no food, begin the struggle for it; if clothing is needed, then there should be struggle for it; if there is no irrigation system fight for it. For the highest salvation of the soul is to free it from all bondages &ndash; that alone is real salvation. Spiritual salvation is the only real salvation, all other salvations are not real. This is because today one may be free from some physical bondages, but tomorrow the same will come. Today one may be free from hunger, but tomorrow hunger will return. Spiritual salvation, though, is permanent salvation, eternal freedom. Hence good association results in salvation and bad association results in bondage. Hence evil company must be avoided.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In the Sam&#x301;skrta&#x301; language, &ldquo;mudran&#x301;am&rdquo; has two meanings. One is &ldquo;to give impression&rdquo;, and the other meaning is to desert. So &ldquo;Asatsaun&#x32D;ga mudran&#x301;am&rdquo; means to desert evil company. In addition it means to print, e.g. to print a book. By mistake people call this &ldquo;Mudritkaro&rdquo;. In Sam&#x301;skrta, &ldquo;Mudrita&rdquo; means to close. For example, &ldquo;Cakhu mudrita karo&rdquo;, means to close the eyes. It is generally accepted that &ldquo;Pustaka mudrita karo&rdquo; means, &ldquo;shut the book&rdquo;; however it is not so. &ldquo;Pustaka mudrankita karo&rdquo; is correct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Whatever it is, &ldquo;Asatsaun&#x32D;ga mudran&#x301;am&#x301; karo&rdquo; means to desert evil company, and this is the practice of Mudra Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Shankaracarya said that if you leave bad company and associate with very good people, you will be able to do good for society and you will continue to do virtuous deeds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->What is a virtuous deed? Those actions which bring good to the individual and good to the society are called virtuous. Taking a dip in the Ganges is not &ldquo;Pun&#x301;ya karma&rdquo; (virtuous deed), nor is the observance of religious rituals. Only if a particular individual or the society is benefited by your actions can they be considered virtuous. If someone is unable to get food and you feed them, that is virtue.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Kuru pun&#x301;yamahora&#x301;tram&#x301; smara nityamanityata&#x301;m.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Always do virtuous deeds.&rdquo; Your life will be fruitful by those deeds. If you do not, then what is the justification for coming to this world, eating and then going away? There is no difference between that sort of life and the life of an animal &ndash; they are one and the same.<!-- /block --></p>
