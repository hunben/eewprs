<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[filler] Increase the speed of your activities thousands of times, countless times more than it is now, and accomplish your work. There are three realms: physical, mental and spiritual. It is your duty to show society the right path in these three realms. Your success also depends on your speed. Work with the infinite power of God and with infinite speed. Victory is surely yours.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->[filler] It will have to be explained to all that there will be clash between different nations as long as national feelings exist. Some may talk of disarmament, but military preparation will go on underground. If people dedicate themselves to the cause of the welfare of the entire human race, their respective nations will also be benefited. The one Cosmic Ideology will have to be preached: that the one Supreme Father, the Cosmic Entity, is the goal of all human beings. This spiritual sentiment will keep man united for all time to come. It will form the entire planetary world and even the universe into a nation. Then there will be only one nation &ndash; a World Nation. No other theory can save the human race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[filler] Satan does not have the attributes of the Absolute; he is nothing but the human mind propelled by depraving tendencies. If these tendencies are diverted properly, they no longer exist. It is within your power to kill that Satan.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[filler] Win over scandal by praise, violence by love and darkness by light.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[filler] I want every man to be guaranteed the minimum physical requirements of life; every man to get scope for the full exploitation of his psychic potentiality; every man to get equal opportunity to attain absolute truth; and, endowed with all the glories and achievements of the world, to march toward the Absolute. In and through this movement man should be made conscious of the purpose and meaning of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[filler] Every atom of this universe is the joint property of all living beings. This has to be adopted as a matter of policy; and after its recognition, the idea that this is national and that is foreign, that a particular man is fit for the citizenship of a particular country while others are not or have no rights at all, cannot stand. In reality, only vested interests appear intensely interested in such illusory matters. All men are world citizens by birth. Every man has the right to go and settle anywhere and to live like a human being. If any group of men of any country is not ready to accept this fundamental right of living beings, then it should be understood that their utterances for &ldquo;peace&rdquo; are only meant to cheat and bluff others. Mankind has a right to live not only in this small world, but also on every planet and satellite, meteorite, nebula and every particle of this vast creation. If anyone wants to deprive human beings of this very birthright, then people will have to establish it by the use of force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[filler] In all walks of present-day life, the dark shadows of immorality are fast taking definite shapes and hampering human progress. It requires a very strong moral force to wipe out this filth of immorality. One cannot expect this moral force from a government power functioning within a democratic structure. We must expect it from the non-political side. The government, be it fascist, imperialist, republican, dictatorial, bureaucratic or democratic, is sure to become tyrannical if there is no moral force to check the capricious activities of the leaders of the party in power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[filler] Those who wish to purify society of all defects will have to keep an eye on every man; social reform can be effected only through the purification of individuals. Social life cannot be elevated merely by speeches delivered from political platforms; political leaders cannot produce sadvipras by their rhetoric. Besides, who are those who deliver lectures from platforms? Are they not the people who sling the mud of political censure on others? Most of them are blind after powers. What will they teach others? Mental and spiritual training alone can create sadvipras. Sadvipras are only those who are perfect in morality and aspirants of Supreme Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->DO NOT DELAY<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Whenever considering doing good works, do not hesitate; do them immediately. Whenever contemplating doing bad works, linger and delay, so that the thought of performing them will wither away from the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Always be ready to perform good actions, even without seeking permission from anyone. Determination is the main thing; you must do a good action immediately.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[filler] What should a person do? His life is a mission. I have said that human life is an ideological flow. Whatever one does must be done for one&#146;s own liberation and for the elevation of the entire world. If someone works only for his own spiritual elevation, for his own liberation, is he not a selfish fellow? So while working for his own liberation, he must also serve others.<!-- /block --></p>
