<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In regard to the difference between a language and a dialect, I have stated that a language depends upon eight conditions, and of those eight, four were discussed. That leaves four more. They are: literature, intonation, psycho-acoustic and inferential acoustic notes, and syntax. The first of these to be discussed today will be literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Literature: A language must have its own literature in order to be a separate language. The English word &ldquo;literature&rdquo; comes from the Latin word liter which means &ldquo;brick&rdquo;. Long ago, before the advent of printing, separate letters used to be moulded from clay which was then fired like a brick. Just as companies stamp their name on their bricks when they are fired, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, omega, theta and other letters were fired like bricks, much like other work with fired clay. The handicraft that uses fired clay is called &ldquo;terracotta&rdquo; in English. The terracotta industry originated in Bankura District&#146;s Vishnupur. In this kind of industry the clay is first moulded and then fired. Then it is pasted in the temple with a mixture of lime and sugar. The handicraft of Vishnupur was copied by other places and so the industry spread.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I was saying that these letters were fired like bricks and for that reason they were called liter in Latin. This is the origin of the English word &ldquo;later&rdquo;. When clay is fired it turns reddish, thus reddish soil is called &ldquo;laterite soil&rdquo;. Since the soil of Rarh is quite reddish it is called the &ldquo;land of laterite soil&rdquo; or ra&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;ma&#x301;t&#x301;ir desh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, the art that rose up on the basis of these letters is called &ldquo;literature&rdquo; in English.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->It should be mentioned that what is called sa&#x301;hitya is not identical or does not convey the same significance as the English word &ldquo;literature&rdquo;. There is a night and day difference between the two. Literature refers to that art form which is based on letters while sa&#x301;hitya is something altogether different. Simply being an art form based on letters does not qualify something to be called sa&#x301;hitya. For it to be sa&#x301;hitya it must imbibe the thought of welfare. Sa&#x301;hitya means hitena saha [with welfare]. In other words, if a piece of literature is not motivated by the thought of welfare then it cannot be classified as sa&#x301;hitya. For this reason the scope of literature is vaster than the scope of sa&#x301;hitya. Something which is created from language but which is not motivated by the thought of welfare may be considered to be literature but it cannot be considered to be sa&#x301;hitya. In simple terms, all sa&#x301;hitya is literature but not all literature is sa&#x301;hitya. It is a common error to consider the English word &ldquo;literature&rdquo; to be the equivalent of sa&#x301;hitya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Those compositions which we call apasa&#x301;hitya come within the scope of literature but since they are not motivated by the thought of welfare they do not deserve to be called sa&#x301;hitya. Amongst English writers we find in Shakespeare an unprecedented fusion of literature and sa&#x301;hitya. Now in Keat&#146;s compositions do we find as much sa&#x301;hitya as we do literature? This is something for the scholars to decide. In Scott as well, how much of each one finds is something to think about. Kipling&#146;s compositions are more literature than sa&#x301;hitya. In Milton&#146;s compositions we find pure sa&#x301;hitya, although there is some literary value as well. There is a great sa&#x301;hityik quality in the works of George Bernard Shaw.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->However dazzling pure literature may be, it is transitory and cannot be called sa&#x301;hitya. Satyendranath Datta was a magician with metre. His works have more literary value than sa&#x301;hityik value. On the other hand, Rabindranath Tagore&#146;s compositions demonstrate an unprecedented blending of literature and sa&#x301;hitya. Valmiki&#146;s Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a has sa&#x301;hityik value but not as much literary value. His language is also not that developed. On the other hand, Vyasdeva&#146;s Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata is almost cent per cent sa&#x301;hitya but it has, by comparison, more literary value than the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Kalidas&#146;s works have tremendous literary value but not as much sa&#x301;hityik value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Thus it should be borne in mind every step of the way that literature and sa&#x301;hitya are not one and the same. No composition can be called sa&#x301;hitya if it is not motivated by the thought of welfare and from an erudite standpoint it must, perforce, be rejected. However as literature it certainly remains meaningful and valuable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Wordsworth&#146;s compositions do not have that much literary value but they have great sa&#x301;hityik value. Romain Rolland&#146;s works have profound sa&#x301;hityik value, very lofty, but while their literary value cannot be sneezed at, they are not that wonderful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Thus, whenever judging the compositions of a poet or a writer, rather than using the touchstone of the era or the environment, I would test them by using a measuring rod that will stand the test of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit synonym for the English word &ldquo;letter&rdquo; is aks&#x301;ara. Aks&#x301;ara means &ldquo;that which is not ks&#x301;ara [perishable]&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which does not undergo destruction, which does not decay&rdquo;. In other words, that which is and will remain as it has been. Conversely, whatever is perishable or subject to decay will one day come to an end. In one verse of the Yajurveda it is said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;aram&#x301; pradha&#x301;namamrta&#x301;ks&#x301;aram&#x301; harah<br>Ks&#x301;ara&#x301;tmana&#x301; viishate deva ekah<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[Prakrti is ever-waning and Purus&#x301;a is changeless and immortal. The Supreme Entity controls both Prakrti and Purus&#x301;a.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It means that that which is born from prakrti is perishable and will gradually decay and come to an end, but that which is imperishable is eternal; it will never be destroyed. Whatever sound has been produced on this earth, whatever song has been sung, will continue to reverberate in the cosmic hub for infinite time. It has no end. No one will be able to check it. Therefore the first idea of humanism is that people must be allowed to speak freely. Unfortunately nowadays those anti-Neohumanistic theories which give indulgence to dogma are flourishing and thereby depriving people of their fundamental right of free speech. They are not fulfilling the first condition of human expression. This is a great tragedy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There are fifty letters in Sanskrit beginning with a and ending with ks&#x301;a. Since they are held together like a garland they are collectively called the aks&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301;, the garland of letters. Because this garland of letters is held together in this universe on the breast of Parama Purus&#x301;a through the dance of Parama&#x301; Prakrti, it is also called in philosophical language the rudra&#x301;ks&#x301;a. In the Atharvaveda one finds Bhadraka&#x301;lii [manifestation of the primordial force] holding the fifty letters [they are depicted as skulls]. She has forty-nine around her neck and one in her hand. Actually this is not the case. This conception reflects the ignorance of the common people. It is, in fact, the garland of letters. In former times people did not know how to write letters. Written letters had yet to be invented. Thus they tried to indicate them by drawing the mouth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->I said earlier that that which is created based on bha&#x301;va is called sa&#x301;hitya, thus it is incorrect to teach small children that literature is called sa&#x301;hitya or that the English synonym for sa&#x301;hitya is literature. It is much better to admit ignorance in this case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now, no one can claim that what you call sa&#x301;hitya or what you call literature must be written down. If something had to be written to be considered sa&#x301;hitya then that would have eliminated the Rgveda and the Yajurveda from the list because in those days there was no written script. Pupils used to memorize what their masters said, thus another name for the Vedas is Shruti, that is, &ldquo;that which is learnt by hearing&rdquo;. Thus sa&#x301;hitya does not in any way mean that something has to be written down. Sa&#x301;hitya can be oral as well, and the Vedas are an example of this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->For a long time people&#146;s minds were bound by the demons of superstition whenever any work was or was not done. Hence we see that even after the invention of written script people did not write down the Vedas and other scriptures. They believed that since their forefathers had not written down the Vedas then it would have been unjust and undesirable for them to write them down. Actually they conveniently forgot that written script had not been invented at that time. It was only later on, when the Kashmir pandits of northwest India began to write in Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script that they realized the impossibility of committing the four Vedas to memory. Not only that, out of the 108 extant parts of the Vedas, fifty-two had vanished. Thus they decided to write down the Vedas thinking that if they delayed much longer the Vedas might all disappear. So they wrote down the remaining portions of the Vedas in Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script. Those parts that had vanished were never written down and no matter how much effort is expended those lost portions will never be recovered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->When it became impossible to memorize the four Vedas as a whole the pandits decided that it would work better if they committed a single Veda to memory instead of all four. Those who were able to memorize a single Veda were given the title Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;eya (Pa&#x301;nr&#x301;e), that is, one who is a scholar (pandit) of one Veda.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Those who were able to commit two Vedas to memory were called Dvivedii (Duve). Similarly, pandits of three Vedas were known as Trivedii (Tewa&#x301;rii) and pandits of all four Vedas were known as Caturvedii (Caove). Later on the Yajurveda became so big that it was divided into two parts, the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;ayajurveda and the Shuklayajurveda. Those who were pandits in the Shuklayajurveda were called Shukla (Shukul in the spoken language). In this way, when the Vedas grew beyond all capacity to memorize them, the pandits found themselves forced to give them a written form. Apart from this written form of the Vedas, the unwritten portion cannot be kept outside of the purview of sa&#x301;hitya. It must certainly be classified as oral sa&#x301;hitya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Previously I stated that  Bhojpuri, Magahii, Chatrishgar&#x301;ii and other languages deserve to be accepted as full-fledged languages. From the standpoint of literature as well they certainly deserve to be considered separate languages because all of these languages have their own oral literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Maethilii literature is nine hundred years old. There was a writer of Maethilii literature who predated Vidaypati. His name was Jyotiriishvara Thakur, the composer of the Varn&#x301;aratna&#x301;kara. He was the father of Maethilii literature. The pioneer of the Chatrishgar&#x301;ii language was Naval Sharma who wrote literature in that language. None of these languages is a dialect. If someone wants to undervalue them by calling them dialects then I would have to say that they have no acquaintance with learning no matter how much praise they might have received.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->English literature before the time of Alfred was oral. He encouraged written English literature and from his time onwards it began to flourish, therefore he is called the father of English literature. Hussain Shah can also be given the same appellation in Bengali literature because he was the first nawab in that old, dark era to encourage poets and writers to compose literature, and to have religious books such as the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata and the Bhagavatam translated into Bengali. Bengali literature existed before the time of Hussain Shah but there is no indication that it enjoyed any government acceptance. The epic poetry that was composed by order of the kings cannot be said to have enjoyed government acceptance because in most cases the kings used to financially support these works out of greed for their own fame. The Carya&#x301;pada (Carya&#x301;caryavinishcayah) is classified as sa&#x301;hitya and it is more than a thousand years old. Most of these works were composed between thirteen hundred and a thousand years ago. At the time that the Carya&#x301;padas were written, Bengal was under the influence of the Kalacakraya&#x301;na branch of Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na Buddhism. The principal centre of the Kalacakraya&#x301;niis was Bajrayoginii village near Vikrampur in Dacca District. Anyhow, Bengali did not have any written literature before the Carya&#x301;padas because at that time Bengali was still rather limited. Moreover, in that era Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta was still prevalent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta separated into two branches &ndash; eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii and western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii. The languages belonging to the eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii group are Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Maethilii, Koshalii and Angika; those belonging to western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii are Magahii,  Bhojpuri, Na&#x301;gpurii (the language of western Ranchi) and Chatrishgar&#x301;ii. In eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii the verb-endings do not change according to number and gender. For example, Ra&#x301;m ja&#x301;cche [Ram is going] (singular) and Ta&#x301;ra&#x301; ja&#x301;cche [they are going] (plural). Here there is no difference in the verb-endings. Likewise with Ra&#x301;m ja&#x301;cche, Siita&#x301; ja&#x301;cche &ndash; here also there is no change in the verb-endings despite the difference in gender, that is, both use the same verb form. Of course, in Maethilii there are exceptions to this that have arisen in modern times. For example, Ra&#x301;m gela&#x301;h but Siita&#x301; geliih. As regards number, there is a difference in Oriya between the singular and the plural in the future tense of the first person. For example, the verb-ending for &ldquo;I am going&rdquo; is jibi in the singular but jibu in the plural. Magahii, despite being a western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii language, does not have any exception to this rule. In  Bhojpuri the masculine form is karata&#x301; while the feminine form becomes karatiya&#x301;. The masculine dil ca&#x301;hela&#x301; becomes a&#x301;tma&#x301; ca&#x301;helii in feminine gender. Similarly the masculine gaila becomes gelun in feminine gender.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->I was saying that something does not have to be written to be literature. Alongside the Carya&#x301;padas in old Bengali and the written literature of the middle ages, the pervasive oral unwritten literature that existed cannot be discounted. In fact, not only during the old and middle ages, but today as well, there is an oral literature sprinkled alongside the written literature. Such oral forms of literature as Tusu songs (western Rarh), Bha&#x301;du songs (eastern Rarh), Bhawaia (north Bengal), Bha&#x301;t&#x301;iya&#x301;li (southeast Bengal), A&#x301;ul (central Bengal), Baul (Rarh), Mu&#x301;rshida&#x301; (central Bengal), Sa&#x301;ri (Dacca, Pa&#x301;bna&#x301;), Ja&#x301;riga&#x301;n (Mymensing), Vratakatha&#x301;, Pa&#x301;nca&#x301;lii, lullabies, and so on, cannot be denied their right of admittance into the courtyard of literature. From the literary standpoint this oral literature must also be respected as literature, regardless of its tangibility or intangibility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Intonation: Every language has its own intonation or style of pronunciation, just as every dialect has more or less its own intonation. This changes from village to village, mile to mile. If one hears O man&#x301;i bha&#x301;t kha&#x301;va&#x301; na&#x301; one can understand where that language comes from.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Earlier I was talking about King Alfred. During his time the educated English in the higher rungs of society preferred to study French. The study of French literature used to be a matter of pride. They used to go to Paris, France from time to time in order to perfect their French accent. There is a story connected with this. England&#146;s Henry the Eighth was an unruly king. Once he came to Paris with the queen. In Paris many kinds of covetable drinks were available, thus when they were in Paris his desire for drink naturally increased. One day, while under the influence of liquor, he beat the queen so mercilessly that one of her legs became practically crippled. For several days she was obliged to drag it behind her as she walked. When the time came they returned to London (In those days they did not call it London but rather Londre in the aristocratic French language). The residents of the city fell head over heels in the nooks and crannies of the royal residence trying to see whether or not the king and queen had brought back any new fashions from Paris. They saw [Princess] Elizabeth dragging her leg and thought perhaps that this kind of walk was some kind of ultra-modern French style. Women have one great quality; they can easily imitate others. Thus it happened that within three to four days most of the women in the aristocratic households were dragging their leg behind them when they walked and taking a lot of pride in it. It is not written in the histories whether they ever discovered what the real story was behind the queen dragging her leg when she walked. Elizabeth&#146;s style of walking while dragging her leg was called the &ldquo;Elizabethan gait&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Anyhow the English used to study French but they used to feel difficulties becoming accustomed to the French style of pronunciation because in French there is no pronunciation of the t&#x301;a varga. In English the pronunciation of the t&#x301;a varga predominates and the use of the ta varga is practically nil.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Young boys are called &ldquo;boy&rdquo; in English and garcon in French but at that time in London people preferred the word garcon. The &ldquo;c&rdquo; in French has two different pronunciations. Sometimes it is similar to la and sometimes closer to sha. By adding the cedilla the pronunciation falls somewhere between sa and sha. The English used to pronounce the French word restaurent as res&#x301;t&#x301;uren&#x301;t&#x301; (instead of restora&#x301;n) and the French word hospital as haspita&#x301;l (instead of apita&#x301;l). The reason is that the t&#x301;a varga is not pronounced in French while in English there is limited pronunciation of the ta varga. Thus the French word mesdames (meda&#x301;m) became mesdems in English. In this way the English could not escape the influence of English intonation while speaking French.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Just as every language has its own intonation, so does every dialect. That intonation is captured in the various specific local pronunciations. For example, the pronunciations ja&#x301;ti pa&#x301;rla&#x301;m na&#x301;, kha&#x301;ti pa&#x301;rla&#x301;m na&#x301;, ca&#x301;d (ca&#x301;nd), pha&#x301;d (pha&#x301;nd), and so on, indicate that it is the language of Jessore. There is a special type of intonation in the Gambhiira&#x301; songs of Maldah District. When Indians speak English there is a different pronunciation in each area according to the influence of the locality. The influence of Bengali intonation is clearly evident when Bengalees speak English. &ldquo;Giva me a glassa of watera&rdquo; &ndash; you will hear this kind of pronunciation and by hearing it you can tell that this is the influence of a certain local area. If someone who is not accustomed to speaking Calcutta Bengali wants to speak it then there will be a definite difference in their pronunciation. Once a certain gentleman from Burdwan was speaking with a gentleman from Calcutta in very good Calcutta Bengali but when the word kya&#x301;nda&#x301;i came out of his mouth he gave away that he was not actually from Calcutta at all. Once a Bihari gentleman was standing in front of a betel shop in Lucknow and said dot&#x301;ho pa&#x301;nka&#x301; khili dijiye [give me a couple of khilis (betel leaf with lime, catechu and betel-nut folded inside)]. What he should have said was do khiliya&#x301;n dija&#x301;nye. When the betel seller gave him his betel he said &ndash; do khiliya&#x301;n li ja&#x301;nye, &ldquo;t&#x301;ho&rdquo; udha&#x301;r milega&#x301; [here are your two khiliya&#x301;n, the &ldquo;t&#x301;ho&rdquo; you will get over there]. When an Englishman speaks Hindi he finds himself unable to avoid the influence of his own language&#146;s intonation. He says eya&#x301; mya&#x301;n, t&#x301;um kid&#x301;ha&#x301;r hyay, pa&#x301;ni car&#x301;a&#x301;o. Mistaken pronunciation is a social offence because successive mistakes in the pronunciation of a word or words become widespread in the society and lead to the distortion of a language. Thus teachers should exercise extreme caution in this regard, otherwise their poor pronunciation will have an undesirable effect on their students and millions will suffer for it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The intonation of a particular language should be mastered for that language. In Sanskrit the pronunciation of the ma is accepted in the conjuncts sma or dma (for example, padma &ndash; pad - ma), but in Bengali sma is pronounced like sya and dma is pronounced like dda, that is, ma is not pronounced separately. Sanskrit should be pronounced according to its own particular intonation and Bengali should also be pronounced according to its own style. Hindi and English also should follow their respective styles. The standard colloquial form of Bengali is Calcutta Bengali, hence it is only reasonable that educated Bengalees speak Calcutta Bengali. Maethilii, Avadhii,  Bhojpuri, etc. have their own intonations and those languages should be pronounced according to their respective intonations. For example, in Maethilii the rule is that if i follows a consonant in a word then the i is pronounced before the consonant, not after the consonant. For example, one writes pa&#x301;nii but pronounces it pa&#x301;in. Ma&#x301;t&#x301;i is pronounced mait&#x301;; bha&#x301;gi is pronounced bha&#x301;ig; pisii is pronounced pius; dar&#x301;ibha&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; is pronounced da&#x301;ir&#x301;bha&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;, and so on. If a triangle is created between three points located in London, Cambridge and Oxford then the spoken language of the area lying inside the triangle is standard spoken English and should be followed. Cockney and American English pronunciation are not correct pronunciations of the English language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->I have said many times in the past and will repeat again that there is a need for an easy, well-understood spoken language with a high quality of intonation to be accepted as the standard spoken and written language for each and every language. In this respect, it appears that the Bengali of Calcutta should be considered to be standard Bengali. In the same way, the spoken language of Moghulpura&#x301; (near Lahore in Pakistan) for Panjabi, Campa&#x301;nagar for Angika (a little to the west of Bhagalpur &ndash; during the time of Karn&#x301;a this Campakanagarii was the capital of Angadesh), Gumla&#x301; for Na&#x301;gpurii, Cuttack for Oriya, Shivasagar for Assamese, Rajgir for Magahii (Rajgir or Rajgiri or Girivraja was the old capital of Magadha &ndash; it is situated in the heart of Magadha), Madhuvanii for Maethilii, Dumraon for  Bhojpuri (this is situated in the ancient district of Bhojpur), Rewa for Ba&#x301;ghelii, Delhi&#146;s Chandnichowk for Urdu (Lucknow&#146;s language is not Urdu but Avadhii), and Raipur for Chattrishgar&#x301;ii should be considered to be their respective language&#146;s accepted standard language. These languages not only take less time to speak, they also save space when they are written. It is pleasant to hear these free and unencumbered languages being spoken. The sixth condition for acceptance as a language is precisely this style of intonation, therefore attention must be paid to it.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  The real meaning of the word pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; is &ldquo;intelligence resplendent with divine knowledge (veda)&rdquo;, or &ldquo;spiritual wisdom&rdquo; &ndash; aham&#x301; brahma&#x301;smiiti buddhih ta&#x301;mitah pra&#x301;ptah pan&#x301;d&#x301;itah, that is, one who possesses this intelligence resplendent with divine knowledge deserves to be called pandit.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  Some people claim that the use of the ta varga is non-existent in English but this is altogether untrue. [&ldquo;The&rdquo;, &ldquo;thousand&rdquo;, &ldquo;that&rdquo;, &ldquo;those&rdquo;, etc.] are definitely pronounced with the ta varga.</p>
