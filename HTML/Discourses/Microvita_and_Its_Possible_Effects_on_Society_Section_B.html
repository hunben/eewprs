<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->How will the chemical formulae undergo changes due to research on microvita?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As a result of intensive research on microvita, there will be many significant changes in the chemical formulae of various objects. During scientific experiment in chemical laboratories, you have surely noticed that the results of chemical reactions are not always the same in spite of temperature, atmospheric pressure and atmospheric conditions remaining the same. This is due to the difference in the number and denominations of the microvita present in the samples. Suppose there are two samples of calcium phosphate (CaPO2). Chemically, both the samples contact the same amount of oxygen, yet the number of microvita present in the oxygen of sample A may be 10 million more than that of sample B. Obviously, in chemical reactions the results will vary. Whatever may be the external chemical structure, the internal structure will be greatly changed due to an increase or decrease in the number of microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A little intensive research will make the situation clearer. For instance, take the case of calcium sulphate. Suppose there are two samples of calcium sulphate. The formulae in both cases is the same, that is, CaSO4. Suppose sample A has 20 million more microvita than sample B. In that case, the new formula for sample A will be written as CaSO4 (Group A MV 20 million). In the changed circumstances, the size of chemical formula will be bigger that what it is at present, and accordingly, they will give much more information. In case of sodium carbonate (NA2CO3) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), this is more applicable. Any change in the external structure will automatically introduce qualitative changes in the objects. For instance, when hydrogen monoxide (H20) is changed into hydrogen peroxide (H202), there is change in the external structure and a corresponding qualitative change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Will microvital research affect the commercial transaction of this Earth? If so, why so? If not, why not?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Intensive research in microvita will surely bring about radical changes in the realm of commercial transactions. Suppose a certain country is making a huge profit by selling sodium nitrite. Now, if the denomination and the number of the microvita present in the oxygen of the sodium nitrite is decreased or increased in the sodium nitrite factory of another country, then the buyers may not like to buy sodium nitrite supplied by the former country. Naturally, there will be a change in the pattern of international commercial transactions as a result of the production of commodities with the increase or decrease in the number of microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Again, take the case of jute. The quality of jute in the different districts of Bengal varies, although the jute seeds are the same everywhere. In Bengal, all are aware of the fact that there is a clear difference in the quality of jute in the districts of Maymansingha, Jalpaiguri and &#146;Murshidabad. The cause is the same in this case also &ndash; the varying number of microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Take another case &ndash; the case of potato. Even after the use of the same chemical fertilizer, the rate of production and taste of potatoes in all cases are not uniform. Perhaps many persons are not aware of the cause of the difference in the rate of production and taste of potatoes from one place to another. The cause lies in the number and denomination of microvita. The difference in the number of microvita in oxygen accounts for this difference.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->By the way, it may be mentioned that the oxygen present in sodium nitrite acts as a fertilizer in soil. Sodium nitrite in colloquial Bengali is called &ldquo;shora&#x301;&rdquo;. In Bihar, the Sone river is bigger than the Falgu river, and in both the rivers there are good deposits of sodium nitrite, but the sodium nitrite of the Falgu river is more productive than that of the Sone river. This is why the soil of Mokamatal, which is inundated by the flood waters of the river Falgu, yields a richer harvest than the fields flooded by the Sone river. Chile in South America is the largest supplier of sodium nitrite in the world market.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In India there is a constant shortage of tin and copper. By bringing changes in the inner physical structure of objects with the application of microvita, necessary elements can be created. In the same manner, petroleum can be artificially synthesized with the help of microvita. This sort of change takes place with the change in the internal structure of objects. There is greater scope for change in metals than in non-metals. Newer varieties of explosives will be created in the future. In fact, there will be radical changes in the field of pyro-technology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->How will the theory of microvita affect pharmaco-chemistry and biotechnology?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There will be revolutionary changes in the fields of pharmo-chemistry and biotechnology. A particular object has its particular medicinal value. Take, for instance, the case of copper sulphate. It contains copper, sulphur and oxygen. Any variation in atomic proportions brings changes in the quality and effectiveness of medicines. Changes in the number of microvita bring qualitative change. Intensive pharmaco-chemistry research will reveal the amount of microvita required to produce particular kinds of medical effects, and accordingly a scientist will be able to evolve accurate and effective formulae for various medicines. Naturally, the old and outdated formulae will be discarded. Hence, pharmaco-chemistry is sure to be affected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->It is often found that the same medicine produced by different companies has varying effectiveness. The medicine produced by one company is found to be more effective than the one produced by the another company. Here also variations in the number and classification of microvita account for such differences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Similarly, microvita theory will also influence pyro-technology. It is noticeable that fire crackers manufactured by one company produce more or less sound than those of another company. The greater the internal movement, the higher the frequency, and as a result the explosive potential is intensified, producing greater sound. The mobility of microvita influences the internal movement. Consequently, there will be great changes in the control and production of highly powerful bombs. And as this is concerned with speed, the very nature and mode of the speed of rockets will be affected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now a question arises. How does the theory of microvita affect biochemistry?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The internal protoplasmic formula will change. Nuclei can also be affected by microvita, and protoplasm will be affected by bringing changes in the nucleus with the help of microvita. The displacement of the nucleus can be brought about with the help of microvita, which will bring qualitative change in the internal structure. Internally, the hormones will be affected, and thus externally, the corporeal structure will also be affected. The longevity of all forms of protoplasm is twenty one days. Changes will also occur in this regard. A change in the very appearance of human beings is also sure to come.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->As a result of the inter-transmutation of microvita, positive and negative, can a mango be changed into an egg? Yes. If change is brought in the nuclear mass of the protoplasmic cell of a mango by properly harnessing the quantitative value of its microvita, this change can be brought into effect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Can a caterpillar be converted into casein under normal temperature if the theory of microvita is properly explored? It can be done as per the process stated above by changing the pressure. In that case, there can be a change in the atmospheric pressure without changing the temperature. There will be a change in calorie, but that does not mean that there will be a change in the temperature.<!-- /block --></p>
