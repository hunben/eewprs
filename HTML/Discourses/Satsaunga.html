<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Even a golden vessel needs polishing occasionally. Unmaintained it gathers dust and dirt and loses its lustre. Similarly, even a good person or a sa&#x301;dhaka needs proper maintenance, for in a world of constant change, care must be taken that the change be always towards the better or the higher. Keeping good company is essential for this positive development. While bad company strengthens the bondage of the soul, good company is conducive to liberation and salvation. The keeping of good company is conducive to liberation and is known as satsaun&#x32D;ga in Sanskrit. When satsaun&#x32D;ga is followed, either physically or mentally or both, the subconscious mind, and thus the conscious mind, are charged with better and higher influences. This change will move the follower forward towards higher and better goals. The alternative is asatsaun&#x32D;ga, the keeping of bad company, which leads one into greater and greater bondage. It has been said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This means that through satsaun&#x32D;ga one achieves liberation; whereas asatsaun&#x32D;ga leads to greater bondage. [And the meaning of the second line is: &ldquo;The mudran&#x301;am &ndash; shunning &ndash; of bad company is called mudra&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There are two types of satsaun&#x32D;ga &ndash; external and internal. Just as the best medicine is Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself, the best satsaun&#x32D;ga is also Parama Purus&#x301;a. Internal satsaun&#x32D;ga is the satsaun&#x32D;ga of Parama Purus&#x301;a, that is, the thought of Parama Purus&#x301;a during all the [waking] hours of the day, even when the bodily organs are engaged in worldly activities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Internal satsaun&#x32D;ga is absolutely essential. Those practising internal satsaun&#x32D;ga may, as far as practical, attend external satsaun&#x32D;ga also, but if they cannot do so at any time, there will be no harm. But mere external satsaun&#x32D;ga, that is, the mere sitting among good persons while the mind forgets Parama Purus&#x301;a or remains engrossed in undesirable thoughts, is not good.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The importance of satsaun&#x32D;ga lies in the subconscious mind. In the realm of the conscious layer of the mind, processes are natural and mostly alike between human and animal, and no pa&#x301;pa [sin] is incurred. The unconscious layer is beyond the sphere of the active mind. The subconscious layer of the mind is of basic importance because it affects the conscious as well as the unconscious minds. It is like a two-way flow from the subconscious mind. The flow is swifter downwards, that is, towards the conscious mind. It is slower upwards, that is, towards the unconscious mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The subconscious mind is subject to three processes, namely, smaran&#x301;a, manana and nididhya&#x301;sana.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Strictly speaking nididhya&#x301;sana takes place mostly beyond the subconscious mind, but the subconscious leads to it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Smaran&#x301;a means the recollecting and rethinking of what was heard earlier.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Manana means the recollecting and the rethinking of what was imbibed earlier through the other sense organs. This rumination which is involved in smaran&#x301;a and manana influences the conscious mind and activates it into causing actions, good or bad, depending upon the nature of the impressions recollected and rethought during smaran&#x301;a and manana. Moreover, the unconscious mind is also concerned. Thus satsaun&#x32D;ga, where one hears, sees, smells, etc., desirable things, leads to desirable smaran&#x301;a and manana and to good actions, while the reverse is the result of bad company. When the subconscious has desirable smaran&#x301;a and manana, and if they are collected and directed one-pointedly through the [subconscious] mind to Parama Purus&#x301;a, that is known as holy smaran&#x301;a and holy manana. And if the subconscious smaran&#x301;a and manana are focused through the unconscious onto Parama Purus&#x301;a, there is nididhya&#x301;sana. Here again lies the importance of satsaun&#x32D;ga.<!-- /block --></p>
