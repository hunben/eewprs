<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[His hands and feet are everywhere; His eyes, heads and faces are everywhere; His ears are everywhere; He exists enveloping everything.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The palms &ndash; pa&#x301;n&#x301;i &ndash; of the Lord are everywhere &ndash; sarvatah. Whatever is offered to Him, good or bad, He receives. And whenever and wherever it is offered to Him, He receives it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Scriptures say that the ordinary human beings of the world use their power of discrimination before they decide upon what to receive and what not to receive when offered. They accept only that which they like and reject that which they do not like. Elevated beings &ndash; uttama purus&#x301;a &ndash; on the other hand, do not accept anything from anyone. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is entirely different from these two groups. He makes no discrimination whatever and accepts all that is offered to Him by any of His children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->People normally offer sentient things to different deities &ndash; white flowers are generally offered to them. But to Shiva many offer even red flowers such as the java, or Chinese rose, which is a flower of ta&#x301;masika [static] colour.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> This is because Lord Shiva, Parama Purus&#x301;a, has His palms ready to receive anything and everything. One may offer one&#146;s reverence &ndash; shraddha&#x301; &ndash; or one&#146;s abuse &ndash; hela. The Lord&#146;s palms are ever-joined to receive it &ndash; Shraddhaya&#x301; helaya va&#x301; [&ldquo;With reverence or with indifference&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Once Lord Buddha was camping in a mango orchard at Baishali. A large number of people used always to [come and] accept the path shown by the Lord. But a particular individual and his group were very much opposed to Lord Buddha. It so happened that the group, without the individual himself, came to the mango orchard where Lord Buddha was camping, and were influenced by the Lord and accepted Buddhism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This news greatly agitated this man, and in anger he came to the orchard and started abusing Lord Buddha in all sorts of ways. Lord Buddha maintained his usual equipoise towards all this. One feels happy and encouraged in abusing someone only if he or she finds that person affected by the acts of abuse. This man found Lord Buddha undisturbed and was greatly disappointed, finding all his hard labour gone to waste. When he had done all the abusing [he could] for quite some time and his stock of bad words might have been coming to an end, the Lord urged the man to listen to him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Lord Buddha asked the man, &ldquo;Suppose you give something to somebody which he accepts; then the ownership of the thing is transferred to the receiver, isn&#146;t it?&rdquo; The man agreed. The Lord continued, &ldquo;And if the man rejects the offering, will not the thing be returned to its owner?&rdquo; The man again agreed. Lord Buddha concluded, &ldquo;All the words given by you have not been accepted by me!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->But the Lord [Parama Purus&#x301;a] has His palms ever ready to accept all that is offered by His children anywhere in the world. The palms of human beings are so small &ndash; they can receive and contain so little. Their palms simply cannot receive more than this [indicates]. But the palms of the Lord are large enough to receive any quantity from all His children at the same time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Lord&#146;s feet (pada) are also everywhere. There is no place which is inaccessible to Him. If a person is at a particular place and has to move to some other place, he or she will have to travel. But the Lord is everywhere, and He in reality does not have to move. In other words, He has so many feet that He is able to reach any place and be available at all places at all times. Elsewhere, scriptures say:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Tadejati tannaejati taddu&#x301;re tadvantike<br>Tadantarasya sarvasya tadu sarvasya&#x301;sya va&#x301;hyatah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[The Supreme Entity moves; the Supreme Entity is unmoving. The Supreme Entity is far, far away; no, the Supreme Entity is the nearest entity. He is the inside of everything; He is also the outside of everything.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->None of His children are ever alone. The Lord is ever with them at all moments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Sarvato&#146;ks&#x301;i &ndash; &ldquo;the Lord has His eyes &ndash; aks&#x301;i &ndash; everywhere also.&rdquo; The word aks&#x301;a has two letters, a and ks&#x301;a. From a to ks&#x301;a, in the Nagari system of letters, there are fifty letters. These letters are the acoustic roots of the fifty propensities through which human beings function. The different sounds are only a mixture and combination in varying degrees of these acoustic vibrations. So in other words, aks&#x301;a represents the whole set of the vibrations; that is, the creation. Since we see this creation with our eyes, the eye in Sanskrit is called aks&#x301;i. The pronunciation of this word as per the Tantric and the [Yajurvedic] system would be akkhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The Lord&#146;s eyes are everywhere. His eyes are even in a closed room where one may consider himself or herself alone. The story goes that once Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa gave a pigeon to Swami Vivekananda asking him to kill the bird in a place where he was alone. At the end of the day Swami Vivekananda returned along with the living pigeon and reported to Sri Ramakrishna that he could not find himself alone anywhere because wherever he went he found a pair of eyes &ndash; the Lord&#146;s &ndash; watching him.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
