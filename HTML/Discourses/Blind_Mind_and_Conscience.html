<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Now I&#146;ll say something regarding Bhagava&#x301;n and His Giita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The name of the scripture is Shriimad Bhagavad Giita&#x301;, because it is the Giita&#x301; of Bhagava&#x301;n. Ya&#x301; Bhagavata&#x301; giita&#x301; sa&#x301; Giita&#x301; [&ldquo;That which has been sung by Bhagava&#x301;n is the Giita&#x301;&rdquo;] &ndash; that is, &ldquo;The Giita&#x301; is the expression of Bhagava&#x301;n.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is Bhagava&#x301;n? Bhagava&#x301;n means &ldquo;owner of bhaga&rdquo;. In the Vedic language the word bhaga has three meanings. One is &ldquo;divine effulgence&rdquo;. The other is &ldquo;primary cause&rdquo;. And the third meaning is &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Aeshvaryain&#x32D;ca samagrain&#x32D;ca viiryain&#x32D;ca yashasah shriyah;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[Bhaga is a collection of six attributes: aeshvarya, viirya, yasha, shrii, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and vaera&#x301;gya.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->That is, the word bhaga means a collection of six attributes. What are those attributes?<!-- /block --></p>

Aeshvarya means &ldquo;occult power&rdquo;. He who has aeshvarya, or occult power, is called Iishvara. So one of the attributes is occult power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Then the second one is viiryam, that is, stamina.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And the third is yasha &ndash; reputation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The fourth is shrii. Shrii means &ldquo;charm&rdquo;. You know, shrii means &ldquo;activating charm&rdquo;. Not only ordinary simple charm, but activating charm. Sha &ndash; the letter sha, ta&#x301;lavya [palatal] sha, is the acoustic root of the mutative principle. And the sound ra is the acoustic root of energy. Sha plus ra is equal to shra. In the feminine it becomes shrii. The sha represents the mutative principle, and ra represents energy; and shrii means &ldquo;activating charm&rdquo;, &ldquo;charm that activates&rdquo;. And that&#146;s why it is the Indian system to use the word Shrii before the name.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->So the first thing is occult power, the second thing is stamina, the third thing is reputation, the fourth is shrii, and the fifth is spiritual knowledge, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The sixth is vaera&#x301;gyam, renunciation. Not exactly renunciation: to remain unassailed by the attractive colours of this universe is vaera&#x301;gya. Ra&#x301;ga means &ldquo;colour&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The combination of all these six attributes is called bhaga, and he who is the owner of this bhaga, that is, he who is owner of these six attributes, is called bhagava&#x301;n. By sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; an ordinary man can become bhagava&#x301;n &ndash; after acquiring bhaga, these six attributes.<!-- /block --></p>

Ya&#x301; Bhagavata&#x301; giita&#x301; sa&#x301; Giita&#x301;. Now, it is the divine call. Now, let us see what is its spirit. The spirit of the Giita&#x301; is that one should march, one should move, towards one&#146;s spiritual goal, by making proper adjustment between inner urge and external physicalities. But you know, the external mundanity always tries to deprave a sa&#x301;dhaka, so he will have to fight a ceaseless battle against these depraving factors. In the Giita&#x301;, it is the order of Bhagava&#x301;n to fight against depraving factors, to fight against inner and outer enemies. This is the spirit of the Giita&#x301;, and the spirit of the Giita&#x301; has been represented, properly represented, in its first shloka. In that first shloka, what has been said?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra uva&#x301;ca:<br>Dharmaks&#x301;etre Kuruks&#x301;etre samaveta&#x301; yuyutsavah;<br>Ma&#x301;maka&#x301;h Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava&#x301;shcaeva kimakurvata Sain&#x32D;jaya?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->[Dhritarastra said: &ldquo;O Sanjaya, now that my children and the children of Pandu have gathered on the battlefield of Dharmaks&#x301;etra, of Kuruks&#x301;etra, eager to fight, what is taking place?&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->This shloka represents the entire import of the Giita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra uva&#x301;ca &ndash; &ldquo;Dhritarastra said.&rdquo; Who is Dhritarastra? Ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ram dhrtam yena sah Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rah &ndash; &ldquo;He who holds the structural solidarity&rdquo;. Ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra means &ldquo;structure&rdquo;, &ldquo;framework&rdquo; &ndash; in Hindustani, dha&#x301;nca&#x301;. So ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra means &ldquo;structure&rdquo;; and dhrta means &ldquo;holder&rdquo; &ndash; so he who holds, he who maintains, the structural solidarity, is &ldquo;Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra&rdquo; &ndash; Ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ram dhrtam yena sah Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rah. Now, who maintains the structural solidarity of the human structure? The mind. Because the mind is there, its structural solidarity is maintained. When the mind goes away, the different limbs will dissociate, it will start decomposing. So the mind, Dhritarastra, calls Sanjaya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Now you know, mind without conscience is a blind force. Dhritarastra was blind; Dhritarastra was janma&#x301;ndha [born blind], Dhritarastra could not see. Blind Dhritarastra said &ndash; the blind mind said (Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra uva&#x301;ca means, &ldquo;The blind mind, blind human mind, mind of a non-sa&#x301;dhaka, mind of a non-aspirant of spirituality, said&rdquo;) &ndash; Dharmaks&#x301;etre Kuruks&#x301;etre sama&#x301;veta&#x301; yuyutsavah<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ndash; Dharmaks&#x301;etre Kuruks&#x301;etre [&ldquo;On the field of dharma, on the field of this universe&rdquo;] yuddha&#x301;rtham [&ldquo;for war&rdquo;] samaveta&#x301;h [&ldquo;gathered&rdquo;] ma&#x301;maka&#x301;h [&ldquo;my people&rdquo;] (mamapaks&#x301;iiya&#x301;h [&ldquo;my party&rdquo;]) Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava&#x301;shcaeva (Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava&#x301; + ca [+ eva = &ldquo;and the Pandavas&rdquo;]) kimakurvata [&ldquo;what are they doing?&rdquo;].

Bho Sainyaya kathaya aham&#x301; shrnomi [&ldquo;O Sanjaya, tell me, let me hear&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Dharmaks&#x301;etre. What is dharmaks&#x301;etra? What is dharma? The root verb dhr plus the suffix man equals dharma. Dharma means &ldquo;characteristic&rdquo;; dharma means &ldquo;property&rdquo;; dharma means &ldquo;natural wont&rdquo;. And what is the characteristic, what is the natural wont, of a human being? To move towards the Supreme Self &ndash; to long for pleasure. To long for pleasure is the wont of each and every human being. And because He is the fountain, He is the home, He is the supreme abode of all pleasures, that&#146;s why to long for Him is proper dharma. And dharmaks&#x301;etra &ndash; one can practise dharma &ndash; where? Only when one is within this physical structure. After death one cannot practise dharma. So this human body is the dharmaks&#x301;etra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The blind mind said that within this dharmaks&#x301;etra of the human body, and this kuruks&#x301;etra &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit kuru means &ldquo;do&rdquo; &ndash; imperative mood, second person &ndash; &ldquo;do, kuru&rdquo;. Kuruks&#x301;etra means the field always saying Kuru, kuru, kuru, kuru &ndash; &ldquo;Oh, man, do something, do something, do something, do something.&rdquo; The ks&#x301;etra, the field, always saying, &ldquo;Do something, you must do something, you will have to do something,&rdquo; is kuruks&#x301;etra. That is, this world is kuruks&#x301;etra. Kuruks&#x301;etra is not a town near Delhi. The entire universe is kuruks&#x301;etra. Here everybody will have to do something, must do something. So it is kuruks&#x301;etra. And this universe is also doing something; it is always moving. One name of this universe is jagat: gam (root verb) + kvip (suffix) = jagat; jagat means &ldquo;characteristically moving&rdquo;. Another name is sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra: the root verb sr means &ldquo;to move&rdquo;, so sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra means &ldquo;moving on its own&rdquo;. Everything here is moving, so it is kuruks&#x301;etra &ndash; and this universe is always telling you to do something.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->So the blind mind asked the conscience, asked: &ldquo;In this sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra of kuruks&#x301;etra, and in this human body, dharmaks&#x301;etra, who did appear, who did assemble? My party and the party of Pandu. These were the two belligerent parties. What did these two belligerent parties do?&rdquo; This was the question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The blind mind asked whom? Asked Sanjaya. What is the sain&#x32D;jaya? Just now I said that the mind is a blind force, and cannot do anything without the help of the conscience. What is the conscience? The power of discrimination. Sain&#x32D;jaya: sam + ji (root verb) + al (suffix) = sain&#x32D;jaya. Sain&#x32D;jaya means &ldquo;conscience&rdquo;; sain&#x32D;jaya means &ldquo;power of discrimination&rdquo;. The mind is a blind force; that&#146;s why the mind asked the conscience: &ldquo;What did they do? What did these two parties do? &ndash; my party and the party of  Pandu.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Now, &ldquo;my party &ndash; ma&#x301;maka&#x301;h, mamapaks&#x301;iiya&#x301;h&rdquo; &ndash; said Dhritarastra, the blind mind. Now, who are the agents of the mind? The mind says &ldquo;my party&rdquo; &ndash; who are the soldiers, who are the agents of the mind? There are ten organs, and these ten organs are the agents of the mind; these ten organs are the agents of that blind mind. Five external organs and five internal organs: caks&#x301;uh, karn&#x301;a, na&#x301;sika&#x301;, jihva&#x301;, tvak, va&#x301;k, pa&#x301;n&#x301;i, pa&#x301;da, pa&#x301;yu, and upastha [eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin, vocal cord, hands/arms, feet/legs, anus, genitary organ]. These are the ten organs; they are agents of the blind mind. And each and every organ can function in ten directions. In Sanskrit there are ten dishas; six are called pradisha and four are called anudisha. Pu&#x301;rva, pashcima, uttara, daks&#x301;in&#x301;a, urdhva, and adhah &ndash; these six directions are called pradisha. And iisha&#x301;na, va&#x301;yu, agni, naerta &ndash; these four corners are called anudisha. So a total of ten dishas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->There are ten organs &ndash; ten agents of the blind mind &ndash; and each and every organ can function in ten directions. Ten times ten is equal to one hundred. The agents of the mind can function in one hundred directions. So the blind mind has one hundred agents. Dhritarastra had one hundred sons &ndash; Duryodhana, Dushasana &ndash; one hundred in number; one hundred agents of the depraved mind, the blind mind, the polluted mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->And the opposite parties are the fighting parties of the Pandavas &ndash; Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;upaks&#x301;iiya&#x301;h,  agents of Pandu. I think it is quite clear? &ndash; agents of Pandu. And who are the agents of Pandu? In Sanskrit pan&#x301;d&#x301; is a root verb; pan&#x301;d&#x301; means &ldquo;Self-realization&rdquo;. Yesterday I told you the meaning of pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita. He who has acquired realization is a pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita; pan&#x301;d&#x301; means Self-realization. Now this Self-realization is attained by whom? By the sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual aspirant]. And in the process of Self-realization one will have to exalt one&#146;s divinity in crude form. That is, the dormant divinity is to be exalted and brought to the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> for that Self-realization. And in this process, in this march towards the supreme goal of spirituality, it will have to pass through five stages. Just to acquire [pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, absolute knowledge] one will have to pass through five stages &ndash; mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na, man&#x301;ipura, ana&#x301;hata and vishuddha. These are the five stages, five controlling points of the five factors of this quinquelemental world. These five stages are the helpers of pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;u;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  they help in realizing the Supreme Self. So they are pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avas. The Pandavas are five in number.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->So it is an internal fight &ndash; the fight between the introversial tendency and the extroversial tendency. In the extroversial tendency there are one hundred agents, and in the introversial tendency there are five friends. The fight within yourself is a fight amongst, on the one side, those five introversial friends, and on the other side, one hundred depraving elements. This fight is the fight of kuruks&#x301;etra. The blind mind asks the conscience: &ldquo;What was the result of that fight? O Sanjaya, O conscience, I want to know.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->So in this particular shloka the spirit of the Giita&#x301; has been properly represented. And it is the order of Bhagava&#x301;n [here, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a] that one will have to fight this fight with proper courage and prowess. And this prowess will make one victorious, and those depraving elements will be vanquished.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->So you are all sa&#x301;dhakas, you are all spiritual aspirants; I will ask you to follow, to adhere to, this principle properly. Be courageous and fight properly against those depraving elements; certainly you will be victorious.<!-- /block --></p>
