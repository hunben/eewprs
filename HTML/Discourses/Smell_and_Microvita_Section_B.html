<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhaghra&#x301;n&#x301;a</b>. Gandha + ghra&#x301; + lyut&#x301; = gandhaghra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;. Etymologically, gandhaghra&#x301;n&#x301;a means sensing any smell. The smell inferences vary from object to object.  They vary more according to intensity and lightness, but they also vary according to extent or limit. After a living entity has died, the parts of its body separate from the main structure because of a lack of centralized control. The various parts become disconnected from one another. The different stages and sub-stages of separation continue till the fragments finally merge into their respective original sources (that is, pain&#x32D;ca ma&#x301;ha&#x301;bhuta &ndash; the solid, liquid, luminous, aerial and ethereal factors). Through this process a corpse or carcass decomposes, and at each succeeding stage of decomposition, a kind of foul smell starts being emitted. The emission of stinking smells continues till the various parts of the corpse merge in the different quinquelemental factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Whatever be the nature of the smell inferences &ndash; whether pleasant or unpleasant &ndash; human beings receive them according to their intensity or lightness and depending upon the capacity of the nostrils to sense smell.  Whether the smell inferences are of a pleasing or offensive nature depends on one&#146;s inherent reactive momenta. According to some of those who like fish, uncooked fish smells offensive, but after the fish have been cooked, the offensive smell disappears and the cooked fish taste delicious. But those who do not like rotten or decomposed food say that when food smells repulsive, how can one even think of eating it! It is a question of reactive momenta. The vulture has no objection to eating rotten flesh, but the mynah bird has much objection, and so does the dove.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The act of assimilating or receiving the smell of an object according to the capacity of one&#146;s smell na&#x301;diis (psychic energy channels) as well as one&#146;s nostrils, is called &ldquo;gandhaghra&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Another meaning of gandhaghra&#x301;n&#x301;a is &ldquo;that which helps one to receive smells&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the nostrils or the nose.  The Latin words &ldquo;nose&rdquo;, &ldquo;nasal&rdquo; and &ldquo;nostril&rdquo; came from the Vedic words &ldquo;na&#x301;sa&#x301;&rdquo; and &ldquo;nastril&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhacelika&#x301;</b>. Gandha + cel + kan + ta&#x301; = gandhacelika&#x301;. Literally, the words &ldquo;cela&rdquo;, &ldquo;celi&rdquo;, &ldquo;celii&rdquo; and &ldquo;celika&#x301;&rdquo; mean &ldquo;attractive objects which draw people by dint of their attractive colour or smell or both.&rdquo; At weddings in ancient Bengal, young brides used to wear dazzling red saris made of simul cotton. These saris were not very durable, but for weddings the red celi made the small bride look quite attractive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The other meaning of gandhacelika&#x301; is &ldquo;sweet scented musk accumulated in and around the navel portion of the musk deer.&rdquo; The musk deer lives in cold countries and looks ugly, but the hormone secreted from its glands gradually accumulates in the navel. Eventually the liquid portion evaporates and the remainder becomes hard, and the harder it gets, the stronger its fragrance becomes. The female deer does not have this musk scent. The male deer becomes so intoxicated with its own fragrance that it goes berserk searching for the source of the smell. It fails to realize that the source of the smell is its own navel. Ultimately, after much running, the exhausted musk deer falls down dead. Sometimes businessmen collect the dead bodies, cut out the navels and grind them into powder. Various medicines and cosmetics are prepared from the musk. These medicines preserve the heat in the bodies of dying people for a little while and help to keep them alive for a short time.<!-- /block --></p>
