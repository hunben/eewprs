<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In this universe, both mundane and supra-mundane, or say, physical and metaphysical, we find entities of two kinds: Ks&#x301;ara and Aks&#x301;ara. Ks&#x301;ara is a metamorphosed form of the cognitive faculty created under the tethering influence of Prakrti, the Operative Principle. Hence in philosophical Sam&#x301;skrta, the Operative Principle is also known as Pradha&#x301;na because in the phase of creation it has got the primordial role. Pradha&#x301;na means &ldquo;main&rdquo;. Whatever we see in the universe, or whatever cometh within the arena of our influence is Ks&#x301;ara, that is, creation of the Operative Principle. The portion of the Cognitive Faculty which does not come within the tethering periphery of the binding faculties remains aks&#x301;ara. That is, it undergoes no change, no metamorphosis, is non-decaying, non-waning. &ldquo;Ks&#x301;aram&#x301; pradha&#x301;namamrta&#x301;ks&#x301;aram&#x301; harah&rdquo;. And that Aks&#x301;ara portion, that is, non-decaying, non-transforming, non-metamorphosing portion, is amrta or immortal. Ks&#x301;ara is mortal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is death? Death means a process of metamorphosis. Aks&#x301;ara means not undergoing the process of metamorphosis; hence it is immortal. &ldquo;Amrtaks&#x301;aram&#x301; harah&rdquo;. That is why that Aks&#x301;ara is also known as Para. Para means beyond the scope of all changes, beyond the scope of all transformations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ks&#x301;ara&#x301;tma&#x301;na&#x301; viishate deva ekah&rdquo;. But there is a third entity. One is Ks&#x301;ara Brahma, that is, the transformed Brahma, objectivated Brahma &ndash; this external universe created by the tethering influence of the Operative Principle. The second one is Aks&#x301;ara Brahma whose other name is Hara. Hara means one who undergoes no change under the influence of others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->This world is a divine play of Hari and Hara. It is Hari-Hara&#x301;tmaka. Hara is one who is undergoing no metamorphosis and Hari means &ldquo;Harati pa&#x301;pa&#x301;nityarthe harih&rdquo;. That is, one who steals away sins of others. People may say, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is great and He steals! What is the matter?&rdquo; As per necessity, He does engage in stealing but one without calumny or fault. He expects bhaktas to give away their sins to Him and be liberated. But when He asks bhaktas to do so, they say, &ldquo;O Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a! we can give You our minds, our bodies, our souls, our everything; but how can we give You our sins? That we can&#146;t do.&rdquo; Bhaktas love Him deeply and He loves them too. As Bhaktas won&#146;t part with their sins on request, He steals them away and that is why He is known as Hari. But in this Shloka we are concerned with the word Hara. &ldquo;Amrta&#x301;ks&#x301;arah Harah&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, one is Ks&#x301;ara Brahma. The second one is Aks&#x301;ara Brahma and there is the third entity, Niraks&#x301;ara Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->You know, the acoustic root of creation is &ldquo;A&rdquo; &ldquo;U&rdquo; and &ldquo;ma&rdquo; = &ldquo;Aum&rdquo;. And the acoustic root of objectivated Brahma, causal Brahma creating &ldquo;a&rdquo; &ldquo;u&rdquo; and &ldquo;ma&rdquo; and effect Brahma created by &ldquo;a&rdquo; &ldquo;u&rdquo; and &ldquo;m&rdquo; &ndash; its acoustic root is &ldquo;ka&rdquo;. Hence &ldquo;Ka&rdquo; is our first consonant and &ldquo;A&rdquo; is our first vowel because &ldquo;a&rdquo; is the root of creation. &ldquo;Ka&rdquo; is our first consonant because it is the acoustic root of this objectivated universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So one meaning of ka is that it is the acoustic root of objectivated Brahma; the second meaning of ka is that it is our first consonant and the third meaning of ka is jalam, that is, water. In Sam&#x301;skrta jala is also called ka. Along with niiram, toyam, udakam, kambalam, and pa&#x301;niiyam, ka is a synonym for jalam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Once I said that the land surrounded by ka, that is, covered by ka, is kaccha. Cha means &ldquo;surrounded by&rdquo;. Root cha&#x301;d + da suffix is cha and root verb cha&#x301;d + ghain&#x32D; suffix make chat. Cha&#x301;t means &ldquo;covering entity&rdquo;. Land covered by water is kaccha. Kaccha is an area on the western coast of India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The third one is Niraks&#x301;ara Brahma. &ldquo;Ks&#x301;ara&#x301;tmana&#x301;viishate deva ekah&rdquo;. There is another Deva who establishes His control both over Ks&#x301;ara and Aks&#x301;ara. He is Niraks&#x301;ara. The common meaning of niraks&#x301;ara is illiterate but here niraks&#x301;ara means &ldquo;Ta&#x301;raka Brahma&rdquo; &ndash; the tangential point who has got control over both Ks&#x301;ara and Aks&#x301;ara, but not Nirgun&#x301;a because Nirgun&#x301;a has got no control over anything. He does not accept anything as His object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now you are to worship, you are to do your auto-suggestions or outer-suggestions or meditation or any other spiritual observances for whom? Neither for Ks&#x301;ara, nor for Aks&#x301;ara but for Niraks&#x301;ara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->If Ks&#x301;ara is accepted as your object of ideation or adoration, then finally you will converted into Ks&#x301;ara, you will be converted into crude matter. So Ks&#x301;ara can not be your object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Aks&#x301;ara cannot be accepted either because Aks&#x301;ara is always associated with some Ks&#x301;ara and always engaged in so many duties concerning Ks&#x301;ara. That Aks&#x301;ara can not be Mukta Purus&#x301;a. So your only object of ideation or meditation or adoration, the only subjective pabulum, should be that Niraks&#x301;ara. So here it has been said &ldquo;Tasya&#x301;bhidhya&#x301;na&#x301;t&rdquo;. You will have to do His abhidhya&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Abhi &ndash; dhya&#x301; + anat&#x301; = abhidhya&#x301;na. Abhidhya&#x301;na means withdrawing yourself from all transitoriness of this world and goading that withdrawn propensity or those withdrawn propensities into the Niraks&#x301;ara. This is the abhidhya&#x301;na of the Niraks&#x301;ara. So many propensities are brought to a single point, and that combined propensity, the combined force of all propensities is goaded unto Him. That is called abhidha&#x301;nam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tasya&#x301;bhidhya&#x301;hat yojana&#x301;t tattvabha&#x301;va&#x301;t.&rdquo; By dint of a never-ending process or practice you come in closest contact with Him. Yojana&#x301;t and tattvabha&#x301;va&#x301;t: tat + tva. Tat means That; that is, Niraks&#x301;ara Brahma. Ideating on that only, that item only, that entity only, is tattvabha&#x301;va&#x301;t. &ldquo;Bhu&#x301;yashca&#x301;nte Vishvama&#x301;ya&#x301;nivrttih.&rdquo; And the final goal of yours, final result of yours, the resultant of so many practices should be liberation from Vishvama&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->There are different varieties of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;: Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, Yogama&#x301;ya&#x301;, An&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Vishvama&#x301;ya&#x301;. Vishvama&#x301;ya&#x301; means the influences of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; that function both within and without the created world and that portion of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; working within it as an all-pervading faculty is known as Vis&#x301;n&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Here the bondage is from that universal Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or Vishvama&#x301;ya&#x301;. It is she who with her dexterous hands creates this universe of so many colors and sounds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->So by dint of never-ending ideation of Niraks&#x301;ara, one has to merge in Him and attain liberation from Vishvama&#x301;ya&#x301;. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
