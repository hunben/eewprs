<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The word viru&#x301;pa&#x301;ks&#x301;a has two meanings. One of the meanings is, &ldquo;one whose eyes are viru&#x301;pa &ndash; displeased or angry&rdquo;. The second meaning is &ldquo;a person who looks upon everything with His special expression of sweet benevolence, who views everything with compassion&rdquo;. To the sinful, Shiva is viru&#x301;pa&#x301;ks&#x301;a in the first sense, and to the virtuous He is viru&#x301;pa&#x301;ks&#x301;a in the second sense.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->One who possesses divine vision is called divyacaks&#x301;u &ndash; that is, &ldquo;one who can see the original hidden cause of everything &ndash; the omniscient knower of past, present and future&rdquo;. The one who, by playing His pina&#x301;ka drum, is creating a stir in the bodies, a vibration in the minds, and a thrill in the souls of all creatures is Sada&#x301;shiva. For the punishment of the wicked and the protection of the good, weapons have been used in all ages, and will be used in future. Shiva has been wielding His terrible weapon vajra, the thunderbolt, for the welfare of all. Thus He is not only vajradhara [&ldquo;the wielder of the thunderbolt&rdquo;], but shubhavajradhara [&ldquo;the wielder of the thunderbolt of welfare&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The weapon which pierces sinners from three sides is called trishu&#x301;la. In Shiva&#146;s hand there was a trishu&#x301;la (so He is called shu&#x301;lapa&#x301;n&#x301;i) to strike terror in the hearts of the sinners so that they might desist from their sins and be forced to let honest people live in peace. And to control the sinners and bind them in tight bondages, Shiva held in His hand a lathi [staff] and a rope.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->He is controlling the psychic realm which sustains and nourishes the entire life-flow of heaven, earth and underworld &ndash; so He is called Trilokana&#x301;tha [the Lord of the Three Worlds]. And in this quinquelemental world, He clearly understands the nature and behaviour of each and every entity, so He is called Bhu&#x301;tana&#x301;tha [the Lord of All Created Beings]. He is also Pramathana&#x301;tha [the Lord of Music Students]. As Shiva has consummate control over Himself, both internally and externally, He is called sha&#x301;nta [tranquil]. This tranquil purus&#x301;a has the authority to control everything, and that is why regarding Him it has been said, Namah Shiva&#x301;ya sha&#x301;nta&#x301;ya [&ldquo;Salutations to Shiva the tranquil one&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the crude, subtle and causal worlds, the noumenal factor is Citishakti [Consciousness]. Shiva and Citishakti are identical. Thus regarding Him it has been said, ka&#x301;ran&#x301;atrayahetave [&ldquo;the causal factor of the three worlds&rdquo;]. All entities prostrate before that Supreme Entity which has illuminated the inside and outside of all manifested and unmanifested entities with His own sweet, glorious effulgence; they all totally surrender to Him. He is the culminating point of all the entities, so about Him it has been said, nivedaya&#x301;mi ca&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; tvam&#x301; gatih Parameshvara [&ldquo;O Supreme Lord, I surrender myself unto You; You are my supreme shelter&rdquo;]. &ldquo;O Shiva, O Parama Purus&#x301;a, the last shelter of the shelterless, the final rest of the weary &ndash; I surrender all my existential feeling unto Your feet. Besides You I have nothing &ndash; without You, I have no existence.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
