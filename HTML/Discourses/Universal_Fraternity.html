<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The eternal question is: Wherefrom do you come? When you have come, certainly you have come from a certain place. Wherefrom have you come, where will you go and what to do? Wherefrom do the collective and individual worlds come? You know, nothing is destructible. Everything in this world is indestructible. Nothing is finally destroyed. What is known as destruction is nothing but metamorphosis, a change of form. When a small boy of five years becomes a young man of 25 years, you won&#146;t find that little boy of five years. But, is that boy dead and gone? No, he lives in that young man of 25 years in a changed form, in a metamorphosed form. So, nothing is destroyed. And nothing comes from nothing, everything comes from something,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This human society, this animal world, this plant world &ndash; all of them come from a particular source, and that source is Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Entity, the Supreme Father, whose progeny are all. He is the Supreme Progenitor, the great Father, who creates everything Human beings, both in individual and collective life have got the same source, the same progenitor. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Supreme Creator.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now, the second portion, the second phase of the question is &ndash; Where do the people stay? To contain something you need a container. Here you are standing in the city of Athens. It is the container. This city of Athens is contained by the country of Greece. It is the shelter of the city. This country of Greece is sheltered by this earth, this planet earth. And this planet is sheltered by the entire solar system &ndash; sun and moon and planets. And this solar system is contained by, is sheltered by, Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Entity. So, human beings and all other beings come from Parama Purus&#x301;a, stay in Parama Purus&#x301;a, and then finally leave this world. This applies to everybody &ndash; man or animal or plant. Whoever comes goes. &ldquo;Ya a&#x301;gacchati sah gacchati&rdquo;. Who has come will go. Nobody will be in this world forever, because movement is the very order of this universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Everything moves. This earth moves, the sun also moves, and along with this, the entire world. Nothing is stationary. Everything will have to move. So, those who are staying in this world, will also move with this moving world. And, where will they go? What is their goal? They have to go back to Parama Purus&#x301;a, from where they came. So, He is the starting point, He is the originating point, and He is the culminating point of all creatures. Thus there lies an inherent tie of fraternity among human beings, among the living creatures. You are all spiritual aspirants. You are all devotees. You are all going to be one with the Creator. You should remember this inherent tie of humanity. Try to help others as much as you can, because it is the desire of Providence that all will march onward with maximum cooperation. And, if you move along the path of righteousness with the spirit of Universal Fraternity, victory is yours. The blessing of Parama Purus&#x301;a is always with you.<!-- /block --></p>
