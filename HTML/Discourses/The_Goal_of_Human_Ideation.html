<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->[B:] And if they are accepted as the object of ideation, ascribing <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>-hood to them, then what will be the result?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;In that case, they cannot be accepted as the goal. We will have to work within the scope of these things, but they cannot be accepted as the goal.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->[B:] But if <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>-hood is ascribed to them, ascribed to that cooperative body of tempus eternal and accident? A knotty philosophical question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;According to our philosophy, if we work, we have to work within the scope of this manifest universe. But while dealing with each object of this manifest universe, or working within the scope of time, place and person, we ascribe <i>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i>-hood, or <i>Brahma</i>-hood, to the form or to the idea of an object.

<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;So the ascription is the only process. We have to remain within the realm of relativity, and from our stance within relativity, we have to [[aspire]] to the Supreme stance of salvation.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->[B:] Tempus eternal and accident, a happy cooperation, a happy cooperative blending, then, can it be accepted as the goal? No.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;If it is done from the spirit of ascription &ndash;&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->[B:] No, no, I said &ndash; there is no question of ascription.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;Then in that case, if there is no ascription of <i>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i>-hood to those factors &ndash; then naturally, they themselves cannot be accepted as the goal of human beings.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->[B:] If there is a happy cooperation between nature and accident &ndash; Accident means accidental happening. &ldquo;This universe is an accidental happening.&rdquo; [[There are people who]] say like this.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;Actually, there are some people who illogically put forth the view that this universe came into being out of an accident. But we know fully well that there is nothing like an accident in this universe. Everything is incidental, because we always require two factors: first of all, there must be a cause leading to a particular effect. Sometimes out of our ignorance we overlook the cause and simply come to the conclusion that the effect is there. But it is the wrong conclusion. It is simply due to ignorance that we are misled that way. So that this universe came into being was definitely the effect of some cause. And this cause was the Supreme Entity, or I should say the Macropsychic conation. It must have been there at the beginning of the manifestation of this universe.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->[B:] You know there is a fine line of demarcation between transcendental entities and non-transcendental entities. Now the causal factor lies beyond that line, beyond that fine line of demarcation. And the effect factor below that line. So when we move forward, towards the Causal Entity, I say the Causal Matrix, what happens when we cross that line? There remains no microcosm, no Macrocosm even. So human beings fail to find the link between transcendental and non-transcendental. And when a person becomes one with the Transcendental, he maintains no link with the non-transcendental entity at that time. After that, he says, &ldquo;Oh, I am lost in the kingdom of bliss.&rdquo; Always only that Transcendental Entity can be accepted as the object of adoration, and nobody else, and nothing else. So if there be a combination of nature and accident, the combination cannot be the object of adoration either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Now, the quinquelemental factors. If there is a cooperative structure of nature and the quinquelemental factors, can it be the object of ideation, can it be the goal, can it be the Desideratum?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;The cooperative structure of nature and quinquelemental factors, similarly, cannot be accepted as the goal of ideation. Because the quinquelemental factors, combined together, constitute the material universe, the expressed universe. This universe you see, which comes within the scope of our senses &ndash;&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->[B:] What is matter?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;Matter is nothing but the combination of all five fundamental factors.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->[B:] How are those fundamental factors created &ndash; the rudimental factors?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;These five rudimental factors, first of all &ndash;&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->[B:] It is better to use the word &ldquo;rudimental.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo;. &ldquo;Fundamental&rdquo; means &ldquo;based on fundament&rdquo;, &ldquo;rudimental&rdquo; means &ldquo;based on the root&rdquo;. From &ldquo;root&rdquo; the word &ldquo;rudimental&rdquo; comes, and from &ldquo;fundament&rdquo; the word &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; comes. So in our philosophical expressions here regarding the quinquelemental factors, we should use the word &ldquo;rudimental&rdquo; and not the word &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;The five rudimental factors, that is, ether, air, gas, liquid and solid &ndash; these five rudimental factors, when combined together &ndash;&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->[A: &ldquo;Then in the second phase, after the emergence of Cosmic Mind, there is a completely inanimate state. Or not actually inanimate state, but, you can say, purely mental state.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->[B:] Now in the process, five quinquelemental factors were created.<!-- /block --></p>

Because the microcosm will have to go beyond the scope of relativity; it will have to become one with the supreme state of transcendentality.
