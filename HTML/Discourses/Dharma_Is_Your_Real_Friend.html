<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In an ideal society, every soul ought to get complete scope for development without any impediment. But in a transitional period, when one era is about to end and the next one is yet to dawn, a critical situation arises in social life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->How the Giita&#x301; Addresses a Critical Situation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Ya&#x301; Bhagavata&#x301; giita&#x301; sa&#x301; Giita&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;The Giita&#x301; is that which is sung by the Lord Himself.&rdquo; Bhagava&#x301;n is another name for the Lord. What is Bhagava&#x301;n? Bhagava&#x301;n is [He who possesses] the totality of aeshvarya; and in addition yasha, shrii, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Aeshvarya is the sum total of all [occult] powers &ndash; an&#x301;ima&#x301;, mahima&#x301;, [laghima&#x301;], etc. The Lord ought to have powers. His mission is going to be accomplished [by] the use of His powers. Clumsiness is not going to help.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Another attribute of the Lord is yasha. His greatness is recognized and sung[, but] not by all people. Particularly in a transitional period, there is a sharp polarization. People get divided into two blocs. Some pray to the Lord, and some discredit Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The Lord has yet another characteristic, that is, shrii. Shrii denotes &ldquo;attraction&rdquo;. Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is one who attracts. Within the word shrii, sha denotes the mutative principle and ra is [the] acoustic root of energy. &ldquo;Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;, with this shrii, is &ldquo;the Lord who attracts everybody&rdquo;. ([Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a] has another meaning, [krs&#x301;ibhu&#x301;h] &ndash; that is, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is &ldquo;He because of whom we all are&rdquo;, that is, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is Parama Purus&#x301;a. We all owe our existence to Parama Purus&#x301;a, just as a fish owes its existence to water.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Two more attributes of the Lord are jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and vaera&#x301;gya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, or knowledge, is the subjectivization of an objectivity. And regarding vaera&#x301;gya, vaera&#x301;gya is not renouncing the world and going to the Himalayas. Vaera&#x301;gya is derived vi &ndash; ran&#x301;j [+ ghain&#x32D; + vyain]. If in spite of remaining amidst objectivities, a person does not get attached to them, then it is called vaera&#x301;gya. Lead life fully, but keep the mind unaffected by it. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is for the living, not for the dead.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The [propensities] are to be controlled by the mind, and not the mind by base propensities. The Lord said in the Giita&#x301;:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->[At a time when dharma is distorted and adharma is ascendant, I create myself out of my own fundamental factors. I incarnate Myself in this world from age to age for the protection of the virtuous, the destruction of the wicked, and the restoration of dharma.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->That is, whenever there is gla&#x301;ni, or downfall, of dharma, God appears on the scene.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Dhr means &ldquo;to [uphold]&rdquo; or &ldquo;to support&rdquo;. Dharma is that which supports life and its properties. Dharma alone stands forward, come what may. The dictates of dharma ought to be heeded. Everything else &ndash; wealth, logic, intellect &ndash; is secondary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Those who abide by the dictates of dharma are called sa&#x301;dhus. In the traditional sense, a sa&#x301;dhu means a devotee wearing white clothes, with the word da&#x301;sa suffixed to his name, and after whose death the ceremony of shra&#x301;ddha and bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;ra&#x301; is performed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->(A sannya&#x301;sii, on the other hand, uses saffron clothes. Sannya&#x301;siis have the word a&#x301;nanda appended to their names. No shra&#x301;ddha ceremony is performed after their deaths.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->But this is only a traditional meaning of sa&#x301;dhu. Sa&#x301;dhu really means &ldquo;one who abides by dharma&rdquo;. Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a says [in effect]: &ldquo;Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.&rdquo; That is, whatever is required by me may also be required by others. This consideration for others is dharma, and one who acts like this is a sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Dharma is your real friend. So, strengthen dharma when dharma itself starts deteriorating, when life becomes unnatural and [threatens] our destruction; because everything in life has to have its proper place. [When] dharma [is moved from] its place, that is called the gla&#x301;ni of dharma; when dharma gets displaced from its proper position in life, then there is dharma[sya] gla&#x301;nih.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In our shloka [couplet], bha&#x301;rata means &ldquo;king&rdquo;. That is, one who does bharan&#x301;a. Bhr means &ldquo;to feed&rdquo;. One who feeds life, in the physical, mental and spiritual strata, is a bha&#x301;rata, a king.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Abhyuttha&#x301;na means abhi &ndash; uttha&#x301;na, that is, the &ldquo;ascendancy&rdquo; of adharma. In such a situation the Lord says, tada&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; srja&#x301;myaham &ndash; that is, &ldquo;I create myself.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Tra&#x301;n&#x301;a is just &ldquo;relief&rdquo;, as one is to give in floods, cyclones, earthquakes, etc., where the tragedy will recur. But paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;permanent protection or relief&rdquo;. The Lord appears in order to give permanent protection to sa&#x301;dhus. [To build a perennial and just social order is the job of the sadvipras, spiritual revolutionaries.] But when the sadvipras are not able to do their job by their own power, the Lord [creates Himself] and applies His power to that job.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Vina&#x301;sha is to be differentiated from prana&#x301;sha and na&#x301;sha. Na&#x301;sha means &ldquo;destruction&rdquo;; prana&#x301;sha means &ldquo;transformation of an entity [back to its] original [source]&rdquo;; but vina&#x301;sha means &ldquo;special destruction&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The word sam&#x301;stha&#x301;pana is important. Stha&#x301;pana means &ldquo;placement&rdquo;. Sam&#x301;stha&#x301;pana means &ldquo;replacement to the proper position from which a thing has been displaced&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->[Sambhava&#x301;mi means] samyak rupen&#x301;a bhava&#x301;mi [&ldquo;I incarnate Myself in a proper way&rdquo;]. Bhava&#x301;mi means &ldquo;to come into existence [by employing all the material factors] which He Himself has created&rdquo; in order to protect the sa&#x301;dhus and to cause the [special or] total destruction of the wicked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The Lord says, &ldquo;I create myself in a special way;&rdquo; that is, Parama Purus&#x301;a promises that in a period of transition, He will incarnate Himself with His special powers to destroy the wicked and to give dharma a proper place in society.<!-- /block --></p>
