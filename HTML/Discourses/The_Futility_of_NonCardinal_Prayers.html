<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Now in a short discourse I want to say something regarding the futility of non-cardinal prayer and attributional worship. The Supreme Entity is beyond the scope of any mundane measurement and hence no attributional expression can bind Him. He is the Lord of all attributions and is above the periphery of attributional bindings. Worship may be adorative or may be ideative but it can never be attributional. The microcosm has got its own limitations. Within its restricted source how much can it think and how much can it explain, express or manifest? If you try to say anything about Him you will be vainly trying to bring Him within the scope of so many limitations and bindings. That is why the poet Padmadanta says:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If we use the Himalayas as an ink-tablet, the largest ocean as the ink-pot, the branch of the biggest forest tree of heaven as a pen and the entire lithosphere as paper, and with this paper, ink and pen if the goddess of learning writes for an indefinite period even then it would not be possible to write all the attributes that He possesses. So attributional worship is meaningless; and because it is meaningless it is impractical, not feasible and nothing but a waste of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->But worship may be adorative because He is the object of adoration of all. Even within the limitations of the microcosm one can do it, or rather, one can try to do it. Similarly, in the realm of ideation as one touches Him, when one&#146;s microcosmic structure gets pinnacled, it is possible in that realm and so ideative worship, can be supported. It is the only way of worship, the only form of acceptable worship.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Similarly it is futile to engage in non-cardinal prayers. The cardinal human principles are acceptable to all. They touch the Infinite with the finite or rather they have a close relationship or a close link with mysticism; which is the never-ending endeavour to find a link between the finite and the Infinite. So in the case of cardinal prayer to some extent it is acceptable, but non-cardinal prayer is a mere waste of time. To say, &ldquo;Oh God, give me this or that&rdquo; is meaningless because your actual requirements are better known to Him. A child does not know what it requires but the mother of the child knows and the mother provides accordingly. You do not know what your actual requirements are, but the Supreme Father knows and He provides accordingly, and he will continue doing so for ever. So your burden is His burden. You need not say, &ldquo;Oh God, give me this or give me that&rdquo;. That is why I say, prayers of non-cardinal nature are meaningless. They have no significance in the universal march of the microcosm towards its cherished goal. If you are to ask for anything, you should only say, &ldquo;Oh God, guide my brain, guide my mind, onto the path of bliss. Give me shubha-buddhi. I want only this much from You and nothing else.&rdquo; There must not be any other prayer. If the buddhi becomes shubha one gets everything. What else do you want? So your only prayer should be, &ldquo;Oh God, guide my intellect or rather guide our intellect onto the path of bliss. We want nothing more from you. Regarding my physical and psychic needs please do whatever you think fit. I am at your disposal.&rdquo; That is why I said in A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram in unambiguous language, &ldquo;Pra&#x301;rthana&#x301;rcana&#x301; ma&#x301;traeva Bhramamu&#x301;lam.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Depend on Him, rely on Him, have Him as your only object of ideation. Nothing else is required for your spiritual salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
