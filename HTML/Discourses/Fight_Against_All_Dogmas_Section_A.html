<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Notions of vice and virtue, codes of justice and scriptural texts &ndash; which are claimed to be the word of God &ndash; have been formulated by different religions to further vested interests. Those who oppose the scriptures or the system they propound are subject to severe punishment. To socialize with a person of a different caste is a great sin and those who commit such sacrilegious acts will be excommunicated. They will have to make atonement according to scriptural decree, and sometimes the magnitude of their penance maybe the cause of their death. If they plead for a milder dose of punishment, the priests express their helplessness: one cannot defy the scriptures!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Those who are ensnared by the scriptures cannot be expected to know the value of human life. It takes millions of years, lives and stages to get a human body. But nobody knows how many invaluable lives have been nipped in the bud, how many innocent lives have been slaughtered at the altar of the scriptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Vice and virtue are the outcome of mental perversion under the influence of time, space and person. The mental perversion which is vice in one country or in one age passes for virtue in another country or another age. Thus it is unwise to attach absolute importance to the notion of vice and virtue nurtured by some individuals at a given time. Vice and virtue have their origins either in religious faith or social prejudices, as a result of natural or other causes, and they undergo changes in time, space and person. In ancient India grief-stricken wives mourning the death of their husbands were dragged pitilessly onto the funeral pyre and burnt to death. Those who did this remained unaffected because according to the their scriptures it was a virtuous act. Today, however it is treated as a vice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->These fabricated religious injunctions have been a repeated cause of exploitation. Placing blind faith in the scriptures people used to derive pleasure from cruel human sacrifice. The scriptures also proclaimed that to live the life of a virgin was a vice. Hence, it was not uncommon for a nine year old girl to be forced to marry an old man waiting at the jaws of death. After the death of her old spouse, hymns were chanted to make the young bride believe that she was destined to return to her husband after her own death and had no right to turn a new leaf in this life by marrying again. What a tragic existence for a sentimental woman to have to live a life of austerity to ensure unison with a husband in the life hereafter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Polygamy, on the other hand, was not forbidden for men. A woman who was married to a man having a number of wives suffered a life of misery due to her co-wives. The folklores or doggerels bear an excellent testimony to this: &ldquo;Peace will come with my co-wife&#146;s death. Oh what joy! I shall kill my co-wife and adorn my arm with bangles.&rdquo; Even today within the same social group the cutting remarks of the mother-in-law and the husband&#146;s sisters rob the wife of her zest for life. The story goes that a wife had her rice rationed to one earthen cup full by her mother-in-law. One day, as luck would have it, that measuring cup broke into countless pieces. Oh, what joy the wife felt. But the mother-in-law cruelly remarked, &ldquo;The small earthen cup has broken, but the big one is left for us. Your joy is in vain, Daughter-in-law, for my hand will now be your measure.&rdquo; Can there be any greater cruelty than this? Even when supplying the minimum requirements meaness was perpetrated with such cruelty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The inhuman rules and regulations and tortures inside the house filled a woman&#146;s life with bitterness. Nobody knows how many have wept away sleepless nights having suffered tortures for which no redress is possible. The dogma of the scriptures crushed their emotional feelings, their hopes and aspirations like a steamroller flattening soft clay. Nobody has paid any heed to their sobs and tearful outbursts. The irrational social dictates based on vice and virtue have been a perennial source of injustice for human beings. Humanity has always been hated and trampled.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->I repeat that no scripture should gain supremacy by slighting or neglecting humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
