<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Recently my topic of discussion has been &ldquo;micropsychic longings&rdquo;. Let me explain how this topic relates to the science of bio-psychology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As you know, micropsychic longings may be brought within four broad categories: psycho-physical longing concerning inborn instinct; psycho-physical longing concerning non-inborn instinct; psychic longing for psychic pabulum; and longings concerned with apexed psychology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of longing? Longing means &ldquo;the urge that pulls forward&rdquo; &ndash; it does not push. If you hear someone say, &ldquo;You little boy, you are a naughty child but I like you very much,&rdquo; a psychic idea is created, and the urge is pulling it, not pushing it. The enjoying portion of the mind is pulled by the urge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Inborn Instincts<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->First, take the case of inborn instincts. Suppose a person enjoys eating food in the form of sweets or rice. The psycho-physical longings for these two types of food operate in the same direction &ndash; they have the same lateral movement &ndash; but different waves. How many such waves are there? There are innumerable waves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When a newborn babe hears the sound of its mother, it thinks, &ldquo;Oh, my mother is coming. I will get breast milk.&rdquo; It smells fragrances, feels the sensation of touch and reacts to the environment: &ldquo;Ooooh, it&#146;s extremely cold.&rdquo; It kicks and urinates. These are all inborn instincts in the case of animate creatures, but not in the case of inanimate objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Inborn instincts develop in human beings a few minutes after birth. In reptiles and birds they develop when these creatures come in contact with the physical world, and in dogs and cats they develop after a few days.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the case of non-living entities, their inborn instincts are to contract and inflate. As they cannot express themselves through nerves, we say that they are inanimate. They express themselves by increasing or decreasing their inter-atomic or inter-molecular spaces. Iron, sand, earth, water, etc., are all inanimate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In living entities, longings such as the longings for carbonic pabulum and mother&#146;s milk are longings for physical and not psychic pabulum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Suppose a man is drinking and drinking &ndash; he knows when to stop because he has a self-controlling faculty. He knows when he should not drink any more, and he knows when his thirst has been quenched. On the other hand, suppose he tries to check his thirst. He may try to control his thirst up to a certain degree, but beyond that point his vital force will not cooperate with his self-controlling faculty. After two or three days he will not be able to check his thirst any longer, and if he continues to control it he will damage his health. The glands and plexi and the protoplasmic cells will disintegrate because he went against the characteristics of the vital force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Take another example. Suppose your collective body does not want perspiration to come out through the pores of the skin, but only in the form of urine through the bladder. Gradually this thinking will change your bio-structure. The pores will no longer be required, and the bladder and kidney will have to become more active. Or suppose, by your mental force, you want to totally check urination. What will be the result? There will be complete disintegration and dissociation of various parts of the body &ndash; pancreas, liver, spleen, etc. Such changes can only be brought about if the idea of the collective body is supported by the Macrocosm &ndash; that is, if the Macrocosm approves your demand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Non-Inborn Instincts<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Next come non-inborn instincts. The inner portions and skin of the human body vary according to climatic conditions. In the human body there are many glands which are controlled by plexi. When a human child is born, not all the plexi function. Generally, the plexi do not function within the mother&#146;s womb because the babe does not breathe directly. Although the plexi are there, they become developed after birth only when the child starts to use its own respiratory system. So after birth, when the plexi become developed, changes occur in the physical body, in the secretion of hormones and in the hormonal structures. Over-secretion and under-secretion of hormones affect nerve cells, and thus change thoughts. Instincts also change. In the human body these changes take place slowly in cold climates and more quickly in hot climates.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Immediately after birth only the faculties of inborn instincts are expressed. Around the age of five several more faculties develop, and accordingly more hormones are secreted and different types of thoughts arise. Certain changes also take place in the skin. The skin becomes a bit<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->thick at the age of six in cold climates and at the age of four in hot climates. With this development a child&#146;s love for his or her brothers and sisters increases, and a tendency to want to play arises. As a result thoughts change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Some Important Glands<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><b>(1) Testes and ovaries</b>: At around the age of thirteen in hot countries and fifteen in cold countries, the testes and ovaries develop due to the secretion of a special type of hormone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In males the testes are the glands which convert lymph into semen. As soon as lymph is converted into semen, the nerves are affected and there is a corresponding change in one&#146;s thoughts. It is the pituitary gland which tells the testes to convert lymph into semen [that is, testosterone and spermatic fluid]. When the production of lymph goes beyond the capacity of the body to utilize it, it is converted into semen and comes out of the body. Thus, sex desire is created in the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->If the secretion of the testes glands is normal, a sense of dutifulness will be created in the mind. A boy will be proud of the fact that he obeyed his father. But if the boy was only three years old, he would not be able to feel a sense of dutifulness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->If the testes are over-active [highly active] and there is over-secretion [high secretion] of hormones, a youth develops the spirit of rationality. The pubic hair grows due to the activity of the testes. This is the physical effect. The development of rationality is the psychic effect. The nervous system will also be affected. If not hindered by the natural flow of the lymphatic glands, over-secretion [high  secretion] leads to the development of hair in the arm pits at the age of fifteen to seventeen in hot countries and seventeen to eighteen in cold countries. Along with this the feeling of rationality grows. For example, a boy may say, &ldquo;No, father, do not ask me to do that. It is not good.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->If there is under-secretion of the testes glands, there will be less hair; and if, at the same time, the sex glands do not develop at the specified stage, the boy will become very cruel. He may, for example, take a grasshopper and cut off its legs. You may have seen such a boy at the age of thirteen, fourteen or fifteen: he may be unsocial, he may not mix with others. This is due to the under-secretion of hormones from the testes glands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In the case of ordinary secretion, sex longing is created. If there is over-secretion [high secretion], a youth acquires the power to transform that longing into universalism. In those of you who have a longing for Parama Purus&#x301;a [Supreme Consciousness], an over-secretion [high secretion] took place in your hormones between the ages of fifteen and seventeen. At that stage the idea to become great comes into the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->If there is under-secretion of the hormones of the testes glands, a youth will develop less kindness, and less hair will grow in the armpits and pubic region. If you see a man with these physical characteristics, then and there you can come to a conclusion about the extent of his kindness. Moreover, such a person will most likely support dogma. He will not have the moral strength to protest against dogma (including scriptural dogma), and he will not support a new idea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->If the testes function properly and if there is no hindrance from the lymphatic glands, intelligence will develop. Without the testes, the solar plexus will not be developed and intelligence will decrease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In the past many slaves were converted into eunuchs &ndash; known as khojas in Persian. If the ovaries of a female or the testes of a male are dissociated from the body, the person will become a eunuch. In a male, if the testes are separated from the body, there will be physical and psychological changes. The man will not die but he will lose the sense of dutifulness and responsibility. All the qualities associated with the testes, such as the sense of dutifulness and responsibility, will be wanting. A eunuch will not be able to grow any pubic hair or the pubic hairs will be few.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Should the testes be cut off and a man made into a eunuch? Can it be considered civilized? In some countries men were changed into eunuchs, and as they did not have any sex feeling, they were posted as security guards in the harems of the rulers. This is a barbarous system and goes against fundamental human rights. It is extremely bad.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->If the sex organ is cut off from the male body, what will be the result? The man will not die, but the testes and kidneys will not be able to function properly. There will, therefore, also be psychological changes and no sex feeling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph --><b>(2) Prostate gland</b>: The prostate gland gives rise to the feeling of shyness or shamefulness in the mind. At the age of three to five a child does not feel any shyness. At this age a child can walk on the street without any clothes on. Adults experience shyness due to the development of this gland and imposed sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->As a result of over-secretion of hormones from the prostate gland, a sort of melancholia may develop. One may think: &ldquo;What is the necessity of this creation? Why did Parama Purus&#x301;a create this universe? I am alone, I have no friend. Where is the charm in life? Nobody cares for me.&rdquo; There are certain philosophies which propound this sort of melancholia. It is also apparent that the propounders themselves suffered from melancholia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->If there is under-secretion of the hormones from the prostate gland, a person will develop a fearful nature and suffer from psychic hallucinations. One may even see a ghost in broad daylight. Under-secretion, or low secretion, from the prostate gland creates this psychology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Does the prostate gland depend on the lymphatic glands or vice versa, or are they interdependent? These glands are interdependent; rather, all plexi and all glands are interdependent. All glands depend greatly on the lymphatic glands for their supply of lymph &ndash; the raw material. The dependence of the other glands on the lymphatic glands is greater than the dependence of the lymphatic glands on the other glands. Similarly, the upper plexi are less dependent on the lower plexi, and the lower plexi are more dependent on the upper plexi. The surplus supply of lymph goes to the brain [via the bloodstream] and nourishes the nerve cells of the cranium.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><b>(3) Solar plexus [located at the mid-point of the chest]</b>: When the solar plexus is developed, love for children is aroused. This is common to all animals, birds, mammals and human beings. But creatures which have self-dividing bodies have no love for children as they have no solar plexus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Just after the lymphatic glands begin to function normally, the testes develop in males, and in the case of females, the ovaries develop and glands start functioning to make human milk. Love for children also increases.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->When the solar plexus develops, the beard grows in males. If there is low secretion of the hormones from the solar plexus, less beard grows. Also, due to low secretion in sterile men and women &ndash; those who are viewed as eunuchs &ndash; love for children is lacking. In the case of over-secretion [high secretion], what will happen? In males the beard will grow more. It is a good sign if men have a thick beard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Human love will be transformed into universal love if there is over-secretion [high secretion] of the hormones from the solar plexus. In the case of males with love for Parama Purus&#x301;a, they will either have a thick beard or developed breasts, or both. Before they were sa&#x301;dhakas [spiritual aspirants], they would have either thinner beards or less developed breasts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->What happens if the solar plexus becomes dissociated from the body? All higher human wonts have their base in the solar plexus. If the solar plexus or any plexus becomes separated from the human body, the person will die then and there. The corporal structure will not survive even for a second. (In Latin there are two adjectives for &ldquo;corpus&rdquo;. &ldquo;Corpus&rdquo; means &ldquo;the indispensable portion of a structure&rdquo;. &ldquo;Corporal&rdquo; concerns something relating to the physical body, and &ldquo;corporeal&rdquo; refers to some physical material. &ldquo;Incorporeal&rdquo; concerns something which does not come within the scope of tactuality. Suppose a voice comes from the invisible world. Is it a physical voice? No, it is an incorporeal voice.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph --><b>(4) Thyroid and parathyroid glands</b>: Due to the secretion of hormones from the thyroid gland in the male body, the voice becomes deep and the moustache grows. Along with this, the quality of self-reliance increases. In the case of men, if this gland is not developed they will have a quarrelsome nature. Women will have the same defect and will also become a bit irrational. Vanity, too, will develop if there is under-secretion of the parathyroid gland. These are all non-inborn instincts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->For a male from a hot country, all the glands develop fully by the age of twenty-four. In cold countries this full development is reached approximately two years later. After the age of thirty-nine there is a slight deterioration in the physical body, but advancement in the psychic sphere. After the age of fifty in hot countries and fifty-one in cold countries, there is more physical deterioration and slight mental deterioration. After the age of sixty in hot countries and sixty-one in cold countries, the thinking power will slowly deteriorate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The human body is a biological machine. This is the story of the human body and human plexi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->I have discussed only a small portion of this knowledge because there is the possibility that it may be misused. Much research needs to be done on this subject for the all-round welfare of living beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph --><b>(5) Pituitary and pineal glands</b>: As a result of the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practices] performed in previous lives, at the age of thirteen, after the sex glands are developed, the pituitary gland starts to function tremendously and one&#146;s thirst for spirituality is aroused. If such a person gets proper guidance from a preceptor, one achieves spiritual progress. If one falls into bad company, one&#146;s downfall is rapid.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->After getting proper spiritual guidance, one&#146;s mind rises upwards from the pituitary gland to the pineal gland, and with one&#146;s mind concentrated on the controlling point of the pineal gland, one attains salvation within a short span of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a applies microvita to different glands and sub-glands. He renders this help to spiritual aspirants in the last phase of the third stratum [dimension of psychology] and in the fourth stratum. Most of the glands function within the first and second dimensions of psychology. The pituitary gland concerns the third dimension, and the pineal gland concerns the third and fourth dimensions. [There are four dimensions of Yoga psychology &ndash; from the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra to the man&#x301;ipura cakra; from the man&#x301;ipura cakra to the vishuddha cakra; from the vishuddha cakra to the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra; and above the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra. These dimensions of psychology correspond to the four phases of meditation.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Spiritual aspirants should take care to purify their pituitary gland because this helps in spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The secretion of hormones in the upper glands maintains a balance in all the other glands. The pituitary gland is psycho-spiritual in nature, and the pineal gland is spiritual in nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->As far as plexi are concerned, they are the bio-psychological secrets of living. In inanimate objects there is no secretion of hormones from [glands or] plexi. Expression takes place through the expansion and contraction of their inter-atomic and inter-molecular spaces.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a influences all plexi. The atonemental provisions of Parama Purus&#x301;a are through all plexi &ndash; not only the pituitary and pineal. Negative microvita do not function in the pituitary and pineal glands. Positive microvita function through all plexi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->As a general rule the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a is expressed through positive microvita in different plexi. Noticeably or conceivably a sweet aroma comes from the concerned plexus. When a spiritual aspirant attains mental concentration or composure, as in madhura sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [a particular type of meditation], he or she experiences a sweet aroma and the mind feels peaceful or composed. Parama Purus&#x301;a gives the bliss of tactuality through different plexi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->The Importance of Lymph<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->The lymphatic glands supply raw material &ndash; lymph &ndash; to the factories &ndash; the glands &ndash; and the surplus lymph goes to the brain and provides food for the nerve cells in the cranium. When lymph comes in contact with an activated gland, hormones are created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->The lymphatic glands associated with the testes start functioning at the same time as the testes begin to work in a proper manner. The raw material for the testes is the [lymph] hormone generated by the [regional] lymphatic glands. That lymph is converted into semen by the testes. When lymph comes to the solar plexus, the spirit of love and affection for children develops. In the female body ova are created in the ovaries. Some other lymph helps to maintain proper energy in the body and physical glamour, and in the case of females a certain portion is converted into milk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->The solar plexus cannot function properly if the supply of lymph is not perennial or regular. In the case of spiritual aspirants, there is high secretion of lymph in the solar plexus, consequently love for children is converted into love for the Supreme. That is, love for unit beings is transformed into love for Supreme Consciousness. Lymph is thus a cause of psychic change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->In the female body the lymph glands become very active at certain points, and in the male body at other points. In the case of adolescent girls and boys, a special type of nerve sensation occurs in the genitals. This sensation increases vigour in the person and creates the feeling in the mind, &ldquo;I have to do something.&rdquo; At that age one decides or tries to decide one&#146;s future. If the selection is defective, one will not progress. For example, if one wants to learn medicine but is forced to learn engineering by one&#146;s parents, one may not be successful. But if the selection is proper, one will be successful. Generally in hot climates this occurs in boys at the age of seventeen and in girls at the age of sixteen, and in cold climates at nineteen in the case of boys and eighteen in the case of girls.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->The lymphatic glands supply the raw material to the factories. All glands are factories. If hot static food or excessive animal protein is eaten by males, the quantity of lymph will decrease and the conversion of lymph into semen will increase. This will lead to intellectual backwardness. It may be observed that people who eat much animal protein tend to produce many children. This has its own sociological effect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Men should have proper control over the conversion of lymph into semen. This is part of Brahmacarya sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [meditation on the Supreme Entity]. Men should have proper control over their bodies. Human beings should be sentient in food, mind and intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Although carnivores may be more clever or cunning than granivores, they are generally less intellectual. It will be very difficult for a tiger, a cat or a dog to perform spiritual practices. A monkey or a cow may perform spiritual practices because they get much chlorophyll from grass and other green vegetation. Granivorous animals produce more lymph than carnivores, and that is why their brains are more developed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->The lymphatic glands of monkeys are highly developed, although they utilize very little of their lymph. This is why they can jump so much. Human beings cannot jump as much as monkeys because they use more lymph in the functioning of the brain. Human qualities develop along with the increase of lymph.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->Lymph is required for the production of milk. Most women can move fast until they give birth to children, but after childbirth they generally cannot move as fast. Deer are granivorous and can move fast, but they give little milk because they use their lymphatic glands a lot. As cows produce excessive milk, they cannot move fast.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->Vegetarians produce more lymph because they get chlorophyll from grass and other green vegetation, and that is why their brains are more developed than those of non-vegetarians. Those who consume animal protein [neglecting green vegetation] suffer from want of lymph because animal protein contains very little chlorophyll. Tigers and cats are carnivores, which is why they produce less milk. Cows and buffaloes produce much more milk because they take chlorophyll from green grass and green vegetation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Maximum lymph is produced from food which contains a lot of chlorophyll, such as green vegetables and especially the tips of the stems of creepers. Granivorous animals produce much milk, while carnivorous animals, such as dogs, give very little milk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->Lymph is produced from animal protein also, but because animal protein produces a lot of heat in the human body, the lymph is quickly converted into semen. Monkeys and deer produce much lymph, but it is not converted into semen because it is utilized in running and jumping.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->What is the initial stuff in the manufacture of lymph? Lymph is produced from the energy and vitality acquired from the different quinquelemental factors of this universe, such as water, air and light. They are the initial stuff. The final stuff is shukra [which has three stages: lymph, spermatozoa and seminal fluid]. It is the most developed stuff &ndash; the cream of all creams. Chlorophyll accelerates the speed of the production of lymph, but it does not act as the initial stuff.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->In certain people the major portion of lymph is eroded away and that is why they are intellectually deficient. But for spiritual aspirants, as the major portion of their lymph remains in their bodies, they should not suffer from any intellectual deficiency. This is why the intellectual standard of spiritual aspirants is higher than that of common people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->Positive or negative catalytic agents have an important effect on the manufacture of lymph. Positive psychic and positive physical environments are positive catalytic agents, and negative psychic and negative physical environments are negative catalytic agents. Even if the food one eats is sentient, but the environment is negative, it is detrimental to mental progress. Cinema halls, prostitute quarters and busy commercial places are negative physical environments. Bad discussions, bad books, and bad thoughts prevailing among the population are negative psychic environments &ndash; negative catalytic agents. If the environment is good, such as at Anandanagar, it is a positive physical environment &ndash; a positive catalytic agent. If there are many spiritual aspirants and elevating discussions, a positive psychic environment will be created. This will help in the manufacture of lymph.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->Lymph itself is a hormone, and is converted into other hormones by different glands. Lymph is the initial hormone. The creation of hormones in the other glands depends upon these positive and negative catalytic agents. This is the reason why in olden times even Shiva placed much importance on satsaun&#x32D;ga [associating with good people]. Satsaun&#x32D;ga provides a positive psychic environment. Good company leads to liberation whereas bad company is the cause of bondages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="65"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Psychic Longing for Psychic Pabulum<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->Pabulum is a Latin word. Its meaning is not comprehensive. A&#x301;bhoga in Sanskrit is the proper term. A&#x301;bhoga: a&#x301; &ndash; bhuin&#x32D;j + ghain&#x32D;. A&#x301; means &ldquo;towards&rdquo;; bhuin&#x32D;j means &ldquo;to enjoy&rdquo;; and ghain&#x32D; makes it a verbal noun. So a&#x301;bhoga means &ldquo;an object of enjoyment&rdquo;. Few people are acquainted with the term a&#x301;bhoga, therefore people use &ldquo;pabulum&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->Objects of enjoyment may be physical or psychic. Suppose an object of enjoyment is a sweet. This is physical pabulum. A noble idea is psychic pabulum. If the psychic object is a sweet, psychic movement is towards something crude; if it is something subtle, the mind moves towards the subtle and will become subtle. Even if the starting point of emanation is crude but the mind continuously thinks of something subtle, the mind will become subtle &ndash; the culminating point, the end point, is subtle. So, if the culminating point is crude the mind gets crudified, and if the culminating point is subtle the mind becomes subtle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->The mind will have to maintain parallelism with the physical structure while moving towards a certain object. Association by proper adjustment and parallelism between the psychic and physical bodies causes life, and dissociation under adverse conditions results in death. If there are severe hindrances in the process of emanation [of psycho-physical waves], the parallelism is lost. If parallelism is lost, there is death &ndash; the body and the mind will dissociate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->There are two causes of death: physical and psychic. Physical death occurs when the waves of the physical structure become crudified due to old age or any other physical deficiency. Psychic death occurs when psychic clash with either subtler or cruder thought-waves results in increasing or decreasing the wavelength of the mental waves respectively. In this case, also, loss of parallelism will occur, and the physical and psychic bodies shall dissociate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->Thus, if, on a particular avenue of progress, one&#146;s longing for a particular object is hindered, the parallelism between mind and body will be lost. In this case psychic diversion is essential because one must maintain parallelism with the vital characteristics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->The psychology of humans is goaded by certain principles, that of cows by other principles, and that of vultures by still other principles. Each follows a particular path. Suppose a human being dies of smallpox or cholera. A vulture will not die if it eats a human body which is infected with either disease. If, on the other hand, a man eats the flesh of a person who has died of cholera, he will almost certainly die. This is because the plexi of human beings and those of vultures are different.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->Human beings should move forward with a thorough knowledge of propriety and impropriety. They must maintain a balance between social propriety, political propriety and psychic propriety. One&#146;s relations with one&#146;s brother, sister, mother, wife, etc., are all different. One&#146;s behaviour with one&#146;s sister should not be the same as it is with one&#146;s wife. Maintaining proper relations with different sorts of people is part of propriety. Human beings must not go beyond the limits of psychic propriety. If balance is maintained and propriety is properly measured, then the world will be an abode of prama&#x301; [dynamic adjustment] &ndash; heaven will be established on the earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="73"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->Apexed Psychology<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->When the movement of the human mind is not in many lateral directions &ndash; north, south, east and west &ndash; but towards the Supreme Entity, then the mind becomes apexed, pinnacled. This pointed mind either merges in the Macrocosm, or gives up its individual existence in the Supreme Cognitive Faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->In the time of Shiva yogis and bio-psychologists preferred cold climates. In those days they did all kinds of parapsychological research. Even now yogis run to the Himalayas for this purpose. Ananda Marga sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is a bio-psychological practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->If, in a particular life, one performs sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; but does not attain salvation, one will have to come back again. Under such circumstances one may or may not remember one&#146;s past life &ndash; it depends on the pituitary gland. Then, in the latter part of one&#146;s present life, say at the age of forty or later, if one&#146;s mind reaches the pineal gland, one will attain salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->Preferably, one should start bio-psycho-spiritual practice as early as possible after the age of five. If that is not possible, one should definitely start sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; by the age of thirteen after the sex glands develop and the sense of responsibility and dutifulness arises in the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->The pituitary plexus is very important in spiritual progress, especially the left side [from the viewpoint of the sa&#x301;dhaka]. If the left side of this plexus is developed and the right side is not, after death one is reborn with a human body and continues practising sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. When a spiritual aspirant strikes the pineal gland, salvation is achieved. If both sides of the pituitary plexus are fully developed, one becomes self-knowing, if not all-knowing. (In Latin &ldquo;all-knowing&rdquo; is &ldquo;omniscient&rdquo;, and in Sanskrit it is trika&#x301;ladarshii-sarvajin&#x32D;a.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->In the case of Shiva, the pituitary gland is called Shiva&#146;s third eye, but it is actually His omniscience through which He sees the three ages &ndash; past, present and future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->If one is unable to attain salvation in a particular life, one gets a human body in the next life and is guided by parapsychology. In the next life one remembers, up to the age of thirteen or fourteen, everything concerned with the past life, but as soon as the testes glands [or ovaries] start to function, one generally forgets the past. This is because as soon as the sex glands start functioning, one develops a special attraction for this earth. If one does not forget the past, one dies, usually at the age of thirteen, fourteen or fifteen, because one will not be able to adjust the past life with the present life. If one forgets the past, one will not die. Those who have attained salvation may or may not remember their past lives according to their own sweet will. This comes within the scope of parapsychology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->So if one does not attain salvation in a particular life, in the next life, after the testes glands [or ovaries] start to function, one will have to become a spiritual aspirant, leaving one&#146;s hearth and home to become successful in spiritual life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->The reason why these people are reborn is to undergo the reactive momenta of their past lives. Some of their reactive momenta remain unquenched. They are reborn just to undergo the pleasure and pain resulting from their previous reactive momenta. In this life a man, in the next life a woman; in this life a boy, in the next life a girl. In the life after that one may become self-knowing, if not all-knowing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="83"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->The Grace of the Guru<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->To make the mind pinnacled, one should do dhya&#x301;na of the Guru in the Guru cakra. The Guru cakra is slightly below the pineal gland, though the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra and the Guru cakra are virtually the same. So the mind is to be concentrated on the Guru cakra, and all the potentialities of the unconscious mind are also to be concentrated here. The moment one achieves full concentration, one becomes omniscient.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->Why do spiritual aspirants concentrate on the Guru cakra and not on the pineal gland for dhya&#x301;na? Because the Guru cakra is the internal side of the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->A spiritual aspirant should not do spiritual practices to become omniscient. Rather, a spiritual aspirant is to perform spiritual practices to satisfy Parama Purus&#x301;a in the form of Parama Guru. That is why it has been rightly said: Guru krpa&#x301;hi kevalam [&ldquo;The grace of the Guru is everything&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->There is no difference between the pineal and pituitary glands of males and females, but there may be differences in the other glands. This is why those who say that women are not entitled to spiritual salvation are wrong. Men and women are equally entitled to spiritual salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->The right wing of the pituitary plexus controls the qualities, attributions and quanta of the leftistic propensities, which are a little more than 400 in number. The left wing of the pituitary plexus controls the qualities, attributions and quanta of the rightistic propensities, which are also a little more than 400 in number. The total is a little less than 850. When both sides of the pituitary plexus are fully developed and fully utilized, one attains apexed intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->Leftistic propensities are those which have a degenerating and depraving effect, such as shyness, shamefulness, melancholia and fear. Rightistic propensities are those which pave the way to supra-consciousness. As a result of the normal secretion of hormones of the first sub-gland of the man&#x301;ipura cakra, the propensities of shyness and shamefulness are created. This creation of shyness is an imposed sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra. It only occurs when the environment helps in creating this propensity. The combined effect of the over-secretion of the fifth and of the over-secretion of the sixth sub-glands of the igneous plexus is melancholia. Due to the under-secretion of its ninth and tenth sub-glands, the fear complex is created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->If one commences spiritual practices later in life, and if the left wing of the pituitary plexus is developed, one can remember one&#146;s past life. When the right wing is developed but the left wing is not developed, the entity will not get a human structure with developed nerve cells, but will get the body of a developed animal such as a dog, cow or monkey. In such cases the entity will remember its past life until its sex glands start functioning. When the sex glands start functioning, it forgets its past life; if it cannot forget, it dies. When, in rare cases, a person does not forget his or her past life nor dies, he or she becomes a spiritual genius, a hermit, or a worker of a missionary organization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->Good propensities may be enhanced or diminished by microvita with the help of the Macrocosm. Good propensities may be enhanced with positive microvita and diminished with negative microvita. Bad propensities may be enhanced with negative microvita and diminished with positive microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->When the Guru is pleased with the disciples&#146; efforts, the Guru graces them by encouraging and enhancing their good propensities and by reducing their bad ones by microvita. The good propensities are enhanced by positive microvita and the bad propensities are reduced by positive microvita. Through microvita the Guru does the needful to increase or decrease the secretion of the glands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->If Parama Purus&#x301;a is pleased with a boy He applies positive microvita to all his plexi, and as a result the person enjoys bliss. It is remarkable that after a sa&#x301;dhaka has developed to the third phase of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, he attains salvation within a short period with the help of the Guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->A human being is just like a machine &ndash; or a mechanical doll &ndash; in the hands of the Macrocosm. Perform spiritual practices to satisfy Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Cognitive Faculty, and He will do everything. If one gets the guidance of a sadguru at the age of thirteen, fourteen or fifteen, and diverts one&#146;s potentialities towards Parama Purus&#x301;a through spiritual practices, one is sure to be successful in life.<!-- /block --></p>
