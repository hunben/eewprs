<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; is derived from the Sam&#x301;skrta root verb &ldquo;dhr&rdquo; + suffix &ldquo;man&rdquo;. It means &ldquo;that which sustains&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is sustained by others&rdquo;. For instance, fire. The dharma or characteristic of fire is to burn. Each and every object in this universe is endowed with a particular dharma which determines its very existence. If anything deviates from its basic characteristics (dharma) it will automatically have to change its name and form. For example, if fire loses its capacity to burn it is no longer fire, and we will cease to call it as such. We will name it according to the nature of the work it performs. If fire makes something wet instead of burning it, we will have to call it water instead of fire. That&#146;s why it is said that each and every object has a particular dharma of its own. So human beings will have to develop their social structure, economic principles, spiritual practice &ndash; in fact everything in life &ndash; in consistence with the principles of dharma because dharma is the divine law.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->An elephant has a particular kind of structure and bathes itself accordingly. It draws water through its trunk and never bathes itself with hands as humans do because it has to act according to its dharma. Similarly, humans must also act in accordance with the system of dharma as it is a divinely decreed system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Whatever humans do in consistence with the dictates of dharma will ensure their well-being, their victory, their prosperity. And whoever goes against these ingrained human characteristics, against these dharma-orientated characteristics, will be doomed to destruction. For human beings, ideation on Parama Purus&#x301;a is a dharmic injunction. By divine decree everyone has the right to live in the world with dignity. If anyone creates any obstacle against this dharma-oriented system, if they oppose it, they are bound to be destroyed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->You have learnt a well-ordered system of meditation and other spiritual practices based on dharma. If any individuals or groups, however powerful they may be, try to suppress you or even succeed in suppressing you, they are bound to be destroyed. History has witnessed many such a downfall in the past. No one has ever been victorious or will ever be victorious by opposing dharma. March ahead with your own strength, march with firm steps and your head held high. Always remember that when dharma is with you, whoever will oppose you will be razed to the ground &ndash; their destruction is a must.<!-- /block --></p>
