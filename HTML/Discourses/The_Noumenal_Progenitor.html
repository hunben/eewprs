<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;The Noumenal Progenitor&rdquo;. The creative faculty of the universe is the fundamental Operative Principle, Prakrti. If She is called the Causal Matrix, then the Transcendental Cognition should be termed the Noumenal Father or the Noumenal Progenitor. This Noumenal Progenitor not only is the Supreme Causal Factor but also has transmuted Himself into the objectivities of His progeny. This Noumenal Entity is not only the Supreme Progenitor; He is also the Supreme Witnessing Entity. He is the nave of this Cosmological order. He is the hub of this circum-rotarian universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Progenitor in His role as the witnessed objectivity has permitted the Supreme Operative Principle to create, to emanate, innumerable waves of innumerable lengths in His transcendental body. And the portion of this Progenitor that has attained the original status (known as the parama pada) is the Witnessing Entity when associated with creation; and also remains as a non-witnessing, non-attached, absolute Entity when He is in His original seity, or in His supreme stance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->But this nave of the Cosmological order is the only witnessing entity of each and every created being. Each and every created being has knowingly or unknowingly adored Him, accepted Him, as the only object of ideation. Somebody ideates on Him knowingly, somebody unknowingly; somebody positively, somebody negatively. But He is the supreme terminus of all the marches of all the created beings. That&#146;s why it has been said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe brhante tasmin ham&#x301;so bhra&#x301;myate Brahmacakre;<br>Prthaga&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; prerita&#x301;rain&#x32D;ca matva&#x301; jus&#x301;t&#x301;astatastena&#x301;mrtatvameti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[All unit entities, all unit structures, revolve around the Nucleus Consciousness in the Cosmic Cycle of creation. This rotation of theirs will continue as long as they think that they are separate from their Creator. When they become one with the Nucleus, they will attain immortality.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Everybody, animate or inanimate, knowingly or unknowingly, moves round Him.&rdquo; They will have to move round Him; there is no alternative for created beings. And each and every entity is moving round Him with their own peculiar psychic pabulum. Mr. X is worshipping Him in the form of money, Mr. Y is worshipping Him in the form of name, another in the form of fame, another in the name of landed property, and so on. They are worshipping Him unknowingly. So it has been said that each and every entity is moving round Him with their own peculiar psychic pabulum. And the collection of all these pabula is the Supreme Entity. That&#146;s why the spiritual aspirant, while dealing with, or while coming in contact with, any expression of this quinquelemental universe, ascribes Brahma-hood to that physical object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->If while coming in contact with money, a person thinks &ldquo;This is money,&rdquo; that person is doing something crude. That person  is crudening his or her psychic body. But if while coming in contact with money or some other mundane object, the person ascribes Brahma-hood to that object, then he or she is coming in contact with That Entity, and it will be nothing but intuitional practice, spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe brhante tasmin ham&#x301;so bhra&#x301;myate Brahmacakre &ndash; &ldquo;The many entities moving around that Supreme Hub have not got a singular physical structure, they have got so many structures, so many frameworks, with so many mental pabula.&rdquo; No two physical structures are the same, because the psychic pabula of no two physical structures are the same. The physical structures, the physical frameworks, vary according to the variations in psychic pabula. The psychic pabulum of a goat and the psychic pabulum of a human are not the same. The psychic pabula of Mr. X, a man, and of Mr. Y, another man, are not the same. And that&#146;s why they have not got similar physical frameworks. And when the psychic pabulum of a person becomes one with the psychic pabulum of the Supreme, one requires no physical structure, one becomes one with the Supreme. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe brhante tasmin ham&#x301;so &ndash; &ldquo;This ham&#x301;so (ham&#x301;so means jiiva [unit being])&rdquo; &ndash; bhra&#x301;myate Brahmacakre &ndash; &ldquo;is moving round this Cosmological Hub in this Brahma Cakra, in this Cosmological system.&rdquo; You know, in this universe everything is systematic. Nobody can function without a system. In our social life, in family life, everywhere there is a system; and there should be a system. One who goes against that system commits a social crime. This is what is called indiscipline. In our life in India today there is indiscipline in the social order, and that&#146;s why there is every chance of social disintegration, which is dangerous. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So, ham&#x301;so [&ldquo;the unit being&rdquo;]. Now, in the smallest system, that is, the atomic system, there is a nucleus and electrons; electrons are moving around that nucleus. In the ethereal system, the nucleus is the earth, and the moon is moving round the earth, round this nucleus. In the solar system also, the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving round that nucleus. There is order, there is system. And in this vast Cosmological order, Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Noumenal Father, is the nucleus, and the jiivas are moving around Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Prthaga&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; prerita&#x301;rain&#x32D;ca matva&#x301; jus&#x301;t&#x301;astatastena&#x301;mrtatvameti &ndash; &ldquo;And they will move round Him&rdquo; - for how many years? Why do they move round Him? Because they have forgotten the supreme truth that they are one with the Hub. And unless and until they get free from this ignorance, they will have to move round Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Prthaga&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; prerita&#x301;rain&#x32D;ca matva&#x301;. A&#x301;tma&#x301;nam, that is, &ldquo;the self, the jiiva&rdquo;, and prerita&#x301;rain&#x32D;ca, &ldquo;its centre&rdquo;. That is, the Supreme Hub is the centre. &ldquo;The jiiva and Shiva are the same&rdquo; - this idea helps the jiiva to become one with Shiva. And &ldquo;We are different; we are two entities&rdquo; &ndash; this idea compels the jiiva to move round that Supreme Hub. What is your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? By sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you are to free yourself from this ignorance, from the slumber of ignorance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now, wherever there is any system, there is a nucleus in the middle, [and] other objects, other entities, are moving round that nucleus. There are two forces, two active forces, two operative forces. One force is the concentric, centripetal, force, and the other is the centrifugal force. One is centre-seeking, moving towards the centre, and the other drifts one away from the centre. In this Cosmological order also these two forces are functioning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Here, in this case, the concentric force is called vidya&#x301; - vidya&#x301; shakti. This concentric force has two kinds of effect on the human mind &ndash; on the human entity, rather.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->First of all, let us take the case of the eccentric force. The eccentric force is called avidya&#x301; shakti. This avidya&#x301; shakti has two kinds of influence on the jiiva. One is spirituo-psychic and the other is psycho-physical. The spirituo-psychic influence of the eccentric force on the human entity, on the jaevii entity [i.e., the jiiva, the unit being], is called viks&#x301;epa shakti. Viks&#x301;epa means &ldquo;the drifting away of the entity from the hub&rdquo;, that is, increasing its radius. This viks&#x301;epa shakti teaches a person to keep away from the Father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->And another influence is psycho-physical. The psycho-physical influence is called a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. In Sanskrit, [a&#x301;varan&#x301;a] means &ldquo;to cover&rdquo;. That is, one tries to cover one&#146;s eyes so as not to see the Lord. One&#146;s intention is that one will not see the Lord, that is why one covers one&#146;s eyes. It is just like a rabbit that thinks that because it closed its eyes with the help of its ears and is not able to see the hunter, the hunter will not see it either. This is the effect of a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti on the jiiva&#146;s mind. While committing anything antisocial, committing a sin, a person is influenced by this a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. He or she thinks, &ldquo;This particular action of mine is not being witnessed by the Supreme Father.&rdquo; This is a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Similarly, the influence of the concentric force, the vidya&#x301; shakti, has two effects. One is samvit shakti, another is hla&#x301;dinii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->A depraved person, a degenerated person, all of a sudden one fine morning starts thinking, &ldquo;What have I done in this life? I have been given a human structure, a human body, a human mind, a human soul, but I haven&#146;t yet utilized that structure. What have I done? I have misused my human potentiality.&rdquo; This idea is created by the concentric force. It is physico-psychic. A&#x301;varan&#x301;ii was psycho-physical, and this one is physico-psychic &ndash; moving from physicality towards the realm of mentality. This samvit shakti creates the urge in the human mind to do something noble, to do intuitional practice. &ldquo;Now I must not waste my time. I should do something noble, something concrete.&rdquo; After that, what does it do at that moment? It gets His krpa&#x301; [grace]. And one gets the chance to know, to do, to practise, intuitional science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->So what will be the next phase? In the next phase one is helped, one gets help from, the concentric force in the form of hla&#x301;dinii shakti.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Hla&#x301;dinii shakti means the shakti that helps, that propels, that directs, the jiiva towards the realm of supreme beatitude. This is hla&#x301;dinii shakti. Hla&#x301;dinii shakti is also known as Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti in Sanskrit, and the Supreme Hub is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti helps the jiiva in coming in contact with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Then there will be union of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; [the unit entity].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Now, it is the duty of each and every human being, each and every jiiva in human structure, to encourage this hla&#x301;dinii shakti and to discourage that viks&#x301;epa shakti and a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. You must remember that nothing remains covert in this universe, everything is public.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->So you are all sa&#x301;dhakas, and my instruction to you is that you must not waste a single moment; and you are to try your best to encourage, to strengthen, your hla&#x301;dinii shakti and fight against the immorality appearing before you in the form of viks&#x301;epa shakti and a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. Be one with your hla&#x301;dinii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Peace be with you.<!-- /block --></p>
