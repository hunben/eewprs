<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Now I will tell you something about the medical science in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->According to ayurveda, when the balance of the body is lost due to the increase or decrease of va&#x301;yu or pitta or kapha, disease starts. Medicine is applied to restore balance. If the amount of va&#x301;yu or pitta decreases, medicine is applied to increase it; if the amount of vayu or pitta increases medicine is applied to decrease it. This is the ayurvedik system of medicine. In the unani system, a similar system of medicine, there are four factors (dha&#x301;tu) &ndash; va&#x301;yu, pitta, kapha and rakta. The difference between the two systems is that in the unani system one more factor, i.e., rakta, has been added. The other three factors are the same. In both systems crude medicine is applied and surgery ( shalya cikitsa) is simply nominal. In the pure ayurvedik system there is no surgery. But the vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra of India which has been incorporated into the ayurvedik system included surgery.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->And one more system is the homoeopathic system popularized by Hahnemann, a great man. In the ayurvedic system and in the unani system the medicine is applied not to treat the disease but to bring about a balance among the aforesaid factors. In homoeopathy, too, whose principle is &ldquo;Samah samam shamayati&rdquo; (like cures like), the disease is not treated, but the symptom of the disease is treated. No matter whether the disease is diarrhoea or malaria, the symptom is treated and not the disease. Moreover, the medicine is applied in a subtle form. It is theorized that the subtle affects the crude, hence subtle medicine is applied to cure the crude disease. The more subtle the medicine, the more effective the result on the crude disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Allopathic treatment is a direct treatment of the disease. A particular disease is cured with the appropriate kind of medicine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In India at that time, there was a mixture of ayurveda and vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra. But a strange thing is that homoeopathy incorporates the vis&#x301;a cikitsa&#x301; of that era, and through this vis&#x301;a cikitsa&#x301; people were familiar with the principle &ldquo;Samah samam shamayati.&rdquo; For instance, the Kaoravas gave poison to Bhiima, and people announced that he had died. But the experts in ayurveda gave injections of poison to Bhiima, by which he was cured. This proves that people had the knowledge of vis&#x301;a cikitsa&#x301; and the principle &ldquo;Samah samam shamayati.&rdquo; i.e., homoeopathy in an elementary form. Homoeopathy was not started by Mahatma Hahnemann, instead it was developed by him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Vis&#x301;a cikitsa&#x301; is native to India, and its first reference is found in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata period. Later on this vis&#x301;a cikitsa&#x301; was encouraged not by Aryans, but rather by non-Aryans, and South India, especially Malabar, saw it expand a lot. These people attribute the origin of vis&#x301;a cikitsa&#x301; to Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, i.e., vis&#x301;a cikitsa&#x301; was originated by Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. And vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra was originated by Lord Sada&#x301;shiva. Actually, ayurveda was known to the Aryans earlier than Lord Shiva. But Lord Sada&#x301;shiva brought about a blending between vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra and ayurveda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->But the originator of vis&#x301;a cikitsa&#x301; was Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. In the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata period, it was appreciated a lot, and people discussed it and practised it by applying different venoms such as the venom of the snake, the venom of the spider, the venom of the scorpion, etc., to cure snake bite, spider bite, scorpion bite, etc. In course of time, it was neglected. At last it had some place in the royal family of Cochin. This system is neglected nowadays, but if it is encouraged, a new system will be added to medical science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Perhaps you know arkavana (arkapatra), generally found in a cremation ground. If this is used either externally or internally, the eye becomes defective. But it was discovered in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata period that if that same arkavana is used in a subtle form, it is a very good medicine for various eye diseases. The same system of &ldquo;Samah samam shamayati,&rdquo; i.e., poison roots out poison, is there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Surgery, which is considered to be a part of allopathy, is not really so; rather it is a part of ayurveda sha&#x301;stra. Since the time of Sada&#x301;shiva, it has developed a lot. In vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra, it is also explained how a dead body is to be studied by students. The structure of the human body, how to keep it clean, how it decomposes, is all explained in vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra. This proves that surgery was very developed in that period. There is a very interesting example of surgery. The cousin of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a (the son of the sister of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s father) was Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, with his capital at Rajgir. At the time of the birth of Jarasandha, the child had to be cut out of the womb. People saw this child and threw it in the cremation ground. Then there came a very famous non-Aryan (ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii) lady doctor known as Jara. She stitched the child in a proper surgical operation and saved it. Since the lady Jara joined (sandhi) the pieces of the child&#146;s body, the name of the child became Jarasandha. This proves that the people were well acquainted with surgery.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->It is improper to think that everything in India has come from abroad. I have told you that Bhaskaracarya first discovered that the earth was round, and not Copernicus. That the earth is moving was first discovered by Bhaskaracharya and not by Galileo. The law of gravitation was first discovered by Bhaskaracharya and not by Newton. We give incorrect training to children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Hence you see that homoeopathy sprang up in India itself. Nor did surgery originate with Aryans, but in India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Suppose there are two persons. If the mind of either of them is stronger, it will control the other mind and the controlled mind will follow the stronger mind. The stronger mind imposes itself on the other mind either directly or by some artificial means indirectly. Because of the effect of the stronger mind, the controller mind utilizes its mental power against the disease and gets free from it. This sort of treatment by hypnotic spell, people say, was started by Dr. Mesmer of France, and so this system is known as &ldquo;mesmerism.&rdquo; But prior to Dr. Mesmer, this system was known to Indians. In India it was named &ldquo;ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii vidya&#x301;.&rdquo; In ancient India (by ancient India I mean the non-Aryans, the natives of India) there was a non-Aryan lady doctor, Ka&#x301;rkatii Ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii. This Ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii was very famous for her mesmeric treatment. This sort of treatment should therefore not have been known as &ldquo;mesmerism&rdquo; &ndash; it should have been known as something different.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Hence we find that in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata age, there was surgery, ayurveda, vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra, vis&#x301;a cikitsa&#x301;, and homoeopathy; and people were not unacquainted with mesmeric treatment either. This proves that medical science was not underdeveloped.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->You can pose the question &ndash; if medical science was developed so much, why was it destroyed? The main reason was that touching the dead body, learning about the physical structure of the skeleton of the dead body, etc, was not considered to be lowly by the people of the early Buddhistic age; but after Buddha, people began to take it as lowly. Touching the dead body was considered to be most undesirable. This affected medical science a lot. Surgery especially was much affected, and because of this all medical science was affected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Six or seven hundred years after Buddha, Buddhists once again discussed medical science a lot and tried their best to develop it But immediately after Buddha it was completely discouraged, and medical science in India had its downfall. Moreover, when people did start to develop medical science, some time after Buddha, there was simultaneously an invasion from outside India, due to which ayurveda, vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra, vis&#x301;a cikitsa&#x301; and surgery were discouraged in India and the unani (hakimii) System of medicine began to take root. Because the hakimii system was not much cultivated in this country, the downfall of India as far as medical science is concerned, occurred.<!-- /block --></p>
