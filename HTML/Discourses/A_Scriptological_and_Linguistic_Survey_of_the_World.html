<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Between the points of no magnitude there is a flow of cognition. In that fluidal flow of cognition, bubbles are created. These bubbles are the bubbles of ideas. In the Cosmic emanation of the Supreme, when these bubbles touch the unit &ldquo;I feeling&rdquo;, then unit ideas are created as a result of close proximity to the Cosmic Ocean. These are the reflections or refractions of Cosmic ideas. When these ideas concern the unit, the unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; tries to express them through its own psycho-physical structure. It endeavours to express its unit desires and longings according to the capacity of the vocal cord and its hormone secretions. These reflections or refractions of ideas are expressed either within or without. The expression within is called &ldquo;inner voice&rdquo; and the expression without is called &ldquo;outer voice.&rdquo; These expressions within and without are collectively called language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->According to structural, environmental, climatic and racial differences, languages are expressed in different forms, thus we get different languages. So far as the refraction of the bubbles is concerned, the language of the universe is the same, was the same and will remain the same forever. The language of the &ldquo;inner voice&rdquo; is always one and indivisible. Only in the outer manifestation do we get so many languages. In the expressed world linguistic differences have a little value, but in the inner world they have no meaning, no import and no value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the entire world there are different linguistic groups. These groups may be divided according to the following criteria:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->1) Those languages in which the verbal form changes according to changes in the number and gender of its subject, like French and Sam&#x301;skrta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->2) Those languages in which the verbal form changes according to the number and not the gender of the subject, as in English. For instance, we say &ldquo;Henry is coming&rdquo; and &ldquo;Henriette is also coming&rdquo; but &ldquo;Henry and Henrietta are coming&rdquo;. Here the gender of the subject does not affect the verb, but the number certainly does.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->3) Those languages in which the verb changes according to the gender and not the number, like Maethilii and Bhojpurii. In Bhojpurii the verb is not fully expressed. For example, in the case of &ldquo;you&rdquo; masculine it is &ldquo;tu gaila&#x301;&rdquo; but in the case of &ldquo;you&rdquo; feminine it is &ldquo;tu gailii&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->There are some languages where the use of the &ldquo;be&rdquo; verb is avoided, as in Bengali. For example, &ldquo;He is a good boy&rdquo; is &ldquo;Se bha&#x301;la chele&rdquo; in Bengali. Here the Bengali equivalent of &ldquo;is&rdquo; in English is not mentioned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The Languages of India<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the ancient past, in the hoary past, India was inhabited by the Austrico-Negroid-Mongoloid races. The northwest was thickly populated. The Caucasian people came to India from the central portion of South Russia, so we can say that central southern Russian Aryan blood was incorporated into the body of India. There was less Aryan blending in the south and east of India, and more in the north and west of India. The Aryans who came to India 393 spoke a distorted Vedic language which was blended with the Austrico-Negroid-Mongoloid tongues and was thereby changed. The Austrico-Negroid-Mongoloid languages were also blended with the Vedic language, so they have a large percentage of Vedic vocabulary. Even languages of non-Vedic origin have a large number of Sam&#x301;skrta words, like Malayalam for instance, which is an Austrico-Negroid language containing 75% Sam&#x301;skrta and Vedic vocabulary. Bengali is an Austrico-Negroid-Mongoloid language, but it contains 92% Sam&#x301;skrta vocabulary. Punjabi is a direct descendent of the Vedic language &ndash; it contains 80% Tadbhava Vedic or distorted Vedic. Due to the close proximity of the Punjab with Persia and Turkey, Persian and Turkish vocabulary are also included in Punjabi. There was a blending in the cultural history of these countries, and a similar blending also took place in the linguistic structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Sam&#x301;skrta has four zonal intonations: a) Gaor&#x301;iiya; b) Ka&#x301;shika&#x301;; c) Maharastra; and d) Daks&#x301;ini. In a particular language there are different intonations which even vary district-wise. The languages of Bihar and some of the languages of Uttar Pradesh do not have any position in their region. Bhojpurii was spoken in Deoria and Gorakhpur and known as Tarai Bhojpurii. There is a variation between lower Gangetic Bhojpurii, which is the Bhojpurii of Bhojpur, and upper Gangetic Bhojpurii, which is spoken in the east of Gopiganj. Bhojpurii is spoken to the east of Gopiganj, and Bagheli is spoken to the west. Dogrii, which was a flourishing language 500 years ago, could not be revived due to the silent opposition of the Kashmiri Brahmins. At that time Urdu was influential in Kashmir.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->During the Sam&#x301;skrtic age, like today, languages were not given their proper status. Sam&#x301;skrta was called &ldquo;Bha&#x301;s&#x301;a&rdquo; and the peoples&#146; language was called &ldquo;Bha&#x301;kha&rdquo; to give it a lower status. Sam&#x301;skrta was compared with well water and the peoples&#146; language with flowing water (Bahata&#x301; Niira). Vernacular means &ldquo;the language of the slaves.&rdquo; You should do something for the recognition of peoples&#146; languages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->There are certain similarities in the languages derived from one source, for example, Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta is like Bengali (and Maethilii, etc.) because these languages use &ldquo;ma&#x301;&rdquo; and &ldquo;ca&rdquo; in the present tense &ndash; &ldquo;a&#x301;mi ya&#x301;cchi&rdquo; in Bengali and &ldquo;aha&#x301;n ja&#x301;echi&rdquo; in Maethilii &ndash; &ldquo;la&rdquo; in past tense &ndash; &ldquo;se gela&rdquo;in Bengali and &ldquo;same gaeli&rdquo; in Maethilii &ndash; and &ldquo;ba&rdquo; in future tense &ndash; &ldquo;ami ja&#x301;ba&rdquo; in Bengali, &ldquo;hama ja&#x301;iba&rdquo; in Maethilii and &ldquo;mu jibi&rdquo; in Oriya. Western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta, which includes Magahii, Bhojpurii, Nagpuria, Chattisgarhii, etc. is different. In the present tense &ldquo;ca&rdquo; is not used &ndash; &ldquo;Ham ja&#x301; rahalbani&rdquo; etc. &ndash; in the past tense &ldquo;la&rdquo; is used &ndash; &ldquo;gel&rdquo;, &ldquo;geli&rdquo; etc. &ndash; and in the future tense &ldquo;ba&rdquo; is used. So Western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta differs from Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta only in the present tense. These specialities have to be studied carefully if one wants to acquire knowledge of intonation and philology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The average longevity of a script is 2000 years and the average longevity of a language is 1000 years. After this period they undergo metamorphosis. Vedic and Sam&#x301;skrta are not the same languages. The language of the Aryans is Vedic Sam&#x301;skrta, or rather Rg Vedic Sam&#x301;skrta. Sam&#x301;skrta is of Indian origin. &ldquo;Aham,&rdquo; &ldquo;a&#x301;vam&rdquo; and &ldquo;vayam&#x301;&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta are &ldquo;mam,&rdquo; &ldquo;asma&#x301;kam&rdquo; and &ldquo;nah&rdquo; respectively in Vedic. &ldquo;Mam,&rdquo; &ldquo;asma&#x301;kam&rdquo; and &ldquo;nah&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta are &ldquo;me,&rdquo; &ldquo;no&rdquo; and &ldquo;nah&rdquo; in Vedic. The translation of, &ldquo;This is my house&rdquo; into Sam&#x301;skrta is, &ldquo;Idam&#x301; asma&#x301;kam&#x301; grham asti.&rdquo; In Vedic it is, &ldquo;Yetad nah dhama.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is my house&rdquo; is &ldquo;Tad asmakam&#x301; grham asti&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta, &ldquo;Tad nah dham&rdquo; in Vedic Sam&#x301;skrta and &ldquo;T&#x301;ad nas dham&rdquo; in Russian. Russian has a close proximity with the Vedic language. Due to spatial, temporal and personal factors some changes took place in the Vedic language. The five languages of South India abound in Vedic Sam&#x301;skrta, even though they were not of Sam&#x301;skrta origin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->South Indian languages are of Austrico-Negroid origin, but the scripts are of the Indo-Aryan group (that is, &ldquo;ka,&rdquo; &ldquo;kha,&rdquo; &ldquo;ga,&rdquo; &ldquo;gha,&rdquo; etc.) Examples are Telegu and Kannada, which contain about 80% Sam&#x301;skrta words. Although ethnically Tibetans are Mongoloids of Indo-Tibetan origin, their script is Indo-Aryan. That is, the same script is used in Kinnaur and Ladakh. Multa&#x301;ni is a blending of Punjabi and Sindhi which evolved about 3000 years ago; Pahari Punjabi, which uses &ldquo;da,&rdquo; &ldquo;dii,&rdquo; and &ldquo;de&rdquo; in the possessive case; and Marwari, which uses &ldquo;ra&#x301;,&rdquo; &ldquo;rii&rdquo; and &ldquo;re.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The seven peoples&#146; languages of India are known as Pra&#x301;krta. In eastern India the spoken language was Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. (In the past India was comprised of several countries and Magadh was one of them). The speciality of Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta is that in pronunciation instead of three &ldquo;sa&rdquo; &ndash; that is, &ldquo;sha,&rdquo; &ldquo;sa&rdquo; and &ldquo;s&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; only one &ldquo;sa&rdquo; &ndash; that is, &ldquo;sa&rdquo; &ndash; is pronounced. In central northern India the peoples&#146; language was Shaurasenii Pra&#x301;krta. Shu&#x301;rasena was the country between the Ganga and the Jamuna &ndash; it was known as &ldquo;Brahmavarta&rdquo; in ancient times. During the time of the Mahabharata it was called &ldquo;Shu&#x301;rasena&rdquo; and Mathura was the capital. During the Pathan and Mughal periods, it was called &ldquo;Doa&#x301;b&rdquo; or &ldquo;the land between two rivers.&rdquo; In the west of Shaurasenii, Paesha&#x301;chii Pra&#x301;krta was spoken and in the west of Paesha&#x301;chii, Pa&#x301;shcha&#x301;tya Pra&#x301;krta was spoken. In Sind and Baluchistan, Saendhavii was the language of the people. In the west of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, it was Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta. In Mahara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra, Goa and parts of Karnataka, Mahara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rii Pra&#x301;krta was spoken. The Pra&#x301;krta languages were &ldquo;petticoat languages,&rdquo; that is, they were the languages of the kitchen. The Pra&#x301;krta languages underwent further transmutation. From Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta came Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii and Western Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii. From Western DemiMa&#x301;gadhii Chattisgarhii, Nagpuria, Bhojpurii and Magahii evolved, and from Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii Asamia, Bengali, Angika, Maethilii and Oriya evolved. All these nine languages come from Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. Buddha&#x301; spoke in Pa&#x301;li, that is, Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. &ldquo;Palli&rdquo; means &ldquo;village&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pali&rdquo; means &ldquo;language of the village&rdquo;. From Shaurasenii came Avadhii, Bundelii, Baghelii, Brajabhas&#x301;a and Hariya&#x301;navii. From Hariya&#x301;navii (which had Persian and Turkish vocabulary) came Urdu, the language of people who wear &ldquo;vardii&rdquo; or military dress. From Paeshachii Pra&#x301;krta came Multa&#x301;ni, Eastern Punjabi, Western Punjabi, Pahar&#x301;ii (Sirmaurii &ndash; a dialect of Nahan) and Dogrii. From Pa&#x301;shcha&#x301;tya came Pashto, Afghanii, Peshavarii, Kashmirii, Tazakii, Kurdis and the languages of South Russia. From Saendhavii Pra&#x301;krta came Sindhi, Kacchi, Bahici and Brulii. The last two are Dravidian and not Indo-Aryan languages. Several languages emerged from Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta in the east and were spoken in Bhopal, Vidisha and nearby places, Gujrati and Kathiavari or Saurashtri. To the western side Marwarii, Mewar&#x301;ii, Harautii, Dhudha&#x301;rii and Mewati were spoken. From Maha&#x301;ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rii Pra&#x301;krta came Varad&#x301;i, spoken in Vidarbha, and Debastha Merathi, spoken in Pune and Konkon. In Paesha&#x301;chii Pra&#x301;krta the use of diphthong is rare. In Pa&#x301;shcha&#x301;tya, as in &ldquo;Padam Pos&#x301;a&rdquo;, diphthongs are occasionally found. Kulu is a blending of Pahar&#x301;ii Punjabi and eastern Dogrii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->I once said that all the languages of this universe are mine, but you know only 5,7 or 10 of them. Suppression of the mother tongue is suppression of human sentiment and suppression of human expression. Such a thing is not only bad, it is nasty!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The Scripts of India<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In ancient times there were two scripts in India &ndash; Brahmi and Kharas&#x301;ti. These two scripts have been found on goat hides from the time of the first Muslim king. They date to pre-Muslim times, making them at least 1500 years old. Brahmi was written from right to left and Khara&#x301;sti from left to right. Late Kharas&#x301;ti died and Brahmi bifurcated into two scripts &ndash; Sha&#x301;rda&#x301;, the script of the people northwest of Prayag (Allahabad), and Na&#x301;rada, which was used in the southwest. These scripts were written from left to right like English. Prayag was the meeting point of Sha&#x301;rda&#x301; and Na&#x301;rada. A third script developed and was known as Kutila&#x301; script. Since it was developed in Kausambii, it was also known as Kausambii script. It was also known as Sriharsh script since the seal of Sriharsh was written in this script. It was popular in the east of Allahabad.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;rada script was also known as Na&#x301;garii script due to the domination of Na&#x301;gar Brahmins. After the Gupta period, the influence of Ka&#x301;nyakubja Brahmins declined and that of the Na&#x301;gar Brahmins increased, hence Na&#x301;rada began to dominate Kutila&#x301; script. Previously, the scholars of Kashi wrote in Kutila&#x301; script, but later, due to the influence of the Na&#x301;gar Brahmins, Kutila&#x301; disappeared and Na&#x301;grii took its position. Kutila&#x301; used to be the script of the entire eastern portion of India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Ancient ta&#x301;mralipi, or inscriptions written on copper, and shila&#x301;lekha, or edicts written on stone slabs, have been found in Kutila&#x301; script from the time of Harshvardhan when Kutila&#x301; dominated. Na&#x301;grii came after the Gupta period. During the Mughal period the Kayasthas wrote their official records in a distorted form of Na&#x301;grii. Since the Kayasthas wrote in this script, it came to be known as Kayathii. It was popular in east Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Bhojpurii was written in this script. Of course, the official language of the Mughals was Urdu. There is no diphthong (yuktakshara) in Kayathii, which was used in the courts during the British period. Kayathii has a close proximity to Gujrati script, which used to be found over 70-80 years ago. When the United Provinces of Agra and Avadha was consolidated after the merger of Agra, Avadh and Ruhelkhand, Kayathi disappeared from the courts and Urdu took its place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The Sa&#x301;rada or Sa&#x301;rasvata script had three branches &ndash; Kashmirii Sa&#x301;rada, used in Kashmir; Dogrii Sa&#x301;rada, used in Dvigarta; and Punjabi Sa&#x301;rada, used in Saptasindhu. Later Urdu was accepted in the Punjab and the Sikh Guru Arjuna Deva developed Guru-mukhi script, however Persian script was more popular. Punjabi contains more Tadbhava Sam&#x301;skrta words which cannot be written properly in Persian script, so in Punjabi school and station are &ldquo;sakool&rdquo; and &ldquo;sateshan&rdquo; respectively. Later Landei script developed as a distortion of Punjabi Sa&#x301;rada and the shopkeepers of the Punjab and Sind would write in it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Ranabir Singh wanted to popularize Dogrii script in Jammu and Kashmir, which was a Hindu theocratic state. At that time only Brahmins and Sandhivigra&#x301;hks (Kayasthas) could be government ministers in Hindu theocratic states. Such a system, however, is not proper, as the state is for all citizens equally. The Brahmins in Jammu and Kashmir favoured Kashmirii Sa&#x301;rada and were more familiar with Persian script, and due to their influence Dogrii script was not accepted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Assamese and Bengali horoscopes and books were both written in Sriharsh script, while in Mithila horoscopes were written in Sriharsh and books in Na&#x301;grii. In Kashmir, horoscopes were written in Sa&#x301;rada. In the Punjab, during ancient times, horoscopes and books were written in Punjabi Sa&#x301;rada, that is, Saptasindhu Sa&#x301;rada, while today horoscopes are written in Punjabi Sa&#x301;rada and books in Gurumukhi script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Oriya script used to be written on palm leaves with iron pens. To avoid tearing the leaves, it was written in rounded letters. Bengali, however, was written in angular letters. But on shila&#x301;lekha, or edicts written on stone slabs, both scripts are written in an angular style because stone is not easily damaged. Oriya was written in Sriharsh script in circular style or Utkal style, and Sriharsh script was written in angular style or Gauriiya style.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;rada denotes intellect or intellectuality. The script used by the intellectuals of Kashmir was called Sa&#x301;rada script. When the Vedas were first composed, they were passed down from guru to disciple through memorization because script had not yet been invented and so no written record of them could be made. The Vedas are also called &ldquo;Shruti.&rdquo; (During the time of the Rg Veda there was no script). It became a dogma not to write down the Vedas, and a great portion of the Vedas were lost due to this dogma. Out of nearly 100 Rks, most were lost. Despite this the scholars of Kashmir were the first ones to write the Vedas down, and they wrote them in Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script. They wrote the Atharva Veda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;rada was the script used in the southwest of Allahabad up to the Gulf of Kachh, north of Bombay. It was invented by the Na&#x301;gar Brahmins of Gujarat, therefore it is also called Na&#x301;grii script. Na&#x301;grii script derived its name from the Na&#x301;gar Brahmins. These Brahmins started writing Sam&#x301;skrta, that is, Devbha&#x301;sa, in Na&#x301;grii, so this script was called Devana&#x301;garii. Thus Devana&#x301;garii script came from Gujarat and not from Uttar Pradesh. Gujaratii is written in a simple way without a line over the letters. When Sam&#x301;skrta was written in this script, lines were also drawn over the letters. This script came to be known as Devana&#x301;garii script, a specific type of Na&#x301;grii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Kutila&#x301; is the script used in the east of Allahabad. Since complicated diphthongs were used in this script, it was called &ldquo;Kutila&#x301;&rdquo;. Kutila&#x301; means &ldquo;complicated&rdquo;. During the days of King Ashoka, Kutila&#x301; was the popular script but stone edicts were written in Brahmi script. After the Gupta period and up to the Pathan invasion of India, the influence of Ka&#x301;nyakubja and Saryupa&#x301;riin Brahmins decreased and their position was taken over by the Nagar Brahmins of Gujarat. Na&#x301;gar Brahmins were dominant in Varanasi. Consequently, Kutila&#x301; became less dominant and Devana&#x301;garii took over its position. Varanasi accepted Devana&#x301;garii as its script. Some British scholars learnt Sam&#x301;skrta in Devana&#x301;garii when the British came to India. The German scholar Max Mueller also used Devana&#x301;garii script for writing Sam&#x301;skrta. Devana&#x301;garii became the script of Sam&#x301;skrta in this area, though Sam&#x301;skrta has no special script of its own. It is written in several scripts. Paesha&#x301;chii and Pas&#x301;hca&#x301;tya Pra&#x301;krta abounded in Tadbhava or distorted Sam&#x301;skrta words. In ancient times human beings wandered like nomads and gypsies. Later they settled down permanently in villages. In Vedic Sam&#x301;skrta the word &ldquo;anna&rdquo; is used for staple food and &ldquo;pind&#x301;a&rdquo; for any food. The place where people took food was known as pinda + ik = pindiik. In Paesha&#x301;chii Pra&#x301;krta it became pin&#x301;d&#x301;a. Today in Punjabi pinda means &ldquo;village.&rdquo; Punjabi contains a lot of Tadbhava Sam&#x301;skrta words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->There are three scripts in Bhojpurii: Na&#x301;grii script is used in the west of Allahabad. Max Mueller wrote the Vedas in Na&#x301;grii script which came to be known as Devana&#x301;garii 800 years ago. Sa&#x301;rada script is used in the northwest of Allahabad and is 1300 years old. Kutila&#x301; script is used in the east of Allahabad. It is the script for Oriya, Bengali, Bhojpurii, Maethilii, Angika etc. Bengali is 1100 years old.<!-- /block --></p>

Later on Brajabhas&#x301;a emerged from Shaurasenii Pra&#x301;krta, and is spoken in the west of Allahabad. Raskhan (a Muslim poet), Rahim and Surdas were the poets of Pra&#x301;krta. The Agrawalas of Braja belong to the Braja area and are not Marwaris. The Muslims of Allahabad speak the Avadhi language. Only the Shia&#x301;s speak Urdu.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The languages of the entire world have been divided into several categories. Some of these languages maintain a parallelism with racial and ethnological factors, but this is not always the case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Racial factors in Assam, Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, east of Allahabad, east Madhya Pradesh, south Maharastra, Andhra and South India are not Aryan. In Maharastra there is some influence of the Mediterranean Aryans, but in Bengal there is the blending of Caucasian blood of the Mediterranean sub-race with the Austrico-Negroid-Mongoloid races.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The languages of Assam, Bengal and Orissa all abound in Sam&#x301;skrta vocabulary. The base is not Aryan &ndash; the language is Sam&#x301;skrta. Bengali is 92% Sam&#x301;skrta, Oriya 90% and Malayalam 72%, though the Malayalese do not belong to the Aryan group. Vedic Sam&#x301;skrta is of non-Indian origin, while Sam&#x301;skrta is of Indian origin. An illiterate woman of Bengal may say &ldquo;bina,&rdquo; &ldquo;tele&rdquo; and &ldquo;rendhechi&rdquo; (from randhana) &ndash; all three are Sam&#x301;skrta words. Sam&#x301;skrta is not a foreign language in India, but the Vedic language is different. It is a foreign language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Tibetans are members of the Mongoloid race. The Nipponese sub-group of Japan and all the people in China except those in Tibet, Outer Mongolia and Korea belong to the same race. The Indo-Tibeto-Mongoloids or the people of Bhutan, Sikkim, north of Nepal, north of Udayan (Garhwalii and Kumayunii), Kinnari in Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh near Jammu and Kashmir are also of the same origin &ndash; the Mongoloid race. Indo-Tibetans have a large physical structure and a tall body. The Chinese have a small figure like the Filipinos, Indonesians, Malays, Vietnamese and Thais living in the southern portion of Thailand. The Burmese people are different. They have no single language, just like India. India is a multilingual, multi-national country and so is Burma. Amongst the languages of Burma, Burmese is the most important language. The people of Mizoram, Manipur, Naga hills, and some portion of Meghalaya belong to the Indo-Burmese sub-group of the Mongoloid race. They vary from each other linguistically.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The languages of Burma are different from those of China &ndash; they do not follow the Chinese pictorial script. They use words like &ldquo;ka,&rdquo; &ldquo;kha,&rdquo; &ldquo;ga,&rdquo; etc. The people there utter the mantra &ldquo;Om Mani Padme Hum&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Japan follows the pictorial script of China. Ethnologically and racially the people have maintained a parallelism with China, like the people of Outer Mongolia and Korea. In Bhasa Malaya Sam&#x301;skrta vocabulary is used. The Thai language contains 80% Sam&#x301;skrta vocabulary, while Bengali contains 92% and Oriya 90%. Malayalam, which contains 72% Sam&#x301;skrta vocabulary, stands fourth. The Malayali people do not belong to the Indo-Aryan stock. The forefathers of the Nayars and the Nambooderies of Kerala, were Bengalees. The Gaur Saraswat Brahmins of Maharastra, (like the Senoi, Pai, Patil, etc.) eat fish like the Brahmins of Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The Malaysian and Indonesian languages have a high percentage of Sam&#x301;skrta vocabulary. Although the percentage is less than in the Indian languages, it does not come under 40%. Burmese has 40% to 50% Sam&#x301;skrta, while Chinese has between 2% and 3%.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Chinese has three dialects, but Mandarin is the standard Chinese. In the Philippines words like &ldquo;raja&rdquo; and &ldquo;guru&rdquo; are used. In Thai, a road is called &ldquo;ra&#x301;japatha&rdquo; and a government hospital is called &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;nuku&#x301;la Hospital.&rdquo; There is a hotel in Thailand called the &ldquo;Apsara&#x301; Hotel.&rdquo; &ldquo;Apsara&#x301;&rdquo; is Sam&#x301;skrta for &ldquo;angel.&rdquo; The Indonesian airline is called &ldquo;Garuda Airways.&rdquo; Garuda is Sam&#x301;skrta for a mythological bird. Indonesia is a Muslim country, but since it has been influenced by both the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, an Indonesian king named his son &ldquo;Sukarno.&rdquo; He selected the name &ldquo;Sukarno&rdquo; after Karna in the Mahabharata. According to his understanding, Karna was a great warrior who had certain imperfections. The king wanted his son to emulate Karna&#146;s good attributes but avoid his defects. &ldquo;Sukarno&rdquo; means &ldquo;good Karna.&rdquo; Sukarno married a Japanese girl who was given the name &ldquo;Ratna&#x301;sar&#x301;ii Devii&rdquo; after marriage. Sukarno&#146;s first daughter was called &ldquo;Meghavarna&#x301; Sukarna Putrii&rdquo; because she was born on a rainy night.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Dravidian influence is evident in the southern portion of Bengal, whereas Mongolian influence is evident in the northern portion. But, in general we can say that Bengali contains a greater percentage of Sam&#x301;skrta words than any other language in the world. Amongst the Caucasian languages, certain languages like Russian, Polish, Czech and Slovak languages have been greatly influenced by Vedic vocabulary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->The Mediterranean countries of Europe have a Latin origin. Original Latin underwent some changes after 1000 years and developed two branches &ndash; Occidental Demi-Latin and Oriental Demi-Latin. From Occidental Demi-Latin came Basque, Spanish and Portuguese, and from Oriental Demi-Latin came Italian and French. Other languages greatly influenced by Latin and Vedic were the languages spoken by the Alpine and Nordic people. Polish and Slovak are of Alpine origin, and they were also greatly influenced by Latin and Vedic. They contain a certain percentage of the Scandinavian languages which are of the Anglo-Saxon group. This group includes the countries of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland. Modern English is a blending of Anglo-Saxon, Normandy French, which was spoken in the northern portion of France, and Latin. French evolved from Oriental Demi-Latin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->To know English properly, people must acquire good knowledge of Latin and Anglo-Saxon terms. Distance is measured by feet, but in Sam&#x301;skrta it is measured by gaja, a longer unit of measurement. Gaja means &ldquo;elephant&rdquo;. In ancient times the measurement was done by hand. Some ten thousand years ago the measurement unit was from the end of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. In Latin foot is called &ldquo;pedas&rdquo;, and from this came &ldquo;pedal.&rdquo; Pedal is also used in the sense of &ldquo;to bicycle&rdquo;. Pedal is the adjective of pedas. The Sam&#x301;skrta word &ldquo;naktram&rdquo; is &ldquo;nocturnal&rdquo; in Latin. In English &ldquo;bloody&rdquo; has two meanings &ndash; one is used in a negative sense. In Latin the term for bloody is &ldquo;sanguinea&rdquo; and its adjective is &ldquo;sanguinary.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->English vocabulary abounds in Nordic, Alpine and original Normandic words. English is a blended language and it has two sets of pronunciation &ndash; the Latinic style of pronunciation and the Nordic or Anglo-Saxon style of pronunciation. For example, The English word &ldquo;knife&rdquo; came from the French word &ldquo;kanif.&rdquo; In English &ldquo;knife&rdquo; is pronounced incorrectly when the &ldquo;k&rdquo; is silent. &ldquo;Education&rdquo; in Latinic style is pronounced &ldquo;ajukation&rdquo; and in Anglo-Saxon style &ldquo;ejucation.&rdquo; In the same way &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; is pronounced differently.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->In Africa, languages differ according to climatic conditions and river basins. Several Negroid tongues originated in the south of the Sahara, and altogether there are 27 dialects. In the north of the Sahara the original language was Egyptian. When the Arabs conquered Egypt, the language was influenced by Arabic, and dialects and sub-dialects developed. From Morocco to Iran and from Lebanon to Yemen Arabic is spoken. The Persian and Afghani languages are very close to Rg Vedic Sam&#x301;skrta. For example, &ldquo;asti&rdquo; is Sam&#x301;skrta and &ldquo;asta&#x301;&rdquo; is Persian; &ldquo;bhra&#x301;tara&rdquo; is Sam&#x301;skrta and &ldquo;biradar&rdquo; is Persian. Persian is the grandchild of Rg Vedic Sam&#x301;skrta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Later Hebrew and old or later Arabic came from old Hebrew. Later Hebrew died out when the Jews had to leave the Middle East and settle in Europe and the United States of America. A new language, Yiddish, emerged, but now it is virtually extinct. Hebrew became the official language of Israel when the Jews resettled in the Middle East. Hebrew has close proximity with Arabic. For example, the Arabic words Abraham, Yusuf, Yacub and Daub are Ibrahim, Joseph, Jacob and David respectively in Hebrew. Both are semitic languages and both are written from right to left.<!-- /block --></p>
