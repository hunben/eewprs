<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Regarding the Sixteen Points, it was said that a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s or senior persons would see if you were observing them properly or not. Similarly, I gave a directive to all that they should keep watch on one another. No one will exempt anyone else regarding the Sixteen Points.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Here I have to say a special thing. If the conduct of senior persons, or ta&#x301;ttvikas  or a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s or avadhu&#x301;t/ika&#x301;s, goes against the Sixteen Points, then you should take silent action. What is silent  action? Suppose there is an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301; who delivers sermons about the dos and don&#146;ts, and issues different decrees. But suppose he or she does something which merits criticism by society &ndash; suppose, for example, that he or she secretly investigates the caste of the potential marriage partner for his/her son or daughter. If this happens, it will be  the duty of the Aca&#x301;rya or Avadhu&#x301;ta or Ta&#x301;ttvika Board to take suitable action. However, it will take time to initiate the action, because facts, evidence and many other things are needed. Until an action based on facts and evidence is taken, you can take silent action against the party.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is silent action? Suppose there is a complaint against an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301; and you know for sure that it is valid. The Aca&#x301;rya Board may take two months, four months, or a year to make a decision about this a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. But why should you wait that long for the decision? Under such circumstances you should take silent action &ndash; that is, do not accept the person&#146;s a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya-ship. It is a question of human rights, because Aca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t pa&#x301;t&#x301;hayati yah sah a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryah &ndash;  &ldquo;One who teaches through one&#146;s conduct is an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya.&rdquo; If you cannot learn anything from the conduct and behaviour of a certain person, why should you accept that person as an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Let the Boards do their duty. The Boards have their  functions, and the Aca&#x301;rya Board will certainly take the proper action at the proper time. Meanwhile, you take silent action against the offending a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. And what will be the nature of this silent action? You will disavow the person as an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;; you will not accept the person as an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. I [[vest]] this authority in you. I will never seek any explanation from you as to why you have disavowed the person. Human beings will win honour if they exhibit exemplary conduct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Although this is not written down as part of any code of conduct, my considered opinion is that if a person fails to marry, or fails to arrange the marriages of his or her brothers, sisters, sons or daughters, according to the revolutionary-marriage system,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> we will not allow the person to become an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. In this way the door will be closed on their becoming, and enjoying the rights of, a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s. In other words, those who have married according to the revolutionary-marriage system, and those who joined Ananda Marga after their marriages, should arrange the revolutionary marriages of their brothers and sisters. And if their brothers and sisters are already married, then at least they should arrange the revolutionary marriages of their sons and daughters. I think this is a really logical step. There is no place for hypocrites in our organization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Do not indulge in unnecessary criticism of offenders, but immediately take suitable steps, under a certain system, against them. This system should henceforth be called &ldquo;silent action&rdquo;,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> do you agree? Although it is silent action, it will force strict adherence to our principles, and it will put those against whom it is directed to shame. It will always take some time for the Board to pronounce its verdict in a case, because it is not easy to arrive at a verdict.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sincerity is reflected in actions, not in words only. One who displays sincerity in words but not in actions is a hypocrite. You should not tolerate hypocrites, not at all. But do not indulge in criticism. If you criticize too much, that will create internal weaknesses. So carefully abstain from criticism. Instead of criticizing, simply do not accept such persons in practical life. Why? That I have already explained in the definition of a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya, Aca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t pa&#x301;thayati yah sah a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryah &ndash; &ldquo;One who teaches through one&#146;s conduct is an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya.&rdquo; If one&#146;s conduct is not exemplary, he or she is not an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. The verdict of the Board in this regard is not your concern.<!-- /block --></p>
