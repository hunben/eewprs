<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The excellence and subtlety of expansion are inseparable. Brahma is the most expansive entity, the all-pervading existence. His subtlety is unfathomable. Due to subtlety His identity cannot be perceived by the senses. It is not accessible to the extroversial mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The cruder the object, the less its capacity of expansion and vice versa. Thus the degree of expansion and subtlety of liquid is greater than that of solid. The aerial factor is even subtler than liquid. The ethereal factor is the most expansive and subtlest of all the five fundamental factors. That&#146;s why it is not perceptible to the indriyas. It is not possible to determine its size or fathom its subtlety, nor to make any measuring rod for that purpose. This ethereal factor, although one of the five fundamental factors, is almost beyond the scope of human perception (it requires a highly developed human intellect and continuous scientific pursuit for its perception) so how can a common person grasp something which is even more subtle than that?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I have said earlier that the subtler an object the less the capacity of the indriyas to perceive it. As the greatness of expansion depends upon the degree of subtlety of an object, the more expansive an object the more difficult it becomes for the indriyas to perceive it. To grasp such an object requires constant endeavour and a refined intellect. That&#146;s why human beings try to understand subtler objects with the help of their minds. What is beyond the perception of the crude physical organs, the eyes or the ears, can often be perceived with the help of the internal ears or internal eyes, or the introversial mind. Wherever the extroversial mind might work in the internal mind or in the external world, it cannot go beyond the periphery of the ethereal factor and is thereafter forced to return to its own abode.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Human beings are constantly coming in contact with an entity beyond the periphery of the five fundamental factors. That entity is the human mind. Although the mind cannot be perceived by the indriyas, with a little introversion its existence is substantiated without doubt in individual life. However hard a so-called pandit (scholar) may try to convince you through powerful logic that you have no mind, you will not accept it because mind is a natural entity for you. You do not require any logic from any outsider to understand your own mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There is another entity which is even subtler than the mind &ndash; the Cognitive Faculty (Purus&#x301;atattva or Bhahmatattva). Being subtler than the mind, it is beyond the capacity of the mind to grasp it. But in the process of sadhana, when the mind becomes so subtle and expanded that it loses its individual existence, the Supreme Cognitive Factor can be recognized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The rs&#x301;i says,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->While discussing a subtle entity one is continuously reminded of the ethereal factor, the subtlest factor of this perceivable world. That is why people loosely describe Brahma as being &ldquo;like ether&rdquo; or &ldquo;beyond ether&rdquo;. This Supreme Entity who is as subtle as ether (in fact, He is much much subtler than that) is called Aks&#x301;ara because He is not transmuted from the Original Stance. Conversely, the entity or entities which have been transmuted and are undergoing various transmutations are called ks&#x301;ara. Only the Supreme Entity, Parama Puras&#x301;a, is A&#x301;ks&#x301;ra. The various emanations of the Supreme Entity which are subject to constant change are known as devatas (mythological gods or dieties). These devatas or divine emanations lie embedded in the cosmic body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Brahma is the source of infinite energy. Whatever has been created, or is being created, or will be created is a vibrational flow emanating from Him. The seed of all emanations lies embedded in Him. The controlling faculties of the vibrational flows are called devatas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->These devata&#x301;s, or divine emanations, have no absolute or separate identity. The manifestation of this relative universe is caused by their collective expression. The sound created by the vibrational expression of each devata&#x301;, in which its potentiality of expression lies, is called its acoustic root, and the totality of these acoustic roots is called on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra or pran&#x301;ava. Hence on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is the seed of the cosmos.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Those who worship the various deities in pursuit of artha (mundane wealth) and not Parama&#x301;rtha (Supreme wealth) do so because those deities are the controllers of the transient wealth of the universe. Those who worship these deities to attain Brahma will be sadly disappointed for it is impossible to attain the infinite through the worship of the finite. The one who declares that a particular deity is Brahma may have an element of devotion, but must be totally devoid of rationality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Dyotate kriid&#x301;ate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divih<br>Tasma&#x301;ddeva iti proktah stuyate sarvadevataeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So devata&#x301; is a particular vibrational flow whereas Brahma is the ocean of universal flows, the ocean of divine nectar. It is totally unnecessary for a spiritual aspirant to worship any particular deity. The rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;For one who has not realized Brahma, ritualistic worship, the study of the scriptures, religious pilgrimages, charitable activities or scriptural recitation are all meaningless&rdquo;. Such ritualistic observances devoid of cosmic ideation do not deserve to be called anything less than ostentatious public displays, or pretentious demonstrations of intellectual vanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Only that person who remains free from all superstitions and moves towards the Supreme Entity with genuine devotion, and one-pointed ideation on Him, and whose inner soul runs unhindered towards the cosmic soul, attains Him, attains everything in life, and attaining Him gets merged in Him. Merging in the ocean of nectar, one also becomes nectar. Hence the Vedas declare, &ldquo;Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati&rdquo; (one who knows Brahma becomes Brahma).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->This imperishable Parama Brahma is the paramount topic of the Vedas. Many people think that the Vedas only teach the worship of Brahma, but it discusses so many other subjects such as chanda (rhythm), mantra (holy chants), vyakaran&#x301;a (grammar), and a host of other rules and regulations, dos and don&#146;ts. Should we study all the Veda&#146;s teachings? In reply one can only say that one may accept the essence of something without accepting its non-essential aspects. If someone says &ldquo;I eat wood apple&rdquo; it doesn&#146;t mean that he eats its skin, seeds or gum. Similarly to eat a mango does not mean to devour its skin and stone but to eat the essential part discarding the rest. So to accept a scripture means to accept the essence which stands the test of rationality, and to discard the rest. Rational people should never declare that the teachings of the scriptures should be followed blindly. The rs&#x301;i says,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->[The rational words spoken by a child should be given importance, but the irrational utterings of even the creator Brahma&#x301; Himself should be rejected as a straw.]<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[Do not make decisions on the basis of scriptural study. For if your analysis of the scriptures is irrational it may undermine dharma.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The Vedas expound the science of metre, the rules of religious sacrifices and various other observances, describe vows and paraphernalia, and make certain pronouncements about the present, past, and future. They also expound the science of intuitional practice. An intelligent person should reject the inconsequential portion of the Vedas and only accept the important part that is the description of intuitional science (Brahma-vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->According to the Vedas the Supreme Entity (Parama Brahma) is giving expression to this created universe with the help of His immanent principle, His divine Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Shiva, latent in the microcosm, is creating a world of imagination in collaboration with Prakrti. Similarly, the Supreme Entity, in collaboration with His immanent power, continues the cosmic flow of creation, the Macrocosmic conation, from which all microcosmic entities emerge. As microcosms are born out of the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; they are subject to Her spell as long they remain in the microcosmic stance. But the Supreme Entity, the Supreme Witness, is beyond the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; for He is the Lord of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Had He been under Her influence, the secret of salvation from Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; would have eluded Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; who continues this cosmic imagination for the exhaustion of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma&#146;s sams&#x301;karas is subservient to the Supreme Cognitive Faculty of Parama Purus&#x301;a because He is ensconced in the highest state of awareness. The Cosmic Imagination starts as a reactive expression from that supreme state.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;ntu prakrtim&#x301; vidya&#x301;nma&#x301;yinantu maheshvaram<br>Casya&#x301;vayavabhu&#x301;taestu vya&#x301;ptam&#x301; sarvamidam&#x301; jagat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Prakrti are almost synonymous. The etymological meaning of Prakrti is the &ldquo;entity who is creating diversities in the infinite cosmic body&rdquo;. Usually, when the sentient, mutative, and static principles remain in a state of balance, it is called Prakrti, and when balance is lost, due to the dominance of the sentient principle, it is called, Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. But when the balance is lost due to the predominance of the static principle it is called Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. So the rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;In reality Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Prakrti are almost the same. The entity who remains beyond their influence is the Supreme Controller.&rdquo; Both the concept of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are very subtle, too subtle for you to understand with the indriyas. But when (as a result of the combined association of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti) their existence comes down to the psychic level due to the crudifying influence of Prakrti, then your intellect, your subtle power of perception, can perceive their existence. The subtler the object, the less capacity the indriyas have of perceiving it. A subtle mind can only fathom a subtle object like the mind, but nothing subtler.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The crudest manifestation of the Cosmic Mind is the quinquelemental universe. Hence the rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;This vast quinquelemental universe is His physical body&rdquo;. His subtle and causal body and His stance as Purus&#x301;ottama are beyond the scope of perception of the indriyas. Microcosms can never fathom the extreme subtlety of these states of cosmic existence. To bring the vast cosmic body within the scope of perception is beyond the microcosmic capacity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;jagat&rdquo; is derived as gam (root verb) + kvip (suffix) and means &ldquo; a moving entity.&rdquo; Due to the extroversive (Sain&#x32D;cara) and introversive (Pratisain&#x32D;cara) flows of cosmic imagination everything of this universe is in a state of continuous flux. Most of the manifested universe cannot come within the scope of perception of the sense organs and the mind of microcosms. Some part of it can only be realized by the subtler layers of mind and intellect, while the subtlest portion can only be assimilated through deeply universalistic spiritual immersion. Materialistic philosophy does not want to transcend the scope of the crude perceiving mind, and there is no harm if it doesn&#146;t! The nature of an object depends upon the mental outlook of the subject. It is foolish to try to deny the existence of something which is beyond the scope of perception through vain intellectual debate. It is certainly not wise to say that something does not exist simply because it is beyond one&#146;s power of comprehension. If a blind man says that the world is colourless, will it lose its colour? A wise man can only say, &ldquo;I do not understand anything beyond this.&rdquo; So it can safely be declared that a materialistic philosophy is no philosophy because the totality of the universe is not within the scope of its purview.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->He is the Noumenal Cause of the universe. He shines in the various expressions of the fundamental factors. He is the flower, He is the honey, He is the bee. It is only due to the varying degree of influence of the static principle that He manifests Himself in these three different ways. With the help of Prakrti His Macrocosmic bearing is controlling the various manifestation of His own Self. He is playing with Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Whatever may be the apparent differences between one object and another, if one proceeds along the path of synthesis one will ultimately arrive at the Supreme One. Whether you call this entity small or vast, its depths are unfathomable. Countless unit expressions of finitude lie embedded in the singular identity of the ocean. The diverse expressions of this changing universe are embedded in the singular body of the universe and the diverse expressions of the celestial world are embedded in the infinite void. The same vast space you will see both outside and inside your citta. If you analyse the various symbols of the myriad of diversities you will discover that they are all merging in the Supreme Singularity. This is true in the case of the individual and the collectivity. He is the subject, the object and the connecting link &ndash; all in one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->What is the vast play of cosmic imagination? Does it originate from the noumenal causal factor &ndash; the collective creation of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti? Is it not a fact that the causal factor, due to the varying degree of influence of the static principles, is manifesting itself in countless ways? In reality, this causal factor is the Causal Mind of the Supreme Entity, and the countless finite emanations are the minutest expressions of His Citta. All the quinquelemental objects perceived in the universe today had their origin in a previous subtler stage. If we trace these subtler stages back to their original source will finally arrive at the Supreme Causal Factor. Prakrti (which is inconspicuous in Nirgun&#x301; Brahma) lies dormant as a causal factor in the initial stage of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. One who is asleep cannot said to be non-existent. That which is unmanifest is of course unexpressed, but the principle which causes its manifestation cannot be said to be non-existent. It does exist but in a subdued form &ndash; it&#146;s action expression is unsubstantiated, and is this incapable of giving a subjective bearing to Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Suppose a distinguished poet is sleeping. While sleeping is he devoid of poetic genius? No, but at that time the poetic talent remains dormant in a causal stage in his individual mind &ndash; his poetry and his faculty to compose are unexpressed. Since He is not expressing himself as a poet he does not deserve to be called a poet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a, under the influence of Prakrti, manifests the glory of His poetic expression along the path of Sain&#x32D;cara, and finally, in the introversial flow of Pratisain&#x32D;cara, merges Himself in His original stance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The creation of the universe has been continuing to originate from the Cosmic Causal Factor. The first perceptible form that the citta has assumed in the cosmic extroversial flow is the ethereal body. At this stage He doesn&#146;t have any physical body but exists in a virtual abstract form. Yet human beings with the help of the subtler sensory organ (organ of hearing), and by applying certain scientific methods, can assimilate the sound tanma&#x301;tra from the subtler ethereal body to some extent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Thereafter the aerial body is created with the application of a cruder force of Prakrti. The aerial body&#146;s sound tanma&#x301;tra can also be heard by the ears. The ethereal body, while being constantly formed out of His unmanifested cosmic potentialities is also being transmuted into the aerial body, without losing its inseparable association with the Witnessing Faculty. The aerial body is thus a cruder manifestation of His mind. In the further extroversive flow of Macropsychic manifestation, both within and without, there is a ceaseless clash of vital force causing subtlety to become increasingly crude. The intermolecular space decreases giving a concrete form to the Cosmic Mind in its metamorphosed form. The internal and external clashes increase proportionally. In the ethereal factor there is no difference between the internal and external forces, but in the case of the aerial factor there is greater internal clash. Although the molecules in the aerial factor are scattered far from each other there is something external to it &ndash; some external pressure &ndash; which it develops the capacity to resist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The next stage of crudification (resulting from the further crudification of the inter-molecular space) in the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara is the luminous factor. It derives its luminosity from the intense clash of forces. It has an even greater capacity to resist the external factor. We can see the luminous factor in the various celestial bodies of the vast space which, although in most cases are not yet converted into solid or liquid, have assumed a particular shape. In the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara these luminous entities gradually get crudified into the liquid factor. Their intermolecular space further decreases causing greater internal conflict. This internal contraction results in its assuming a particular shape and size and developing an even greater capacity to counteract its exterial forces.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->When the burning celestial bodies begin to condense in the process of Sain&#x32D;cara they are converted into a liquid ocean of fire. This planet earth, after its immediate dissociation from the burning Sun, was in the liquid state for some time. When this liquid factor reaches the nadir point of the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara, its molecules and atoms reach the zenith point of proximity resulting in intense clash within its internal space. Its material flow is perceivable to all the indriyas. And its internal capacity to fight against its opposing forces become tremendous.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The movement in the process of Sain&#x32D;cara takes place due to the increasing influence of tamaguna. The more the cosmic cycle moves through the phase of Sain&#x32D;cara, the more the physical form of objects becomes evident. The greater the action of the internal force, the greater the conflict between the inter-molecular space, and the greater the capacity to assimilate the different tanmatras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The ethereal factor carries only the sound tanmatra. When it is transformed into the aerial factor it acquires the capacity to carry a greater variety of tanmatras (but not a greater quantity of tanmatras). Thus the aerial factor can carry two tanmatras, sound and touch. However, the sound tanmatra it carries is not as subtle as the sound tanmatra carried by the ethereal body. When the same aerial factor is converted into the luminous factor its total capacity for carrying tanmatras remains unaltered, but it acquires the capacity of radiating light and can thus carry the form tanmatra (as well as the sound and touch tanmatras). The sound tanmatra it carries is not as subtle as the aerial factor&#146;s sound tanmatra. As the process of crudification continues there is more internal clash (and less external clash) resulting in the increase of the capacity to carry an even greater number of tanmatras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The force which plays a special role in balancing the interial and exterial forces within the structure is called pra&#x301;n&#x301;a. In this struggle if the opposing exterial forces are dominant the material structure collapses, and we declare it as dead. But actually it doesn&#146;t die, it maintains its existence in the midst of countless forms of the expressed universe.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->When the physical structure vibrates strongly due to the clash of internal forces a certain control must be exercised over the structure to ensure neither explosion nor implosion occurs. Under such circumstances the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a will have to act under its own initiative otherwise it will be difficult to maintain the balance between the two opposing forces. To help the individual structure to maintain a balance between the exterial and interial forces the Cosmic Mind creates a sub-centre or individual mind within that structure. When the life force, due to the complexity of the structure, takes the unit mind as the apparent source of its actual flow, that is called life or vital energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h). Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h is the collection of ten vayus. (That&#146;s why in Sam&#x301;skrta it is always used in the plural number. In modern Indian languages born out of Sam&#x301;skrta we use the word pra&#x301;n&#x301;a in the sense of pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h).

That is, they can regress.]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Those who move forward properly along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara or accelerate their speed through the process of sadhana are true human beings. The further the microcosmic body moves along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara the greater its structural complexity. To cope with this complexity the microcosm, out of its physical structure, evolves a more developed and capable psychic body. That&#146;s why we notice that the greater the complexity of the physical structure, the greater the protoplasmic and glandular complexities and the greater its psychic expansion. With the increasing complexity of the body and mind the human hopes and aspirations, pains and pleasures, sorrows and afflictions also increase. The boss running an office of a huge corporation requires far more psychic power than the boss running the office of a small company, for he has to shoulder greater responsibilities and run greater risks. A person who lacks the requisite psychic capability for his job is demoted. Similarly, if a human being is preoccupied with crude thoughts he will have to be reborn in a crude body for he is not utilizing his full potential. Human beings, the crown of creation, due to their heavy responsibilities, have more qualities than other creatures. The reflection of Consciousness becomes more distinct on a mental plate of a person whose mind is highly expanded. Such a mind overflows with bliss when it receives cosmic inspiration, and with the help of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; develops a greater power to realize the Supreme Entity. The day one gets the Supreme attainment marks the end of the Pratisain&#x32D;cara phase of the cosmic cycle for that particular microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->But not all physical entities are converted into Consciousness. Where the vital energy and mind are not developed the entity will have to follow the path of stagnation and can only be established in Consciousness after arousing the vital energy and mind. If it fails to do that, its physical structure will be controlled by the Cosmic Will. Undeveloped physical structures do not try to direct their self will against the natural forces, but human beings, due to the greater complexities of their physical structure, and the greater development of the energy and the mind, challenge the natural forces and sometimes, with the help of their developed vital energy and psychic power, can overpower them in both individual and collective spheres. If matter guided by energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;a) can be called Union Territories (such as Goa and Pondicherry) then the living sub-human creatures together with their vital energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;ah) can be called Indirectly Centrally Administered Areas whose budget is passed by the government; and the living beings endowed with more developed minds and lives can be compared to A-class States (such as India). Normally Direct Union Territories are considered part of the federal state and their civil servants are considered as the employees of that central government. However, under certain circumstances, these employees are accorded different rights and responsibilities. This is the same in the cosmic world too: inanimate matter, sub-human creatures, and human beings have their respective rights and responsibilities. The present state of Bihar is a part of India. The government of Bihar is a part of the Indian government, yet the praise and criticism for or against the government of Bihar does not directly concern the government of India. The government of Bihar will have to plan according to its own state exchequer not the central government&#146;s.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->The same thing applies to human beings with developed minds. When life evolves from matter the Macrocosmic Mind helps in the evolution of the human mind. But when that composite structure increases in complexity in the phase of Pratisain&#x32D;cara, guided by cosmic imagination, its mental capacity increases and proportionately it is accorded greater rights and responsibilities. When the unit mind takes responsibility for the authorship of action it must also take responsibility for the consequent praise or criticism. If the government of Bihar finds itself helpless in certain circumstances it can surrender it&#146;s entire burden to the central government. Similarly, the unit mind can relinquish its authorship and surrendering all its rights and responsibilities to the Supreme Entity, can become one with that Entity by merging the unit mind in the Supreme Mind. But when inanimate matter does not follow the path of living beings, [[it]] follows the path of stagnation. When unicellular beings moving along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara come in contact with other living beings they evolve into multicellular creatures. Through the same process these multicellular creatures can increase their multicellular complexities. When the intensity of the internal struggle increases the psychic body has to become stronger according to the intensity of the struggle. No matter how powerful a creature may be, if its physical complexities are less, its psychic and spiritual complexities will be proportionately less. That&#146;s why the mighty elephant and rhinoceros have to suffer the fate of being the slaves of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->As the psychic realm of a unit being develops its capacity for self expression gradually increases enabling it to struggle against obstacles and move towards a brilliant future. Human beings, due to their greater control over their propensities, try to express their desires and ambitions after due deliberation. But an undeveloped creature rushes immediately towards any object it sees which excites its greed. Human beings do not act like that, of course &ndash; they control their instinct of greed through proper and rational discrimination. And this discrimination is the result of psychic expansion which itself is the result of the reflection of the Supreme Consciousness on the unit mental plate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Thus humans reach higher stages of psychic expansion as they advance on the path leading to the attainment of the Supreme Entity. This expansion causes them to become established in the subtler world of cognition. Finally one glorious day they will either attain liberation by merging their individual minds in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma or salvation by merging their existential feeling in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. But if they remain preoccupied with petty thoughts they will be converted into sub-human creatures or even into the crude fundamental factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Thus there are three paths open to human beings: salvation (moks&#x301;a), liberation (mukti), and complete crudification. When the five fundamental factors do not get the scope of acquiring a mind in a physical structure they move towards even more crudity &ndash; the solid becoming more solid; the liquid becoming solid; the luminous becoming liquid and ultimately solid; the aerial factor becoming luminous then liquid, then solid; and the ethereal factor becoming aerial, then luminous, then liquid, then solid. As a result of the continuous crudification of the fundamental factors the physical structure becomes more condensed. This path of crudification is the path of degeneration. All the perceptible physical objects of the world are composed of the five fundamental factors. If the subtle factors within them crudify that is are converted into solid one day due to extreme condensation, their existence will go beyond the sense of perception, becoming extremely small. This process of contraction increases the internal clash within the material structure. When the internal clash becomes so intense that the structure can no longer maintain it&#146;s structural solidarity it is called jad&#x301;asphota. Jad&#x301;asphota converts all the fundamental factors into the ethereal factor, from which they again move within the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara evolving once more to their solid base where they again get the scope to become a living structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->On one branch of the evolutionary tree the solid structure develops a crude mind and evolves as a unit being.

<a name="53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Take the case of this planet earth which is composed of the five fundamental factors.

But when, due to the crudifying influence of Sain&#x32D;cara, the earth&#146;s environment will become uncongenial for habitation, unit beings will not get any further scope to advance along the path of liberation. Under these circumstances the planet and its atmosphere will gradually get condensed. It will become so small that it will become unrecognizable as a planet. When its internal factor reaches the nadir point of crudity it will appear to be non-existent outwardly. At this stage it will experience jad&#x301;asphota causing an immense explosion. That tremendous energy release converts the solid body into the ethereal factor. The celestial bodies of the universe which are unfit for human habitation are all moving through the process of jad&#x301;asphota and are hurtling towards a catastrophic explosion. This is the inevitable fate of each and every celestial body. But it is possible to increase longevity of a particular planet with the assistance of a highly powerful celestial body such as a comet or nebula.<!-- /block --></p>

The rhythm in which the vibrational flow of the cosmic mind vibrates the annama&#x301;ya kos&#x301;a of individual microcosms &ndash; veins, nerves, arteries, blood, lymph, etc. &ndash; is the initial stage of the divine cosmic sound. When this sound is heard in the anama&#x301;ya kos&#x301;a it resembles that of a cricket. When this cosmic sound vibrates the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a it resembles the sound of ankle bells. In the manomaya kos&#x301;a it resembles a flute (the mystic sadhakas of the Vaesnava cult describe it as the sound of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s flute); in atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a, the resonance of a gong; in vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a the buzzing of bees or the rolling of ocean waves; and in hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a, a prolonged on&#x32D;m&#x301; sound. Thus the cosmic sound is expressed in various ways according to the degrees of crudity or subtlety in relation to the fundamental factors. There are various physical and psychic expressions centring around the various degrees of cosmic sound. When one&#146;s mind is confined to a particular stratum one hears the sound peculiar to that stratum only. A person who lacks concentration of mind cannot hear any expression of the cosmic sound. In the field of spiritual practice the divine sound is expressed in a spontaneous way. When the existential awareness of living beings becomes concentrated with the cognitive bearing, it is not attracted to any sort of sound.
