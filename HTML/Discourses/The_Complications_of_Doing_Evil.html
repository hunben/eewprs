<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Doing what a human being should not do is pa&#x301;pa, and not doing what a human being should do is pratyava&#x301;ya. Pa&#x301;taka includes both pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya. You should not steal, and, if you do, you commit pa&#x301;pa. You should assist a helpless person, and, if you do not, you commit pratyava&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;pa seems good as long as we do not get the reaction of our pa&#x301;pa. Have you seen a washerman washing clothes in an Indian town? He lifts the clothes he is washing high up in the air, and the clothes think they are moving up and feel elated. But they do not realize that the higher they are raised, the harder they are hit against the washing stone. The persons who commit pa&#x301;pa are like those clothes who think that they are having a nice time and are moving up. They enjoy themselves in pa&#x301;pa. But when they suffer the reaction of pa&#x301;pa, they find themselves in misery, like the clothes they get beaten on the stone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There is a difference between &ldquo;svaccha&rdquo; and &ldquo;bhadra.&rdquo; Svaccha means good or clean; for example, the water is svaccha (clean). Bhadra means internally and externally good. Bhadra persons are very cautious before doing anything. They think what the reaction of their action would be. They do good and keep doing good, even if they do not immediately obtain the good reaction of their benevolent deeds. They do not mind suffering till they start getting the good reactions of their good deeds. And once the reactions of their good deeds begin, then there is bliss and only bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->While doing evil, people may enjoy themselves. But when they start reaping the reactions of their evil deeds, there is only misery. A dishonest person travels without a ticket in a first class compartment. He wants to cheat the railways and have fun. But an honest person will buy a second class ticket and may travel in great discomfort. The dishonest person has fun, but only for some time. The ticket checking squad comes and fines him or arrests him. He has to hang his head in shame. But the honest man (though poor) reaches his destination honourably. The dishonest person has misery in the end. The honest person lives a clean life and remains happy with what he has. The dishonest man accepts bribes and indulges in various corrupt practices. He does not pay his income tax and builds a palace for himself. But one day the income tax officials raid his house and prosecute him for tax evasion and amassing ill-gotten wealth. He lands in jail.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So, before you commit any pa&#x301;pa, you should think about its adverse reaction, immediate or subsequent. In good action, there may be some pain, but the reaction will always be beneficent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Do good. But do not be arrogant and vainglorious. Arrogance and false pride can ruin Ananda Marga.<!-- /block --></p>
