<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;ottama is the nucleus of this Cosmological system. In the atomic system, there is a nucleus, and so many electrons are moving around the nucleus. Similarly, in our global system, the earth is the nucleus, and the moon is moving round the earth; in the solar system, the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving round it. In the Cosmological system, Purus&#x301;ottama is the nucleus, and so many objects are moving round It, so many solar systems are moving round that Nucleus. But there is a speciality of this Cosmological flow. In other systems, that is, in smaller systems, movement is in the realm of physicality, but, in the case of the Cosmological nucleus, the movement is not only in the physical status but also in the psychic stratum. That is, all are also moving round Him mentally &ndash; knowingly or unknowingly. Those who move round Him knowingly &ndash; dancing round Him knowingly &ndash; are fortunate, are very lucky. Others are moving round Him unknowingly, and, with all their movement, sometimes they, unknowingly, unconsciously by their crude objectivity increase their radius. Sometimes they decrease their radius. When, because of lack of knowledge, the radius is increased, they feel sorrow, and when that radius decreases they get pleasure. So this is the speciality of the Cosmological Nucleus. In other nuclei, in the case of other nuclei, the movement is just physical. Everybody should always remember that each and every mental creation, each and every mental force, is moving round that Supreme Nucleus. You should have subjective approach and objective adjustment. Dharmacakra is subjective approach. He is the Supreme subject; all others are his objects. When the sensory organs and motor organs are the objects, your mind is the subject. When mind is the object, your a&#x301;tman is the subject. And when a&#x301;tman is the object, Parama&#x301;tman is the subject. So, Paramat&#x301;man is the Supreme Subjectivity. And the supra-mental world &ndash; atima&#x301;nas kos&#x301;a of Brahma &ndash; is the crudest objectivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Where there is knowledge, but no devotion, there such people try to establish their speciality. And, as this endeavour to establish one&#146;s speciality becomes more important than finding the Supreme, people fail to find the Supreme Veracity.<!-- /block --></p>
