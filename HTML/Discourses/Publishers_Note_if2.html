<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->During His lifetime, P.R. Sarkar made an immense contribution to a vast range of subjects including spirituality, ethics, literature, music, philology, psychology, science, socio-economic theory and philosophy. He also gave numerous talks on all aspects of farming from the end of 1987 until His Maha&#x301;praya&#x301;na or Great Departure on 21st October 1990.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->P.R. Sarkar was especially keen that underdeveloped and developing countries should adopt a more scientific system of farming to increase their productivity and solve their food problems. To demonstrate His ideas, He established and built up A&#x301;nanda Nagar as a model farming project in the Purulia district of West Bengal, one of the poorest and most backward parts of India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;c. Asiima&#x301;nanda Avt., a senior monk of Ananda Marga and an agricultural specialist, faithfully noted down many of P.R. Sarkar&#146;s talks on farming. But tragically, he was brutally murdered by members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on 2nd April 1990 at A&#x301;nanda Nagar. Due to his untimely death, he was unable to personally oversee the publication of this book, the second part of P.R. Sarkar&#146;s series called &ldquo;Ideal Farming&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->We have made every effort to accurately compile P.R. Sarkar&#146;s talks on farming as noted by A&#x301;c. Asiima&#x301;nanda Avt. and present them to our readers.<!-- /block --></p>
