<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The meaning is: &ldquo;<I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> knows everything.&rdquo; <I>Evedam&#x301; sarvam&#x301; ja&#x301;na&#x301;ti sarvam&#x301; eva</I> &ndash; &ldquo;He knows everything;&rdquo; <I>yadbhu&#x301;tam&#x301;</I> &ndash; &ldquo;whatever has been&rdquo;; <I>yacca bhavyam</I> &ndash; &ldquo;whatever will be&rdquo;; <I>uta&#x301;mrtasyesha&#x301;no</I> &ndash; &ldquo;He is the master of both heaven and hell;&rdquo; <I>yadanye na&#x301;tirohati</I> &ndash; &ldquo;no one is His master.&rdquo; This is the literal meaning of the <I>shloka</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This <I>shloka</I> is a <I>rk</I> from the <I>Rgveda</I>&#146;s tenth <I>man&#x301;d&#x301;ala</I>, <I>purus&#x301;a su&#x301;kta</I>. This reminds me of something. If a <I>shloka</I> is from the <I>Rgveda</I> then it is called a <I>rk</I> rather than a <I>shloka</I>. This is a convention of the <I>Rgveda</I>. The singular is <I>rk</I> and the plural is <I>rca&#x301;</I>. Some mistakenly pluralize <I>rca&#x301;</I> and say <I>rca&#x301;yen&#x32D;</I> [in Hindi], but <I>rca&#x301;</I> is already a word with a plural ending. For example, many people pluralize the word <I>santa</I> and say <I>santon&#x32D;</I> [in Hindi]. This is incorrect because the word <I>santa</I> is itself plural. <I>Santon&#x32D;</I> means &ldquo;honest individuals&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the <I>shloka</I> it is said that <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> knows everything. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> knows what has happened in the past, what is happening in the present and what will happen in the future. What does <I>Purus&#x301;a</I> mean? <I>Pure shete yah</I>, or <I>purasi shete yah sah Purus&#x301;a</I>, that is, he who is lying in the <I>pura</I> [city] of the body and observing everything is <I>Purus&#x301;a</I>. He is seeing everything but doing nothing. The second meaning is &ldquo;he who is lying in front&rdquo;, for example, <I>purasi hitam&#x301; karoti yah sah purohitah</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><I>Yadbhu&#x301;tam&#x301; yacca bhavyam</I>. The meaning of <I>purus&#x301;a</I> knowing everything is that whatever has been or will be is inside of him, not outside. Nothing exists outside him. Momentum comes from him. In the <I>rk</I> there is no mention whatsoever of the present. Now the question may arise: Does <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> only know the past and the future, and not the present? Here nothing is said about the present because actually there is no such thing as the present. For example, no one hears the words I am saying at this moment; they hear them slightly afterwards. When someone hears my words they are present for that person but for me they are in the past. We call something present when we are not aware of it being past or future, that is, we combine the two into one. What do we do then? We take a little chunk of the past and a little chunk of the future, join them together, and make the present. In actual fact this is not the present. There is no such thing as the present. For this reason there is no mention of the present in this <I>rk</I>. <I>Yadbhu&#x301;tam&#x301; yacca bhavyam</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><I>Uta&#x301;mrtasyesha&#x301;no</I>. <I>Uta</I> means &ldquo;hell&rdquo;. <I>Tala, atala, tala&#x301;tala, pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, atipa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, rasa&#x301;tala</I> &ndash; <I></I>these are the different levels of hell. <I>Rasa&#x301;tala</I> is the lowest of them all. When a person has become completely degenerate then people say about them that they have gone to <I>rasa&#x301;tala</I>. Just as there are seven levels in the downward direction, there are also seven levels in the upward direction &ndash; <I>bhu&#x301;h, bhuvah, svah, mahah, janah, tapah</I>, and <I>satya</I>. Among these seven worlds, <I>svah</I> is heaven. And down below, the <I>pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la</I>, the imaginary <I>pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la</I>, is called hell. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the master of heaven and He is also the master of hell. People want to be saved from hell. He who is the master of the mortal world is also present in hell. This is a complex question. In the same way, the immortal world is also arranged in seven levels &ndash; <I>bhu&#x301;h, bhuvah, svah, mahah, janah, tapah</I>, and <I>satya</I> <I>(vya&#x301;hrti: vi &ndash; a&#x301; &ndash; hr + ktin)</I>. <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the master of both heaven and hell. Now the thing is that these seven lower levels are not spatial entities. In the Vedas all these levels have been described: <I>Asu&#x301;rya&#x301;h na&#x301;ma te loka&#x301;h andhena tamasa&#x301;vrta&#x301;h</I> &ndash; &ldquo;Hell is the <I>asu&#x301;rya</I> world, that is, where the light of <I>su&#x301;rya</I> [sun] <I></I>cannot enter, that which remains always covered in profound darkness.&rdquo; It is where the darkness is so dense, so deep, that a person cannot even see himself. That kind of darkness is called <I>andhatamisra&#x301;</I>. And when a person cannot see someone else, then it is called <I>andhaka&#x301;r</I>. What is hell like? It is where there is no sun, that which is covered in <I>andhatamisra&#x301;</I>. That person who does not do spiritual practices moves in the direction of this world of darkness. This is the correct meaning of this <I>shloka</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><I>Uta</I> means &ldquo;hell&rdquo;, that is, the world of darkness. This world of darkness is arranged in six layers &ndash; <I>tamah, tamasa&#x301;, tamisra&#x301;, andhatamah, andhatamisra&#x301;</I>, and <I>andhatamasa&#x301;</I>. In the Upanis&#x301;ad it is said: <I>ta&#x301;m&#x301;ste pretya&#x301;bhigacchanti yeke ca&#x301;tmahano jana&#x301;h</I> [to which all will go who deny their own souls]. That world of darkness is called the <I>asu&#x301;rya</I> world. It is depicted as if from within that deep darkness even more darkness is vomited up. If one looks towards that deep darkness then it seems, as if, even a deeper darkness is tearing the heart of that darkness and coming out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now the question arises: whose movement is towards that darkness? It is the movement of that person or those persons who do not perform spiritual practices. <I>Ta&#x301;m&#x301;ste pretya&#x301;bhigacchanti</I>. Now <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is present even in this world shrouded in profound darkness. Here the purport of the <I>shloka</I> is that since <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the master of both heaven and hell, He also has to go to hell from time to time to supervise or look after things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><I>Tama&#x301;huragryam&#x301; purus&#x301;am&#x301; maha&#x301;ntam</I>. So this <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is all-pervading, moving everywhere. He is present in the so-called heaven and in the world of darkness where the sun does not shine. How will you know Him? You do not even know why you have come to this earth. How will you know where He is hiding and what He is doing? But He knows what you are doing or thinking in secret. When we meditate on <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> we must think that <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is taking me as the object of His cosmic mind; He is seeing me. One should have this kind of thought in one&#146;s mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->For this reason it is said: <I>sa vetti vedyam&#x301; na ca tasya&#x301;sti vetta&#x301; tama&#x301;huragryam&#x301; purus&#x301;am&#x301; maha&#x301;ntam</I>. That <I>Purus&#x301;a</I>, that is, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, is called <I>agryapurus&#x301;a</I> or <I>maha&#x301;n</I>. <I>Agrya</I> means &ldquo;he who remains in the front or the forefront of everything&rdquo;. <I>Agryapurus&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;representative <I>Purus&#x301;a</I>, best <I>Purus&#x301;a</I>, first <I>Purus&#x301;a</I>&rdquo;. What does <I>maha&#x301;n</I> mean? The first person singular of the word <I>mahat</I> is <I>maha&#x301;n</I>. In the Sanskrit language two very important words are <I>brhat</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <I></I>and <I>mahat</I>. What is the fundamental difference between them? Similarly, two very similar words are <I>visha&#x301;la</I> and <I>brhat</I>. That which is very big but which can be measured is <I>visha&#x301;la</I>, for example, the Himalayas. They are nearly fifteen hundred miles in length but in spite of being extremely big they can be measured. We depict the Himalayas in our maps. And that which is so big that it cannot be measured, we call <I>mahat</I>. There is only one such entity that is so big that it cannot be measured, and what is that entity? Brahma. It is said: <I>brhattva&#x301;d brahma brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d brahma</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->So <I>brhat</I> means &ldquo;so big that it cannot be measured&rdquo;. And what does <I>mahat</I> mean? That which is not big in the physical sense but which is big or very big in the psychic sense is <I>mahat</I>. In other words, something which is <I>brhat</I> belongs to the external world, the world of the sense organs which we can see with our eyes, and that which belongs to the mental world, which cannot be perceived in the external world but which exerts a great influence over other things in the psychic sense, we call <I>mahat</I>. Take, for example, a renunciant who is small in stature but who possesses tremendous intellect and understanding. We will not call him or her <I>brhat</I>. Seen externally, he or she is a person of small size. Actually he or she is <I>maha&#x301;n</I>. For this reason, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is called <I>agryapurus&#x301;a</I> or <I>maha&#x301;n purus&#x301;a</I> in the Vedas.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  The <I>ba</I> of <I>brhat</I> is <I>vargiiya</I> <I>ba</I>. Do you know the difference between <I>vargiiya va</I> and <I>antastha va</I>? <I>Vargiiya ba</I> is used in words derived from <I>ba&#x301;la&#x301;, bodha, brhada</I> and <I>bandhana</I>. For example, <I>ba&#x301;la&#x301;, ba&#x301;lak, ba&#x301;lika&#x301;</I>, etc.; <I>bodha, budha, budhi, baoddha, baoddhika</I>, etc.; <I>brhat, brahma, bra&#x301;hma, bra&#x301;hmii, bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a, bra&#x301;hman&#x301;ii</I>, etc.; <I>bandhana, bandhu, ba&#x301;ndhaba, ba&#x301;ndhabii</I>, etc.</p>
