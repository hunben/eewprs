<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->While explaining the inner significance of <I>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava,</I> I was saying one of the names of Sada&#x301;shiva is &ldquo;Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;The King of Dancers.&rdquo; There are so many names, so many attributes, but occult science says He is beyond the periphery of all attributions, beyond the scope of all qualifications.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Why is He beyond the scope of all attributions? There are two reasons. One is that He is the creator of everything, so He is the creator of qualifications also, attributions also. So how can He be within the binding scope of those principles, of those qualifications? And certainly He is beyond the reach of these qualifications. In Sanskrit, qualification or attribution is called <I>gun&#x301;a,</I> and He is called &ldquo;Gun&#x301;a&#x301;tiita&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;beyond the bondage of any <I>gun&#x301;a</I>&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->And there is another reason also, and that is &ndash; suppose a man is an MA in thirty subjects. Still, he cannot be an MA in an infinite number of subjects. Human possibilities have certain limitations. But He is beyond all limitations. So how can one say that He has got this quality or that quality? That&#146;s why He is &ldquo;Gun&#x301;a&#x301;tiita&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Once upon a time some devotees approached one poet, one Sanskrit poet, to get him to write something regarding the qualifications of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. He said, &ldquo;Yes, I&#146;ll write something, I&#146;ll do the duty within a few seconds.&rdquo; Then that poet wrote a <I>shloka</I> in Sanskrit, that is, a poem in Sanskrit. Poems are called <I>shlokas</I> in Sanskrit. And he wrote,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Asita girivara kajjalam&#x301; sindhupa&#x301;tre<br>Surataruvara sha&#x301;kha&#x301; likhanii patra muravii,<br>Likhitva&#x301; yadi grhitva&#x301; sa&#x301;rada&#x301; sarvaka&#x301;lam<br>Tada&#x301;pi tava gun&#x301;ana&#x301;ma iisha pa&#x301;ram&#x301; na ya&#x301;ti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[If the ink tablets were as big as the Himalayan mountains, and the ink pot as large as the oceans; and if one of the branches of the divine tree Pa&#x301;rija&#x301;ta were used as a pen, and if the earth&#146;s lithosphere were used as a sheet of paper; and if Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;, the goddess of learning, agreed to write through all the ages, even then, O Lord, all Your qualities could never be described.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now if we want to write about His qualifications we require ink, we require paper, and we require &ndash; what? We require one writer. To write about His qualifications we require these things, So the poet said, &ldquo;If we get the mighty Himalayas as an ink tablet&rdquo; &ndash; we require ink &ndash; &ldquo;and as an ink pot, all the oceans of the world&rdquo;; and then a pen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The biggest imaginary tree of Heaven is known as Pa&#x301;rija&#x301;ta. &ldquo;If we use that tree as the pen and if this entire lithosphere is used as paper&rdquo; &ndash; and who is to write? &ndash; &ldquo;If the imaginary goddess of learning, the mythological goddess of learning, Minerva, writes with this ink tablet, ink pot, paper and pen&rdquo; &ndash; for how many days? &ndash; &ldquo;for an innumerable number of days, even then it won&#146;t be possible for her to write all His qualifications.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->He is beyond the periphery of all qualifications. That&#146;s why He is &ldquo;Gun&#x301;a&#x301;tiita&rdquo;. Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja is one of His qualifications, it is not everything. He is also called <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>? What is the meaning of <I>purus&#x301;a</I>?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->You know this physical body, this physical body is &ndash; what? It is one of your cells, it is a physical cell. And within this physical cell, there is the psychic cell. And there is the spiritual body. Now the entity that always remains with you, within your physical structure, within your psychic structure, and also closely associated with your spiritual structure, is <I>purus&#x301;a</I>. <I>Pura</I> means &ldquo;representing the structure&rdquo;; the entity who is always present with you, within your structure, is <I>purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now each and every entity, each and every living being and each and every inanimate object, has <I>purus&#x301;a</I> in it. Some objects are animate, due to the presence of afferent and efferent nerves, due to the presence of so many organs; and when <I>purus&#x301;a</I> is there those organs can function. In the case of inanimate objects &ndash; stones, sand, earth, water &ndash; due to the absence of those nerves and organs they cannot realize anything, they cannot feel anything, they cannot witness anything. But the <I>purus&#x301;a</I> is there. <I>purus&#x301;a</I> is present everywhere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now the individual <I>purus&#x301;as</I> lying covert within your existence are unit <I>purus&#x301;as,</I> your individual &ldquo;I&#146;s&rdquo;, your little &ldquo;I&#146;s&rdquo;. And the Supreme is called <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><I>Parama</I>. The word <I>parama</I> has two meanings, two significances. One meaning is &ldquo;Supreme&rdquo;, another meaning is &ldquo;the final <I>para</I>&rdquo;. What is <I>para</I>? Suppose you are seeing an elephant. Here you are the subject and the elephant is the object. Now, because the elephant is the object, we say the elephant is the <I>apara</I> entity and you, the seer, are the <I>para</I> entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now who is seeing? Your eyes are seeing. Why are your eyes seeing, how are your eyes seeing? Because your mind wants it. So in the next phase, that is, in the first inner phase, who is the <I>apara</I> and who is the <I>para</I>? The eyes are <I>apara,</I> object, and the mind is <I>para,</I> subject. Then in the next inner phase the mind is <I>apara</I> and your <I>a&#x301;tman,</I> the witnessing entity, is <I>para</I>.                                                             But you know <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is seeing everything. What your <I>a&#x301;tman</I> is witnessing, that thing is also witnessed by <I>Parama  Purus&#x301;a</I>. So your <I>a&#x301;tman</I> is <I>apara</I> and the Supreme Entity is <I>para</I>. So He is the Supreme <I>Para,</I> that&#146;s why He is called <I>Parama  Purus&#x301;a</I>.  This is the exact meaning of the term <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now this <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is the Supreme Witnessing Entity. What your individual <I>purus&#x301;a</I> is seeing or is witnessing or is feeling &ndash; everything is being witnessed by the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now how is everything being witnessed by the Supreme Entity?  Suppose you are creating a rhinoceros in your mind and that rhinoceros is moving within your mind. Whatever that rhinoceros is doing, you are seeing. Whatever that rhinoceros is saying, you are hearing. And whatever that rhinoceros is thinking you are hearing. Whatever the rhinoceros does, there and then it is being witnessed by you. No activities, no thought waves, of that rhinoceros, are a secret for you &ndash; you know everything. And whatever is being done in the Universe is nothing but a mental creation of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. Everything is within His mind. He is the Macrocosm, and everything is microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So each and every man is moving within His mind. Everything is within Him, nothing is without. Whatever is being done He sees, He knows, He feels. This universe is nothing but a mental projection of that <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Hence He is <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</I> and because everything is His mental creation, everything, everybody, is &ndash; what? His child. He is not the ruler; He is not the administrator; He is not the boss. He is the creator, the generator; He is the operator; and He is the destroyer. When He withdraws His thought waves within Himself then nothing will remain. You came from Him, you are moving within His mind, and finally you will be one with Him. That&#146;s why I said that He as Generator is represented by &ldquo;G&rdquo;; He as Operator is represented by &ldquo;O&rdquo;; and He as Destructor is represented by &ldquo;D&rdquo; &ndash; G-O-D. He is &ldquo;God&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Now let me explain the meaning of the word <I>deva</I> first. The root word is <I>div</I> The Sanskrit word is <I>deva</I>. <I>Deva</I> means &ldquo;vibrating faculty&rdquo;. The entity due to whose presence everything in the Universe vibrates is <I>deva</I> or <I>div,</I> and its Latin adjective is &ldquo;divine&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Everything, each and every expression, is represented by a particular type of wave. There are sound waves, there are light waves; some waves may or may not be properly understood or assimilated by your organs. Some sounds are audible, some sounds are not audible. Some of the light waves are visible, some of the light waves are not visible. But all those waves are <I>devas,</I> because they vibrate the entire creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Now all these waves emanate from a particular source. The source is a singular one, so the source that controls all these <I>devas,</I> all those vibrations or vibrational faculties, is Maha&#x301;deva. <I>Maha&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;great&rdquo;. &ldquo;The Great Deva&rdquo;. Hence <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is called &ldquo;Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo;. That is, another name of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</I> another name of God, is &ldquo;Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->A very popular name is Hari. In Sanskrit the root verb <I>har</I> means &ldquo;to steal&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Hari&rdquo; means &ldquo;The Stealing Agent&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->It is fundamentally against Sixteen Points and <I>Yama</I> and <I>Niyama,</I> so how can <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> steal? He is stealing, that is, His actions are ultravires to the principles of Sixteen Points, and <I>Yama</I> and <I>Niyama</I>? It is against <I>asteya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Though He cannot go against the principles of Sixteen Points, <I>asteya</I> and <I>Yama</I> and <I>Niyama,</I> but the very name says that He is a thief. You heard &ldquo;Hari&rdquo; means &ldquo;thief&rdquo;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Yes, He is a thief, but He is not against Sixteen Points or <I>Yama</I> and <I>Niyama</I>.  How can this be?  As explained, each and every entity is within His mind; He is the Generator, Operator and [[Destructor]]. Everybody is His, all are His loving children. But you know, whatever a man does, that very man will have to undergo the reactive momenta of his original action or actions. Suppose a man committed so many sins in so many lives; now he will have to undergo the reactions of those actions, of those bad actions. Then for [[millions]] of years he will have to pass through so many troubles, so many pains, so many mental tortures. A father cannot like this, a father cannot think that His children will have to go through so much trouble because of their past bad actions. So what does He want? He wants His sons to give Him &ndash; what? The sins committed by them. But the sons will say, the daughters will say, &ldquo;No, Father, we will give you flowers, we will give you sweets, we will give you so many things; but we can&#146;t give you our sins. We can&#146;t.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Then what will this loving Father do? He will secretly take away the sins. He is [[a thief. He finds no other alternative but to steal the  sins of His children, just to save the children from the  tortures of their reactive momenta.  That&#146;s why He is Hari &ndash; He is a thief, The Great Thief.]]<!-- /block --></p>
