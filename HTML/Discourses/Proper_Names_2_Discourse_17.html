<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Up until this point we have been discussing the naming of places and things. A boy named A&#x301;diyta has just danced kaos&#x301;ikii for us. What is the meaning of the name A&#x301;ditya? In old Sanskrit the word a&#x301;ditya means &ldquo;one who collects what is due to them&rdquo;. After the death of a living being their quinquelemental existence &ndash; that is, solid, liquid, luminous, aerial, ethereal &ndash; these five factors collect what is due to them. The stars, planets, atoms and molecules, these luminaries and particles are an aggregate of twelve factors. Since each one of them collects what is due to them they are called &ldquo;the twelve a&#x301;dityas&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now this garland of rajaniigandha&#x301; [tuberose] that you see here &ndash; how did this flower get its name? Rabindranath has written in one of his poems: ra&#x301;ja&#x301;r ka&#x301;nane phut&#x301;eche vakul-pa&#x301;rul-rajaniigandha&#x301; [vakul, pa&#x301;rul and rajaniigandha&#x301; flowers have blossomed in the king&#146;s garden]. However during the time in history depicted in this poem, that is, during the time of Magadh&#146;s King Bimbisar, there was no such rajaniigandha&#x301; flower in India. It was only four hundred and fifty years ago that the Portuguese first brought the rajaniigandha&#x301; from Mexico and planted it in the garden of their Bandel church. The original home of this flower was Central American Mexico. Its English name is &ldquo;tuberose&rdquo;. Like the shuili flower, the tuberose is full of fragrant pollen. During the day the breeze becomes light in the heat of the sun. As a result it cannot easily carry the fragrant pollen of the rajaniigandha&#x301;. But during the night the breeze becomes strong and easily carries the scent; for this reason the tuberose brought by the Portuguese was given the name rajaniigandha&#x301; [literally: night-scent] in Bengali. One can also smell the rajaniigandha&#x301; during cloudy days and solar eclipses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, last week I was talking about the names of places. The giving of Sanskrit names is not only confined to India; in many countries outside India the giving of names shows the influence of Sanskrit. At one time the Sanskrit language was used throughout the vast region extending from southern Russia all the way to Suvarn&#x301;adviipa. The southern region of Russia &ndash; what is today Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan &ndash; used to be called Sha&#x301;kadviipa. And the combined name of India and Afghanistan at that time was Jambudviipa, You must have heard the mantra jambudviipe bha&#x301;ratakhan&#x301;d&#x301;e. Of course at that time Afghanistan was part of India. The name for Burma and all of southeast Asia was Suvarn&#x301;adviipa. Sanskrit is still used to speak with the king of Thailand, however it is pronounced differently. For example, in Thailand ja is pronounced like d&#x301;a and n&#x301;a is pronounced like d&#x301;ha, and ya and ya [with dot] are both pronounced like ya [ja]. The name of the kingdom of Kamboja is pronounced nowadays Kambod&#x301;iya&#x301; by the people. At that time the kingdom of Kamboja was much larger than the present-day Cambodia. At one time there was a huge Shiva temple there called Ounka&#x301;rabhat&#x301;t&#x301;a. Its modern name is Ounka&#x301;r Bha&#x301;t&#x301;. Now the temple has been practically ruined.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When I was in Thailand my driver&#146;s name was Krs&#x301;d&#x301;had&#x301;a&#x301;s; that is, his real name was Krs&#x301;n&#x301;ada&#x301;s. But since n&#x301;a is pronounced like d&#x301;ha in the Thai style of pronunciation, if you asked the driver&#146;s name he would reply Krs&#x301;d&#x301;had&#x301;a&#x301;s.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->One also sees the influence of Sanskrit pronunciation in Indonesia. One famous city in Indonesia is Jakarta. Its Sanskrit name in the past was Yogyakartta&#x301;. Thus, according to the style of pronunciation there, it became Yogaya&#x301;kartta&#x301;, Jakarta for short.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The Sanskrit name for the land we now call Java is Yavadviipa. Its capital was Va&#x301;ta&#x301;vipura. The modern name Batavia comes from this Va&#x301;ta&#x301;vipura. When the Dutch [olanda&#x301;j] came to India in the last part of the Mughal era, they brought a variety of lemon with them from Va&#x301;ta&#x301;viipura which they first planted in the present-day city of Chinsura [Cuncr&#x301;o].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The Dutch had a factory in Chinsura and they christened the city &ldquo;Chinsura&rdquo;. The modern Dutch pronunciation was sya&#x301;nsura&#x301; and in Bengali it became cuncur&#x301;a&#x301;, cuncr&#x301;o in spoken Bengali. When I was staying in Holland I spoke with a few scholars about Cuncr&#x301;o and I found that none of them were conversant with Cuncr&#x301;o. One of them said: &ldquo;I have never heard anything in the history about Cuncr&#x301;o but the word cuncr&#x301;o is from our language.&rdquo; I have seen a place in Cuncr&#x301;o called &ldquo;Dutch Villa&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The Dutch imported into this country a type of legume from Yavadviipa similar to peas [kara&#x301;ishunt&#x301;i]. In Calcutta Bengali we call mat&#x301;arshunt&#x301;i [peas] kara&#x301;ishunt&#x301;i. Although they are not as good as regular peas for making da&#x301;l, they are quite tasty when eaten fresh in the pod. At one time the village people of Hooghly District used to love to eat these pods with puffed rice. They used to cultivate them as well. They named them or&#x301;anda&#x301; shunt&#x301;i (that is, &ldquo;Dutch peas&rdquo;). They look somewhat like regular peas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The Batavia lemon [pomelo] that I was talking about is a well-known name in Bengal nowadays. It does not have any true Sanskrit name, however the Sanskrit name for the somewhat smaller, sweet and sour lemon that was already common in this country was maha&#x301;laun&#x32D;ga. Nowadays the maha&#x301;laun&#x32D;ga has gotten lost in the crowd of Batavia lemons. The Sanskrit name of the lemon that is a little smaller than the maha&#x301;laun&#x32D;ga and a little elongated, and which was already in this country is jambiira; its modern popular name is ja&#x301;mir or ja&#x301;merii or jambura&#x301;. The jambiira did not come from outside India. It has also gotten lost nowadays in the crowd of Batavia lemons. Keep in mind that although the Batavia lemon came to this country from Java, it is native to all of Southeast Asia, that is, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines (this country&#146;s Sanskrit name is Maha&#x301;rlika&#x301; or Maha&#x301;rliin&#x301;a&#x301;). The Sanskrit name of the sweet and juicy lemon called maosambii in Urdu and sharvatii in Bengali is shiitanimbu; it is smaller than the jambiira and quite plentiful in this country. Nowadays the name maosambii is more common in Bengali, however it would not be right to forget the Bengali name, sharvatii nebu. This sharvatii nebu belongs to the nebu family, not the kamala&#x301; family. Nebu in English is &ldquo;lemon&rdquo;; in Sanskrit it is nimbu; in Hindi niimbu; in Angika nemu; and in Bengali nebu &ndash; some people mistakenly say lebu. Kamala&#x301; in English is &ldquo;orange&rdquo;. In Sanskrit it is kamala&#x301; or na&#x301;garaun&#x32D;ga, in Urdu na&#x301;ra&#x301;ungi, in Marathi sa&#x301;ntara&#x301; and in Bengali kamala&#x301;. The main difference between the nebu family (sharvatii or sweet lemon, jambiira, maha&#x301;laun&#x32D;ga, Batavi or lemon pomelo, pa&#x301;ti, ka&#x301;gjii, etc.) and the kamala&#x301; family (orange &ndash; Sanskrit na&#x301;garaun&#x32D;ga group) is that the rind of the nebu is not easily removed. It is cut with a knife or chopper. But the skin of the kamala&#x301; family (Sylheti kamala&#x301;, Assam kamala&#x301;, Meghalay kamala&#x301;, Darjeeling kamala&#x301;, Nagpuri kamala&#x301; or Khoka&#x301;kamala&#x301;, gonr&#x301;a&#x301; nebu, gonr&#x301;a&#x301; kamala&#x301;, etc.) is easily peeled and the sections inside come apart. The keno nebu, quite common nowadays, is a mix between the lemon and orange families. In those days India was producing less sugar so it used to be imported from Batavia in Indonesia. Hence the colloquial name for sugar [cini] among the people became ba&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; cini (during our young days ba&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; cini and Barishal&#146;s ba&#x301;la&#x301;m rice were very common in Calcutta).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It is said in the Thai folk tales that Rarh&#146;s crown prince, Sahasraraba&#x301;hu, defeated Thailand and gave it the name Shya&#x301;madesha. The land is very green and lush so the name Shya&#x301;madesha [verdant land] is both fitting and beautiful. He established a vast empire in Southeast Asia. At that time the capital of Rarh was Sim&#x301;hapur. The former name of the place called Siun&#x32D;gur in present-day Hooghly District was Sim&#x301;hapur. The crown prince, Sahasraraba&#x301;hu, founded a city in Southeast Asia and named it after Rarh&#146;s Sim&#x301;hapur; its modern name is Singapore. Just as the British established another city called London after going to America, the same kind of thing has happened many times. There are cities and towns in many places with the same name.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->We have already mentioned that the Sanskrit name for the southern part of Russia was Sha&#x301;kadviipa. The Greek name for Sha&#x301;kadviipa was Sacdonia. &ldquo;Alexander&rdquo; is also a Greek name. Its Arabic equivalent is Sika&#x301;nda&#x301;r. There is a port in Egypt named Sikandria. Its Greek as well as European name is also Alexandria. Alexandria was home to the historically renowned library. The poet Satyen Datta has written these lines about the scholar Acharya Harinath Dey, master of many languages:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The people of Sha&#x301;kadviipa were followers of the A&#x301;rs&#x301;a religion [religion of the Rs&#x301;is]. Since they were unwilling to embrace Islam during the age of the spread of Islam, they left that country and took shelter in India. In Indian society they became known as the Sha&#x301;kadviipii Brahmans. They mostly kept themselves busy studying astrology and Ayurveda. They used to wear loose pyjama pants with a jacket on their upper body and a Fez cap. Although they were followers of the Rs&#x301;is they did not always follow the Vedic customs in their sacrifices and rituals. Furthermore, they were worshippers of the sun god. So the images of the sun god they worshipped that are found in the different sun god temples are also dressed in loose pyjama pants with a Fez cap on the head and a rosary in the hands, what we call ja&#x301;pa&#x301;ma&#x301;la&#x301; in Bengali. Thus it is said that it is more of a non-Hindu sun god. This kind of sun god temple is found in several places in India. There is a famous temple of this type in Gaya District (present-day Aurangabad District). Today the sun god temple at Kon&#x301;a&#x301;rk is in ruins and its idol has vanished.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The Sha&#x301;kadviipii Brahmans spread (prasa&#x301;r) Ayurveda throughout northern India.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In Bengal, however, there was little use of Ayurveda; mainly the Vaedyaka system was in vogue. In contrast to Ayurveda, the Vaedyaka treatises provided for the dissection of corpses; that is, the Bengali physicians did not limit themselves to the Ayurvedic theories. They paid attention to the practical side also. Later on, the demonic dogmas of the Sha&#x301;kadviipii Brahmans in north India extended their limiting influence over the physicians as well and slowly the Vaedyaka practitioners abandoned the dissection of cadavers. When Shrii Madhusudhan Gupta began practising western medicine during British rule the caste injunction against touching dead bodies made him a social outcaste.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->A large portion of Bengal is watery land. In the areas where big rivers flow, those rivers take a bend at certain places and as a result eddies are created at the bottom of the river near the bend [va&#x301;nk].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Such places are dangerous for boats or ships. There was one such eddy in the Jalangi River where it takes a bend [va&#x301;nk] (Sanskrit vakra &rarr; vam&#x301;ka &rarr; va&#x301;nka&#x301;) near Krishnanagar. At that time one used to go by water down the Jalangi River from Calcutta to where it met the Padma River and from there to Dhaka. The steamers used to take special care when they neared this eddy. The settlement that sprang up near this eddy [ghurn&#x301;ii] was named Ghurn&#x301;ii. Three places, this Ghurn&#x301;ii, Goya&#x301;ri and Krishnanagar, developed collectively into the cultural centre of Bengal at the time, Krishnanagar. During the reign of Maharaja Krishnachandra some sealing-wax artisans were brought from Birbhum&#146;s Ilambazaar to reside in this Ghurn&#x301;ii. They were the forefathers of Krishnanagar&#146;s renowned modern-day clay sculptors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The Bengali name for this whirlpool or eddy at the bottom of the water is daha, so when one hears the word daha in the name of any village or town one can know that there is or was a large river nearby that town or village and that it has or had a daha or eddy in it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->There was one such eddy in the Maha&#x301;nanda&#x301; River also. There are two rivers mentioned in the Atharvaveda called the Para&#x301;nanda&#x301; and the Apara&#x301;nanda&#x301;. These two rivers joined near Kis&#x301;an&#x301;ganj and thereafter became known as the Maha&#x301;nanda&#x301;. When the king of the Malla Ks&#x301;atriyas occupied this region it was renamed the Ma&#x301;ldah. In other words, the kingdom of the Mallas and the nearby Maha&#x301;nand daha were combined to make the name Ma&#x301;ldah. Similarly, in Rajshahi District you find Sardaha. Ca&#x301;kada&#x301; in Nadia comes from Cakradaha. At one time the Bhagiirathii River used to flow past Ca&#x301;kda&#x301;. Nowadays the Bhagiirathii has moved more to the west.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The Saraswati River passed by Mogra to the west of the Bhagiirathii and the Yamuna passed by Kalyani. The lands of these three rivers, the Bhagiirathii, Saraswati and Yamuna, is a triven&#x301;ii [confluence of three streams] &ndash; an open triven&#x301;ii or open stream. In other words, the three rivers flow off in three different directions. The triven&#x301;ii at Praya&#x301;g near Allahabad is a closed triven&#x301;ii or closed stream because there the three streams coming from different directions unite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The open stream of the Yamuna merges into the Icha&#x301;matii. At that time the Vidya&#x301;dharii River used to emerge from the southern outlet of the Yamuna in midcourse; today it flows into the Bay of Bengal after passing the eastern outskirts of Calcutta, south past Canning, then joining with the Bhagiirathii&#146;s tributary, the Piya&#x301;lii, where they assume the name Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; and thereafter pass through the Sundarbans. The British planned to build the port of Canning on the banks of the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; but the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; is no longer actually a river. It is an ordinary estuary [kha&#x301;r&#x301;ii]. An estuary is also called a &ldquo;backwater&rdquo; in spoken English. Although in Bengali and Oriya kha&#x301;r&#x301;ii means &ldquo;estuary&rdquo; or &ldquo;backwater&rdquo;, in Urdu it means &ldquo;bay&rdquo;. For example, the Bay of Bengal is ba&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;l ki kha&#x301;r&#x301;ii in Urdu. So seeing that the proposed Canning port was ruined by the flooding of the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301;, the plans for the Canning port were scrapped. The Vidya&#x301;dharii that flows from this southern outlet used to change its course practically every year. Later the area turned into a salty swamp so the British named it the Salt Lake area. This area was full of trees and plants that favoured salty soil. There was a jungle of gol, ba&#x301;in, hinta&#x301;l, mangosteen and mangrove. The salty seawater inundated the area during floodtide and made it even more frightening. There were a number of eddies. Packs of jackals used to roam there in broad daylight. The people used to call the entire area Shiya&#x301;ldaha [jackal eddy].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->When the British occupied this country Calcutta was part of the northern outskirts of the Sundarbans. In order to save Calcutta from the Maratha invasions they dug a canal to the northeast which was known as the Maratha Ditch. Mr. Tolley joined this Maratha Ditch to the A&#x301;digaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. In olden times the A&#x301;digaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; was the original Ganges river and it used to flow past Ba&#x301;ruipur&#146;s Maha&#x301;prabhu D&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; towards Chatrasha&#x301;l. Maha&#x301;prabhu, on his way to Shya&#x301;mpur, would keep the Bhagiirathii on his right at Khar&#x301;da&#x301;, then rest for a little while at the modern Maha&#x301;prabhu D&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301; in Ba&#x301;ruipur, and then cross the Ganges near Chatrasha&#x301;l. From Shya&#x301;mpur he would take the Gopiivallabhapur road to Puri. This part of the canal was named after Mr. Tolley and part of the A&#x301;digaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; as well; it was known as T&#x301;alii na&#x301;la&#x301; [Tolley Canal]. It was an unhealthy saltwater area full of mosquito-infested jungle and undergrowth. Farming was not very successful there. Afterwards, when a new settlement was founded there it was named Tolleyganj. It cannot take pride in its antiquity like Beha&#x301;la&#x301; and Bar&#x301;is&#x301;a&#x301; can.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->If you take a look at a map of Bengal you will see innumerable estuaries to the south by the Bay of Bengal. They are full of saltwater and are home to ferocious crocodiles. These ferocious crocodiles are called &ldquo;crocodile gangelitis&rdquo; in English. They are not the alligator variety of crocodile. Although the alligator variety of crocodile lives in various regions from the tropic of Cancer to the equator to the tropic of Capricorn, their primary home is the Amazon River-basin in Brazil. In other words they are not gangelitis but rather amazonika. At one time there were great numbers of this crocodile gangelitis variety of crocodile on the shoals of the Rupanarayan River-basin near Shya&#x301;mpur, Ba&#x301;gana&#x301;n, Genyokha&#x301;li, etc., especially during wintertime.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> During the middle of the day in winter they would lie on the river shoals with their mouths gaping open and small birds would enter their mouths to pick out the pieces of meat stuck to their teeth and eat them. There was an unwritten alliance of mutual self-interest and doing each other a good turn between the birds and the crocodiles. The crocodiles used to get their teeth cleaned and the birds found their food there. The crocodile would not close his mouth while the birds were in it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->At that time the Rupanarayan was a huge river. During the rainy season it was full of ilish (hilsa) fish and during the winter it was full of tapse.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The word ilish means &ldquo;glossy&rdquo; or &ldquo;glittering&rdquo;. In spoken Bengali it is called ilsha&#x301; or ilshe in some places. The word is derived from Pra&#x301;krta. If the ilish loses its taste then it is called viilish [vi-ilish &ndash; without ilish]. When the ilish would get separated from the main river and end up in someone&#146;s pond or pool due to flooding of the sea or of the Ganges then they would grow large in size, no doubt, but they would be less tasty because the amount of oil would decrease. This kind of ilish was commonly known as viilish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The British took three settlements from the nawab for 2700 rupees when they came to this country for the first time &ndash; Kalighat, Sutanuti and Govindapur. Sutanuti was a village of weavers to the north.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Their trade involved suta&#x301; [thread] and nut&#x301;i [&ldquo;bobbin&rdquo; in English] so naturally the name of the village become Sutanut&#x301;i.

<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->It has been said that Sutanuti was principally a weavers&#146; settlement. The old textile merchants of Calcutta used to live in the area between Sutanuti and Govindapur. Now it is known as Bar&#x301;aba&#x301;ja&#x301;r. Actually its old Bengali name was Bur&#x301;a&#x301; Ba&#x301;ja&#x301;r &ndash; from the local name Bur&#x301;o Shiva. The place was probably under the ownership of Bar&#x301;is&#x301;a&#x301;&#146;s Sa&#x301;varn&#x301;a Choudurees. They were the forefathers of Bar&#x301;aba&#x301;ja&#x301;r&#146;s merchants. The area beginning where Sutanuti touches the bank of the Ganges straight south until the bank of the Ganges to the west of Kalighat was the home of the fisherman community, or jelepa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;. This jelepa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; was divided into three localities &ndash; Sutanuti, Govindapur and Kalighat. We should keep in mind that this does not mean that the city of Calcutta was formed from only Sutanuti, Govindapur and Kalighat. Calcutta was founded over a vast area to the north and east of these three villages comprising mainly another twenty-seven villages and secondarily thirty-five villages. The villages of Pat&#x301;old&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;, D&#x301;ihi, Henta&#x301;li (Entally), Citrapur (Chitpur), Hogalkunr&#x301;e, Pat&#x301;uya&#x301;pa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;, Ba&#x301;gma&#x301;rii, Mogalba&#x301;ga&#x301;n, Belegha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, Ta&#x301;ltala&#x301;, and so on, all became part of Calcutta as well. The neighbourhoods of Gara&#x301;n&#x301;aha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, A&#x301;hirit&#x301;ola&#x301;, Mohanba&#x301;ga&#x301;n, Hartukiba&#x301;ga&#x301;n, Ha&#x301;lsiba&#x301;ga&#x301;n, Ha&#x301;t&#x301;khola&#x301;, Kuma&#x301;rt&#x301;ulii, Shobha&#x301;ba&#x301;ja&#x301;r, etc. were incorporated later on, however they are not very new either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Kalighat was a small, temple-centred village to the south. A few Brahman families and Pat&#x301;uya&#x301; [painter-caste] families lived there. These Pat&#x301;uya&#x301;s were the artists responsible for the renowned Kalighat canvases. It was Jamini Rain&#x32D;jan Ray, a resident of Bankura&#146;s Beletor&#x301;, who recognized the excellence of these Kalighat canvases. There is no written history in existence that tells how old these Kalighat canvases are but the Pat&#x301;uya&#x301;s were living there at the beginning of the Pathan era. They came from the Arambag and Ghatal areas. In those days the people of Bengal used to buy paintings along with other things when they went to market. There used to be an especially brisk trade in the paintings of different Hindu gods and goddesses. The women who worshipped Lakshmi year-round used to do it with paintings. When Durgapuja began during the Pathan era only the zamindars used to make idols for their worship. The middle class people who used to celebrate Durgapuja at home would use paintings. Those who could not afford to buy paintings would celebrate it with earthen pots. Even as recently as one hundred years ago Saraswati puja used to be performed chiefly with earthen pots. The performance of Saraswati puja with idols was introduced later on with inspiration from the British.<!-- /block --></p>

They were the forefathers of the renowned Tagore families of Jorasanko and Pathureghata.

They began to live in hundreds of villages in Bhagalpur and Monghyr districts. Descendants of the Rarhi Kayasthas bearing the surnames Ghosh, Mitra, Datta, Das and Singha still live there. They went there with their own Rarhi class Brahman priests as well. During the invasion of the Maratha cavalry the wealthy Kayasthas of the Bankura, Hooghly, Howrah and Burdwan areas sought safe shelter in British Calcutta, the city of officialdom and business. However, for whatever reason, they did not take up residence in Govindapur. They went to Ha&#x301;t&#x301;khola&#x301;, Shobha&#x301;ba&#x301;ja&#x301;r, Shya&#x301;mba&#x301;ja&#x301;r, Shya&#x301;mpukur, Kambulit&#x301;ola&#x301;, Kumurt&#x301;ulii, Chitpur, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>

When the British built up their business interests in Calcutta many of Cuncr&#x301;o&#146;s Suvarn&#x301;a baniks moved there. They started living in the city&#146;s western district by the bank of the Bhagiirathii river. In those days Calcutta&#146;s trade moved principally along the Bhagiirathii. One famous personage of Cuncr&#x301;o at that time was Gaorii Sen. He was famous throughout the land for his wealth, his generous heart and his liberality. People still say, &ldquo;If you need money, Gaorii Sen will give it to you&rdquo;. These fisher-folk, Pira&#x301;li Brahmans, Kayasthas, weavers, textile merchants and Suvarn&#x301;a baniks were the old residents of Calcutta.<!-- /block --></p>

They would go in the early morning and return back in the evening.<!-- /block --></p>

No one dared travel that path alone, even in broad daylight, what to speak of at night. When they would go to perform Kali puja in the Kali temple they would travel in groups of forty or fifty persons and take their staffs and cudgels with them. Otherwise they would be killed by highwaymen. It is said that the highwaymen used to kill people in broad daylight and hang them from trees. The ashram of Caoraungii Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; was in the Govindapur area (the Na&#x301;th yogi Caoraungiina&#x301;th). Caoraungii Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; was pained to see the distress of the pilgrims so he had his disciples carve out a road through the jungle to Kalighat. For a long time this road was known as Caoraungii Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;&#146;s road. I cannot understand why those who have completely or partially changed the name of this road have done so. Dharmara&#x301;j T&#x301;hakur&#146;s place was a little to the east of Caoraungii Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;&#146;s ashram. Dharmara&#x301;j was another name for Buddha. The worship of Dharmara&#x301;j or Dharmat&#x301;ha&#x301;kur began in Bengal towards the end of the Pa&#x301;l era.

<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->I was talking about the Dharmara&#x301;j puja. Dharmara&#x301;j puja was common to some extent in central Bengal and throughout Rarh. In Birbhum and Bankura, Dharmara&#x301;j was regarded as the non-Brahman-worshipped Shiva right from the beginning. In certain parts of eastern Rarh and central Bengal, Dharmara&#x301;j acquired the appellation Bur&#x301;o Shiva. In many villages and towns of this region there is a Bur&#x301;o Shivatala&#x301; as well as a Dharmara&#x301;jtala&#x301;. The difference was that the majority of the worshippers of Dharmara&#x301;j were non-Brahmans, that is, people belonging to the [[Ja&#x301;t Bengalees]], chiefly Kaevarta and Sadgopa. They were generally known by the name Deva&#x301;m&#x301;shi. The worshippers of Bur&#x301;o Shiva, however, were predominantly Buddhist Brahmans with the surname Cakravartii. In subsequent times, this Bur&#x301;o Shiva&#146;s Buddhist colour changed and he was transformed into Paoranic Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>

Modern ladies who cook are unfamiliar with the way mug-sha&#x301;uli was actually prepared. But I would guess that it was prepared by boiling the whole mung in milk after removing the husk and then frying it in a little ghee with cloves, sugar and cassia leaf. Mugkhan&#x301;d&#x301;a used to be prepared in those days in a similar way. The consumption of mung burfi as a sweet had probably not become common yet.

The rukh here comes from the Sanskrit word vrks&#x301;a. Sanskrit vrks&#x301;a &rarr; riks&#x301;a &rarr; ruks&#x301;a &rarr; rukh. Generally, whenever r is joined to a consonant in Sanskrit then in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta it is taken as if the r were not there. For example, nrtya becomes nacca, vrddha becomes vad&#x301;hd&#x301;ha &rarr; vud&#x301;d&#x301;ha &rarr; bur&#x301;a&#x301; &rarr; bur&#x301;o. If there is only r then it becomes i in the Yajurvedic style. In the Atharvavedic style it becomes u. For example, rs&#x301;i becomes isi and rju becomes uju. In the aforementioned verse it would have been more correct had vrks&#x301;a been changed into vaks&#x301;a but since the pronunciation of antahstha va is vowel-like, vrks&#x301;a in the Atharvavedic style becomes ruks&#x301;a and from that comes the old Bengali rukh. Of course there are exceptions also. For example, the Sanskrit vaks&#x301;a becomes bukka in Pra&#x301;krta and from that buk in modern Bengali. The name of the place where Lord Buddha initiated his first five disciples was Sa&#x301;raun&#x32D;gana&#x301;th; nowadays it has become Sa&#x301;rnath. The sages made a deer park in this Sa&#x301;raun&#x32D;gana&#x301;th so the place was renamed Rs&#x301;ipattana Mrgada&#x301;va in Sanskrit which became Isipattan Migda&#x301;b in Pra&#x301;krta.<!-- /block --></p>

The name of this place in Angadesh underwent change and became Monghyr. In the Pathan era its distorted name became Mungher. Monghyr was the last capital of Bengal during the Mughal era. Its nawab was Mirka&#x301;ssim. The fort from those days and the arsenal bazaar originally made for muskets and canons still exist in Monghyr. There is a Kasimbazaar named after the nawab as well as the Kar&#x301;eya&#x301; parade grounds for military parades. There are rest houses called Sara&#x301;i here and there in the city for travellers. At that time travellers&#146; lodges were called sara&#x301;i in Farsi. In the Indian languages they were called cat&#x301;i. Long-distance travellers would rest there. In some places the kings or nawabs made arrangements to provide food and in some places there were almshouses. In some places rice, pulse, salt and wood were stored there and the travellers would cook their own food. Sophiya&#x301;sara&#x301;i and Pu&#x301;ravsara&#x301;i were near Monghyr and Laks&#x301;miisara&#x301;i was a little further away. Burdwan was also the capital of Bengal at one time.

<a name="71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->So we were talking about Mudgagiri, which was the last capital of Bengal during the era of the Nawabs and the second capital of Anga in olden times. At that time the Ras&#x301;t&#x301;rakut&#146;s were a dominant force in west India. They took possession of Monghyr for a short time and they also designated it as their second capital. This was most probably during the time of Mahendra Pal. Monghyr&#146;s history dates back to the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata when Karna was the king of Angadesh. Angadesh&#146;s main capital then was Campaknagar (present-day Campa&#x301;nagar near Na&#x301;thnagar). Although there is no connection between the historical Karna and Monghyr&#146;s historically famous Karn&#x301;acu&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; palace, the hillock on which the palace is situated is named after Maharaja Karna. During the time of the Pal kings Bengal&#146;s impenetrable fort was on the south side of the Ganges. The fall of Monghyr speeded the fall of the Pal kings and opened the doors for the Pathan invasion. As a result the historically renowned Vikramshila University located to the east of Monghyr near Bhagalpur was destroyed (Bhagalpur&#146;s nearby Antichak village).<!-- /block --></p>

Golden mung has been cultivated in the clayey soil of central Bengal for a very long time; it is incomparable in taste, smell and sentiency. However there is no way of knowing if the mung mentioned in the Bengali literature of the middle ages is the s&#x301;a&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; variety of golden mung or some other variety of mung because in the Rarh region ghor&#x301;a&#x301; mung or gheso mung is cultivated more than golden mung.

For example, mung is called &ldquo;green gram&rdquo;; biri kala&#x301;i or ma&#x301;s&#x301; kala&#x301;i (in Calcutta we say biuli) is black gram; kurthii kala&#x301;i or kulattha kala&#x301;i is &ldquo;horse gram&rdquo;; chola&#x301; is &ldquo;Bengal gram&rdquo; (bun&#x301;t&#x301;ika or can&#x301;aka in Sanskrit; but&#x301; in Rarh and Bihar; rahila&#x301; in  Bhojpuri; can&#x301;a&#x301; in Hindi; harbar&#x301;a&#x301; in Marathi). The British first came into contact with chola&#x301; on both banks of Burdwan District&#146;s Kunur River (it begins in the Budbud jungle and merges in the Ajay near Kogra&#x301;m) so they named it &ldquo;Bengal gram&rdquo;.

Girivraja or Ra&#x301;jagiri was the capital of Magadh during the time of Bimbisar, that is, during Buddha&#146;s time. It suffered from a lack of water so there was a need for a plentiful water supply in the capital. Once the Buddha stood at the place where the Ganges and Shon rivers meet and said that if the capital were there it would be advantageous in every respect. Among the disciples of the Buddha present was a merchant by the name of Pataliputra. At that time there was a synthesis between the matrilineal and patrilineal systems with respect to giving names. The mother&#146;s name was Ru&#x301;pasa&#x301;ri so the son was named Sa&#x301;riputta. The mother&#146;s name was Maha&#x301;maodgalii (Maha&#x301;maggali) so her son was named Maha&#x301;maodagallan Arahan&#x301; (Maha&#x301;maggallan). Similarly his mother&#146;s name was Pat&#x301;alii so he was named Pat&#x301;aliiputra. This Pataliputra took on the responsibility of building a city at that spot so the city was named Pataliputra after him. Kusumpur was destroyed and Pataliputra was built in its place. Time and again the Shon changed its course and time and again Pataliputra was destroyed. When one Pataliputra disappeared another was founded on top of it.

There are many snakes in the villages and market centres of Bengal and there are a great many cobras in Rarh. Their name in Rarhi Bengali is kharis. That village which has a great number of snakes is called Sarpalehana&#x301; (Birbhum). Similarly, in Manbhum District there is Man&#x301;iha&#x301;ra&#x301;, in Bankura District there is Mukut&#x301;man&#x301;ipur, and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Formerly people used to be given names signifying manliness. Nowadays there is a tendency towards giving sweet names. Formerly, girls&#146; names used to have six or seven syllables, for example, Viirendramohinii, Shatadalava&#x301;sinii, and so forth. Thereafter they became shortened to around four syllables, for example, Viin&#x301;a&#x301;pa&#x301;n&#x301;ii, Saoda&#x301;min&#x301;ii, etc. Later on it became three syllables and nowadays two, for example, Viin&#x301;a&#x301;, Riin&#x301;a&#x301;, Rta&#x301;, and so on. Since the very long names of former times present difficulty when calling people a tendency arose to give nicknames. A woman whose name was Kiran&#x301;ashashii used to be called Kenna&#x301;. Today short names are the custom so there is no longer much need for nicknames. As names keep getting shorter, perhaps one day they will become one syllable. However there are not many one-syllable names in our storeroom. Several come to mind &ndash; A&#x301;h, Uh, Ki, Chi, Thuh, Ca, Kha&#x301;. I hope that in the future many meaningful one-syllable words will be created in the world&#146;s different languages; then no one will laugh if these kinds of names are given.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->When many are taken together to make a single whole then it is a guccha [bunch]. This guccha is called char&#x301;a&#x301; in Bengali. What is spread about [char&#x301;iye deoya&#x301;] is also called char&#x301;a&#x301;. Rural girls sprinkle [char&#x301;a&#x301; dey] cow dung water in the threshold of the courtyard. Many guccha or char&#x301;a&#x301; together make one ka&#x301;ndi or ka&#x301;ndi (the words char&#x301;a&#x301; and ka&#x301;ndi are pure native Bengali words), for example, a ka&#x301;ndi of bananas, a ka&#x301;ndi of palm fruit, a ka&#x301;ndi of coconuts, a ka&#x301;ndi of betel, etc. There are many char&#x301;a&#x301; in one ka&#x301;ndi of bananas. Many villages forming a bunch in this way are also called char&#x301;a&#x301;, in north Bengal it is called gur&#x301;i, for example, Laks&#x301;miichar&#x301;a&#x301;, Durlabhchar&#x301;a&#x301;, Kala&#x301;char&#x301;a&#x301;, and so on. As with char&#x301;a&#x301;, villages are also given the name Ka&#x301;ndi or Ka&#x301;ndi for the very same reason, for example, Cha&#x301;tina&#x301;ka&#x301;ndi, Ka&#x301;ndi, Jemoka&#x301;ndi (Murshidabad), Pa&#x301;tharka&#x301;ndi (former Sylhet District), Ha&#x301;ila&#x301;ka&#x301;ndi (Kachar District), etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->There is no relation between the names Ka&#x301;ndi and Ka&#x301;nthi. The name Ka&#x301;nthi comes from ka&#x301;nthika, which means &ldquo;shawl&rdquo; [ca&#x301;dar] or &ldquo;covering&rdquo;. The word ca&#x301;dar, however, is Farsi. In Urdu ca&#x301;dar is feminine, that is, merii ca&#x301;dar rather than mera&#x301; ca&#x301;dar. Since the British pronunciation of Murshidabad District&#146;s Ka&#x301;ndi and Midnapore&#146;s Ka&#x301;nthi are extremely similar they used to use the word &ldquo;Contai&rdquo; for Ka&#x301;nthi. There are two hidden reasons behind the giving of the name Ka&#x301;nthi. One is the famous Ka&#x301;nthi textile industry &ndash; clothes or coverings. At one time Ka&#x301;nthi&#146;s woven cloth was exported outside India. The second reason is the fame of Ka&#x301;nthi&#146;s erudition (erudition is a covering). At one time Ka&#x301;nthi was one of the centres for the cultivation of knowledge. A good number of Sanskrit Pandits used to live there. Even though the Sanskrit pandits are now few in number, Ka&#x301;nthi has not completely lost its lustre.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->After the government records were taken out from Leguya&#x301;, Ka&#x301;nthi expanded. Now the city is more developed than other district cities in many matters. In those days many district cities did not have a college but Ka&#x301;nthi had one. I know many elderly people in Orissa who learned to read and write in Ka&#x301;nthi college. Among the five districts in Orissa at that time (Cuttack, Puri, Baleshwar, Sambalpur, and Aungul-Khondamahal), only Cuttack had Ravenshaw College, so Ka&#x301;nthi&#146;s educational importance must indeed be recognized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->I and many of my friends were forced to go to college in Calcutta due to the scarcity of colleges in the provinces of Bihar and Orissa at that time. Ka&#x301;nthi&#146;s Sanskritic and cultural importance cannot be denied. It would not be bad if a Sanskrit university could be established there. It is my firm opinion that the poet Kalidas was a resident of this Ka&#x301;nthi region. The all-round development of Ka&#x301;nthi would afford many opportunities and conveniences. I would like to direct the attention of the concerned people there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->It would be very good if a railway line were extended from Haldiya&#x301; to Da&#x301;ntan via Ka&#x301;nthi-Diigha&#x301;. This would bring a new day&#146;s glow to the city of Ka&#x301;nthi and at the same time would foster the development of Haldiya&#x301; port. The sandy town of Diigha&#x301; would become a favourite of the people and south Midnapore would be bathed in a new light. Not only that, it would enable the local fisher-folk, banana farmers, betel farmers and flower farmers to expect a proper return for their commodities. If arokedia variety trees (Japanese tamarisk) are planted by the ocean their lustrous growth would also help matters by providing protection against ocean storms because this kind of tree has the capacity to serve as an obstacle to cyclones. It would be even better if a type of marine drive were built along the ocean from Haldiya&#x301; to the mouth of the Suvarnarekha River. This would not only prove attractive to travellers, but would also foster the development of smaller and larger trade centres and towns on the roadside. It would promote the economic prosperity of the local people. Many sea-dependent industries should be developed in the region lying between Ka&#x301;nthi and Junput&#x301;. A small port should also be developed near Ka&#x301;nthi at the mouth of the Rasulpur River. Since it can take advantage of natural conveniences, the port would not entail much expenditure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->The area below any large tree is called tala&#x301; or talii. Many places also have names that include tala&#x301; or talii, for example, Nimtala&#x301;, Keor&#x301;a&#x301;tala&#x301;, Ta&#x301;ltala&#x301; (Calcutta), A&#x301;gartala&#x301; (Tripura), Ba&#x301;da&#x301;mtala&#x301;, etc. Some examples of talii are A&#x301;mtalii, Kultalii, and Phultalii. If a particular place is used for some particular thing or particular work then in that case tala&#x301; is used. Talii, however, is not used in such cases. Some examples are: Can&#x301;d&#x301;iitala&#x301; (Hooghly), Ka&#x301;liitala&#x301;, Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nantala&#x301; (Chandannagar), Ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ntala&#x301; (Bankura), Por&#x301;a&#x301;ma&#x301;tala&#x301; (Navadviipa), S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hiitala&#x301; (Krishnanagar), Bur&#x301;o Shivatala&#x301; (Chandannagar), etc. Besides this many places have a Ha&#x301;t&#x301;tala&#x301; and a Rathtala&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->If new people make a settlement or are newly established in a place then those places have the name Vasa&#x301;n attached to the end of the name, for example, Ra&#x301;ja&#x301;vasa&#x301;n, Nawa&#x301;bvasa&#x301;n, Mukundavasa&#x301;n, and Nuya&#x301;vasa&#x301;n. Many people mistakenly say Naya&#x301;vasa&#x301;n but this is incorrect. &ldquo;New&rdquo; is nuya&#x301; or noya&#x301; in southern Rarh and north Orissa. Naya&#x301; is a Hindi word. Naya&#x301;-related words in the Bihar languages include nayka&#x301; or navka&#x301;.

<a name="90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->When the British turned Mayurbhanj, Tripura, Coochbihar, etc. into native kingdoms or feudatory kingdoms or vassal kingdoms in accordance with their subsidiary alliance, they summarily included significant portions of them in British India. The concerning kings were considered thereafter as the zamindars of those areas and they used to deposit their land revenue in the collectory. They were not considered native kings in those regions but instead became zamindars. In the remaining portions of their lands they were considered native kings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->The British left the mountainous eastern portion of Tripura in the hands of the Maharaja. In that region the Maharaja of Tripura was a native king and he had his capital there. The densely populated, fertile areas in the west of his kingdom were incorporated into British India. In this way they formed the Brahmanbaria Subdivision from part of the former Kingdom of Tripura and part of the former Sylhet District; along with that they formed British Tripura or Tipperah out of Chandpur and the Comilla district headquarters. Since this British Tripura or Tipperah District was densely populated there was no need to colonize it anew but the Maharaja of Tripura remained the zamindar of a substantial part of this district. He used to deposit the land revenue in the Comilla collectory. He remained the native king in the remaining portion, which was part of Tripura. The spoken Bengali of the Kingdom of Tripura is Sylheti Bengali in the north and Noya&#x301;kha&#x301;li Bengali in the south, which is a blending of Chittagong Bengali and Sylheti Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->Similarly, the British incorporated a vast region from the former kingdom of Coochbihar (its former name was also Ka&#x301;mta&#x301;pur) into British Bengal. They only left eight tha&#x301;na&#x301;s (Coochbihar, Ma&#x301;tha&#x301;bha&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;, Dinha&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, Shiitalkuci, Haldiba&#x301;r&#x301;i, Mekhligainj, Sita&#x301;i, Tupha&#x301;ngainj) under the control of the Maharaja. Rangpur District of the then Province of Bengal was formed out of the areas that the British took control of. Since this region was also more or less densely populated there was no need to make many new land leases. But in the northern part of this region, private lands, or in a few cases leased lands, were appropriated for numerous tea plantations without paying loss compensation, or paying compensation in name only. Since the eastern part of Rangpur District was less populated, many farmers were brought in from outside and land tenures were drawn up. After Rangpur District grew very big it was divided into three parts. The name of the southern portion remained Rangpur. The north was made into a new district, Jalpaiguri, and the northeast portion became Northeast Rangpur District. When the Province of Assam was created in 1912 this Northeast Rangpur District was incorporated into it. Rangpur remained in Bengal Province and Northeast Rangpur was made part of Assam Province. Being somewhat incompatible, northeast Rangpur&#146;s name was changed to Goyalpara. Dhubr&#x301;i was made the district headquarters. The spoken language of Dhubr&#x301;i is Rangpuri Bengali. The spoken language of Coochbihar and Jalpaiguri is also Rangpuri Bengali, however in different parts of the two districts different branches of Rangpuri Bengali are prevalent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->The mountainous regions in the western part of the Kingdom of Mayurbhanj were allowed to remain in the hands of the maharaja and the relatively level regions to the east were incorporated into British Bengal. The maharaja of this region became a zamindar of the British. His land revenue used to be deposited in the collectory at Midnapore. In the remaining areas he remained a native king. The capital of the kingdom was Ba&#x301;ripada&#x301;. The portion that was incorporated into British Bengal was somewhat sparsely populated at that time. There was a small jungle but no mountains to speak of. The British brought in new tenants so the region became known as Nuya&#x301;vasa&#x301;n, that is, &ldquo;where tenants have been newly installed&rdquo;. The spoken language of the western and southern parts of Mayurbhanj is northern Oriya and the spoken language of the northeast part is Kera&#x301; Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->This Kera&#x301; Bengali is a blending of Oriya and Bengali. Many people are aware of the fact that the Oriya and Bengali languages are extremely close neighbours. Their history is also the same to a great extent. The social functions and customs of their communities as well as their anthropological identities are nearly the same. It is impossible to completely separate the two, thus it is meaningless to work up a sweat trying to decide whether this Kera&#x301; Bengali mixture is a dialect of Bengali or a dialect of Oriya. No matter what the leaders or the philologists say, I would say that since this dialect is equally related to both Bengali and Oriya the people there can claim either Bengali or Oriya as their mother tongue as they wish. It is only natural that they should do as suits them best.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->Another native kingdom situated in the far west of Bengal was Sera&#x301;ikela&#x301;. The spoken language of the southern portion of this kingdom (the south bank of the Sain&#x32D;jay River) is Kera&#x301; Bengali. The spoken language of the northern part (the areas of A&#x301;dityapur, Ga&#x301;ma&#x301;riya&#x301;, Sini, Ka&#x301;ndra&#x301;, etc.) is Rarhi Bengali.

If the history of the names of the villages and towns of the countries that do not have a written history is discovered then the history of those countries will also come to light. The Indian people have shown a certain apathy towards history since very ancient times; thus they have comparatively little written history. Stone inscriptions, copper inscriptions and coins offer very little help in assessing history, so if there is a proper and heartfelt effort to discover the history behind the names given to towns and villages then that history can be newly prepared. The greater portion of the history that is taught nowadays in the schools and colleges will then have to be mercilessly discarded.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn1">1</a></b>)  In English they also used to be called &ldquo;Hollanders&rdquo;. This &ldquo;Hollanders&rdquo; became pronounced olanda&#x301;j in Bengali.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn2">2</a></b>)  Many people mistakenly write prasa&#x301;rata&#x301;. Pra &ndash; sr + ghain&#x32D; = prasa&#x301;ra. The word is a qualitative noun. The suffix ta&#x301; [ness] cannot be added to it so the word prasa&#x301;rata&#x301; is wrong from head to toe. It is better that it not be used.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn3">3</a></b>)   In Kishanganj Subdivision there is one such place named Diighalva&#x301;nk. The name indicates what sort of a place it is. I have heard many educated gentlemen pronounce the name &ldquo;D&#x301;iga&#x301;l Bank&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn4">4</a></b>)  Genyokha&#x301;li&#146;s old name was Jiivankha&#x301;li or Ja&#x301;hnaviikha&#x301;li. It was most likely named after the queen of Mahis&#x301;a&#x301;dal, Ja&#x301;hnaviidevii. In order to save Mahis&#x301;a&#x301;dal from the Maratha navy, Ja&#x301;hnaviidevii brought a skilled Portuguese naval force from Bandel or Bonadel (in Portuguese this means &ldquo;beautiful village&rdquo;) and lodged them on her estates in the village of Mirja&#x301;pur. The successors of those Portuguese have nowadays mixed with the Bengali Christians. Arrangements were made for a marriage between a boy named Sunil Kumar and a girl named Saoda&#x301;minii.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn5">5</a></b>)  This fish was called tapasvii fish in Sanskrit because in front of its mouth it has something that looked like a beard. From this comes the Bengali tapse fish.</p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn7">7</a></b>)   The modern name of Dalhousie square is B. B. D. Bag. Here also we have a distortion of history. Would it not have been better to construct something new in the name of the three heroes for which B. B. D. Bag has been named? Lord Dalhousie was a symbol of British imperialism. Still he cannot be erased from the history of India. We pronounce the word &ldquo;Dalhousie&rdquo; but its correct English pronunciation is d&#x301;a&#x301;lu&#x301;zii, as if it were spelled &ldquo;Dal-oozee&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn8">8</a></b>)  In order to facilitate boat traffic the British excavated a linking canal from the Bhagiirathii at Ba&#x301;lii village to the Saraswati River. Due to the digging of this canal, the northern part of Ba&#x301;lii was cut off from the rest of the village. Later, when Hooghly District was partitioned and a new Howrah District was created, the original Ba&#x301;lii village was included within the newly-created Howrah District and the separated Otorpa&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; village remained in Hooghly District.</p>

This marshland [ha&#x301;or&#x301;a] area was mainly known by the name of Ha&#x301;or&#x301;a&#x301; [Howrah]. There were huge banyan trees in the elevated [d&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;] areas of these swamps. One of these very ancient banyan trees is now in the Shivpur botanical gardens. It is probably the oldest banyan tree in India. I have mentioned probably for this reason that there is one of these same ancient banyan trees near Nadia District&#146;s Ba&#x301;gcijjamasedpur. Great numbers of sha&#x301;likh birds used to live in these banyan trees in the swamps, hence the name Sha&#x301;likha&#x301; or Sha&#x301;lkhe.</p>

Very often betho sha&#x301;k grows spontaneously during the winter in potato fields. This gritty, glittering-leafed green is a favourite food of the people. Indeed, Mahaprabhu Caetanyadeva used to love to eat this green. Saciidevii fed Mahaprabhu a curry of this green in Shantipur.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn14"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn14">14</a></b>)  The real name of the city of Patna is Ba&#x301;nkipur. During the Mughal era the capital of Bihar Province was a few miles to the east in A&#x301;zima&#x301;ba&#x301;d. A&#x301;zima&#x301;ba&#x301;d&#146;s present-day name is Patna City. The city was named A&#x301;zima&#x301;ba&#x301;d after the commander-in-chief A&#x301;zim-ush-sha&#x301;n.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="fn15"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.fn15">15</a></b>)  The word patna comes from pattana which means &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; in Sanskrit. &ndash;Trans.</p>
