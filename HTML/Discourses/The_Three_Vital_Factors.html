<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->One point, the vital point that spiritual aspirants must always remember, is that they are the progeny of the Supreme Progenitor, and that Supreme Father is omnipotent and omniscient. So there must not be any inferiority complex in the mind of a sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual practitioner], there must not be any fear complex in the mind of a sa&#x301;dhaka, because sa&#x301;dhakas are progeny of the Supreme Progenitor, and the only goal for them, the only goal for a sa&#x301;dhaka, is that Supreme Father. A sa&#x301;dhaka will have to become one, rather, he will have to be unified, with the Supreme Father &ndash; not united, but unified.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You know, to unite and to unify are two different things. When sand and sugar are mixed together, that physical mixture is unity. They are united: sand and sugar are united. But when water comes in contact with sugar, it is a case of unification. We get sarvat [syrup]. In sarvat, we will not find those separate entities of sugar and water. So your union with the Supreme Father will not be a case of unity, but a case of unification. That supreme unification is the goal of your life, and your march towards Him should be done through three vital factors. And those three factors are Pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;tena, pariprashnena, sevaya&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> [&ldquo;By surrender, spiritual questioning, and servicefulness&rdquo;]. That is, the first point is pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;ta, the second point is pariprashna, and the third point is seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;ta? Pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;ta means offering oneself as an oblation at the altar of the Almighty. People offer oblations for their forefathers &ndash; pin&#x301;d&#x301;am. A sa&#x301;dhaka is to offer himself as an oblation at the altar of the Supreme Father. He is the pin&#x301;d&#x301;am, He is the oblation. This is what is called pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;ta. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The second point is pariprashna. Sometimes people ask questions only for the sake of knowledge, only for the sake of tarka [debate], but it is not pariprashna. Pariprashna means to know what to do and how to do. That is, the person is prepared to do something. He is prepared to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and for that purpose he wants to know how to do, what to do. This special type of question is called pariprashna. Sa&#x301;dhakas have got nothing to do with ordinary prashna [questions]. A sa&#x301;dhaka is to ask pariprashna &ndash; what I am to do, how am I to do. &ldquo;I am ready to do. I have got nothing to do with logicians&#146; philosophy. I want to do.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And the third point is seva&#x301;. I explained before about seva&#x301;. Seva&#x301; means offering maximum service to others and offering minimum service to himself. And where the service offered to himself becomes zero, it is the stage of pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; [becoming established] in seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So you have to come in contact with your Supreme Father through these three items, through these media: pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;ta, pariprashna and seva&#x301;. You are all sa&#x301;dhakas, you are all spiritual aspirants, you will have to do it. And I know certainly you will be successful in your mission.<!-- /block --></p>
