An aspirant churns spiritual and mundane knowledge to separate the spiritual from the mundane (as churning separates butter from buttermilk).]<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Svadeham. Sva means &ldquo;one&#146;s&rdquo;; deha means &ldquo;body&rdquo;. In Sanskrit there are several terms for &ldquo;body&rdquo; &ndash; deham, shariiram, ka&#x301;yam, tanu &ndash; there are so many words. But their meanings are not the same. Tanu &ndash; the root verb tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;; tanu means &ldquo;the wonted expansionist&rdquo;; to expand is its wont, to expand is its characteristic. That is, the body of a babe, the body of a man below thirty-nine years of age, is called tanu. Because up to the age of thirty-nine, the body goes on increasing either internally or externally. And after thirty-nine decay starts, waning starts. So the name for the body after thirty-nine is shariira. To become shiirn&#x301;a is its svabha&#x301;va [nature]. To wane is its svabha&#x301;va. Hence the body of a man after thirty-nine years of age is called shariiram. Shariiram means &ldquo;[that which is] decaying&rdquo;, &ldquo;[that which is] waning&rdquo;. Another word is ka&#x301;yam. The root verb is ci, and the suffix is [ghain&#x32D;]. Ci means &ldquo;to select&rdquo;, &ldquo;to choose&rdquo;, &ldquo;to pluck&rdquo;. Now, in this body there is oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, gold, iron, mercury, and so many factors and so many elements. So this body is an assemblage of so many items. Hence it is called ka&#x301;yam. Ka&#x301;yam means &ldquo;assemblage&rdquo;. And here in this shloka the word deha has been used. Here the root verb is dih. In Sanskrit dih means &ldquo;to adorn&rdquo;, &ldquo;to decorate&rdquo;. So deha means &ldquo;the object that one wants to keep decorated&rdquo;, which is one&#146;s object of adoration. An ugly-looking man also tries to keep his body well-decorated, thus it is  called deha. A man has got maximum attachment for his deha &ndash; not for tanu or shariiram or ka&#x301;yam, but for deha. So here the word deha has been used by the rs&#x301;i, and not shariiram or ka&#x301;yam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Svadeham aran&#x301;im&#x301; krtva&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;The spiritual aspirant should use his deha as aran&#x301;i.&rdquo; What is aran&#x301;i? Aran&#x301;i means &ldquo;wood used as fuel&rdquo;. In ancient times there were no matches. They had to create fire by friction. Now, the main piece of wood was called aran&#x301;i, and the smaller one used for rubbing was called uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. So here the spiritual aspirant should use his deha, the main object of his attachment, as aran&#x301;i, and pran&#x301;ava, that is, his Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra [mantra leading one to the Supreme Goal], as uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. Do you follow? That is, his physical body, his deha, should be in constant touch with his Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Svadeham aran&#x301;im&#x301; krtva&#x301; pran&#x301;avam&#x301; ca uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;im &ndash; &ldquo;using pran&#x301;ava, using the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra, as uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i&rdquo;. Now what is its inner import? What is the import? The human body has a particular rhythm; each and every human body has its peculiar rhythm. And that rhythm is a creation of the person&#146;s reactive momenta. So that rhythm separates him from all other objects of this universe. The reactive momenta of two persons are not the same. So the entitative rhythm of a particular man is purely his. And, just now I said, the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra is to be used as uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. The Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra has a particular acoustic rhythm. Each and every mantra has its own acoustic rhythm. So the entitative rhythm of the spiritual aspirant must be in constant touch with the incantative rhythm of his Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra. That is, a sa&#x301;dhaka, a spiritual aspirant, should always try to make an adjustment between his entitative rhythm and incantative rhythm. And when that adjustment is established he attains the supreme trance of qualified absorption. And this is his goal. Svadeham aran&#x301;im&#x301; krtva&#x301; pran&#x301;avam&#x301; ca uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;im&#x301;. Why should the pran&#x301;ava be used as uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i? That has now been clearly explained. And after that what will happen? Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nanirmathana&#x301;bhya&#x301;sat pa&#x301;sham dahati pan&#x301;d&#x301;itah [&ldquo;A pandit breaks the fetters by churning knowledge (to separate the spiritual from the mundane)&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nanirmathana. Actually the word jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means &ldquo;subjectivization of external objectivities&rdquo;. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam &ndash; the actual import of the term jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam is &ldquo;subjectivization of external physicalities, of external objectives&rdquo;. Now here the rs&#x301;i [sage, author of the shloka, or couplet] prescribes jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam nirmathanam. Nirmathana means &ldquo;to churn&rdquo;. We get butter by churning curd. Now in this jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam there are so many objects &ndash; there is name, there is fame, there is money, there is landed property, there are so many items. Now by churning this jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam the spiritual aspirant separates a&#x301;tman, the mu&#x301;lavastu [basic substance], from the impurities, from the mundane impurities. That is, by churning jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam you are to separate the spirit from the impurities. And that&#146;s why nirmathanam is required. And this nirmathanam is being done by &ndash; what? By this ghars&#x301;anakriya&#x301; [rubbing] of aran&#x301;i and uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nanirmathana&#x301;bhya&#x301;sat pa&#x301;sham dahati pan&#x301;d&#x301;itah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What is the result of the friction, the friction between aran&#x301;i and uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i? Fire is created. So as a result of this friction what happens? Certainly spiritual fire is created, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;gni is created; and what will that sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;gni do? All the impurities of the mind will cease to exist, will be destroyed; and he who does these things is a pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The word pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita can be used only for such spiritual aspirants and for nobody else. Because pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;Self-realization&rdquo;. Pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;subjective reality&rdquo;. Pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;knowing the hub of this Cosmological order&rdquo;. And he who has acquired pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; is a pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita. Just by learning Sanskrit one cannot become a pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita. If one aspires to become a pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita, one will have to know oneself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Aham&#x301; Brahma&#x301;smiiti buddhih ta&#x301;mitah pra&#x301;ptah pan&#x301;d&#x301;itah [&ldquo;One who has the sense, or intelligence, of knowing that &lsquo;I am Brahma&rsquo; is a pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita&rdquo;]. &ldquo;I am that characteristic seity&rdquo; &ndash; this supreme realization is called pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;. And he who has realized this pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, he who has acquired this pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, is a pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita. You are all sa&#x301;dhakas. I will ask you to obey this order of the rs&#x301;i, which I also prescribe, and become pan&#x301;d&#x301;itas.<!-- /block --></p>
