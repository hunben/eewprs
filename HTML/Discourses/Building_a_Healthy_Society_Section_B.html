<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Not only are the superstitions discarded, but the fundamental principles of some of the existing laws of society, like allegiance to the laws of society and state, take second place. Of primary importance is one&#146;s allegiance to Brahma. Harsh social punishment such as creating outcasts or placing restrictions on widows or women in general in participating in certain social functions, do not find any place in our society. Ananda Marga has formed a society which frames its laws on the basis of common ideals in order to develop the idea of the oneness of all humanity. This society is radically different from any existing society, for it provides a society with a common bond where there is no distinction between class or sex, where no one is declared an outcast or punished without being given the chance for self-reform, and where no laws are framed keeping in view the interests of only a few individuals. In such a society no one is weak or downtrodden and no one is allowed to exploit others. Such a society had been dreamed of and advocated earlier by moralists and idealists, but never before has such a system been achieved, as it has been with Ananda Marga, which combines all the qualities of the different economic classes of the world in one individual. Never has such a system been conceived of by any of the numerous thinkers and lawgivers of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->If Ananda Marga is a revolution in the economic and social spheres, it is an even greater revolution in the mental and spiritual spheres.<!-- /block --></p>
