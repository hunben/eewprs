<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You boys and you girls, do you realize why you were born? You were born to do something to please Parama Purus&#x301;a. Always move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, through your actions, through your thoughts, through your contemplation: and your goal will be attained, your purpose in coming to this world will be fulfilled. The only duty of human beings is to move along the path of righteousness until they reach the Supreme Entity. Until they touch the sweet feet of the Supreme Entity, they cannot stop their movement. Now, how will they move? By maintaining a proper adjustment with the external world, by rendering maximum service to the external world in all possible ways. Thus the unit entity will move towards Supreme fulfilment, while the hands and feet and mind are fully utilized in service to the external world. You must lift your minds above all feeling of difference: differences among human beings, such as social disparities or economic disparities; differences between humans and other living creatures; and differences between living and non-living creatures. You must move along the path of Neohumanism towards the Supreme Goal, with your mind moving like a subterranean flow. Until that Supreme Goal is reached, you will have to advance tirelessly, ignoring all fatigue and exhaustion. You must reflect in your personal life the very spirit of Caraeveti, caraeveti &ndash; &ldquo;Move ever onwards, move ever onwards.&rdquo; May you be victorious.<!-- /block --></p>
