<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Nowadays some intellectuals have become very vocal about progress in different spheres of life. First, the fact is that progress is not in a straight line, it is always pulsative and rhythmic. Secondly &ndash; and this is also to be remembered &ndash; the speed of progress varies in different places and different spheres - the speed changes according to the sphere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Within the circle of human existence there are three spheres &ndash; material, mental and spiritual. Human development is not the same in all three spheres. It is rhythmic and pulsative. Where there is more development in the material sphere, development in the mental and spiritual spheres is less. Where there is more development in the mental sphere, development in the material and spiritual spheres is less. And where there is more development in the spiritual sphere, the development is less in the material and mental spheres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sarve ca pashavah santi&rdquo;. In the first stage of creation, all beings are animal-like. In the age of material predominance, their features in the material sphere are more prominent and manifested. The rhythm of speed of progress maintains a balance with the objects of the material world. This stage is called &ldquo;pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra&rdquo;. In this stage people become capable of deciding how to proceed, where to go and what the final goal of life is. Because of their being animal-like spiritualists call them &ldquo;pashu&rdquo;. Shiva is called by the name of Pashupati at this stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the second stage of development, progress is greater in the mental sphere. The mind is more prone to pleasure and pain. This stage is called &ldquo;viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra&rdquo; or &ldquo;viirabha&#x301;va&rdquo; in Tantra. Struggle in the mental sphere is harder and more complicated than in the material sphere. As such, more mental power, more powerful nerve fibres and nerve cells are required. Spiritualists or sa&#x301;dhakas confronted with mental struggles are viira, or brave. They are not ordinary people. Those sa&#x301;dhakas are viira; hence this stage is called &ldquo;viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra&rdquo;. They are the leaders, the pioneers, and their object of adoration is called &ldquo;viireshvara&rdquo;. Therefore, in the second stage, the sa&#x301;dhaka calls Parama Purus&#x301;a by the name of Viireshvara. He or she says &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, I am viira by your grace. You are my Parama Purus&#x301;a. Therefore You are Viireshvara.&rdquo; Another name of Shiva is Viireshvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the final or spiritual sphere, the rhythm of speed is on the spiritual level. In the spiritual sphere there is only one cause for grief: &ldquo;My Parama Purus&#x301;a is my own. He is my Father. And yet there is such a distance between Him and me.&rdquo; This distance is painful and unbearable for the sa&#x301;dhaka. This stage is called &ldquo;divya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra&rdquo; or &ldquo;divyabha&#x301;va&rdquo; in Tantra. In this stage, Parama Purus&#x301;a is called &ldquo;Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo; or &ldquo;Deva&#x301;dideva&rdquo; &ndash; the God of gods. At this level the sadhaka becomes a deva, a vibrational existence. The sa&#x301;dhaka can vibrate the world, can create a vibration in the universe, and is thus a deva. The sa&#x301;dhaka capable of creating vibrations calls Parama Purus&#x301;a by the name of Maha&#x301;deva. Maha&#x301;deva is another name of Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Shiva is called by three different names at three different levels of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. When a sa&#x301;dhaka is on the material level, he or she calls Him &ldquo;Pashupati&rdquo; when on the mental level, he or she calls Him &ldquo;Viireshvara&rdquo;; and when on the spiritual level, he or she calls Him &ldquo;Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo;. &ldquo;Deva&rdquo; means a vibrational force, and the collective vibrational force, or vibrational rays, are known as &ldquo;Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo;. He controls all the devas, all the vibrational forces in the universe, and thus He is &ldquo;Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->But, being creator and controller of all the vibrations, He is not under any material or mental bondage. Therefore under no circumstances is it possible to use vibrational words for Him. And therefore, on the last level, this has to be said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Tava tattvam na ja&#x301;na&#x301;mi kiidrsho&#146;si Maheshvara;<br>Ya&#x301;drsho&#146;si Maha&#x301;deva ta&#x301;drshaya namo namah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;O Paramadeva, O Maha&#x301;deva, O controller of vibrational forces and all divya&#x301;ca&#x301;rii sa&#x301;dhakas. I do not know what you are. Therefore, regarding You, no attributional prayer is possible. This much I positively know &ndash; that You are something. I do not know what kind of personality You are, but I know this much, that You are definitely a special personality. I submit my prayer to You, whom I do not know fully and who are beyond all my conceptions.&rdquo; We must keep in mind that while progressing in spiritual practices we should direct all our propensities and vibrations towards the cosmic existence. The cosmic existence is beyond the scope of time and place.<!-- /block --></p>
