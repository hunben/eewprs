<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Cognitive Faculty is the Supreme Subjectivity, and all other entities are His objects. Nothing remains secret or unknown or unseen for Him. You can not do anything secretly. You can not even think anything secretly. And as you know, human sadhana is a movement from electronic imperfection to nuclear perfection. So, everything in the universe, anything and everything, is just like electrons moving round Him. It may be a big elephant or it may be a small ant, there remains no difference for Him. All are His loving children.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sama plus&#x301;ina&rdquo; &ndash; You may say this insect is a very small insect. It is plusin, that is, a white ant, an insignificant creature. &ldquo;Sama mashakena&rdquo; &ndash; mashaka means &ldquo;mosquito&rdquo;. He has the same love, the same attraction or He attaches the same importance to a mosquito also. A mosquito is a very small creature. &ldquo;Sama na&#x301;gena&rdquo; &ndash; He has the same love, the same importance for na&#x301;ga also. What is the meaning of na&#x301;ga? There are three meanings of na&#x301;ga in Sam&#x301;skrta. One meaning is &ldquo;python&rdquo; &ndash; a big snake. Another meaning is &ldquo;aera&#x301;vata&rdquo;, that is, mammoth in English. There are several other meanings also. Na&#x301;ga means pertaining to hills. &ldquo;Sama ebhistribhih lokaeh&rdquo; &ndash; the same importance, same attachment, same love is for the entire tribhuvana. Tribhuvana means the expressed world, the psychic world and the astral world or, you may say, Causal World.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->He sees everything. He feels everything. Nothing remains unseen or unfelt. His position is just like a clandestine light. Now, when the focus is on the stage you will see so many things happening on the stage &ndash; an actor is acting, a dancer is dancing and so many things are happening on the stage and that clandestine light sees everything, all the happenings. Similarly, whatever you do, whatever you think, whatever you smell, whatever you taste, He sees, He witnesses everything and when nothing happens on the stage, that is, there is neither any actor nor any dancer nor any singer on the stage then that clandestine light also sees that vacuum. It is also witnessing the fact that nothing is happening on the stage. Similarly when you do nothing &ndash; when you are suspended in your causal body or in your samanya deha then you do nothing &ndash; even that stage of yours is witnessed by Him. Similarly, when you are not in a position to do anything or think, smell or taste, He witnesses that also. So, you are closely associated, closely related to Him and He is closely related to you. You are never helpless, never alone. You are always with Him and so you should never entertain pessimism or any inferiority complex.<!-- /block --></p>
