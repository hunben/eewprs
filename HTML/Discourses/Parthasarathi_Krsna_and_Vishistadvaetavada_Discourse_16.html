<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There are many people who dislike hero-worship, and then again, there are many people who only say that they dislike it, although they actually do like it. It is an ingrained human trait that generally people do not have sufficient courage to undertake those tasks that require courage. But if someone takes the lead courageously, then others will cooperate. When a brave person comes forward, other people become brave due to his or her example. This is also an ingrained human trait. That is why whenever a righteous person undertakes a noble cause, honest people willingly extend their unstinting cooperation to him or her. Hero-worship of this sort is quite natural. If anyone opposes this natural thing, it should be understood that he or she suffers from a fear complex and criticizes hero-worship just to hide it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Hero-worship does not necessarily mean, however, that whatever a great person does should be blindly supported. As previously said, when a virtuous person courageously undertakes a noble cause, it is but natural that other people will extend their support. It is a natural human trait.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->We see in Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi an expression of [the qualities that elicit] that trait in a powerful way. He was a true representative of the hopes and aspirations of good people, that is, of people devoted to the Lord. Who is that entity who fulfils the hopes and aspirations of devoted people, of righteous and virtuous people (the hopes and aspirations of virtuous people generally are virtuous and good)? It is Parama Purus&#x301;a who does so. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi stole the hearts and minds of people in the past and continues to do so today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In my last discourse I was discussing Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;uva&#x301;da. I said that if the sparks coming out of the original fire merge again in their source it is not a matter of sorrow but a matter of joy. But if the sparks lose themselves forever in the yawning chasms of darkness, there cannot be any greater sorrow. This getting lost forever is termed pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha [total annihilation] in Sanskrit. They are lost forever and cannot return to the original source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s teachings there is no mention whatsoever of this pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. Even regarding the most sinful people He said, Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; vina&#x301;sha&#x301;ya ca dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m [&ldquo;(I have come) for the protection of the virtuous and the destruction of the wicked&rdquo;]. Here He talks of vina&#x301;sha [destruction], not pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. What is the meaning of vina&#x301;sha? It means a vishis&#x301;t&#x301;a [special] form of na&#x301;sha. And na&#x301;sha means change of form from an undeveloped form to a more developed one. In this process something is apparently destroyed, but actually is metamorphosed into something better. For example, the ugly silkworm, when it leaves its cocoon, is metamorphosed into a beautiful butterfly. The silkworm has not met its total annihilation but has simply undergone a change for the better. Vina&#x301;sha&#x301;ya ca dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m&#x301; [&ldquo;for the destruction of the wicked&rdquo;]. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi never looked upon anyone as His enemy or as an object of hatred, not even the most wicked people. However, if people were antisocial, if they harmed others and became a cause of immense terror, He destroyed them. Why does this destruction occur? Not to send them to eternal darkness but to destroy the Ravana<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in them, so that they could acquire a better human form.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; means &ldquo;for the protection of the virtuous&rdquo;. First I will explain what the term sa&#x301;dhu really means. In popular Indian usage, sa&#x301;dhu means those persons who smear themselves with white ashes, keep locks of matted hair on their heads and wear white turbans and white clothes. The leader of a group of such sa&#x301;dhus is called a moha&#x301;nta. Those who may or may not use coloured ashes (white, red, crimson, etc.), who wear either red or saffron turbans and clothes and who suffix their names with a&#x301;nanda [bliss], are known as sannya&#x301;sins [renunciants]. Sa&#x301;dhus on the other hand usually use the word da&#x301;sa [servant] together with their first name, such as Sumera Da&#x301;sa, Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na Da&#x301;sa, Ra&#x301;ma Da&#x301;sa, etc. Their Indian or international leader is known as maha&#x301;man&#x301;d&#x301;aleshvara, whereas the head of a small monastery in known as mat&#x301;ha&#x301;dhiisha. So these are the two broad classifications &ndash; sa&#x301;dhu and sannya&#x301;sii. This classification is based upon outward appearance, external criteria.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What is the inner truth? The word sannya&#x301;sii is derived sat + nya&#x301;s + suffix nini, first case ending, singular number. Sannya&#x301;sii means one who, out of noble intentions and benevolent outlook, has sacrificed his or her everything for the highest goal in life, Parama Purus&#x301;a. The word sa&#x301;dhu can be interpreted in two ways, but in both cases the meaning is the same. The first interpretation is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Ja&#x301;tasya hi jagati jantavah sa&#x301;dhujiivita&#x301;h;<br>Ye punarn&#x301;eha ja&#x301;yante shes&#x301;a&#x301;h jat&#x301;haragardabha&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[The lives of those human beings who are sa&#x301;dhu (upright), and who are not born again, I call successful. The lives of the rest are no better than those of donkeys.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It is a fact that not all human beings are righteous. Even though one possesses a human framework, one&#146;s demeanour, conduct and thought processes may be worse than those of an animal. Hence it is said that a person who has lived his or her life honestly, who has not harmed others to further his or her own interests, and has worked for the welfare of others in every way, is a sa&#x301;dhu. He or she is not required to be reborn on this earth. He or she becomes one with Parama Purus&#x301;a after death, and the separate identity is lost in Parama Purus&#x301;a. In the Bengali literature of 1200 years ago it is mentioned, Je je ujuba&#x301;t&#x301;e gela&#x301; ana&#x301;bat&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; bhaela&#x301; soi. That is, &ldquo;One who has followed the straight path of the sus&#x301;umna&#x301; canal<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> upwards does not return.&rdquo; He or she becomes one with Parama Purus&#x301;a, losing his or her separate existence. To come down to a lower level of consciousness, it is necessary to maintain a separate existence. Just because one has a human form and just because one besmears one&#146;s body with ashes, wears white and uses the name Da&#x301;sa, it does not mean that one is a sa&#x301;dhu. Shiva made a pointed comment regarding such people: &ldquo;Yes, these people no doubt have human bodies, but in their thoughts and behaviour they are not sa&#x301;dhu, not honest. Though I accept their mothers as humans, they themselves are donkeys, donkeys born out of human wombs.&rdquo; A true sa&#x301;dhu is a real spiritualist, a spiritually-evolved person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->You may wonder why Shiva has used such strong language. Being as vehemently opposed to injustice as Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was, Shiva was the prototype of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. When one has to speak or fight against injustice, or take administrative action against it, one must not betray any weakness. One must denounce it in the strongest language, because only strong words can strike the right chord in the heart of a sinful person. This is the proper interpretation of sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Yes, Shiva was very stern in this regard. Those who preach meaningless, irrational dogmas and thereby enormously harm society, who crudify the human intellect, who do not leave any scope to think of anything other than mundane problems, who throttle the very freedom of thought, Shiva called Lokavya&#x301;mohaka&#x301;rakah. That is, &ldquo;They infect society with a form of mental disease.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The second interpretation of sa&#x301;dhu is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Pra&#x301;na&#x301;h yatha&#x301;tmano&#146;bhiis&#x301;t&#x301;ah bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;na&#x301;m api te tatha&#x301;;<br>A&#x301;tmaopamyena bhuta&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; daya&#x301;m&#x301; kurvanti sa&#x301;dhavah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The life of every creature is as valuable to itself as one&#146;s own life is valuable to a human being: one who remembers this and shows kindness to all, is termed sa&#x301;dhu.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->These are the interpretations of sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;na&#x301;m [&ldquo;for the protection of sa&#x301;dhus&rdquo;]. Some so-called moralists declare, &ldquo;I don&#146;t do any wrong, so I&#146;m a moralist. I do good to others, so I&#146;m surely a sa&#x301;dhu.&rdquo; To this I will reply that they are not sa&#x301;dhus. Only that person who lives in constant God-awareness deserves to be called a sa&#x301;dhu, a spirituo-moralist.  One who is not constantly absorbed in the thought of God cannot lead a moral life for any length of time &ndash; his or her morality may collapse at any moment. Perhaps one can resist the temptation to take a bribe of ten thousand rupees, but cannot resist the temptation of a million rupees. But not only will a person who is an ardent devotee of the Lord resist the temptation of a million rupees; if you offer that person the emperorship of the universe, the person will say, &ldquo;No, the total worth of all this is far, far less than that of the Lord. I am not prepared to accept all these worthless things in exchange for Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->You now understand that by merely smearing ashes on one&#146;s body one does not qualify to be a sa&#x301;dhu. In fact, one should keep such sa&#x301;dhus at arm&#146;s length, because if they cover their bodies with ashes to hide the filth deep within themselves, it means that a lot of such filth must have accumulated. One must be wary of them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Tra&#x301;n&#x301;a means temporary relief from distress. Suppose there has been a great calamity such as a flood or famine which has inflicted immense suffering on the victims. The measures you take to alleviate the suffering of those in distress are called tra&#x301;n&#x301;a vyavastha&#x301; [relief activities]. For instance, you may visit an afflicted area and distribute ten thousand maunds [about forty thousand kilos] of flour among the people. You have done very commendable tra&#x301;n&#x301;a, but how long will that flour last? Ten or twenty years? No, your stock will be exhausted within a week and again the necessity to start a relief operations will arise. This is tra&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a is the kind of tra&#x301;n&#x301;a whose beneficial effects continue to recur over an endless period of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a gave a permanent assurance to righteous people that He would protect them. He wanted to develop the way of life, the educational system and the economy of the society in such a way that all good people might find solutions for their mundane, supra-mundane and spiritual problems, and permanent relief from the three kinds of bondages [physical, mental and spiritual].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Vina&#x301;sha&#x301;ya ca dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m means &ldquo;for the destruction of the wicked&rdquo;. Here &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; implies change of form. Change occurs, but this change is for the better: the previous form is replaced by a new one. Perhaps Ravana and Kansa were reborn as ideal devotees; their previous forms were replaced by better substitutes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Who are dus&#x301;krtas [the wicked]? Those who cause harm to innocent people either out of self-interest or group-interest are called dus&#x301;krtas. Such antisocial people are a burden on a civilized society, a black spot on society. For such people there is only deha&#x301;tmava&#x301;da and dehaparin&#x301;a&#x301;mava&#x301;da [materialistic doctrines of Charvaka philosophy].<!-- /block --></p>

It throws the cultural and spiritual values of life into the garbage and destroys the very future of humanity. This is gross materialism and those [[who]] support it, consciously or unconsciously, should be branded as dus&#x301;krtaka&#x301;riis.

Suppose a society is moving in a particular direction with a certain philosophy: suddenly it receives a jolt from somewhere and stops, not knowing which way to go. Confused, it begins moving again in another direction. The transitional point between the two flows is called yuga sandhi. And each one of the particular flows of a society is known as an &ldquo;epoch&rdquo; in English, yuga in Sanskrit. One particular epoch ends and a new one follows. One set of ideas and values ends and a new set begins. At the transitional point, human beings become confused: they lose the ability to discriminate between dharma and adharma, what they should and what they should not do. At that moment, the advent of a great personality becomes an imperative necessity. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi came only to teach people what dharma is and what adharma is, what to do and what not to do, and which path would bring the highest fulfilment in their lives. He arrived at the right time, the transitional period in history; so He said, Sambhava&#x301;mi yuge yuge [&ldquo;I incarnate Myself from age to age&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Thus Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was the ideal upholder of the hopes and aspirations of the devotees. He drew all created beings close to Him. Those who did not come to Him He destroyed, to set them on the right path.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Thus Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi has no relationship with Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;uva&#x301;da. Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;u sits in one place in the universe and does nothing [when some sparks become lost in the eternal darkness]. So Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;u cannot be compared with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is the very symbol of infinite life-force. He wants to take all with Him. He is the nearest and dearest of all. No one is insignificant, no one is negligible. He belongs to one and all. What Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi taught through His personal life cannot be explained or taught through Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;uva&#x301;da.<!-- /block --></p>
