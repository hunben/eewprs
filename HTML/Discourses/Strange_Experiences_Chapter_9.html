<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Dipten, Prashanta and I used to study together at Vidyasagar College. The three of us were extremely close friends. We used to serve proxy for each other.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> We would play truant together and go to the movies, and sit together in cafes and chat. Despite being so close, we did not even know whose families lived where.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Those happy days came to an end before our very eyes. Prashanta and I both had difficult family circumstances. My difficulties were particularly heavy. On the day of our parting the three of us went to the cinema together, ate to our hearts&#146; content and noted down each others&#146; addresses. We promised that whether or not we would write each other under ordinary circumstances, we would definitely let each other know about any major good or bad news.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Nearly four years passed. Those who were such close friends did not even write each other. Well, at least I didn&#146;t write. I kept track though of who was doing what. After being actively engaged for some time in India&#146;s independence movement, considering my difficult family circumstances, I had to take up a government job like a good son. The news drifted my way that Prashanta seemed to have gone to America to take some kind of training, while Dipten was studying at Calcutta Medical College. I felt a little angry and disappointed. I thought, studying in medical school or enlisting in the army might not be such major news. But is Prashanta&#146;s going to America such an everyday event? No, they have surely forgotten me. Then let me forget about them too.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->I did not have to stay angry with them for too long. One day, coming home from the office I saw that a huge letter had come from America. Elated with joy, I tore open the envelope. But after reading it I became quite distressed. He had written: &ldquo;Hey, what&#146;s the news of fifty-eight?&rdquo; Dipten&#146;s roll number was fifty-eight, so we used to call him by that name. &ldquo;I&#146;ve probably offended you. I hadn&#146;t informed you before coming to this country. But even after you left Kolkata I&#146;d met up with him a few times. On the day of my departure he&#146;d even seen me off to the ship. But after sending two letters to their home address in Bhawanipur and not getting any response, I gave up writing. But how could I possibly forget! I think about you a lot, and this afternoon it was as though I saw Dipten right before my eyes! In the afternoon I was sitting in the library and going through a few books&#8230; I don&#146;t think anyone else was there in that huge room. Something strange suddenly happened. I could sense somebody&#146;s presence. I felt as though someone was trying to drag my mind from my book.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;My gaze suddenly fell towards the window on my right side. Standing near the window I saw Dipten, and in his hand he had a blunt blade. I clearly heard what he said: &lsquo;Hey, can you check and see how sharp the blade is?&rsquo; Just as soon as I reached out to take the blade from his hand he drove it right through his own throat. A stream of blood gushed out. Next he seemed to moan as he stood, the black shadow of death descending across his eyes and face. I watched transfixed like a statue. I was powerless to move. When I regained my senses I looked around &ndash; where was Dipten? I started to wonder whether what I had seen was true or a dream. Or something not quite real, but not quite a dream either. I decided to write you a letter immediately. Let me know right away, brother &ndash; is Dipten all right or not?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Upon getting the letter, I immediately wrote to my friend Mihir Banerjee asking him to tell me in detail everything he knew regarding Dipten. He wrote, &ldquo;Dipten was studying quite well in the medical college. But since he had to depend on money from his in-laws, he was extremely ashamed. His wife would torment him about this constantly. Not able to bear the insult, one evening he went to a park in Kolkata and overdosed on opium. Deep into the night he came to the notice of one of the park&#146;s gardeners. Despite desperately trying to save him, he made all the doctors&#146; efforts futile and passed on to the other side. At that time his fair complexion seemed to have vanished somewhere &ndash; it was as though someone had poured ink over his entire body.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Having read Mihir&#146;s letter, I realized that Dipten died in the last part of the night prior to the afternoon Prashanta had seen him put a blade to his throat.<!-- /block --></p>
