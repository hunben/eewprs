<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[filler] The Lily and the Moon<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Train yourself in the ideal of the lily, which blossoms in the mud and has to keep itself engaged in struggle for existence day in and day out, parrying, bracing, and fighting the shocks of muddy water and storms and squalls and sundry other vicissitudes of fortune, and yet it does not forget the moon above. It keeps its love for the moon constantly alive. It seems, however, but a most ordinary flower. There is nothing extraordinary about it. Still this most ordinary little flower has a romantic tie with the great moon. Similarly, you may be an ordinary creature &ndash; you may have to pass your days in the ups and downs of your worldly existence &ndash; still do not forget that Supreme One. Keep all your desires inclined towards Him. Always keep yourselves merged in His thought. Go deep into the mood of that Infinite Love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[photo caption] What you love most in the world is Baba for you. For me, you little boys and girls are Baba.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[filler] Is He moving? No, no, He is not. He lies motionless like the stump of the tree. Is He far away? No, no, He is not. He is very close. He is the Life of my life. He is within you, within me. He is within and without all and at all places. When a sa&#x301;dhaka gets adequately acquainted with His Blissful Entity, we say that he is established in God. At that stage both inside and outside attain unity. Mind then remains aloof from the attraction of trifles, and real acquaintance is made with the Supreme Being. While the body remains in the mortal world, the soul is merged in the Supreme Soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[filler] Life is a spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and the result is to be offered at the altar of the Almighty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[filler] You are never alone or helpless. The force that guides the stars, guides you too.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[filler] The persons who can dedicate their all to the thought of the Great and the inspiration of the Supreme are verily the greatest heroes. Such heroes indeed are the virtuous and they alone are capable of taking human history from darkness to light.<!-- /block --></p>
