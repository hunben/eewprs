<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Last night&#146;s discourse was regarding the value of <i>kiirtana</i> in spiritual life. The entire spiritual world is based on divine love. You are the creation. You are the created. And the Supreme Entity is your creator. Your relationship with Him is the relationship of love, not of hatred, or any other such thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You see, even if you are a sinner, a so-called sinner &ndash; I said so-called sinner, because I never hate anybody, I never scold anybody, saying that you are a sinner. A father can never hate his son or daughter. He may scold, he may punish, but he cannot hate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> cannot do two things, and there lies His imperfection. He cannot create a second <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. He always remains a singular Entity. He loves, but while loving He wants that entity to also become <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> like Him. But as soon as that entity becomes <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> that entity becomes one with the original <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. So <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> always remains One. He cannot create a second <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. And the second thing he cannot do is: He cannot hate anybody. The society may hate a sinner. The law may hate a sinner. The family may hate a sinner. But <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> cannot hate anybody. Even if He wants to hate such a man, or such a girl, He cannot.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->You see, everybody in this universe is within <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. He sees everybody within His mind, and because everybody is within His mind, He cannot hate a mental figure of His. So everybody should know that he is not an object of hatred, or object of &ndash; what should I say &ndash; compassion. No, you are not an object of compassion, either. It is your right, it is your birthright. You get help from the Supreme Father. To attain the supreme state of bliss is your birthright. You will get it from your Father as a birthright, and not as a mark of compassion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> cannot do these two things. That is why I said that the arena of spirituality is based on Divine love. You may or may not be a learned person. You may or may not have a good history. Your only qualification is that you are the affectionate progeny of the Supreme Progenitor. You are His object of affection. Even if you forget Him He will not forget you. He cannot forget you, because everything in this Universe is His mental creation. And as long as His mind is there, you are within His mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->He cannot say, &ldquo;Get out, get out! I don&#146;t want to see your face.&rdquo; He cannot say that, because in that case you will ask Him, &ldquo;O Lord, you say, &lsquo;Get out,&rsquo; but where am I to go? I would always be within Your mind. And if You say, &lsquo;Get out, go beyond the periphery of My mind,&rsquo; then certainly O Lord, You are not infinite because there is something beyond Your mind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;So just to maintain the prestige and dignity of Your name, You are to tolerate what I do and what I think. And that&#146;s why it is Your duty to guide me. I am Your son, I am Your daughter. I am to do according to Your dictates.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And not only is this birthright enjoyed by human beings, but by all living creatures. Not only living creatures, but by all animate and inanimate objects. From the mighty mammoth to the small blade of grass, everybody enjoys his birthright. Nobody is insignificant. Nobody is unimportant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Disparity may be encouraged by a defective social order, or by defective isms, but disparity is never supported or encouraged by the Father. The Father&#146;s love is for all, so nobody is helpless. Nobody is shelterless. And nobody&#146;s future is sealed forever. So in the realm of spirituality you should remember that Divine love is the guiding point, is the terminating point, is the desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->One may or may not establish oneself in the actional field. One may or may not establish oneself in the field of intellectuality. One may or may not establish oneself in the mundane sphere. But one must not forget this fact &ndash; that the Supreme Entity is with you, and loves you like anything. And the only goal of one&#146;s propensities must be Him. That is, all the propensities of the human mind should be goaded unto the Supreme Existence. Humanity must not be engaged in actional infighting or intellectual extravaganza. Man&#146;s origin, man&#146;s starting-point, is in Divine love, and his culminating point, his terminating point, lies in Divine existence. It is the Supreme truth of this universe.<!-- /block --></p>
