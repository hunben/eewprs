<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Satyabha&#x301;ma&#x301; and Rukmin&#x301;ii, Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s consorts, were always spoken of together. Satyabha&#x301;ma&#x301; was adept in social service, government administration and the art of warfare. Perhaps you know the story of how she once led her country to victory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Once, in Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s absence, a neighbouring king, Narakasura,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> attacked Dwaraka, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s capital. (By the way, the Dwaraka of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time is no more. It long since became submerged under the Arabian sea. The old city of Dwaraka is sleeping under the Arabian sea: I would say about twenty-six miles west of the present-day Dwaraka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Immediately after Narakasura attacked Dwaraka, Satyabha&#x301;ma&#x301; lost no time and launched a fierce counterattack against the invading forces. Narakasura&#146;s army was defeated and he died on the battlefield. The day Narakasura was killed was the day before the new-moon day of the month of Karttik [mid-October to mid-November]. The whole city of Dwaraka was transported with joy. They jubilantly celebrated by lighting fourteen candles and, on the following evening, worshipped Satyabha&#x301;ma&#x301; with festivities and diipa&#x301;valii [elaborate lights]. Even to this day, people in some parts of India worship Diipa&#x301;nvita&#x301; Maha&#x301;laks&#x301;mii [the goddess of good fortune] with great revelry, shooting off firecrackers. On this same day, Bengalees conduct the worship called Shya&#x301;ma&#x301; Pu&#x301;ja&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The northwestern Indian wave [of social festivities] reached Bengal. On this day, some Bengali families first worship Alaks&#x301;mii [the goddess of misfortune]. (Alaks&#x301;mii here symbolizes Narakasura.) They worship her in the early evening. And in the late evening, around eight o&#146;clock, they worship Laks&#x301;mii, the goddess of fortune, symbolizing Satyabha&#x301;ma&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Let us come to Rukmin&#x301;ii. Rukmin&#x301;ii was born in Arunachala. This territory was known as NEFA [North Eastern Frontier Agency] during the British period. During the rule of the Ahom Dynasty, this area was next to Assam and the Kamrup kingdom. It was known as Baliapara and continued to be called Baliapara into the early British rule.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Rukmin&#x301;ii was famous for her ingrained spiritual fervour. She took an abiding interest in propagating dharma and accelerating the spiritual elevation of her fellow human beings. People would change their outlook when they came in close proximity to this spiritual personality. Even those with a crude, mundane outlook would change into ardent spiritual seekers.<!-- /block --></p>
