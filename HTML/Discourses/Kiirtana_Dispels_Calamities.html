<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I was saying yesterday that <I>kiirtana</I> is a valuable aid in spiritual practice (sadhana) to accelerate the speed of human progress towards the Supreme Conciousness - &ldquo;<I>sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;saha&#x301;yakam</I>.&rdquo; But <I>kiirtana</I> is not only helpful in the realm of spirituality, but also in all spheres of life; it banishes physical troubles and tribulations as well. <I>Kiirtana</I> fights against all mundane difficulties and finally becomes victorious.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->How does this happen? At the time of <I>kiirtana</I>, so many people, so many devotees assemble, and all their collective physical energies function unitedly. But more than that their collective psychic energies are flowing in the same channel under the inspiration of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. So many minds are being loved by <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, so many minds are being guided and inspired by that Supra-Celestial Entity. So at the place of <I>kiirtana</I>, not only will there be a huge concentration of physical energies, but also of psychic energy which will remove collective accumulated miseries of this material, quinquelemental world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Moreover, those people doing <I>kiirtana</I> are the devotees of the Lord, and they have already placed a throne for <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> in their hearts. So when there is <I>kiirtana</I>, <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> immediately comes to sit on the throne of their hearts. The divine seat, the universal hub of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> is shifted there. That spot becomes the capital of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Why does He come there? &ldquo;I will not sit on the thrones of the devotees&#146; hearts&rdquo; &ndash; <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> cannot say this. He will have to sit there, He will be compelled to sit there. In this way the unit minds, by the inspiration they receive from <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>, become irresistibly powerful. No worldly obstacles can stand before their tremendous spiritual force. Thus <I>kiirtana</I> is helpful not only for spiritual sadhana but also for removing worldly difficulties.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The physical afflictions of this material world are caused partly by nature, and partly by human beings themselves. Now, whatever might be the physical miseries &ndash; be they natural or man-made &ndash; if people collectively chant <I>kiirtana</I>, the calamities are dispelled then and there. In case of natural calamities like flood, famine, drought or epidemic, or man-made calamities, miseries and tortures - if <I>kiirtana</I> is chanted with maximum sincerity, it will bring direct relief in no time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In addition, <I>kiirtana</I> removes the collective psychic afflictions as well - those which are already existing, and those which have not yet arrived but about which we have premonitions of their impending arrival. If <I>kiirtana</I> is done in advance, those impending troubles disappear. Why do they disappear? They are dispelled not merely because of the collective mental force of so many people, but also due to the impact of so many minds moving with tremendous speed under the inspiration of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->At the place of <I>kiirtana</I>, not only the people who are themselves doing <I>kiirtana</I> will be benefited, but also those who are not participating &ndash; and even those who are not participating and who do not even like it &ndash; they will also be benefited! Those who listen sincerely to the chanting of <I>kiirtana</I> will be benefited and those who do not listen sincerely but simply hear inadvertently without any respect, they too will be benefited. &ldquo;<I>shraddhaya&#x301; helaya&#x301; va&#x301;</I>&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;either with veneration or without&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->That is why I say that it is imperative for every intelligent person, every wise person, every clever person, to always do <I>kiirtana</I>, without any consideration of time, place and person. And those who do <I>kiirtana</I> should always remember that the hands of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I> bestowing blessing will always be with them.<!-- /block --></p>
