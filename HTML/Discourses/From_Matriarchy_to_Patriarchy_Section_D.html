<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Since the dawn of human evolution several social problems have confronted humanity. The first and foremost problem was the conflict between rival clans and groups living on different hills and in different villages. At the initial stage of human evolution, before the discovery of fire, people used to live in caves for safety. Out of fear of the dark, they would close the entrance to the cave with a large boulder at night. At that time human beings were very helpless, and less physically powerful than many other animals. Although primitive humans had more intelligence than other animals, they had very little intelligence in comparison to the people of today. Moreover, they had less power in their nails and teeth than most other animals. They tried living near mountain springs to satisfy their need for water, but caves were not always available there. And there was no shortage of water in the rivers, but riverbanks provided no safety during the darkness of the night. Gradually primitive people settled between large rocks or in small valleys between hills, and after some time they started building houses in the branches of trees out of sticks and tall grass. Perhaps this marked the very first step of human civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There were frequent fights among different groups for possession of caves, valleys and trees. Their weapons in those fights were their teeth and nails. A treaty between Britain and Iberia several centuries ago stated that they would help each other &ldquo;tooth and nail&rdquo;. Even today people still use the expression &ldquo;to fight tooth and nail&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In those days people felt the need to increase their numbers, thus they always tried to increase the number of women in their group. Powerful women became known as group mothers, and activity centered around them as it does around queen ants or queen bees. If one man had ten wives, the wives could give birth to ten children simultaneously, but if one woman had ten husbands, she could only give birth to one child. So during their frequent battles primitive people always tried to abduct the women of the opposing group. As a result women lived as the slaves of men. At that time people began to practise phallic worship in the belief that this would help increase their numbers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the next phase although women were still considered the property of victorious males, they were not allowed to remain as group mothers. Instead, people accepted the leadership of valorous, strong and capable men. These heroic leaders were assisted by a group of advisers, and this was the first stage in the evolution of the monarchy.<!-- /block --></p>
