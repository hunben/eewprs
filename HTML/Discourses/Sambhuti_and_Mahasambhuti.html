<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Sambhu&#x301;ti and Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti&rdquo;. In the Vedas it has been said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Sambhu&#x301;tiin&#x32D;ca vina&#x301;shain&#x32D;ca yastadvedobhayam&#x301;saha;<br>Vina&#x301;shena mrtyum&#x301; tiirtva&#x301; sam&#x301;bhu&#x301;tya&#x301;mrtamashnute.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[It is better for people to understand Brahma in both Its aspects, sambhu&#x301;ti, or creation, and vina&#x301;sha, or transformation. Through vina&#x301;sha &ndash; changing from one form to another &ndash; they overcome death, and through sambhu&#x301;ti &ndash; the gift of a human body &ndash; they gain a chance for immortality.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti? To acquire knowledge about Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti, you must first understand sambhu&#x301;ti and vina&#x301;sha. The word sambhu&#x301;ti is derived as: prefix sam &ndash; root verb bhu&#x301; + suffix ktin, which combine to mean literally, &ldquo;proper development, proper origin&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->What is proper development or origin? When something is created it is called sambhu&#x301;ti. But when people create something new out of some existing fundamental stuff, it is not called sambhu&#x301;ti. (There are certain fundamental elements which human beings cannot create, but out of which they can create various objects. These objects are called elements, and all are included in sambhu&#x301;ti.) Actually, sambhu&#x301;ti is a special creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What do we mean by vina&#x301;sha? Vina&#x301;sha is derived as: vi &ndash; nash + ghain&#x32D;. Usually we come across three such words: na&#x301;sha, vina&#x301;sha and pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. What we call &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; in ordinary language is called na&#x301;sha. When an object is transformed and cannot be brought back to its original form it is called vina&#x301;sha. For example, when a five-year-old boy grows into a twenty-five-year-old man it signifies a major change. Where has the growing body of the five-year-old gone? It has been annihilated. When an object returns to its original source after being annihilated, it is called pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. Pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha signifies destruction also, but of a different nature. For example, when you prepare puri [unleavened bread puffed by deep frying] out of wheat flour and then transform it back into wheat flour, this is pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Let us take another example. Sugar is made from cane-juice. If the sugar is transformed back into cane-juice, that will be pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. In brief, sambhu&#x301;ti means &ldquo;an original creation&rdquo;, and vina&#x301;sha is the total destruction of an object which cannot be transformed back to its original source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The fundamental stuff of the universe has emerged from Parama Purus&#x301;a; hence all objects, big and small, are the sambhu&#x301;tis of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This sambhu&#x301;ti or creation is divided into various worlds: physical, plant, animal and human. Inanimate and animate beings are divided into various branches and sub-branches, which are also the creations of Parama Purus&#x301;a. In ordinary language they can also be called avata&#x301;ra. When Parama Purus&#x301;a is manifested in some physical object, that physical object is called the avata&#x301;ra of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The word avata&#x301;ra is derived as: ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D;. How diversified is the creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a! What striking differences there are among objects! Even in the plant world some plants are quite developed, while others are totally undeveloped. In the living world the protozoic body is undeveloped, but the metazoic body is developed. There is tremendous complexity within the flow of evolution of living beings. The undeveloped creatures of the living world are called jiivakot&#x301;i, and those which are highly developed are called Iishvarakot&#x301;i. The entire gamut of evolution from protozoic cells up to human beings are called jiivakot&#x301;is. These jiivakot&#x301;is [living beings] evolve through psychic and social clash. For example, those people who are dull and unintelligent today are sure to develop one day in the gradual process of evolution. When they become highly intelligent people, their physical capacity  will also increase. Through intensive self-culture, a jiivakot&#x301;i can achieve a lot. Thus one should not worry; those who have taken the shelter of Parama Purus&#x301;a will certainly merge in Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Like jiivakot&#x301;is, the other branches and sub-branches of creation have originated from Parama Purus&#x301;a. You are not the actual owner of your physical and intellectual strength and spiritual power all these things have come from Parama Purus&#x301;a. All these powers have their limits, but Parama Purus&#x301;a is the source of all power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In a jiivakot&#x301;i, strength can develop only to a certain degree, for the capacity of development of living beings is limited  this is why they are called jiivakot&#x301;is. Suppose a certain man is trying to increase his physical strength through physical exercise. His strength can increase only to a certain degree. The physical strength of human beings is such that it cannot increase beyond a certain point. In exactly the same way, a certain person may develop the power of memory; but this development can take place only up to a certain age. Once that age is reached, there can be no further improvement. An ordinary human being can never become omniscient.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->And what does Iishvarakot&#x301;i mean? In Iishvarakot&#x301;i there is a greater manifestation of divinity. A jiivakot&#x301;i by virtue of sincere and ardent spiritual practice can elevate itself to Iishvarakot&#x301;i. Both jiivakot&#x301;i and Iishvarakot&#x301;i are creations of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus in the gradual process of evolution they will become one with Brahma one day. In the Vedas it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Es&#x301;o ha deva pradisho&#146;nu sarva&#x301;<br>Pu&#x301;rvohaja&#x301;tah sa u garbhe anta;<br>Sa eva ja&#x301;tah sah janis&#x301;yama&#x301;nah,<br>Pratyam&#x301;jana&#x301;m&#x301;stist&#x301;hate sarvatomukhah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Es&#x301;o ha deva pradisho&#146;nu sarva&#x301;. Each direction is a creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He exists in all four directions. There are considerable differences in recommendations as to which way one should face while sitting in meditation or worship. Some say east, some say west; others advise north. Superstitious people consider the south to be inauspicious, as the south is supposed to be death&#146;s door. But the rs&#x301;i [sage] says that all the pradisha [cardinal points]  north, south, east and west  and all the anudisha [secondary points]  northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, above and below  are the sambhu&#x301;tis of Parama Purus&#x301;a. So which way should people face? He pervades all the directions; all are His creations. Thus it is not necessary to face always in one direction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Pu&#x301;rvohaja&#x301;tah. Those objects which existed in the distant past were also His creation. For instance, this planet earth was created after dissociation from the sun about 8,000 million years ago. At that time this earth was only a gaseous substance, but that too was a creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Subsequently that gas cooled and gradually solidified to form the earth. This metamorphosis took place around 2,230 million years ago, long before the advent of human beings. Naturally there was no question of anyone ascribing any name to it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->As the earth gradually cooled, many layers of rock were formed under the crust. Each of these layers is also a creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a, created by certain temperatures, pressures and atmospheric conditions. In brief, whatever was created in the past was the sambhu&#x301;ti of the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The totality of all the sambhu&#x301;tis is this universe. All the entities from the mighty sun to the tiny ant are a part of this universe. All the celestial bodies, living, dying or dead; all the nebulae, galaxies and the Milky Way; are members of the same universal family. A galaxy is vast, an ant is tiny, yet both have equal importance in maintaining the balance of the universe. If even an ant dies prematurely, that mishap may disturb the balance of the universe. Nothing in this universe is unimportant, not even a tiny ant. Suppose an ant moves an inch from the east to the west on a stone. If the balance of the stone is jeopardized by this change, this incident may be the cause of a major earthquake, because ants are also His sambhu&#x301;ti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Through excavation we have discovered many fossils of animals and plants. These discoveries prove that in ancient times various gigantic animals existed, most of which have become extinct. All that remains are the fossilized bones of their bodies. Various ages &ndash; [Archean], Mesozoic, Oligocene, Eocene, etc. &ndash; have come and gone. Each of these ages had its respective animals and plants, which became extinct in a subsequent age. Each age is a sambhu&#x301;ti; each animal, plant and geological layer is also a sambhu&#x301;ti. Nothing is unnecessary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->About 1,700,000 years ago, towards the end of the Miocene Age and the early part of the Oligocene Age, the australopithecine came onto this earth. That animal is now extinct, but its successors, such as orangutans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, still exist. One branch of that group evolved into human beings. Hence the first ancestors of human beings should be called australopithecine and not &ldquo;Ka&#x301;shyapa&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bharadva&#x301;ja&rdquo; [names of early clan leaders]. The ancestors of human beings are monkeys, so monkeys are the relatives of human beings. All things that came on earth in the past were sambhu&#x301;tis of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Sa u garbhe anta. Those beings which existed in the past are not the only sambhu&#x301;tis; those who will be born in the future will also be His sambhu&#x301;tis. Our ancestors used to say in ancient times, Aham&#x301; gaccha&#x301;mi [&ldquo;I&#146;m going&rdquo;]. Later on this was changed into Ahammi gacchata huim. Still later the sentence was changed into Man&#x32D;y ja&#x301;ha&#x301;ta&#x301; ha&#x301;n&#x32D;i. Finally it became Man&#x32D;y ja&#x301;ta&#x301; hun&#x32D; [in modern Hindi]. One thousand years from now the same sentence will be changed into Ma&#x301;i ja&#x301;n&#x32D;i. Thus you see, one sambhu&#x301;ti is dying, yielding its place to a new one. Whatever will come will be an expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a  the changes will be of form and sound only.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Sa eva ja&#x301;tah. Whatever we see at present is His sambhu&#x301;ti also. Nothing in this universe is unimportant, though it may be small or petty. Take the case of alcoholics. To others they are degraded persons, but one has no right to hate them. Hatred is not an expression of moral courage. It is definitely not a praiseworthy tendency.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Sa eva ja&#x301;tah sah janis&#x301;yama&#x301;nah. If all the objects of this universe are the creations of Parama Purus&#x301;a, how can you hate anyone or anything? How is it possible to meditate on one divine expression and hate another? Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti is the object of your ideation. There are certain entities which take a long time in undergoing internal and external change. For example, during the Cretaceous Age this earth was populated by gigantic animals which had immense bodies full of fat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The geography of this earth is constantly changing. Where the sea is surrounded by land on three sides it is called a bay, for instance, the Bay of Bengal. The water of a bay is not ruffled by the high waves of the sea. The carcasses of many animals and creatures used to wash into the waters of such bays and accumulate there. This process resulted in the creation of sargasso seas. The carcasses would form a layer on the surface of the water so thick that small animals could even walk on it. When this hard crust thickened enough, the result was the sargasso sea. Underneath was water, and on the surface people could live and move. As the dead bodies accumulated, the fatty portion of the carcasses was converted into mineral oil under climatic pressures and pressures created in the earth&#146;s surface. Thus by observing the geological structure of the earth, it is possible to determine the location of mineral oil. For example, the Assam valley, the Garo and Khasiya Hills, and the Himalayas, have large deposits of mineral oil, as do Rajasthan and Saurashtra. It takes a few tens of millions of years for animal fat to be converted into mineral oil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The difference between the human beings of one million years ago and those of today is immense. Even the physical structures of developed human beings of today differ from those of undeveloped. The human structure also gradually changes in pace with human progress. All the ectoplasmic cells, nerve cells and nerve fibres of human beings are changing; the glands and plexi are also changing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Pratyam&#x301;jana&#x301;m&#x301;stis&#x301;t&#x301;hate sarvatomukhah. Behind every sambhu&#x301;ti, Parama Purus&#x301;a exists. Suppose you are sitting somewhere thinking about filing a case against your uncle. No one can know your internal thought, but Parama Purus&#x301;a knows. Or suppose your boss has arrived. You give him a proper reception and verbally request him to stay three or four days. But internally you are thinking, &ldquo;The sooner this calamity is over, the better.&rdquo; Here you are maintaining a duality between the internality and the externality. Parama Purus&#x301;a certainly knows your dual role. He exists behind every object, in every existence. For each and every sambhu&#x301;ti He has created a witnessing counterpart. So it is not possible for you to keep anything secret  He has vigilant eyes everywhere. He is equally present in both animate and inanimate objects. We can say allegorically that He is associated with every object of creation through His five faces and His three eyes. The three eyes represent the past, present and future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->It is physically impossible for anyone to have five faces, yet Shiva is called Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nana [&ldquo;Five-Faced God&rdquo;]. So what are those five faces?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Shiva has one face in front flanked by two faces on the right and two on the left. The face on the extreme right is called Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara. This face conveys the message: &ldquo;Listen to me! This will be good for you. You should behave in this way. Follow me. Please follow this path. Don&#146;t indulge in improper deeds, but follow the path of morality and pious deeds.&rdquo; Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara guides people with sweet polite language. Even though it tells one not to do certain things, it is still pleasant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The face on the extreme left is called Va&#x301;madeva. It speaks with a thunderous voice. &ldquo;You worthless chap, why did you do such a thing? I will punish you severely.&rdquo; Thereafter it punishes the wrongdoer with a stick. &ldquo;Don&#146;t take me lightly, your bones will learn what is proper and what is improper!&rdquo; This Va&#x301;madeva is the exact opposite of Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The face next to Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara is called Iisha&#x301;na. It says, &ldquo;Look, my child, follow this path. If you follow any other path, it will bring you only sorrow. Don&#146;t make such a mistake. Prakrti will never pardon you. The result will be disastrous.&rdquo; Iisha&#x301;na clearly states the consequences of misdeeds and gives a few pieces of advice. You may experience Parama Purus&#x301;a either in the form of Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara or in that of Iisha&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->And on the left, the face next to Va&#x301;madeva is called Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni. Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni says, &ldquo;Severe punishment is awaiting you. Your bones will be broken. Stupid! What nonsense are you doing?&rdquo; In this way Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni scolds and threatens to punish, although it does not actually carry it out. Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni tries to rectify wrongdoers by creating fear in them, not by actual punishment. When someone becomes extremely angry we call him agnisharma&#x301; [red as fire]. The face in the middle is called Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram. This face says, &ldquo;Come, dear child, and sit beside me. I hope you are quite well.&rdquo; This is the role of Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram. Thus human beings want only Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->With these five faces the Supreme Entity is watching the movement of each and every human being. He takes steps according to the particular situation. In the Vedas there appears the following prayer:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->So this is His srs&#x301;t&#x301;iliila&#x301; [play of creation], His sambhu&#x301;ti. Behind each of His sambhu&#x301;tis there is a particular wave of energy coming from Him. No one is neglected.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Samaplushina&#x301;. The word plushina&#x301; means &ldquo;white ant&rdquo;. An anthill made by white ants is called valmiika in Sanskrit. The sage around whose body the white ants once made a hill became named &ldquo;Va&#x301;lmiiki&rdquo;. He was so still when engrossed in silent, deep, spiritual meditation that white ants had sufficient time and opportunity to build an ant hill around his body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Samamashakena. Mashaka means &ldquo;mosquito&rdquo; or any tiny creature. Samana&#x301;gena. The word na&#x301;ga has three meanings: &ldquo;python&rdquo;, &ldquo;mammoth&rdquo; and &ldquo;mountain spring&rdquo;. Parama Purus&#x301;a has equal love and affection for white ants, mosquitoes and mammoths. Even though a mammoth has a huge body, Parama Purus&#x301;a shows no special partiality for it. He is as concerned about a tiny mosquito as He is about the entire universe. Although this vast universe, along with the so-called heaven and the so-called hell and this world of mortals, is so complex and vast, Parama Purus&#x301;a does not devote any extra time to it, nor does He devote any extra time to the tiny ant. Behind every sambhu&#x301;ti there functions a particular force assigned by Parama Purus&#x301;a. According to scriptures this force is called deva. Deva means a special manifestation of divine power, a special effulgence radiated from Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus no entity should be hated, and none is insignificant.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The collection of all vibrations constitutes this universe. The existence and progress of this universe depends on the clash and cohesion of these vibrations. This process brings about some kind of disequilibrium in the sambhu&#x301;tis at a certain stage. That is, the imbalance in collective life becomes something that cannot be corrected by any one sambhu&#x301;ti. Let us suppose five thousand million people live in a particular place. Each of them is a sambhu&#x301;ti of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Suppose that with the passage of time (a change in the time factor) they lose their vitality, they become involved in internecine battles, and pessimism strikes deep in their hearts and creates disillusion and disappointment. This pessimism in collective life cannot be solved by one particular sambhu&#x301;ti; it requires the appearance of a special structure through which the Supreme Entity can fully express Himself. This special manifestation is called Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti [&ldquo;Great Sambhu&#x301;ti&rdquo;]. The role of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti is to properly guide all other sambhu&#x301;tis and, by enforcing proper discipline, to bring about proper harmony and coordination amongst them. This special manifestation does not come within the purview of jiivakot&#x301;i or that of Iishvarakot&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Iishvarakot&#x301;i is also a special manifestation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Normally human beings look upon Iishvarakot&#x301;i as an incarnation of God. Actually even jiivakot&#x301;i is an incarnation of God, but Iishvarakot&#x301;i is a higher incarnation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->In ancient times people imagined God in a series of advents correlated with the evolutionary flow of life on earth. The first expression of life took place in the water. Thereafter, another type of living being emerged which could live both in water and on land. Later land animals evolved, followed by a sub-human level of beings and finally by humans. More and more developed forms of jiivakot&#x301;i and Iishvarakot&#x301;i emerged. A medieval poet expressed this idea in sweet, lyrical verse:<!-- /block --></p>
