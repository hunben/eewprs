<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->As all of you, rather, most of you, know, Parama Purus&#x301;a is the starting-point of everything, be it animate, be it inanimate. He is the supreme source; everything emanates from Him. So each and every living being belongs to the same tribe, and the tribal chief is Parama Purus&#x301;a. They are moving on round Parama Purus&#x301;a,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  and their final goal, the final terminus, is also Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; that is, each and every living being belongs to the same village, and same nation, and same group of living beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now, their goal is Parama Purus&#x301;a, the desideratum is Parama Purus&#x301;a. While moving towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, while running towards the supreme goal, they should have an idea in their mind as to why they are moving towards Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; with what an attitude they are moving towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. So far as the question of faculty is concerned, it is either actional, or knowledge (that is, intellectual), or devotional.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  But they are actually not spirituality, they are actually dogma, a mechanical way of futile expression. Standing like this, sitting like this, saying like this, singing like this &ndash; and doing everything with so many gestures and postures. These things &ndash; rather, the framework created by the combination of these<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  gestures and postures, is the abode of dogma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Even in the realm of the actional faculty or the intellectual faculty, or even the so-called devotional faculty, everything is not dharma, everything is not a perfect approach. There are also colours of dogma in them. So those who are spiritual aspirants should very carefully keep themselves away, rather keep themselves aloof, from these so-called approaches of spirituality, rather, from these dogmas. In the past there was dogma; in the Middle Ages it reached its zenith; and in the Middle Ages of the human era, of human history, there was a revolt against dogma. That first revolt against dogma was a psychic approach, a psycho-spiritual approach, of devotionalism. And that we find in certain Bha&#x301;gavata sha&#x301;stras [scriptures], where they say that no physical show is required for the devotional approach.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> For the devotional approach, nothing external is required; nothing external is required to be done.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  And because it is the supreme pinnacle of devotional approach, you should remember that it is yours, because Parama Purus&#x301;a is cent per cent yours.<!-- /block --></p>
