<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[A good sa&#x301;dhaka (spiritual practitioner) was the medium for the demonstration of this sama&#x301;dhi. He was first asked by Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; to examine the audience carefully with open eyes and to estimate roughly the number of individuals. He estimated there were about two hundred fifty individuals. He further stated that as he beheld all those various individuals, his mind registered different feelings and became disturbed. Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; made him close his eyes and touched him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->On being asked what he saw with closed eyes, he responded, &ldquo;Unity.&rdquo; He saw nothing but oneness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; asked him to concentrate on the various cakras, from mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra upward, and each time to try to imagine or see oneness. As the cakras under concentration rose higher and higher, the sa&#x301;dhaka said that he was feeling oneness more. Moreover, his mind was becoming more and more tranquil, in contrast to the disturbance he had felt earlier when viewing the audience. Finally, when his concentration reached and surpassed the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra at the trikut&#x301;i (between the eyebrows), the sa&#x301;dhaka got more and more deeply immersed in sama&#x301;dhi till at last he lost control of his body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; explained that the Cosmos was, externally, a phenomenon of analysis (vishles&#x301;an&#x301;a), diversity, clash, disturbance of mind and materialism (jad&#x301;ata&#x301;); and internally, a matter of synthesis (sam&#x301;shles&#x301;an&#x301;a), oneness, peace, tranquillity and spirituality (a&#x301;dhya&#x301;tma). Apara&#x301; knowledge, that is, the knowledge of the external objectivity, is necessary for worldly activities, but para&#x301; knowledge, that is, the knowledge of matters internal, is supreme and superior. Apara&#x301; knowledge should be controlled by para&#x301; knowledge. Educational institutions where only apara&#x301; knowledge is imparted are not sufficient. Side by side the controlling para&#x301; knowledge must be taught. In fact the para&#x301; knowledge should have precedence over the apara&#x301; knowledge, because uncontrolled by para&#x301; knowledge, apara&#x301; knowledge will tend to produce literate brutes who might misuse their knowledge of worldly things. Controlled by para&#x301; knowledge, apara&#x301; knowledge will be used for the welfare and elevation of all of humankind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Self is the peak of subjectivity. Because He is the goal, our approach in each and every worldly activity should be subjective; however, in the actual physical performance of activity we will have to follow the method of objective adjustment. Even when dealing with the many, one must remember that, behind the many, there is the One. We must never lose sight of the fact that the many are but the facets of the One. Even a criminal whom we may have to punish is, ultimately, a chip off the same block, Brahma. Thus orientated internally, our physical actions will always remain moral, ethical and spiritual. There will be no sins committed and there will be no degradation of the soul, even if a physical action outwardly damages or destroys someone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the end Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; exhorted every Ananda Margi to work tirelessly with a smiling face in the service of mankind and at the same time devotedly and constantly perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Then he promised everyone his grace and the blessing of sama&#x301;dhi that the aforesaid sa&#x301;dhaka was enjoying. The name of the sama&#x301;dhi that he was enjoying was atima&#x301;nasa yoga sama&#x301;dhi.]<!-- /block --></p>
