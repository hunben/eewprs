<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->To attain Paramatattva (The Supreme Stance), there are three recognized means &ndash; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na (intellectual knowledge), karma (action), and bhakti (devotion). Everybody has accepted, and Sham&#x301;kara&#x301;ca&#x301;rya, who has been considered the greatest philosopher in India, has also said in unambiguous language, that &ldquo;Moks&#x301;a ka&#x301;ran&#x301;asamagra&#x301;m&#x301; bhaktireva gariiyasi&rdquo; &ndash; for salvation, devotion is the best approach. Bhakti is greater than jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma. What is bhakti? The root word &ldquo;bhaj&rdquo; and the suffix &ldquo;ktin&rdquo; make the word &ldquo;bhakti.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bhaj&rdquo; means moving towards that Supreme Entity without any second thought. When all your sentiments, all your aspirations, move towards that Singular Entity without any second thought, then that psychic movement of yours if called &ldquo;bhakti.&rdquo; The flow of this very devotion is prema (divine love). When this flow is not towards anything else, but towards Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, it alone is prema. &ldquo;Ananyamamata&rdquo; vis&#x301;n&#x301;ormamata&#x301; premasaun&#x32D;gata&#x301;. &ldquo;Mamata&#x301;&rdquo; means &ldquo;mine-ness&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Mama&rdquo; means &ldquo;one&#146;s own&rdquo;, and the abstract noun derived from it is &ldquo;mamata&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; meaning, thereby &ldquo;mine-ness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Who is Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u? The entity which is all-pervading (sarva&#x301;nusruta) is Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u. &ldquo;Vista&#x301;ra sarvabhutesu vis&#x301;n&#x301;orvishvamidam&#x301; jagat.&rdquo; The entity which is all-pervading in this Cosmos is Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There should not be any amalgamation in devotion. For example, people mix copper in gold, but there should be no mixture in bhakti. Bhakti should be shuddha&#x301; bhakti, unadulterated devotion; that is, there should not be any covert desire in the mind. If there is a second thought, it might be that that desire will be satiated; but Parama Purus&#x301;a will remain unattained. The covert desire was your main desire, and devotion was a show. This will not do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is this shuddha&#x301; bhakti? &ldquo;I want nothing from you. I love you. I love you because by loving you I get pleasure.&rdquo; This alone is ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti or shuddha&#x301; bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->But this ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti is not final. In ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti, the idea is that you love Him because by doing so you derive pleasure. Greater devotees don&#146;t even like this. They love God, not because they get pleasure, but because He gets pleasure. To give him pleasure is what they want. &ldquo;I don&#146;t even want pleasure for myself. I want to please you; therefore I love you.&rdquo; This alone is the supreme devotion. This is known as &ldquo;ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti&rdquo;. &ldquo;Gopayate yah sah gopah&rdquo; &ndash; those who do this ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti are known as &ldquo;gopa&rdquo;. In Laokika Sam&#x301;skrta, &ldquo;gopa&rdquo; means &ldquo;one who rears cows.&rdquo; But, in philosophical language, it is not so. &ldquo;Gopayate&rdquo; means to give pleasure. So, those whose nature is to give pleasure to Parama&#x301;tman are Gopa. In devotional scriptures it is said that Parama&#x301;tman is a slave to the Gopas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Hence, everybody should encourage ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti, because this alone is the most blissful means of attaining emancipation. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
