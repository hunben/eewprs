<a name="1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The tiny organization which first saw the light of day in a small town in 1955 &ndash; you may call it the &ldquo;Jamalpur Organization&rdquo; because in those early days it was confined to Jamalpur town - has today, due to your efforts, been transformed into a mighty global organization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Each and every entity grows step by step due to its own inherent strength, not by acquiring strength from any external source. If internal strength is lacking, it serves no purpose to inject additional strength from outside.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The day we started our journey we only had a fixed goal ahead of us, nothing else. In those days we had neither structure nor financial capacity, nor even a small office room. Yet our organization continued to grow and has become so large today that there is hardly any country left where its branches and ramifications have not spread. The Ananda Marga of today is no longer the small Jamalpur Organization of those early days: the people of Jamalpur have had to surrender it to the population of the world. During the twelve years since 1966, I have not been to Jamalpur. In those early days, people used to talk about the &ldquo;head of Ananda Marga of Jamalpur&rdquo;, but these days they no longer use such words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Every entity develops by virtue of its own internal strength. But where does that internal strength come from? The strength acquired from the external world is fundamentally crude. Food, air and water are created from the five fundamental factors which, being crude, can only directly help the growth of physical energy and not the more subtle psychic energy and spiritual energy. One should not be over-dependent upon that physical source of energy as it is transient by nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->From the very beginning it was my opinion that it would not be wise to depend on external objects alone. This is the advice I have given to members of Ananda Marga, saying that they should rather depend upon psychic energy. Psychic energy is of two types. One is a product of physical energy, the other a product of spiritual power. Suppose some people stop eating food for a number of days: their physical and psychic stamina will be affected. They will be unable to continue their studies and other activities due to a lack of physical stamina. Their minds, infatuated with food, will repeat &ldquo;bread, bread&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. Thus, crude psychic power which is a product of physical energy is also undependable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The second type is internal psychic power. Those who are moralists, those who are armed with spiritual power, naturally develop a kind of psychic power. Whether they eat or not, their strength remains unaffected. Staunch moralists would never agree to drink alcohol even if they were about to die. Their moral strength is so strong that they would rather put their heads in fire than violate their ideology. The energy that originates from crude food is not adequate for the development of this sort of indomitable psychic power. It requires spiritual strength, spiritual moral force which originate, from unit consciousness or a&#x301;tman. In the absence of spiritual power, this unflinching psychic power and moral force quickly fade. That is why from the very beginning I have been stressing that human beings should depend more on spiritual power. Ananda Marga firmly believes that human life should be based on this inherent moral spiritual force. Those who possess such crude physical force tried their utmost to eliminate us. Their days are gone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The crude mental force which is a product of physical energy is expressed as vanity or ego. There is nothing more foolish. You must have observed that when one strikes at vanity it shatters into pieces.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Thus, I advise you to depend upon the inherent psychic force under all circumstances. I do not say that you should depend only on the inherent psychic force because that psychic force itself depends on spiritual force. This is what intelligent people should do. That is why we have followed this path from the very beginning. The small nucleus of an organization which we first started at Jamalpur has extended its circumference far beyond the small frontiers of that small town, and has now spread all over the world. It has spread to each and every neighbourhood and is still spreading.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Today, you should remember that Ananda Marga is not limited to a handful of honest and intellectual people. Rather, it is trying to rally thousands of people under the banner of one sublime ideology. I dedicate Ananda Marga in this DMC [Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra: a spiritual gathering during which the Guru delivers several discourses] to all sections of society. Prior to this DMC, I would only discuss intellectual topics, but from this DMC onwards I have become a man of the people because I believe that dharma is the property of the masses, not the exclusive monopoly of a handful of so-called educated middle class elite. Dharma belongs to one and all. From this DMC, I recognize it as the property of the common people.<!-- /block --></p>
