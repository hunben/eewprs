<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->On the 8th of September, 1985, the author, and founder of Ananda Marga, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, began an extraordinary series of Sunday lectures in Bengali that would eventually fill a total of twenty-six volumes over the next five years. The title he gave to this series was Shabda Cayanika&#x301;, which translates into English as &ldquo;A Collection of Words&rdquo;. As the title suggests, each discourse consists of a discussion of a certain number of words from the Bengali language, beginning, in the first discourse, with the first letter of the Bengali alphabet, a, and continuing on alphabetically. What results, then, is neither an encyclopedia, nor a dictionary, but something unique in the fields of scholarship and literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ostensibly, Shabda Cayanika&#x301; is a series devoted to the linguistics and philology of the Bengali language, but in reality it is much more than that. The author uses the platform of the word as a point of departure to take the reader on a journey through all the varied landscapes of human knowledge &ndash; history, geography, medicine, science, art, religion, philosophy, etc. &ndash; and in the process adds the indelible  stamp of his own unique wisdom, enriching our experience with new ideas and enabling us to see our human heritage in a way we have never been able to before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Like most great authors, he is a consummate storyteller, using a seemingly inexhaustible supply of anecdotes, personal experiences and stories to capture the reader&#146;s interest and lead him or her effortlessly through the garden of human knowledge. Along the way the author refines and develops a language that is the world&#146;s fifth most widely spoken and the closest living language to its great classical ancestor, Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the translators have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the translators or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The author uses a certain shorthand for explaining etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The first English publication of the material on the rights of women (in the section entitled Aodva&#x301;hika) in Discourse 15 of this Shabda Cayanika&#x301; Part 3, and the material on purdah in Discourse 17, came in The Awakening of Women, 1995. This material was translated by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Vijaya&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta, Avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; A&#x301;nanda Rucira&#x301; A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya and A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Acyuta&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta. The first English publication of the story of Aru&#x301;pratan and Sutanuka&#x301; which appears in Discourse 17 came in A Few Problems Solved Part 5, translated by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Vijaya&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta, and was entitled &ldquo;River and Civilization&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The translation of this book by Deva&#x301;shiis&#x301;a was checked by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Vijaya&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta, who compared the English line by line with the Bengali original, making the necessary corrections and suggestions, as well as translating the Sanskrit shlokas.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Aoktha/Aokthaka/Aokthika<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Vedas were composed in ancient times by different sages over a period of nearly ten thousand years &ndash; from approximately fifteen thousand years ago to five thousand years ago &ndash; before human beings became conversant with written script. This is not to say, however, that human beings were completely illiterate during this long period of the composition of the Vedas. They became conversant with the alphabet approximately seven thousand years ago, shortly after the time of Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Originally, the Vedas could not be written down because human beings had yet to discover writing. Later on, despite having the knowledge of writing, people did not write down the Vedas due to a deep-rooted belief that they should, perhaps, not be written down. Thus those human ancestors did not transcribe them, and for this reason, most likely, another name for the Vedas was shruti, that is, &ldquo;that which is learned by hearing&rdquo;. Whatever people considered important during this long period and set to prose or poetry, metre and melody was given the name veda, or &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, whether it concerned spirituality, devotion, or meeting the mundane necessities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Preserving this vast wealth of knowledge through memorization was no easy task. Due to the pressure of necessity they devised written symbols, beginning with pictorial script. In the East, this took the form of the Chinese system of pictorial script, and in south Asia and central Asia it took the form of linear script. This linear script, over time, became divided into two main systems. One was written from left to right (the Aryan and Indo-Aryan scripts, such as Bengali and Roman), and the other was written from right to left (the Semitic scripts, such as Arabic).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Written script was indeed discovered, but, due to the influence of blind belief, people were reluctant to commit the Vedas to writing. Because of this a large portion of the Vedas vanished forever behind the curtain of oblivion. Realizing that the Vedas could not be preserved through memorization, they were divided into three parts according to their relative antiquity. The composition of the oldest portion &ndash; that which was more than seven thousand years old &ndash; began approximately fifteen thousand years ago. It was given the name Rgveda. The main reason why it was given this name was because it abounded in rks, or hymns in verse form. The medieval Vedas were given the name Yajurveda, which was chiefly concerned with rituals and secondly with a blend of rituals and knowledge. The final portion was given the name Atharvaveda because its composition was begun by Maharshi Atharva&#x301; (in some people&#146;s opinion, the sage&#146;s name was Atharvas or Atharva).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Even though the preservation of the Vedas through memorization was made somewhat easier by this tripartite division, it was still a difficult matter. Thereafter the song-predominant portions were collected together and arranged according to their relative antiquity. In many cases, in addition to this time-wise division, an attempt was made to classify the songs according to their metres. Despite making it easier in this way to preserve the Vedas by memorization, they were still on the verge of being erased from the canvas of memory. At one point, after close examination, it was found that many important portions had disappeared &ndash; permanently disappeared, never to return again. At that time, a group of pandits from Kashmir disregarded their age-old inhibitions in order to save the Vedas from destruction and set them down in writing for the first time in the old Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script of that region.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now this musical portion of the Vedas, which was known as the Sa&#x301;maveda (the word sa&#x301;ma means &ldquo;song&rdquo;), was also divided into three parts according to relative antiquity. According to some, the name of that portion of the Sa&#x301;maveda which was taken from the Rgveda is uktha. However, according to many pandits the songs are classified in various ways and the name of a single category is uktha. Whatever the case may be, uktha means &ldquo;all those portions of the Sa&#x301;maveda which have been gathered together as one&rdquo;, whether that be according to time or according to musical classification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Aoktha means &ldquo;concerning uktha&rdquo;. Uc + tha = uktha. The verbal root uc means &ldquo;to be collected, gathered together&rdquo;. Aokthaka means &ldquo;pandit of the Sa&#x301;maveda&rdquo; and aokthika means &ldquo;the rules and regulations concerning aoktha&rdquo;. In the opinion of some pandits, the words aokthaka and aokthika have the same etymological meaning. There are others who are not prepared to accept the word aokthika as correct. They are, of course, principally from the Rgvedic school. In very ancient times, in north India and Gujarat, there was one class of pandits who studied the Sa&#x301;maveda and who introduced themselves as aokthaka. Nowadays no one calls each other aokthaka. Although Bengal&#146;s Pain&#x32D;cagra&#x301;mii Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Brahmans (Bandyopa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya, Mukhopa&#x301;dhyaya, Chat&#x301;t&#x301;opadhya&#x301;ya, Ga&#x301;unguli, Ghos&#x301;al)  followed the Sa&#x301;mavedic system in matters pertaining to the karmakan&#x301;d&#x301;a, virtually none of them studied the Vedas deeply. Their inclination was more towards the Tantra. Thus they were not known by the name aokthaka. In subsequent times, as result of the mushrooming influence of Mahayana Buddhism among them, they drifted far away from the Vedic sphere of influence. The Vedic system of pronunciation was also abandoned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Because Maharshi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yana Vya&#x301;sa divided the Vedas according to their age, he was known among the common people as Veda Vya&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The word ugra means &ldquo;supreme&rdquo;, &ldquo;acme&rdquo;, &ldquo;point of a needle&rdquo;, &ldquo;hot&rdquo;, etc. From ugra we get the noun aogra, and from aogra we get the half-Sanskrit-derived word gargare. For example: &ldquo;The potato curry was well-cooked and strongly seasoned [gargare] with hot spices. With this carefully cooked curry all the rice will be eaten up.&rdquo; In old Bengali the word oggara  (that is, aogra) was commonly used to mean &ldquo;hot&rdquo; or &ldquo;spicy&rdquo;. There is a doggerel in old Bengali:<!-- /block --></p>

The lady of the house is serving, and you, the virtuous one, just sit and eat.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Many people believe that in old Bengal biuli pulse (biri kala&#x301;i) was the only kind of pulse people used. Biuli pulse was a daily staple, thus its name disappeared from the list of desired foods. In many people&#146;s opinion, the Bengalees learned to eat other kinds of pulses approximately one thousand to twelve hundred years ago, nevertheless muggar dal [mung] was most probably taken with oggara bhatta&#x301; [hot rice].<!-- /block --></p>

Generally the word aoccya is used for all kinds of height and the word aocca is used for abstract references to height. In Bengali the word uccata&#x301; is more common and in Hindi, u&#x301;ca&#x301;i. Speaking of the Hindi word u&#x301;ca&#x301;i reminds me of a short story about Aklmand Singh.<!-- /block --></p>

By adding the suffix asun to uj we get the word ojasa which means &ldquo;heat&rdquo; or &ldquo;vital energy&rdquo;, &ldquo;to radiate light&rdquo;, &ldquo;to shine or glitter&rdquo;. By adding the suffix t&#x301;hak to ojas we get the word aojasika whose etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which is full of vitality&rdquo;, &ldquo;that which is colourful&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which contains the splendour of colour&rdquo;. In a special sense, aojasika means &ldquo;great warrior&rdquo;. In ancient literature the word aojasika has been used in some places to mean &ldquo;one who has sacrificed oneself in the interest of others&rdquo;. Nowadays the word aojasika can be used in place of shahiida [martyr].<!-- /block --></p>

Ud&#x301; + rak makes od&#x301;ra. That land which cares for its guests with great affection, which draws far-off people to itself, is called the land of od&#x301;ra. The stretch of seacoast lying between the mouth of the Maha&#x301;nadii and Suvarn&#x301;arekha&#x301; Rivers is called od&#x301;ra and the coastal area between the mouths of the Maha&#x301;nadii and the Goda&#x301;varii rivers is known as Utkala. The name of the entire coastal area from the mouth of the Goda&#x301;varii to the mouth of the Suvarn&#x301;arekha&#x301;, that is, both Utkala and Odra, is Kaliun&#x32D;ga. Subjects relating to the land of Od&#x301;ra are called aod&#x301;ra. The language is called od&#x301;rii/aod&#x301;rii. The word or&#x301;iya&#x301; has come from this word od&#x301;rii/aod&#x301;rii. The word ur&#x301;iya&#x301; is not a result of changes to od&#x301;rii/aod&#x301;rii, rather or&#x301;iya&#x301; is, thus it is preferable that the latter be used.<!-- /block --></p>

In many places, during the paddy harvest, farm hands come from other regions and stay temporarily. Once the paddy has been cut they return home. The place where they come to assist in harvesting the paddy is their upanivesha. People from Midnapore used to cut down certain portions of the Sundarban forest in 24 Paraganas in order to cultivate paddy. They used to go there to harvest the paddy, thus this Sundarban region was their upanivesha. Since they used to go there for cultivation they used to call this area their a&#x301;ba&#x301;d ainchal [cultivation-area]. Their right to cultivate was arranged according to whatever plots of land belonged to them, thus they also called that region their &ldquo;lot-area&rdquo;.

<a name="2..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->Those were happy days. Golden days like these pass on and are lost forever, I know, but their golden memory still remains. The East German border was a short way away from that lonely village. It was quite open in that direction &ndash; there was an open field and a few trees. After going for an evening walk, I sat down under a tree. The sun had set but some twilight remained. I could see deer rushing freely back and forth from West Germany to East Germany, and East Germany to West Germany. No one said anything to them. They didn&#146;t require the curse of visas or passports because people had faith in them. They didn&#146;t know how to cheat anyone and they didn&#146;t accept the imaginary border. They didn&#146;t play fast and loose with either their own minds or anyone else&#146;s. Perhaps for this reason people had not set up any system of passport or visa for them.<!-- /block --></p>

A short way from the city was a mountain and some vegetation as well. Then also we saw some deer rushing back and forth in the same way. Deer in Germany are not so afraid of people because they know that people will not kill them, that people are not their enemy. People allow them the opportunity to play in their natural environment, but what I saw in Jamalpur was a different affair altogether. There the deer flee in fear when they see people, even from a distance, because they know that people may capture them or kill them. They fear people even more than tigers. People both uproot their forests, leaving them homeless, and recklessly exterminate them.<!-- /block --></p>

Most people are probably aware that when it comes to animal husbandry Holland is right there at the top in the world. You will find very few countries on earth where the dairy products of Holland are not available in the marketplace. In India also, during British rule, when one asked for dairy products in the market it was understood that one meant dairy products from Holland. The people of that land are not only skilled in animal husbandry, they also have boundless affection for their cows. The country has such a high standard of cows, but you will not see a single one in the streets. There the cows remain in dairy farms &ndash; in selected grasslands within those dairy farms.

<a name="2..102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I have to leave rather quickly. I have to be in Holland before sunrise. When you come there I have something very important to tell you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->Chandan left the room. A few days later I arrived in Holland. My programme to stay there was not fixed in advance so I couldn&#146;t inform him of my arrival. Had I been able to do so, he would have certainly come to meet me in the airport.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..104"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=104 type=paragraph -->From the airport I went to the place where I would be staying. On one side was a dike and on the other a verdant field of grain. Holland is a little low &ndash; some parts are even below sea level &ndash; so along the seashore there are huge dams to ensure that the country isn&#146;t harmed by flooding from the sea. Such dams are called &ldquo;dikes&rdquo;. I recall that a certain kind of very tall dam was erected in Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah Districts also to protect the land situated on the banks of the Damodar River, but these dams did not prove very successful. Due to the dams, the flood-water could not enter the surrounding land areas during the rainy season. As a result, sand and alluvium accumulated in the riverbed which gradually raised its level. It became evident that the dams had to be raised even higher to deal with the situation, but that wasn&#146;t a real solution to the problem. Consequently, if ever the dam broke (as it did in the year 1943), it would submerge the vast, verdant farmlands of Burdwan, Hooghly, and Howrah Districts under flood-waters and cover the incredibly fertile soil with a thick layer of sand which would then require a great deal of labour to render it fit for cultivation. That is what came to pass in the flood of 1943, but such was not the case with Holland. The level of the sea-bed did not rise so drastically after the construction of the dikes. If, unfortunately, it does rise, however, the dikes would have to be made higher. There is no other recourse.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..105"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=105 type=paragraph -->The dikes have another benefit. Gales and storms from the sea strike against the walls of the dikes, and the power of the wind can then be easily harnessed to drive windmills, and this power from the windmills is transformed into electric power. Such windmills can be run at the mouths of Bengal&#146;s rivers and in the coastal areas of Midnapore, 24 Paraganas, Khulna, Barishal and Chittagong Districts, especially the coastal areas near Contai and Diamond Harbour. This is an excellent source of electric power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->As I was saying, there was a dike on one side of the road that I was travelling, and green fields of grain on the other. Off in the distance I noticed a small irrigation ditch running parallel to us. The land could be cultivated all year long &ndash; there was no lack of water. Not an inch of land was lying fallow. You had to praise the industriousness of these people. They made full use of both sea and wind power, and they had established a firm economic base through agriculture and animal husbandry.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->Certain parts of Orissa, Kerala and Bengal bear strong similarities to the natural environment of Holland. The people of those areas have much to learn from the Dutch.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph -->Nowadays, the country is better known as The Netherlands, but the name &ldquo;Holland&rdquo; is also common. As regards the name &ldquo;Holland&rdquo;, some people claim that it comes from &ldquo;Hollow Land&rdquo;. &ldquo;Hollow Land&rdquo; means &ldquo;full of holes&rdquo; or &ldquo;empty&rdquo;. In this sense, Holland means &ldquo;empty land&rdquo; or &ldquo;land of holes&rdquo;, but not everyone agrees with this. They say that Holland is a country of lowlands, but there is no proof that it is hollow, that is, empty or full of holes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph -->We kept on driving. My driver&#146;s name was Govinda. He was not so proficient in English but he knew French and his mother tongue, Dutch. Nevertheless, he had no real difficulty conversing in English and we had no problem understanding him. He told us that although he himself did not know so much English, he was very proud that his seven-year-old daughter who was studying in elementary school knew very good English. As we went on, evening closed in. Everything was quite visible in the brilliant moonlight so we had no difficulty seeing the sights around us. Though I didn&#146;t know why, it felt as if someone was drawing my sight away from the dike again and again, and towards the farmland.  I realized why a short while later when I saw my very close friend, Chandan Mitra, standing by the side of the road with a bouquet of flowers in his hand. I told the driver to stop the car.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->Chandan rushed up to the car and said: &ldquo;Before you say anything I want to show you something.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph -->He took a couple of steps ahead and I followed right behind. The distance between us was filled with a sweet stillness. We went on a way until Chandan came to a grave and stopped beside it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Take a good look at it,&rdquo; he said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->It was an ordinary grave, not the grave of a king or some royal personage. There was no mosaic over it, no tomb. What was there to see? A common person&#146;s grave. One of those who utter a few cries when they are born and spend their entire life weeping, but when they leave this earth there is no one to cry for them. But since it was Chandan asking, I should have a look.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..114"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=114 type=paragraph -->It was the grave of an unknown person. His corpse had washed up from the sea and gotten caught near the dike. No one knew what country he was from. If he had had any passport with him it had been taken by the sea, so there was no way to identify him. They had laid this man of unknown ancestry to rest here in this bed of earth. I told Chandan: &ldquo;Did you invite me here to show me this grave! Well, tell me!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..115"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=115 type=paragraph -->Chandan didn&#146;t reply. I looked at him and saw him fading into the moonlight. Where was Chandan? Where was he? Where did he go? The bouquet of flowers that he had held fell and rolled onto the grave. It seemed as if, under the weight of those flowers, the grave was unable to fade into the moonlight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph -->Then I remembered what had happened nearly fifty years before, when I had gone to Jamui to play football. Chandan and I had been seated on either side of a table in the Jamui Road Station, facing each other. He had a strong desire to know many things; his inquisitiveness was irresistible. His zeal for abstruse subjects like spirituality and spiritualism knew no bounds. He had also acquired a lot of knowledge. Speaking of which, on that day also he asked me: &ldquo;You know, I am thinking about something. Do you know what I am thinking about?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Tell me what you are thinking of.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that if I die before you, then I will find some way or other to communicate with you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Why are you saying such an inauspicious thing?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;You are only fifteen years old. Are you old enough to be thinking in this way?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;It&#146;s not exactly that,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I just want to know whether or not you&#146;ll be afraid if I communicate with you under those circumstances.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->Then fifty years passed. Standing there on Dutch soil, I told Chandan mentally: &ldquo;No Chandan, I wasn&#146;t afraid at all.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..143"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=143 type=paragraph -->In the old Vedic language, bulls were called uks&#x301;a (in Sanskrit the word uks&#x301;a can be found in certain places, perhaps for the sake of the metre). In very ancient times the Aryans came into contact with the first domesticated animals &ndash; sheep (urabhra), horses (haya) and dogs (shva) &ndash; and tamed them. Later on they came in contact with yaks (ushira).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..144"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=144 type=paragraph -->In the pre-Vedic era, the cow was a forest animal. They used to wander in the large grassy forest lands, not in the deep forest. The bison&#146;s (forest buffalo) situation was similar. The relatively gentle-natured forest buffalo used to live near ponds in the grassy forest lands. We can call them &ldquo;water-loving bison&rdquo;. The bison and water-loving bison used to stay far away from human beings. But if they found themselves in a tight spot they would chase them away. Cows (gavii &ndash; in Bengali some people mistakenly write ga&#x301;bhii; this practice should be stopped) did not remain in herds, but  rather in a disorderly fashion. They did not have a developed capacity for self-preservation, and so, in subsequent times, they took shelter with human beings, became domesticated, and thus preserved their existence. In the days when cows were forest-dwellers the male animals (bulls) would generally move in circles around the herd to save the cows from attack from the outside. Those bulls were called uks&#x301;a. Aoks&#x301;a means &ldquo;concerning bulls&rdquo; and the large herd of bulls was called aoks&#x301;aka. Today forest-dwelling cows, while not completely non-existent, are very rare (the Zebu or Zebu Indica, Nhebu and Rhebu disappeared from the earth over one thousand years ago). Those few that remain can be differentiated from domesticated cows in three notable ways. First, they are smaller in size than domesticated cows; second, they produce much less milk and their milk is sweeter and has a stronger scent; and third, they are fast runners. Their dung is also a little spongy, a little like bull&#146;s dung.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..145"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=145 type=paragraph -->Though it is somewhat off the subject, it is worth pointing out that the buffalo came under man&#146;s control a few thousand years after the cow was domesticated. The pure bison variety of buffalo is resistant to domestication, but the water buffalo, because of its lack of speed, has accepted man&#146;s dominion for the sake of self-preservation. Since fondness for water is inherent in this variety of bison, their original instinctive tendencies awaken if they see water nearby. In the burning heat of summer, cart-pulling buffalo also will forget their sense of responsibility and take a dip, cart and all, if they see a pond &ndash; such happenings are not rare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..146"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=146 type=paragraph -->Just as buffaloes don&#146;t want anything else if they get water, cows are just the opposite. If you spray a cow with water it will jump away and flee. In this respect its nature is similar to that of other forest creatures. Since they prefer to remain far from water, their bodies are subject to attacks and pestering from different types of insects (such as ticks), but the bodies of buffaloes suffer very little attacks from insects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..147"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=147 type=paragraph -->The cow is completely a land animal. Like other land animals, the cow also shows a lot of affection towards its young. And thus, if it suffers an untimely separation from its young, the cow slowly stops giving milk. The buffalo is both partially aquatic and partially a land animal; thus in regard to one of the various characteristics of land animals, it shows somewhat less affection towards its young, and so, if it suffers an untimely separation from its young, its milk-giving capacity is not greatly affected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..148"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=148 type=paragraph -->Pictures of bulls are found among ancient cave paintings &ndash; not of oxen. The practice of using oxen for cultivation came much later. &ldquo;Ox&rdquo; in Sanskrit is baliivardda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..149"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=149 type=paragraph -->At any rate, aoks&#x301;a means &ldquo;concerning bulls&rdquo; and aoks&#x301;aka means &ldquo;bull-group&rdquo;. Subjects pertaining to bulls are called aoks&#x301;ava &ndash; in Latin, bovine. Similarly, cow-related subjects are called vaccine. Thus inoculating (t&#x301;iika&#x301;) cows against pox used to be called vaccination.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ka is the first consonant of the Sanskrit alphabet. All the languages of the world which are descended from Sanskrit use ka as their first consonant. All those languages which are adopted-descendants, that is, those which are not directly descended from Sanskrit, but whose vocabulary is full of Sanskrit, also use ka as their first consonant. Both Sanskrit and the world&#146;s phonetic science are arranged in such a way that if ka is used as the first consonant it is very convenient, and if not, then quite troublesome. If ka is not the first consonant, then not only practical difficulties arise but also grammatical difficulties. It becomes impossible to achieve a well-knit system regarding grammatical aphorisms, rules and decisions if ka is not the first consonant.<!-- /block --></p>

In subsequent times, the scripts that arose chiefly from Bra&#x301;hmii, and secondarily from Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;ii, that is, India&#146;s original Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script (the original mother of today&#146;s Kashmiirii, D&#x301;ogrii and Punjabi Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; scripts), Na&#x301;rada (the mother of today&#146;s Gujarati, Na&#x301;grii, Devana&#x301;grii, Mor&#x301;ii, Curuva&#x301;lii, etc. scripts) and Kut&#x301;iila&#x301; (Bengali) script, are arranged according to those phonetic rules.<!-- /block --></p>

Wherever it was written or studied or taught, it used to use whatever script was prevalent in that country at that time.

Those languages are: Sindhii, which is descended from Saendhavii Pra&#x301;krta (the name of its original script is La&#x301;ha&#x301;ndei), the Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya Pra&#x301;krta-descendant Kashmiirii (the name of its original script is Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; &ndash; Kashmir&#146;s Sanskrit books and birth records are still written in this script), Peshawar (Purus&#x301;apur) and Afghanistan&#146;s (Ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;r) language (this language is also descended from Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya Pra&#x301;krta &ndash; pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya &rarr; pashto. Its original script is also Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;), Farsi (its original script also came from Bra&#x301;hmii). In addition to these, there are the Sanskrit adopted-descendants, Baluchi (it is Baluchistan&#146;s original language belonging to the Dravidian branch), and Bra&#x301;hoi (it is also a language of the west bank of the Sindhu river-basin. It is also of Dravidian origin as well as being an adopted descendant of Sanskrit). The other important language of this group is Malay (it is the original language of Malaysia and Singapore. It is included within the Malay family of languages and its original script is Kut&#x301;iila&#x301; (Bengali)). Although Malay is written nowadays in Arabic script for historical reasons, this Sanskrit adopted-descendant has no relation to the Arabic branch of languages. Still, it contains many Arabic words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->All those Sanskrit-descended languages and Sanskrit adopted-descendants which use ka as their first consonant may encounter difficulties at every step in the construction of grammatical aphorisms and the composition of phonetic rules. The s&#x301;a rule, n&#x301;a rule, and system of conjuncts are all unscientifically and disorderly formulated. In many cases, there being no possible formula to apply,  it is said: &ldquo;that&#146;s the way it&#146;s been done&rdquo;. I say, even if Roman script is used for convenience in the world of grammar, its alphabetic system must be arranged according to Sanskrit rules. Otherwise it will have to suffer the results of its own errors. Thus ka is the first consonant of the alphabet of Sanskrit-descended languages and adopted-descendants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->One meaning of the word ka is &ldquo;water&rdquo;. That which is covered by ka, that is, water, (which is kena in the sense of being covered by water) is kaccha.  In ancient times that portion of western India which is situated at the northwest corner of the Ta&#x301;ptii river-basin and the southeast corner of the Sindhu river-basin fell below sea level due to a terrible earthquake of volcanic origin. Sea-water inundated the land of that region and the area became surrounded by water. From then onwards it was called kaccha. There is another place a short distance from there which became partially inundated with sea-water. That area, which was under the moral supervision of Maharshi Bhrgu, was given the name Bhrgu Kaccha (Bharoca). Since that region was situated between Gondawanaland and the ancient Ba&#x301;luca-A&#x301;ra&#x301;ballii mountain range, the entire area was transformed into sargasso sea according to the laws of nature. Thus, as a result of being inundated by sea-water, there remains the possibility of finding mineral oil in the water beds of this area, or beneath the soil where there is no water.<!-- /block --></p>

If you catch hold of one part and pull it, the distant portion will also be raised. Thus, the name of kalmii sha&#x301;k in Sanskrit is kalambii sha&#x301;ka. Actually, the word kalmii is derived from the Sanskrit word kalambii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When manifestation first sprouts within the vast scope of the unmanifest, the Cognitive Faculty is bound by the Creative Faculty. This bound entity is known in Buddhist philosophy by the name of sam&#x301;vrttibodhicitta. In theist philosophy it is given the name ka&#x301;ryabrahma. At that time one portion of the Cosmic Mind becomes the objective counterpart and one portion becomes the subjective counterpart. If there is no object there can be no subjectivity. Thus, since the unmanifest has no object, it has no subject either. In the manifest state the object exists so the subject also exists. Ka is the acoustic root of the objectivated counterpart of the Cosmic Mind, that is, ka signifies sam&#x301;vrttibodhicitta, or ka&#x301;ryabrahma. And that portion of the Cosmic Mind which is the witness of the acoustic root ka has om  as its acoustic root (a + u + m). Bear in mind, the acoustic root of the causal factor of the Cosmic Mind is not (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om but om. (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om refers to the unmanifest Cosmic Entity, regardless of manifestation or non-manifestation, beyond the phenomenal world or within it. Thus we see that another meaning of the word ka is &ldquo;objectivated Cosmic Mind&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->That ka is the acoustic root of the Cosmic Mind transformed into object was certainly known to some few people during Vedic or ancient times. Thus they used a vertical mark to stand for the ka sound as a symbol of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and as a symbol of the binding force or Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; they drew a [[horizontal]] line. In order to signify the Cosmic Mind which has been transformed into the Cognitive Entity due to the bondage of Prakrti, they drew a plus sign [+] as a combined mark with the line signifying Prakrti over the line signifying Purus&#x301;a. In the process of writing this combined mark quickly without lifting the hand, it has taken on the form k: [ka] in modern Bengali. Because all sounds in the practical world are based on the objectivated Cosmic Mind, ka is the first consonant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Since the letter ka is related through the system of mutual replacement to the sound ca, ca becomes the first letter of the second varga<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->; and since t&#x301;a has a relationship of mutual replacement with the sound ca, it becomes the first letter of the third varga. Since ta has an acoustic and lightness<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  relation to t&#x301;a, it is the first letter of the next varga. Since the ka, ca, t&#x301;a and ta vargas are grouped among the long sounds, pa becomes the first letter of the following fifth varga. Since there is no opportunity for a varga system beyond the fifth varga, the acoustic root of destruction, ma, has been kept as the last letter of that varga. Besides these, the remaining letters are either antahstha varn&#x301;a (vowel conjuncts) or us&#x301;mavarn&#x301;a [aspirates]. These aspirated sounds are known as us&#x301;mavarn&#x301;a because at the time of pronunciation the air of the vocal cavity becomes heated. Thus we see that if ka is kept as the first consonant, then acoustic consistency is preserved. Thus, ka is the first consonant of the alphabet.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root kan&#x301;/kan (kan&#x301;i/kani) is &ldquo;to shine&rdquo;, &ldquo;to create sound&rdquo;, &ldquo;to groan&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be injured, or to run away for fear of being injured&rdquo; or &ldquo;to go quickly&rdquo;. Although in the Vedic language this verbal root is mainly constructed with n&#x301;a, in Laokika (comparitively recent) Sanskrit both n&#x301;a and na are used. &ldquo;That which shines&rdquo; or &ldquo;that whose attraction is desired&rdquo; is kan&#x301; + da = kanda.

They also used to use the word kanda for those objects. Often, due to some extra attraction, the sound was doubled or lengthened (prs&#x301;i diirgha) in accordance with the natural law, thus in those cases also the word kanda became kakanda. The first consonant, ka, was doubled. Kakanda  means &ldquo;gold&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

When the Aryans entered India they came to Jambudviipa and found traces of gold particles in the rivers there.

Its etymological meaning is &ldquo;that thing which gives rise to a pleasing vibration in the tongue&rdquo;. I have said several times in the past that the original Persian language is a descendant of Sanskrit. From this word godhu&#x301;ma we get the word gondu&#x301;ma in old Persian. In various Indian languages we get the words gehun, gahum, gahun, gehuma, gohun, gaham (in Rarhi Bengali and parts of Orissa), gam, etc. from this godhu&#x301;ma. When wheat matures its colour becomes somewhat golden. Thus wheat also used to be called kakanda or kan&#x301;aka in old Sanskrit.

Na and da are dental letters, thus no difficulty arises if we write nda, but according to the conjunction rules of linguistic science, a dental letter cannot be combined with a cerebral letter. Thus the conjunction n&#x301;a with da is not allowed. Kanda must be spelled with nda. Nowadays the spelling of kanda with na is prevalent. In the Vedic era, however, the letter n&#x301;a was much more common. Thus the word kan&#x301;d&#x301;a was also used to mean kanda or &ldquo;gold&rdquo;. The meaning &ldquo;gold&rdquo; for the word kan&#x301;d&#x301;a has disappeared.<!-- /block --></p>

The other etymological meaning of the word kaga is &ldquo;one whose movement is towards ka&rdquo;, that is, water. For &ldquo;movement towards water&rdquo; or &ldquo;descending into water&rdquo; there is also the Vedic verbal root il. Il + ac gives ila which means kaga. If we take the word ka to mean water then one colloquial meaning of the word kaga is &ldquo;buffalo&rdquo;.

The word purii, from which kacurii has come, is not a pure Sanskrit word. It is a north Indian Hindi word. When nuchis [a deep-fried unleavened bread] are fried in pure ghee then they are called shakkulii or sham&#x301;kulii or sham&#x301;khulii. In Bengali both luchi and nuchi are equally correct. When the dough for these nuchis is mixed with some ghee for leavening and fried in a pan of ghee, it is called soma&#x301;lika&#x301; in Sanskrit and purii in north India. If it is fried in oil, whether it is deep-fried or fried with sprinkled oil, it is not considered nuchi &ndash; it is called purii. For example, d&#x301;a&#x301;lpurii which is fried in oil.

It has several colloquial meanings:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->1) The kadam flower, whose other name is niipa. Its original home is India and Southeast Asia. Although there are several varieties, both large and small, there are two main varieties. The first is a small-sized flower which is also used as a food when mature for making chutney, pickle, and ambal [a sour broth used as a condiment]. The second variety is a large flower &ndash; although not as tempting as a food, it has a pleasant smell. The blooming of this flower during the rainy season has been alluded to in various ways in ancient literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->2) The second meaning of the word kadamba is dudhiya grass, a grass which grows well in temperate climates.

<a name="3..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->3) A third meaning of the word kadamba is &ldquo;green turmeric&rdquo;, that turmeric which is found in clusters at the base of the turmeric plant. This green turmeric is a cure for skin disease, but since it is a little poisonous it is not edible except as medicine. Shunt&#x301; turmeric [dry turmeric] is prepared by boiling this green turmeric and drying it in the sun. This shunt&#x301; turmeric is used in cooking. Since this green turmeric had the capacity to eliminate the causes of diseases, people in olden times used to smear their bodies with green turmeric paste and bathe before weddings and festivals in order to prevent the outbreak of disease during large gatherings. This festival is still celebrated to some extent and is known as ga&#x301;traharidra&#x301; [ga&#x301;tra means &ldquo;body&rdquo; and haridra&#x301; means &ldquo;turmeric&rdquo;]. Green turmeric is also a cure for eczema. One small measured teaspoon of chopped green turmeric mixed with one or two drops of pure honey and one tulsi leaf, taken with an empty stomach, is considered a medicine for eczema.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Turmeric leaf is called parn&#x301;a in Sanskrit. The word parn&#x301;a means &ldquo;any mature leaf&rdquo;. Immature, red leaves are kishalaya. Green leaves are patra and in the turmeric plant they were called parn&#x301;a. The third meaning of parn&#x301;a is pa&#x301;n&#x301; [betel leaf] (Its Sanskrit name is na&#x301;gavallarii). Ta&#x301;mbula does not refer to betel leaf but rather to any table spice. In this respect, betel leaf belongs to the category of ta&#x301;mbula. According to tradition, when Pa&#x301;rvatii was performing austerities she used to wear clothes made of turmeric leaves stitched together. Thus her name then became Parn&#x301;ashavarii.<!-- /block --></p>

In olden times kat&#x301;ugandhabiija oil used to be called  kat&#x301;utaela, that is, kat&#x301;utaela means any kind of mustard oil. Thus today also mustard oil is called kar&#x301;uya&#x301; in Bihar and certain other parts of India. Kat&#x301;u &rarr; kad&#x301;u &rarr; kar&#x301;u. Kat&#x301;u  means &ldquo;spicy hot&rdquo;. Mustard oil is somewhat spicy and pungent, hence the name.<!-- /block --></p>

With a little irrigation the cultivation of this variety of mustard is the most profitable. This mustard does not like wet climates. At one time it was cultivated throughout Bengal and its seeds used to be exported to different countries. Although today its production has decreased as a result of a lack of proper agricultural practices, if sincere efforts are made then an increase in its production would not be impossible or unachievable.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->The verbal root kad means &ldquo;to create delusion&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be deluded&rdquo;, &ldquo;to swell up and expand&rdquo;. Kad + ac = kada. Its etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which is deluded, or is deluding&rdquo;, or &ldquo;that which has expanded&rdquo;. Colloquially, kada means &ldquo;vapour&rdquo; or &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; because water expands to produce vapour or clouds. That vegetable which is watery, that is, which has expanded due to water, is kadu or kaduka. Kadu means &ldquo;round la&#x301;u&rdquo; [gourd] (ala&#x301;bu means la&#x301;u  of any shape). The word kadu in Bengali is borrowed from Sanskrit. The word la&#x301;u is a Sanskrit-derivative; the original word is ala&#x301;bu. &ldquo;That plant which is watery&rdquo;, that is, which has become expanded due to water, is kadala (kad + alac). That is its etymological meaning. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;banana tree&rdquo;. Kadali/kadalii means &ldquo;fruit of the banana tree&rdquo;. Generally, kadali/kadalii refers to any variety of banana or plantain, but to refer specifically to ripe bananas the word rambha&#x301; must be used. In Bengali ka&#x301;n&#x32D;ca&#x301; kala&#x301; [green banana] and ka&#x301;n&#x32D;cakala&#x301; [green-banana] are not identical.

Before India attained independence, some of the railway timetables were extremely delusory. This kind of timetable used to be called kada. They used to delude others, and others &ndash; that is, us &ndash; were deluded by them. Thus we were also kada. Whether or not the present-day railway timetables are kada, I cannot say, but I would guess that they are either not kada or are making efforts not to be.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->During those days I once had a true experience regarding the kada meaning of the railway timetables, while travelling on the BNWR (Bengal and Northwestern Railway).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->The BNWR line extended roughly from Katihar to Kanpur. Its head office was in Gorakhpur and it was managed by the company.

<a name="3..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->I was travelling to a district headquarters of north Bihar. First I had to go by the EI Railway (EIR &ndash; now ER) to a dock on the Ganges. From there I had to cross the Ganges by steamer and pick up the BNWR at its docking line on the other side. This train would take me a few miles to a junction station on the BNWR main line. There I would have to change trains and get down a few miles later at yet another junction station, that is, I would have to change trains in that third junction station in order to reach my final destination some forty miles away, that is, the concerned district headquarters. Altogether, the distance travelled was only about eighty miles, but the journey required fourteen hours.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->I left home towards dawn and after overcoming various hindrances I reached the third junction at six in the evening and waited in the waiting room&#8230; waited and waited. There was a large table in the waiting room and a few chairs. The table was tepa&#x301;ya&#x301;. Tepa&#x301;ya&#x301; means that it was not three-legged by birth. At one time it had had four legs but in some prehistoric era one leg had broken off and it had not been repaired since. Of the two chairs, one had both arms broken off, and the other was missing the right arm while the left arm was loose. I didn&#146;t feel safe sitting in the chair with the loose arm so I sat in the chair with no arms. I didn&#146;t have any work with me so I read over their timetable to help pass the time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->It was a memorable evening. While I was there a well-known person appeared in the waiting room.

<a name="3..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One day I was coming from Jaynagar to Samastipur,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was a winter night; the doors and windows were open &ndash; &lsquo;First class compartment, but pitch dark&rsquo;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But what was the matter?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Some unknown person had taken away the doors and windows long before. The lights were off because the bulbs were missing. Previously, the railway officials had the bulbs stamped BNWR in white letters to prevent them from being stolen, but when that didn&#146;t stop the thefts, they started printing &lsquo;stolen from BNWR&rsquo; on the bulbs. The idea was that if the thief was not completely shameless, then he would be too embarrassed to use it at home, because if any relative or friend would see it they would know that the head of the house had stolen the bulb from the BNWR. But since even that didn&#146;t prove any obstacle to the thievery, railway officials of late had stopped putting in bulbs. So there was nothing left to do but sit in a dark compartment. People travelling during the dark fortnight had started carrying torches with them. Of course, during the bright lunar fortnight they didn&#146;t need to; the inside of the compartment was illumined by the moonlight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;With some apprehension, I examined one person&#146;s ticket.

I said: &lsquo;You are sitting on the floor of the train. Show me your ticket.&rsquo; He showed me his ticket. &lsquo;But this is a third class ticket,&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;In first class people sit on cushions,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;therefore the extra fare. I&#146;m sitting on the floor of the train, not on any cushion. Why should I pay the first class fare?&rsquo; &rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; I said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the train was impossibly crowded. Everyone was going to Simaria Ghat to bathe in the Ganges. I bowed my head before his logic. After that I didn&#146;t have the confidence to look at anyone else&#146;s ticket. I took my life in my hands and got down at Samastipur. Then I thought to myself: &lsquo;So be it, for today at least, I survived. I got out of a real spot.&rsquo; &rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;So tell me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You must have had some different kinds of experiences getting here.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Quite different, indeed. Too much so for my blood.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;So tell me then. What other experiences did you have?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One time, I was going to Raxaul from Simaria Ghat, via Darbhanga. The train was incredibly overcrowded. It was even overcrowded on top of the train, that is, on the roof. There was even a crowd on top of the luggage wagons. Guys were crowded together on top of the train, playing cards. If I wanted to check their tickets I would have had to climb on top of them. That didn&#146;t agree with me much so I got into a passenger compartment, a first class compartment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There were two differences between these first class compartments and those of other railways that I particularly noticed. The first was that the cushions that were laid out on the wooden seats could be removed as one pleased. That is, if the railway officials wanted, they could remove the cushions as they needed and transform first class into third class, and third class into first class. And so, this cut down on expenses for the railway.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The second difference I noticed was that the word &lsquo;toilet&rsquo; was written in large letters on the washroom door. Nothing was written there at all in third class. Anyhow, I got into the first class compartment and asked to see the ticket of a certain passenger. He showed me a third class ticket. &lsquo;What is this,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;You are sitting on a first class, cushioned seat and you&#146;re showing me a third class ticket! This is against the law; it&#146;s intolerable. It cannot be put up with.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Suddenly all the passengers on the bench jumped up. I retreated a couple of steps out of fear.

No, they weren&#146;t going to beat me.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;In a shaky voice, I asked them softly: &lsquo;Why did you all get up? I didn&#146;t ask you to get up. I only wanted to see your tickets.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; they replied. &lsquo;We all accept that it is wrong to sit in first class with a third class ticket, but look!

We are sitting in third class now, with third class tickets.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Perplexed, I stammered: &lsquo;What are they doing?

<a name="3..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One smart passenger said: &lsquo;I don&#146;t know what&#146;s hidden beneath the other cushions, but from the cushions that they were sitting on I&#146;ve just counted the denizens who have been there for ages together &ndash; of course, according to the last census report &ndash; 555,555 uriish. Now that the cushions have been removed all those bugs have become refugees, so they are running amok, rushing around, looking for shelter. It&#146;s the law of nature that they take refuge in our cushions and make life miserable for us by biting us and sucking our blood. Ticket Examiner, sir, you certainly wouldn&#146;t want us to be subjected to such a hideous situation. So our request is that you don&#146;t scold the travellers sitting on that bench over their tickets, but rather tell them to put the cushions back in their rightful places and clear the way for the uriish to go back to the holes where they were living.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Since we&#146;ve become ghosts, we&#146;ve lost count of how long we&#146;ve been here in hell.  We haven&#146;t had a single chance to eat goat-flesh since we&#146;ve come to hell, because even though cow-ghosts arrive now and then, not a single goat-ghost does. The goblins in the wood-apple trees on the road that leads from earth to hell reach down and pull them up and cook them in the portable stoves they keep in the tree branches, so they can have goat-meat curry simmered with Ganges water along with their rice and ghee.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;While the ghosts were discussing this among themselves in the building a cow-ghost overheard them.

There was some dispute over his passport and visa, to be sure, but when heaven&#146;s border-guards heard his sad story, they were overcome with compassion and let him enter heaven. After entering heaven, the goat-ghost approached the gods and lodged a complaint against the ghosts of hell. He said: &lsquo;Tell me gods, how can one possibly remain in hell with such worries?&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->&ldquo; &lsquo;Everything about the ghosts is a mess,&rsquo; said the gods. &lsquo;They conspired to eat you without even considering the day or date, didn&#146;t they?&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Since the train is so late, I&#146;m sure I&#146;ll get back to the station long before the train comes.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..139"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=139 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The gentleman had just left when he suddenly saw the train he wanted heading towards the station.

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Kakubh<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The root verb kak means &ldquo;to feel pride&#8230; to consider oneself to be someone&rdquo;. By adding the suffix ubhac to kak we get the word kakubh. The etymological meaning of the word kakubh is &ldquo;that which, when focused on, people feel pride&#8230; thinking oneself an important person&rdquo;. The word kakubh is feminine in gender. The colloquial meanings of kakubh are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->1) A particular fraction or arc of the horizon. For example, east, west, northeast, southwest, etc.  Of course, what we call &ldquo;the eastern horizon&rdquo; is where it seems to us that the eastern sky meets the earth, but, if we say &ldquo;eastern horizon&rdquo; it can refer to the entire eastern sky. However, in Bengali we say pu&#x301;rva kakubh for where the eastern sky meets the earth &ndash; for which we have the expression &ldquo;eastern horizon&rdquo; in English; similarly, iisha&#x301;n kakubh [northeast], agni kakubh [southeast], and so on. You can use this word freely.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->2) If many flowers bloom together in a cluster on a tree then that is also called kakubh, or if many flowers are made into a single bouquet or garland then that is also called kakubh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->3) The third meaning of the word kakubh is &ldquo;where many kan&#x301;akaca&#x301;npa&#x301; [kanakacampaka] flowers bloom together in a single bunch on a tree&rdquo;; that is also called kakubh. Kakubh can also be used for a bouquet of [kanakacampaka] flowers, that is, if we say simply kakubh rather than [kanakacampaka]-kakubh, it means a bunch or cluster of [kanakacampaka].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->4) If any song remains confined within the notes of a particular scale (the gat<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> created from it) then the scale (gat) of that song is called kakubh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->5) Kakubh is also the name of a recognized ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii. This ra&#x301;gin&#x301;ii is included within the Kakubh raga. The Kakubh raga is masculine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->6) The word kakubh means &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; or &ldquo;fascination&rdquo;. For example, this flower-garden&#146;s kakubh is captivating.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->7) The seventh meaning of the word kakubh is &ldquo;abundance&rdquo; or &ldquo;uncommonness&rdquo;. For example, at that time the kakubh of the agricultural wealth of the Damodar river-valley was unparalleled in the world. It had no equal anywhere in the production of paddy, cotton and sugar cane. This can be deduced from various clues from the time of Emperor Akbar. Actually, it is perhaps for this reason that some people used to think that because of the area&#146;s gradual increase of kakubh it became known by the name of Varddhama&#x301;na [Burdwan].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->8) The eighth meaning of the word kakubh is &ldquo;loose hair&rdquo;. In olden times, loose hair was often considered a sign of beauty in women. This loose hair is also called kakubh as an expression of praise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->9) The ninth meaning of the word kakubh is &ldquo;loose hair which has been decorated&rdquo;, that is, the hair is loose, it has not been braided or plaited or bound in tresses, but different kinds of decorations have been put in the hair &ndash; this kind of loose hair is also called kakubh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Kakubha<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Ka means &ldquo;water&rdquo;. Ka + skubh +ac = kakubha. The dropping of the sa leaves kakubha. The word is masculine in gender. It is also worth noting that there is no hasanta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  at the end of the word. The etymological meaning of the word kakubha is &ldquo;that which is obtained when water is stirred or agitated or put to work&rdquo;. It has many colloquial meanings. For example:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->1) The tree we get when we soak the ground with water; kakubha means &ldquo;tree&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->2) The material produced from trees is wood. Thus wood furniture is called kakubha, such as &ldquo;chair&rdquo;, &ldquo;table&rdquo;, &ldquo;stool&rdquo;, &ldquo;wooden box&rdquo;, and the small, forward-sloping table in grocery shops which can be used as both a table and a box.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->3) The word kakubha can also be used for wooden pots and pans such as khora&#x301; [a large cup without handles], ket&#x301;ho [wooden vessel], varakos&#x301;a [serving tray], etc. The half-portion of the coconut shell which is used in housework is called kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->4) Water vessels made of wood (such as wooden glasses) are also called kakubha. The word gela&#x301;s which is prevalent in Bengali has come from the English &ldquo;glass tumbler&rdquo;. Actually, &ldquo;glass&rdquo; means ka&#x301;ca [the material glass]. That water vessel which is made from glass is a glass tumbler. The word [glass] is fundamentally incorrect, so it is not bad at all if kakubha is used for &ldquo;water-glass&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->5) Any kind of water vessel, or something that can be sipped from (such as a saucer, water-pot, etc.), is called kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->6) One of the names of the kaman&#x301;d&#x301;alu [a traditional water-pot used by mendicants and students] that students and renunciants used to use in olden times is kakubha. This kaman&#x301;d&#x301;alu generally used to be made from wood or from the shell of a ripe gourd.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->7) The covered water container which was used out of necessity in olden times for travel to far-off countries, and is still used today (such as a canteen or such types of things), is also called kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->8) Those wooden vessels which are hollow, or have cavities, and are covered with skin for producing sound, such as tabla, d&#x301;ugi, mrdaun&#x32D;ga, d&#x301;hol, d&#x301;ha&#x301;k, d&#x301;holak, jayd&#x301;ha&#x301;k, da&#x301;ma&#x301;ma&#x301;, ma&#x301;dal, khol, and so forth, are also called kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->9) The instrumental system known as jaltaraun&#x32D;ga which works by producing sound waves from water-filled vessels of either wood, glass or stone, is also called kakubha. The special vessel which is used is also called kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->10) The dry shell of a ripe gourd which used to be used, or still is, as part of a stringed instrument is also called kakubha. In olden days, the bitter gourd shell was generally used. The bitter gourd used to be called kat&#x301;utumbi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->11) Kakubha is the name of an accepted raga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->12) The ripe gourd shell which forms part of the ekta&#x301;ra&#x301; [a one-stringed instrument] is called ba&#x301;is or ba&#x301;yes in certain parts of Bengal; its refined Bengali [or Sanskrit] name is also kakubha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->13) The hookah which is made from coconut shell with holes in it and used for smoking tobacco, and which is called da&#x301;ba&#x301; or da&#x301;ba&#x301;hunka&#x301; in Bengali, is also called kakubha in the refined language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..27"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Kadara<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Although kadara is certainly a Sanskrit word of Vedic origin, it is also a Persian word of Vedic origin. When the word is in the form of the Persian word of Vedic origin then its meaning is &ldquo;proper assessment&rdquo; or &ldquo;proper evaluation&rdquo;. For example, if we see a talented, educated person being insulted then we tell them: &ldquo;Don&#146;t listen to them. They are uneducated people; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii-gun&#x301;iir kadar bujhbe na&#x301; [they can&#146;t understand the kadara of the well-educated]&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In the Vedic language we get the word kadara from the stem ka and the verbal root dr. One meaning of the word kadara is &ldquo;vakul flower&rdquo;. The vakul is an Indica variety of forest tree, that is, its original home is in the vast forests of this country. The flowers of this very tall tree are, however, extremely small. In spring and summer mornings this sweet-smelling flower drops to the ground at the base of the tree. Because the flower has a natural hole in it, it is easily strung for garlands. Ita&#x301;r [essence] and a fragrant oil are made from its extract. Its fragrance helps to maintain mental equipoise. Although the use of its fragrance is forbidden for renunciants, it is not forbidden for family people because it is sattvagun&#x301;ii [sentient] in nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The vakul fruit has been used as a food since ancient times. It has small seeds, and the oil obtained from its seeds is suitable for cooking, but since there are insufficient quantities available, it is not used for cooking. This oil is, however, used in the family cooking pots in those village areas in forest surroundings where there are sufficient numbers of vakul trees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Vakul oil is a remedy for arthritis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->In northern India vakul is known by the name of maulshrii. In Rarh the vakul flower is called vaul or bol. The word bolpur has come from vakulpur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The third meaning of the word kadara is ca&#x301;lta&#x301; [an edible acid fruit, or its tree]. In some people&#146;s opinion, this fruit came from southeast Asia, while others believe that it came from South America or South Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;dviipa. As far as I can tell, their assertion is not correct. Since there is a Vedic word, kadara, for ca&#x301;lta&#x301;, it means that the people of India were familiar with it since very ancient times, that is, the statement that it arrived in India at the end of the Pathan era is incorrect. This Liliam indica variety of fruit stimulates the appetite, and in small quantities it is good for the liver and kidneys. However, in greater quantities it can lead to an excess creation of bile. In cases of insanity the ca&#x301;lta&#x301; fruit should be avoided.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The ca&#x301;lta&#x301; likes humid air, thus it is usually seen within one hundred and fifty miles of the sea.

Although generally kadara can mean any kind of saw, it also refers more specifically to that small kind of saw that cuts on both sides, such as a conch-saw. This kadara variety of saw has an inseparable relationship with the conch-craft industry. The conch shells that come from that part of the Bay of Bengal which is near Shri Lanka are of the highest quality. The conches that come from the central part of the Bay of Bengal are not such a high quality. Because high quality conch shells are in short supply nowadays (red and white), girls are using them less, and as a result, the conch-crafts industry is in peril. The Sha&#x301;nka&#x301;ris [Hindu caste specializing in conch-shell crafts] and conch traders are practically out of work these days.

In those parts of India where the Pathans were not firmly established, for instance in south India and Maharastra, the veil was not introduced at all; to this day there is no such custom. Married women in ancient Maharastra never used to veil themselves &ndash; it was optional. Widows did not need to use a veil if they chose not to. Even where the Pathans were firmly established, the aborigines living in the hills and forests did not use the purdah. Today as well there is no custom of veiling oneself among the tribal women of Bengal and north India.

The word&#146;s etymological meaning is as follows: The meaning of the word kam is &ldquo;worldly desire&rdquo; &ndash; getting name and fame, or realizing different other types of worldly desires. Worldly desire creates heat in a person&#146;s brain and that heat afflicts the mental body as well; much of the person&#146;s potential is thoroughly wiped out. Excessive fascination with matter destroys the vast potential of human beings. There was one famous Bengali philologist who was ruined by drinking too much wine; there was a famous poet who lost the vibrational power of his brain through excessive attraction to matter. This dwelling-on-matter thrusts the human being down the path of destruction; dwelling on matter engulfs one&#146;s entire existence in flames and puts an end to it.<!-- /block --></p>

The well-known modern game of polo originated in Manipur&#146;s Kobe Valley. After the defeat of Tikendrajit, when Manipur became a tributary state under the British, they included the Kobe Valley in the then British province of Burma. After the British left Burma and India, the Kobe Valley remained a part of Burma. Nowadays the part of Manipur which is accepted as Indian territory is a state in India, but the Kobe Valley is part of Burma. Originally, only royal princes used to play the horse-riding game of polo. For that a very hard ball was needed. The kind of bamboo that was used, used to grow in the eastern portion of Rarh in slightly salty soil.

After that the pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya civilization starts there. Comparatively speaking the Austric influence is comparatively less than the Mongol-Tantric influence. This area has been known as Trihotriiya Bhu&#x301;mi since ancient times.

After a while we&#146;ll reach Benares city by narrow gauge. I&#146;d like to know how deep the Vedic influence was in this area which you describe as the second part of the Gangetic Valley civilization.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->I replied, &ldquo;Look, as far as I understand, the land of Rarh is the land where Sanskrit originated. But the ancient language which we describe as the Vedic language came to India from the northwest along with the Aryans. The Aryans first migrated to the Sindhu-Saoviira, and the land of Sapta-Sindhu, the Seven Rivers (Sutlej or Shatadru, Bias or Vipa&#x301;sha, Ravi or Ira&#x301;vatii, Chenub or Candrabha&#x301;ga&#x301;, Jhelum or Vitasta&#x301;, Kabul and Sind). These seven rivers together are known as the Sapta-Sindhu. Later on the land became known as the Punjab, that is, the land of five rivers. The names of two rivers have been dropped, so there remain only five.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This is the first phase of the Vedic influence in India. In the second phase the Aryans moved further southeast: their influence pervaded in the northern part of the Yamuna valley. That area was known as Haritadha&#x301;nya or the &lsquo;Land of Green Vegetation&rsquo; (Haritadha&#x301;nya &rarr; Hariaha&#x301;nna &rarr; Hariha&#x301;na &rarr; Hariya&#x301;na).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Then, in the next phase, the Aryans reached Praya&#x301;ga around the Ganga-Yamuna valley. This we can describe as the third phase of the Vedic influence. Then they moved farther east, and their influence extended to the Gan&#x301;da&#x301;kii river on the north and the Shon River on the south. This can be called the fourth phase of the Vedic influence. In this area was situated the ancient Ka&#x301;shiira&#x301;jya or Kingdom of Ka&#x301;shii. We are now journeying through the Ka&#x301;shiira&#x301;jya. One thing to be noted here is that in the first phase, the Vedic language left two daughters behind: Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya and Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta. In the languages born out of this Pa&#x301;shca&#x301;ttya and Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta (for example, Pashto, Punjabi, etc.) there is a multitude of derived words from the Vedic language. In the second phase, that is, in the Hariya&#x301;navii language, the percentage of Vedic-derived words is somewhat less. In the third stage, the percentage of the Vedic-derived words is still less, for instance in languages like Ma&#x301;r&#x301;oya&#x301;rii, Har&#x301;aotii, Bundelii, Ba&#x301;ghelii, Avadhii, and Vrajabha&#x301;s&#x301;a, etc. And in the languages of the fourth stage, like Bhojpurii, the percentage of Vedic-derived words is still less. But no one should misunderstand that in the fourth stage the Vedic influence was nil. No doubt the direct Vedic influence in the fourth stage was nil, but the indirect influence in pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya and Gaod&#x301;iiya civilizations was tremendous, and that influence still persists even today.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->Sutanuka&#x301; said, &ldquo;I&#146;ve noted with interest that in the fourth stage the external appearance of the people and the size of the cattle are quite different from those of the pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya and Gaod&#x301;iiya civilizations.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->Then I said, &ldquo;You&#146;re right in your observation.

Suddenly, a handsome gentleman dressed in a military uniform came running up, and, gasping for breath, entered the compartment. Immediately he approached me with rapid steps. After a while, when I looked closely at him, I was amazed to see that he was none other than my brother-in-law, Aru&#x301;pratan Mitra, Sutanuka&#x301;&#146;s husband, whom I met about fifteen years ago at Bor&#x301;oka&#x301;liitala&#x301; at Chandannagar!

<a name="4..100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p said, &ldquo;About fifteen minutes ago, at a quarter to nine, my mind suddenly became restless and agitated with so many thoughts and feelings.

<a name="4..101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p sat down. He was still gasping for breath.

<a name="4..103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->I said, &ldquo;Unrest or peace are all in the mind. Well, let us talk for a while.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..104"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=104 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p said, &ldquo;Some time ago I heard from someone that you have already addressed a few symposia on river valley civilizations. I couldn&#146;t realize what it was, but I guessed that you might have said something about how at the different stages of rivers the patterns of civilizations vary.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..105"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=105 type=paragraph -->I asked him, &ldquo;Were you then in Britain?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->He answered, &ldquo;Yes, I was,&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Perhaps you know that Great Britain is a small country; the distance from any part of Britain to the ocean is not more than fifty miles. So naturally in that country there cannot be any large river: the distance between the source of a river and the ocean cannot be very great. Yet if we move along the banks of certain rivers, there is a difference between the civilization of the upper areas of the river and the lower ones, and there is also a variation in language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Take for example the case of the river Thames: it is not a big river, either in width or in breadth. The part of the river Thames where the ships sail is not really a river, it is only an estuary of the sea, just like the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; river near Canning. Many people think that the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; is perhaps a wide and large river. They may think that in olden days the southern branch of the river Yamuna (Vidya&#x301;dharii) emerging from the Ganges at Trivenii, moved southwards, and then it and the southeastern tributary of the Ganges (Piya&#x301;lii) both flowed separately for a certain distance and then joined together to form the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; river. Though this is a fact, yet the collective waters of these two combined rivers is quite small. In fact, the Ma&#x301;tla&#x301; river is nothing but the estuary of the sea entering into the land.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The deltaic portion of the river Thames is somewhat similar. The more one proceeds down the river from the source of the Thames, the greater is the Anglo-Saxon and Norman influence. If one moves from the southern bank of the Thames towards the Straights of Dover, there is still a tremendous Norman influence, like a subterranean flow. If one moves from the northern side of the river towards the port of Grimsby on the delta at the coast, there is a greater Anglo-Saxon influence than Norman influence. If one moves towards the coast, the Norman influence becomes negligible. Where there is Norman influence, there are large numbers of Latin derivations in the spoken language. Where the Anglo-Saxon influence is predominant, the number of Latin derivative words is comparatively little. The difference in intonation in the respective areas, too, is quite discernible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If one moves towards the opposite part of the Thames river, or towards Wales in the west, the ancient Briton influence is not negligible, even in the spoken language. This is the reason why, though Welsh is a language of a small country, yet it has certain specialities of its own. Even the difference in people&#146;s external appearance, though not very prominent, is not negligible either.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph -->I said, &ldquo;You are right, Aru&#x301;p, in your observation. I notice that both you and Himava&#x301;n are equally interested in river valley civilizations. I was not aware of this before!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p blushed and smiled faintly. He said, &ldquo;Perhaps you once said that in our land of Rarh, on either bank of the Bakreshvar river in central Birbhum, there is a local civilization which, though small in area, has its own speciality even in the style of its temples and also in its terracotta works. There is also a difference in the use of verbal forms in the spoken language of that area. Similarly, in southern Birbhum also, there is a small river called the Kopa&#x301;i (Kupita or &lsquo;angry&rsquo;) in whose valleys there is also some sort of local civilization. As far as I remember, someone said that the water of the Bakreshvar valley is one of the best for it is full of sulphur. But the water of Kopa&#x301;i valley, though it is as good as that of many places in Bengal, is not as good as that of the Bakreshvar valley. The two small rivers, with their own distinctive streams of water, flow from the west to the east, carrying the rhythmic songs of the most ancient human civilization, in cadence with the dancing rhythms of the land of Rarh. When the two rivers meet at Melanpur (meaning &lsquo;meeting place&rsquo;) at one end of the area under the jurisdiction of the Nanur police station, they are known as Kuye, and at that point both their local civilizations become blended. Melanpur really joins the two rivers in all respects. If one listens intently to the local dialect, one will hear a particular drawled intonation which is lacking in west Birbhum. Besides this, other local variations also came into being there.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph -->I said, &ldquo;You are right, Aru&#x301;p. Really I am delighted by your description. The specialities of the river valley civilizations are very distinct in our Birbhum. In the upper reaches of Birbhum, the spoken language has no drawled intonation: it is one of the flawless branches of the Rarh language. But in the lower reaches of Birbhum, the same Rarh dialect has a local drawl &ndash; have you noticed it?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p said, &ldquo;Yes, I have. This subtle difference in intonation between the area of the Khayra&#x301;sol police station and the La&#x301;bpur police station, and again, between the Khayra&#x301;sol police station and the Mayureshvar police station, can be easily discerned only by listening to it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..114"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=114 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p said, &ldquo;Though it is not directly concerned with culture, still it is a funny story&#8230;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..115"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=115 type=paragraph -->I looked at Aru&#x301;p and asked him, &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p said, &ldquo;At Khayra&#x301;sol in the upper reaches of Birbhum, there is a widespread use of poppy seed, whereas in the lower reaches, the use of poppy seed is less by five to seven per cent. That is to say, in the upper reaches there is an empire of poppies, and in the lower reaches there is merely a kingdom of poppies!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;p burst into laughter. I too joined in his laughter. To continue, I said, &ldquo;The other symbols of Rarh culture &ndash; like d&#x301;im&#x301;le [a type of pumpkin], kher&#x301;o [another type of pumpkin], green gram, jhumur dance are equally popular in both the upper and lower reaches.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;pratan smiled, and said with a voice growing in excitement, &ldquo;Yes brother, I&#146;ve noticed that too.

<a name="4..119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;By the way, Aru&#x301;p&rdquo;, I said, &ldquo;you rushed into this compartment at exactly nine o&#146;clock.

<a name="4..120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->Aru&#x301;pratan exclaimed in wide-eyed amazement, &ldquo;What! Did Sutanuka&#x301; and Himava&#x301;n come here?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Don&#146;t you know that?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;They accompanied me in this very compartment from Allahabad City and got off the train in Benaras. They were in a hurry to get to Ka&#x301;shii where they were planning to catch an evening train which would get them to Burdwan by dawn on Wednesday morning. They told me that you were expected to land at Dumdum airport at around the same time, and that you would take a local train from Howrah to Burdwan, reaching there at about ten the same day. They have the keys of the house, so if you were to arrive there before them you would be put to great trouble.

<a name="4..122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No, I didn&#146;t see them,&rdquo; said Aru&#x301;pratan. &ldquo;I missed them at Benaras railway station. But what you said was correct: I was expected to arrive at Burdwan at ten on Wednesday morning.&rdquo; He paused for a while and then continued. &ldquo;They shouldn&#146;t catch any train which will get them there late at night or at dawn &ndash; I apprehend some danger.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If you sense some impending danger, under no circumstances should they catch any Burdwan train at that particular time.

They have to be prevented from taking any of those Burdwan trains.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;That&#146;s a good idea. That&#146;s a good idea.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph -->The train slowed down. We were approaching a station, no doubt. Aru&#x301;pratan jumped to his feet, rushed to the door, and, looking like a bird ruffled by a raging tempest, leapt onto the platform without waiting for the train to stop. He had reason enough to be worried.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->As soon as the train stopped my private secretary hurriedly entered my compartment. I guessed he had just finished his dinner of lit&#x301;t&#x301;i [a type of fried, unleavened bread] with his in-law. Perhaps his in-law had also served him kar&#x301;iibar&#x301;ii [a type of dumpling made of chick-pea flour and served in yoghurt water] and ma&#x301;kha&#x301;na ks&#x301;iir [a type of sweet rice] for dessert. My private secretary sat beside me and asked me if I had been inconvenienced in any way. I said I hadn&#146;t. Our train was moving from west to east across the border of the ancient Ka&#x301;shii state. I had told Himava&#x301;n that this was the last area to come under Aryan influence. In the fourth phase of the Aryan invasion of India, Ka&#x301;shii can be regarded as a border state of northern India (A&#x301;rya&#x301;vartta). The River Sarayu not only carried the Aryan influence along its banks but also Mongol and to some extent Austric influence as well. That is why its eastern bank was considered as non-Aryan land. Later on this boundary was further extended to the River Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii (Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;ii Gan&#x301;d&#x301;ak). The Ka&#x301;nyakubja Brahmans of those days did not like to cross the River Sarayu. As the land on the other bank was non-Aryan it was considered unholy. They were afraid they would lose their Aryan purity. Those Ka&#x301;nyakubja Brahmans who dared to cross the river, being lured by the fertile land of the trans-Sarayu area, were declared outcastes. They lost their identity as Ka&#x301;nyakubja Brahmans and became known as Sa&#x301;rayupa&#x301;rii Brahmans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->During Pathan rule, the last boundary of A&#x301;rya&#x301;vartta was the present Ghazipur District. In those days north India consisted of three Subas [administrative divisions]: Suba Ba&#x301;nga&#x301;l on the east, Suba Punjab on the northwest and Suba Hindostan between the two. Even today, the people of Bengal and the Punjab call the inhabitants of the middle part of northern India &ldquo;Hindustani&rdquo;. Some people are of the opinion that Hindustan means the whole of India and thus why should the inhabitants of a small part of India be called Hindustani. But this is wrong, because the term &ldquo;Hindustani&rdquo; is used for the people who were once the inhabitants of Suba Hindostan, and not in the sense of Hindustan as being the whole of India. During the Mughal period when Akbar divided his empire into fifteen subas, the name of the northern part of Suba Hindostan was Oudh and the southern part, Suba Agra. Ghazipur District was the last boundary of Suba Agra. On the east of Ghazipur District lies Balia District. Previously it was only a subdivision of Ghazipur District. Similarly, there was no Deoria District in those days. It was only a subdivision of Gorakhpur District.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->The British occupied both Agra and Oudh Subas and made one administrative area out of them &ndash; the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (UP for short) with its capital at Allahabad. In the last part of British rule, the capital was moved to Lucknow. Anyway, there was a marked influence of Mongol and Austric cultures on the Aryan society inhabiting the Sarayu&#x301; river valley. Later on many Aryans crossed the Sarayu&#x301; river and declared the banks of the Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii as the boundary line of A&#x301;rya&#x301;vartta. The area lying on the west of the Gan&#x301;d&#x301;akii valley was called Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;ya and the area on the east was called Videha or Mithila&#x301;. This latter area was not considered as an Aryan colony. I personally consider it as part of the area covered by the pre-Gaod&#x301;iiya Gangetic valley civilization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->King Mithi occupied Videha. To sanctify the land he held a Trihotriiya&#x301; Yajin&#x32D;a [a big sacrifice presided over by three priests]. It was then declared sacred. The land sanctified by the performance of a Trihotriiya&#x301; Yajin&#x32D;a was named Trihut. The land of Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;ya, although not widely valued by the Aryans, was respected by the Buddhists. Lord Buddha visited it a couple of times. Later, it became known as Sha&#x301;ran&#x301;a (Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;ya &rarr; Sha&#x301;kya&#x301;ran&#x301;a &rarr; Sha&#x301;ran&#x301;a).

The district headquarters of Champaran was Motiha&#x301;ri, that of Sha&#x301;ran&#x301; was Cha&#x301;pra, and that of Trihut was Muzaffarpur. This latter district was named after Muzaffar Shah. It covered a wide area and until the early part of the British period its fertile soils were thickly forested. The forests contained abundance of numerous species of flora and fauna, notably tigers, antelopes, crocodiles, panthers and deer. The lake on the ancient river course of the river Lakhandei covered a larger area in those days and was surrounded by extensive forest full of abundant flora and fauna. A major part of the forest was part of the king of Darbhanga&#146;s estate. Some of it was within the Shu&#x301;ras&#x301;an&#x301;d&#x301;a kingdom, and some part belonged to the estate of the Bettiah king.

I arrived home about a week later, my mind full of pleasant memories. Waiting for me on the table was a letter from Himava&#x301;n, sent from Burdwan, in which he wrote: &ldquo;Dear Uncle, We had an unforgettable experience on our return to Burdwan. We left Ka&#x301;shii late Tuesday evening and were sure that we would reach home either late Tuesday night or Wednesday morning at dawn. Late into the night, mother and I were discussing river-valley civilizations when we suddenly heard a huge crash and felt a severe jolt. I don&#146;t remember ever having heard such a loud noise in all my life. In a fraction of a second the train seemed to be smashed into pieces. There was commotion all around &ndash; people were screaming &ndash; chaos reigned everywhere. Mother and I were violently thrown out of the derailed compartment. Pieces of train and the passengers&#146; baggage were scattered here and there. We realized we were the victims of a tragic accident &ndash; who knows how many were lying dead. Both of us were violently thrown towards part of the derailed train, screaming desperately. Suddenly both of us perceived my father (Sri Aruprathan Mitra) rushing towards us. He grabbed each of us by the hand and pulled us out of the wreckage, saving us from the jaws of inevitable death. What happened next we cannot say, for we both became unconscious.<!-- /block --></p>

As we had fallen onto hay our injuries were not severe &ndash; just a few bruises. A crowd of villagers had gathered around us. We saw the wreckage of the train in the distance and heard the pitiful screams and lamentations of the seriously wounded. The local people were very kind, as the people of Burdwan usually are. On seeing the slightest hardship of others, tears come into their eyes. Those people standing around us desperately wanted to help and kept asking what they could do to make us feel more comfortable. They were prepared to do anything to help. We asked them to look for my father and to bring him to where we were lying. They searched everywhere for him, but without success. &lsquo;There&#146;s no one called Aru&#x301;pratan Mitra here,&rsquo; they said. They helped us get to our feet &ndash; which we could only do with great difficulty &ndash; so that we could also look for him. But our search was also unsuccessful &ndash; he was not to be seen anywhere. By that time the railway auxiliary van had arrived from Burdwan.

The ground staff informed us that they had received no news as to the plane&#146;s whereabouts, nor was it possible for them to find out for reasons of military security.

From the passenger list provided at the airport it appears there were twenty Indian passengers.

The colloquial meaning of the word kapittha is &ldquo;stone-apple&rdquo; (Feronium elephantum). In the opinion of some scholars, the original home of the stone-apple is Southeast Asia; others believe that it comes originally from South America (southern Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;dviipa). Although their opinion may be partially correct, it may also not be because the kapittha  has been found in this country since ancient times. Numerous references to it are found in Sanskrit literature. It is true that mango has been in this country since ancient times, and today also it is a forest tree. Although it is only one of a number of examples demonstrating the ancientness of the mango in this country, according to ancient Sanskrit descriptions Hanuman crossed the sea and brought the mango here. Based on this one can venture a guess that the mango came here from across the sea, but there is no such example in Sanskrit literature concerning the kapittha, or stone-apple. Rather references to the stone-apple are seen in small incidents. For example, gajabhuktakapitthavat.  In the Gola&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya it is said: Kapitthaphalavat vishvam&#x301; daks&#x301;in&#x301;ottarayoh samam&#x301;.

The colloquial meaning of the word kapota is &ldquo;dove&rdquo; and &ldquo;pigeon&rdquo;. In olden days, when the roads were not well-developed, people used to send messages to distant lands with the help of trained pigeons or doves. Generally a letter used to be attached to one of the bird&#146;s limbs. Once those trained doves or pigeons arrived at their destination they would carry back a reply also. This system of mail delivery with the help of these kinds of birds was prevalent for many years on the battlefield. Pigeon-post was even used in some places in India during British rule. From this word kapota or kapotara we get the word kabutara (in Mymensingh Bengali, kaetara). However, for &ldquo;pigeon&rdquo; the word pa&#x301;yra&#x301; is better than the word kabutara because pa&#x301;yr&#x301;a has come from the Sanskrit word pa&#x301;ra&#x301;vata.

At the end of autumn, when the paddy fields are somewhat muddy, kernels of grain are scattered in those paddy lands where it is not possible to sow seeds for cultivation in the winter season, or where those seeds will not sprout in the dead of winter, even if sown, for lack of water. These kernels of grain sprout and grow into plants in the spaces between the paddy. When the paddy is harvested, the tops of these plants are also cut.  As a result, more offshoots grow and at the end of the cold season they yield a generous amount of flowers and pods. This type of seed-scattered crop is called the &ldquo;pigeon-harvest&rdquo;. Small lentils, thikre gram or the blackish-coloured small gram, thikre pea (blackish-coloured, small pea), rapeseed, khesa&#x301;ri or teor&#x301;a&#x301; (trikut&#x301;i or tripurii) &ndash; these crops are generally produced as part of the pigeon-harvest. In most parts of Bihar the pigeon-harvest is called pa&#x301;yruya&#x301;. In land where there is no system of irrigation, or where the soil becomes hard or cracked at the end of winter, the produce from the pigeon-harvest is of great benefit to the farmers. Moreover, this pigeon-harvest increases the soil&#146;s power of production, or fertility. As to the surplus, the stalks, pod husks and chaff make excellent bird food and cattle fodder. If mustard is planted it yields khail which can be used as both fertilizer and bird food.<!-- /block --></p>

Thus, ordinarily, the meaning of kapotaka becomes &ldquo;small pigeon&rdquo; or &ldquo;small dove&rdquo;. Yes, the word kapotaka can certainly be used to mean &ldquo;small pigeon&rdquo; or &ldquo;small dove&rdquo;, but its principal meaning is what we call in English &ldquo;antimony&rdquo;, in Sanskrit, rasa&#x301;in&#x32D;jana, in spoken Bengali, rasa&#x301;na &ndash; some people also call it gha&#x301;mtel.

In the southern portion of central Bengal where the soil is more saline, that is, in the areas of 24 Paraganas, Khulna, Bakharganj, Calcutta, and so on, there was hardly a single garjan tree; instead one found the forests of saline climates &ndash; betel, areca, mangrove, and henta&#x301;l or hinta&#x301;l [a tree similar to palm] (The old name of that village which was established by cutting down the henta&#x301;l jungle was Henta&#x301;lii or Hinta&#x301;lii. This part of Calcutta is nowadays called Entally). Another particular name of the garjan tree or garjan wood is kapotaka. Its juice or sap can also be put to various uses. Garjan wood does not decay easily, thus a great deal of wood used to be exported from the mangrove swamps of Uluberia and north Calcutta to Bengal and north India. Like sundari wood, garjan wood is used in the construction of boats and local ships.<!-- /block --></p>

A type of rasa&#x301;in&#x32D;jana also used to be prepared out of aloe sap, or musabbar, which was used as medicine &ndash; it was used to treat blood pressure and insanity due to gall bladder disorder.

I have already discussed the five internal and five external va&#x301;yus.  The pitta element is the principal helping factor in the digestive mechanism. As a result of it, the seven formative body elements are created. The third health-determining element is kapha, or the liquid, viscous portion of the body. Excess kapha creates spontaneous heat within the body which manifests externally as fever. In traditional Muslim medicine, of course, blood is also considered a fundamental, health-determining element, but this is not so in ayurveda. The word kapha is old Vedic.

<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Etymologically, ka means &ldquo;head&rdquo;. Actually, ka does not mean exactly &ldquo;head&rdquo; &ndash; the name of that bony receptacle inside the head in which the brain resides is kabandha (cranium). Still, in common parlance kabandha refers to the head in Sanskrit. Ka + bandh (badhi) + ac = kabandha. Etymologically, the condition that is created when ka is bound and injured, or decapitated is kabandha. Colloquially, kabandha means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->1) A headless body, or torso. In spoken Bengali the imaginary headless ghost, or kabandha ghost, is called kandha-ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; ghost. In this case the word kandha-ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; has come from the word skandha-ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;, that is, one whose upper portion of the skandha [shoulder] has been cut. Ordinarily the covering, as well as the ornament, of the trunk of the body, or kabandha, is called dhar&#x301;a&#x301;,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and the covering, as well as the ornament, of the head is called cu&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;. Both together become dhar&#x301;a&#x301;-cu&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->2) Kabandha is the name of a ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asa [demon] &ndash; according to the Puranas, the one that Rama killed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->3) If we take ka to mean &ldquo;water&rdquo;, then the meaning of kabandha becomes &ldquo;dam&rdquo; or &ldquo;barrage&rdquo;. Ka, or water, is certainly held back by a dam or a reservoir, but the main purpose there is to create a reservoir, while the main purpose of a barrage is to hold back the water. Thus, while kabandha can be used correctly to mean &ldquo;dam&rdquo; or &ldquo;reservoir&rdquo;, it is more correctly used to mean &ldquo;barrage&rdquo;. Thus we can call a barrage kabandha or jala-bandha [jala means ka, or &ldquo;water&rdquo;]. In ancient times when Rarh contained large forested areas there was also more rainfall. Still, then also the kings used to build huge reservoirs in years when there was little rainfall in order to save the paddy from withering. In the common language of Rarh, these extremely large reservoirs used to be called ba&#x301;ndh, and still are. For example, Bankura District&#146;s Samudraba&#x301;ndh, Bhagaladiighi, and Ra&#x301;n&#x301;iiba&#x301;ndh, Dumka&#x301;&#146;s Bar&#x301;aba&#x301;ndh, Purulia&#146;s Sa&#x301;hebba&#x301;ndh, Da&#x301;ntan&#146;s Sarashaun&#x32D;ka&#x301;, and so forth. For such types of ba&#x301;ndhs we can use the word kabandha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->4) The pure Bengali word for the cloth tie that people used to wear around their neck in ancient times as symbol of dharma is kabandha.  The muffler or scarf or comforter that is worn around the neck to protect the head, or ka, from cold or attacks of kapha can also be called kabandha in refined Bengali [and Sanskrit].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->5) The Ketu [dragon&#146;s tail] of the Puranic stories we can also call kabandha.  According to the Puranic tale, the asuras [demons] wanted to deprive the gods of the nectar of immortality that was produced from the churning of the sea by the gods and demons. One asura secretly swallowed it, and as a result he started to become immortal. What a problem, the gods realized! An asura is becoming immortal. Thereupon they cut off his head with the Vis&#x301;n&#x301;ucakra [the discus of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u]. The name of the decapitated head of that asura is Ra&#x301;hu and its torso&#146;s name is Ketu. Thus, another meaning of the word kabandha is Ketu. According to the story, at the time of the lunar or the solar eclipse Ra&#x301;hu swallows either the moon or the sun. Vidhurapi vidhiyoga&#x301;t grasyate Ra&#x301;huna&#x301;hasao [Even the moon is eclipsed by Ra&#x301;hu, this is the providential decree].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->But Ra&#x301;hu&#146;s neck is cut. Thus, shortly after Ra&#x301;hu swallows either the sun or the moon, they come back out through the cut neck. The sun or the moon gets liberated from the swallowing of Ra&#x301;hu. In ancient times, in accordance with their beliefs, people used to bathe in some holy body of water and used to call this bath the &ldquo;liberation bath&rdquo; [mukti-sna&#x301;n] Actually, Ra&#x301;hu and Ketu are successively umbra and penumbra, and for this reason, in the opinion of the astrologers, ketu would be found in the seventh sign from whatever planet in which ra&#x301;hu was found. Thus, if the moon would enter the seventh astrological sign from whatever sign the sun was in then there would be a lunar eclipse.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Neither ra&#x301;hu nor ketu is an actual planet or satellite. They are, in any one set of circumstances, two kinds of umbra. Thus in the astrological scriptures they are called &ldquo;shadow-planets&rdquo;. According to the Puranic conception, Brahma&#x301; is the father and Umbra is the mother &ndash; this is how Ra&#x301;hu is known. According to a Puranic tale, the name of one of Brahma&#x301;&#146;s wives is Cha&#x301;ya&#x301; [umbra] and the name of the sun&#146;s wife is also Cha&#x301;ya&#x301;. Here the progeny&#146;s name is Shan&#x301;igraha [Saturn] (both the spellings Shani and Shan&#x301;i are correct), thus another name of Shani is Cha&#x301;ya&#x301;putra [putra means &ldquo;son&rdquo;]. Since another meaning of the word ka is the bony receptacle situated inside the head &ndash; or cranium &ndash; many people mean ra&#x301;hu when they say ka. There is no objection if someone uses ka to mean ra&#x301;hu, but it is not correct if some wishes to use kabandha to mean ra&#x301;hu; kabandha means ketu.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->7) The retention-of-urine ailment that results when the movement of the urine is obstructed is also called kabandha. The water from soaked fenugreek, fresh date juice, palm juice, and sha&#x301;nkha&#x301;lu [a conch-shaped esculent] are medicines for this disease.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the root verb kam is &ldquo;to want&rdquo;. Kam + at&#x301;ac = kamat&#x301;a. The etymological meaning of the word kamat&#x301;a is &ldquo;one who desires&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is desired&rdquo;. If kam is taken to mean &ldquo;water&rdquo;, then the etymological meaning of the word kamat&#x301;a becomes &ldquo;that which is involved in matters related to water&rdquo; or &ldquo;one in whose matters water is involved&rdquo;. Colloquially kamat&#x301;a means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->1) Bamboo shoot. Just as with the banana tree, where the young plant grows from near the roots, bamboo shoots spring up near the base of the tree. In ancient Bengal people would often place an earthen pot over the bamboo shoot. The young shoot would then wind itself into the pot, continuing to grow. When the shoot would fill up the pot they would cut the shoot off and take the shoot-filled pot away. They would crack open the pot and use this bamboo shoot, which was now rounded and crimped like a cabbage, as a cooking vegetable. It made for a very tasty dish. If a little breeze would come along while it was still in its pot-bound condition then the pot would tremble.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Kap + i = kapi. The etymological meaning of the word kapi is &ldquo;that which moves or jumps&rdquo; (for that reason another name for monkey is kapi), thus the round-shaped bamboo shoot inside the clay pot used to be called ba&#x301;ndha&#x301;kapi [ba&#x301;ndha&#x301; means &ldquo;bound&rdquo;] or konr&#x301;akapi [konr&#x301;a means &ldquo;shoot&rdquo;]. In subsequent times, when cabbage and cauliflower, etc. arrived in Bengal they were also given the Bengali names ba&#x301;ndha&#x301;kapi [cabbage], phulkapi [cauliflower], olkapi [arum] and so forth. In Sanskrit, then, bamboo shoot is called kamat&#x301;a; konr&#x301;akapi is also called kamat&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->2) Kamat&#x301;a also means &ldquo;[water] turtle&rdquo;. There are generally two types of turtles, the land-dwelling turtle, or tortoise, and the water-dwelling turtle. The tortoise is very long-lived. They live on grass and leaves. The [water] turtle is also long-lived. In some people&#146;s opinion, the tortoise lives up to nearly five hundred years in age, while the turtle can survive up to three hundred years.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The water turtle is highly carnivorous. The water turtle also comes onto land, however, in order to lay its eggs. It removes some sand or soft earth and lays its eggs in that depression. Afterwards it covers the eggs back up and returns to the water. With the help of the internal heat of the sand or earth the young burst their shell and come out. The moment the young are born they run right for the water. Normally most of the young turtles are eaten by birds or other carnivorous creatures before they can make it from land to water. While the tortoise also lays its eggs underneath sand or earth, it remains nearby so less of its young die. The water turtle lays a great quantity of eggs while by comparison the tortoise lays much less. People eat both kinds of turtle eggs. A perusal of old Bengali literature shows that the Bengalees of that time used to eat turtle eggs with bitter greens [a bitter vegetable green]. Not all water turtles are edible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->According to differences in size and nature turtles are known by different names in Bengali, such as kacchap, ket&#x301;ho (&ldquo;hard as wood&rdquo;), ka&#x301;ut&#x301;ha&#x301;, ba&#x301;rkol, and so on. All kinds of turtles are called kamat&#x301;a in Sanskrit and refined Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->3) Kamat&#x301;a was the name of a mythological demon depicted in the Puranas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->4) The fourth meaning of the word kamat&#x301;a is what we call in Bengali jag [jug]. The type of water vessel from which water is poured into a glass, or kakubha, is nowadays called a jag.  The actual Bengali, as well as Sanskrit, word for jug is kamat&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->5) The fifth meaning is &ldquo;water full of high waves&rdquo;. Just as water with few waves is called kamala, the same water with many waves is called kamat&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->6) The shark is called kamat&#x301;a in Sanskrit and refined Bengali. Those sharks which are large in size and live in the ocean are normally called ha&#x301;un&#x32D;gar in Bengali, and those sharks which live in coastal rivers or backwaters or estuaries, are called ka&#x301;mat&#x301;a in spoken Bengali. They are somewhat smaller in size than the ha&#x301;un&#x32D;gar. At one time there were a great number of ka&#x301;mat&#x301;as in the rivers of Midnapore, 24 Paraganas and Khulna Districts. Taking bath in those rivers was dangerous at that time. The oil of these ka&#x301;mat&#x301;a sharks has medicinal qualities. As the cod fish began disappearing, shark oil began to be used as a substitute for cod liver oil, and from that time also the ka&#x301;mat&#x301;a species started to be wiped out. Nowadays the number of ka&#x301;mat&#x301;as has greatly diminished.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->2) The lotus does not grow in water that has too many waves, that is, in rivers with strong waves. Thus kamala also is used to mean &ldquo;that water which has few waves&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->3) That water vessel which people use so extensively for carrying or keeping water, that is, a bucket, is also called kamala.  The Bengali synonym for the English word &ldquo;bucket&rdquo;, ba&#x301;lti, is a very recent word; it is of foreign origin. If one says ek kamal jal a&#x301;no [bring a bucket of water] instead of ek ba&#x301;lti jal a&#x301;no it will be good Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->4) The kaman&#x301;d&#x301;alu [a water pot with religious significance in India] that people used to use in ancient times to keep water was generally made out of the shell of a ripe gourd.

It brings out the beauty of the body, or often medicine becomes very attractive to the sick person. In this sense kamala also means &ldquo;medicine&rdquo;. Bear in mind that the highest quality waters which are effective against disease (such as the Bakreswar kun&#x301;d&#x301;a or the Siita kun&#x301;d&#x301;a, etc.) are thus called tiirtha kamala in Sanskrit [tiirtha means &ldquo;place of pilgrimage&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Some people believe that the word kamalinii means &ldquo;small kamala&rdquo; or &ldquo;small lotus&rdquo;. From the grammatical point of view, the word kamalinii can be used to mean &ldquo;small lotus&rdquo;, but in customary usage kamalinii does not refer to a small lotus &ndash; it means a collection of loti, that is, when there are many loti blooming together at one spot in a particular reservoir or pond, then that bunch of loti, or that lotus grove, is called kamalinii. In the same way, if many sha&#x301;luka or kumuda (lily) flowers (in certain parts of Bengal it is also called sha&#x301;pla&#x301;) are blooming together at one spot in a reservoir or pond then we can also call that kumudinii.  Kumuda means &ldquo;sha&#x301;luk flower&rdquo;. While it is correct from the grammatical point of view to use the word kumudinii  to mean &ldquo;small kumuda&rdquo;, it is not used that way in practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The English for kamala is &ldquo;lotus&rdquo;; its plural form is &ldquo;loti&rdquo;. The English for kumuda is &ldquo;water-lily&rdquo;. The lotus maintains a relationship with the sun while the water-lily has a relationship with the moon; for this reason, moonlight is called kaomudii.  The kahla&#x301;ra flower [white water-lily] (dhyanp flower or bhent&#x301; flower) is smaller than the sha&#x301;luk.  If many of these flowers are blooming at one spot then that can also be called kahla&#x301;rin&#x301;ii.  Although kahla&#x301;rin&#x301;ii can also be used in the grammatical sense to mean &ldquo;small kahla&#x301;ra&rdquo;, it is generally used to mean a bower of kahla&#x301;ra flowers. The stalk (mrn&#x301;a&#x301;l) of the kamala has thorns while the stalks of the kumuda and the kahla&#x301;ra do not. The seeds of the kumuda and the kahla&#x301;ra flowers are food for human beings, just as kamala seeds are. Na&#x301;r&#x301;us [la&#x301;d&#x301;d&#x301;us &ndash; a popular variety of Indian sweetmeat] are prepared from them by first parching the ripe dhya&#x301;np or bhent&#x301; seeds in a pan with sand to make khai [a type of puffed grain, usually prepared from rice] and then mixing it with either sugar or molasses water; this type of na&#x301;r&#x301;u generally goes by the name of dhya&#x301;nper or bhent&#x301;er na&#x301;r&#x301;u. This na&#x301;r&#x301;u is somewhat similar to the ra&#x301;mdha&#x301;na&#x301; na&#x301;r&#x301;u of northern India. The dhya&#x301;nper or bhent&#x301;er na&#x301;r&#x301;u has little food value to speak of, but it is easily digestible. For this reason, it is fed to sick people and children.

This is very sweet to the ears but defective from the grammatical point of view. Grammatically speaking, kampavaks&#x301;e would have been better. If the breast trembles out of fear or confusion then we will not say that it is naturally trembling. We will only use kampravaks&#x301;e for someone whose breast naturally trembles.

India learned tea cultivation from the Chinese. The inhabitants of China drink both leaf tea and green tea but it seems that green tea is a bigger favourite. The Chinese people like to drink tea with butter, salt and honey. The people of ancient India used to boil the wild tea leaves in salt water, that is, they used to drink it salty, and this tea&#146;s name was kambal.

These bird-guests usually make their nests in the tall trees near reservoirs and ponds. They are the old inhabitants of northeast China, Siberia, Russia and Tibet, but due to the oppressive cold in those lands during wintertime it becomes impossible for them to sustain themselves. It is extremely cold, and moreover there is a scarcity of food. Thus they come to India and other hot countries during the winter and stay there for a few months. During this time they lay their eggs, and after their young are somewhat grown they teach them how to fly and the process for gathering food. Then, when the hot winds begin to blow they return to their homeland. They return to exactly the place they had come from, and each year they also come back to the same place. It has been demonstrated by attaching a marker to their legs, or through other means, how unbelievably developed their intuition and ability to recognize these places is. Great crowds of them gather during the winter in Calcutta Zoo, 24 Paraganas&#146; Sandeshkhali, and Bharatpur&#146;s bird sanctuary. At one time great numbers of them used to come to Dimdiha village in Purulia District. Since they came to lay their eggs [d&#x301;im] the name of the place became Dimdiha. They can be seen in the marshlands of Bengal during wintertime. Among these birds is a bird of the Flamingo family. Karaka refers to the birds of this flamingo family.<!-- /block --></p>

If someone says &ldquo;the tailor bird is sitting in the karaka tree,&rdquo; then it will have to be understood that the tailor bird is sitting in a pomegranate tree because tailor birds don&#146;t sit in banyan trees or very large trees. From the Sanskrit da&#x301;r&#x301;imba has come da&#x301;r&#x301;im in Maethilii and d&#x301;a&#x301;lim in Bengali. The word a&#x301;na&#x301;r used in Hindustani is of foreign origin. In olden times the beda&#x301;na&#x301; [a high quality pomegranate] came into being as a result of scientific research on the pomegranate. As far as size goes, there are three different varieties of pomegranate &ndash; small, medium and large. The beda&#x301;na&#x301; is medium-sized. The rind of the pomegranate is somewhat reddish while the beda&#x301;na&#x301;&#146;s colour is catechu, or pale-yellow. The pips of the pomegranate are red while beda&#x301;na&#x301; pips are light-rose or purple-rose. The pomegranate is sour, or sweet-and-sour in taste while the beda&#x301;na&#x301; is normally sweet. Although both the pomegranate and beda&#x301;na&#x301; have food value, the beda&#x301;na&#x301; has more. The beda&#x301;na&#x301; is suitable as a diet for convalescing patients. The beda&#x301;na&#x301;&#146;s Sanskrit name is da&#x301;r&#x301;imba.<!-- /block --></p>

This tri-habitat bird (aquatic, terrestrial and aerial) is similar in nature to the swan, or goose. Its body-colour is blackish. Like the foreign birds, they are seen in good numbers in Bengal during winter season, but they are also there at other times.

Only in those times and places where the water freezes does it not stay around because then there is a shortage of food there. If it sees the probability of water freezing in a place then it abandons that place just prior. It does so with the help of its rather advanced deductive powers. Thus, if in any particular land it is seen that the cranes are leaving, then it can be deduced that very cold weather is coming in the near future, just as it can be known that the rainy season is imminent when the swallows can be seen flying westwards at the end of the hot season.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn1">1</a></b>)  In Oriya &ldquo;white&rdquo; is called dhar&#x301;a&#x301;. This has come from the word dhavalra. From the word dhavalra comes the Bengali word dhalo and the Oriya word dhar&#x301;a or dhar&#x301;a&#x301;. Actually, the correct spelling of the Oriya word dhar&#x301;a is not with r&#x301;a but rather with antahstha lra. In Bengali also, ka&#x301;lo-dhalo is common [black and white]. In Bhojpuri &ldquo;white&rdquo; is dhaor&#x301;a&#x301; (dhavalra). For example, Dhaor&#x301;ii (dhavalrii) ga&#x301;y caratiiya&#x301;, that is, &ldquo;a white cow is grazing&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn2">2</a></b>)  For this reason people don&#146;t eat the kalmii during the rainy season. Even if people are made to understand by reason, oftentimes they don&#146;t want to understand or accept. Thus, in order to cause fear, it is said that Jagannath has fever from soja&#x301;ratha day until ult&#x301;oratha day. He is lying on a bed of kalmii leaves. And so, at that time kalmii should not be eaten; it is a sin to eat it.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn3">3</a></b>)  Ta&#x301;mra &rarr; ta&#x301;mba &rarr; ta&#x301;mba&#x301; &rarr; ta&#x301;nba&#x301; &rarr; ta&#x301;ma&#x301;. The ta&#x301;mba&#x301; form is prevalent in northern India. In Bengali, both ta&#x301;nba&#x301; and ta&#x301;ma&#x301; are correct although the ta&#x301;nba&#x301; form is more faithful to the original Pra&#x301;krta.  For example, both a&#x301;nb and a&#x301;m [mango] are correct, but a&#x301;nb is more faithful to the original Pra&#x301;krta.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn4">4</a></b>)  The word ba&#x301;jii is of Farsi origin. In Farsi the adjectival suffixes gar, var, and da&#x301;r are used. For example, ja&#x301;dugar [magician], ja&#x301;navar (not ja&#x301;noya&#x301;r [beast]), duka&#x301;nda&#x301;r [shopkeeper]. Bear in mind, it is ja&#x301;du, not ya&#x301;du, and ja&#x301;dugar, not ya&#x301;dukar.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn5">5</a></b>)  Lodhra &rarr; lodhdha &rarr; lodh. In ancient India girls used to use the pollen of the lodh flower as face powder.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn6">6</a></b>)  The author&#146;s garden contains both the pink and white varieties of this flower. Moreover, there is a variety of kalke brought from Cyprus which is halfway between the kalke and oleander.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="5.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.5.fn7">7</a></b>)  According to a Puranic story the twelve classes of Ka&#x301;yasthas came from the lineages of the twelve children of Chitragupta. The names of his twelve children were: Ca&#x301;ru, Suca&#x301;ru, Citra, Citraca&#x301;ru, Arun&#x301;a, Atiindriya, Himava&#x301;n, Matima&#x301;n, Bha&#x301;nu, Vibha&#x301;nu, Vishvabha&#x301;nu and Viiryabha&#x301;nu. Apart from these twelve classes of Chitragupta Ka&#x301;yasthas, there are six more classes of Ka&#x301;yasthas. They are: (1) The sun lineage king, Ashvapati&#146;s descendants &ndash; Pattanprabhu Ka&#x301;yastha; (2) The moon lineage king, Ka&#x301;mapati&#146;s descendants &ndash; Damanaprabhu Ka&#x301;yastha; (3) The devotee king, Dhruva&#146;s descendants &ndash; Druvaprabhu Ka&#x301;yastha; (4) Upaka&#x301;yastha (Bengal&#146;s Kuma&#x301;r or Kunya&#x301;r Ka&#x301;yastha, Kerala&#146;s Na&#x301;ya&#x301;r and Tamil nadu&#146;s Pilla&#x301;i groups); (5) Purka&#x301;yastha (Purka&#x301;it); and (6) Bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;rii Ka&#x301;yastha. Although the Bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;rii Ka&#x301;yasthas are Ka&#x301;yastha by caste, they have taken on the Brahman&#146;s profession. Due to their social relationship with the Buddhist Chakravarttiis during the Buddhist era, the other Ka&#x301;yasthas don&#146;t especially like them. Today caste differences and caste divisions are fading out. What I have just related is a Puranic story of the old days.</p>

<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix at&#x301;ac (at&#x301;an) to krp we get the word karpat&#x301;a. The meaning of the Vedic root verb krp is &ldquo;to possess the ability to do some action&rdquo; or &ldquo;to be capable of doing something&rdquo;. The word krpa&#x301; has come from this root verb krp. Many people think that the root verbs krp and day (from which we get the word daya&#x301; [compassion]) have the same meaning. Many mix up karun&#x301;a&#x301; with daya&#x301;/krpa&#x301;. No, these three are not the same. Although the word karun&#x301;a&#x301; has been used since ancient times, we find it used most frequently in Buddhist literature and philosophy. The actual meaning and significance of the word karun&#x301;a&#x301; is &ldquo;being overcome with affection for others after seeing their ignorance or reluctance in the spiritual sphere, and giving them help, either mentally or physically, or showing them compassion&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The couplet is ambiguous. Its literal meaning is that a boat named karun&#x301;a&#x301; has been filled with gold so there is no room there to keep any silver. The inner meaning is that the formless Supreme Entity (in Buddhist thought, naera&#x301;tmadevii) has filled the boat of my existence, so there is no room for the different inferences, such as form, etc. One is floating onward, from the world of forms to the world of the formless, and the binding sam&#x301;skaras [reactive momenta] from the cycle of birth and death will not be able to bind them.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So you see, the word karun&#x301;a&#x301; is an odd kind of self-contained word. The word daya&#x301;, which comes from the root verb day, means &ldquo;to melt when seeing someone&#146;s pain and to remove that pain &ndash; to be conscious of it&rdquo;, in English, &ldquo;kindness&rdquo;, &ldquo;grace&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word krpa&#x301;, which comes from the root verb krp, means &ldquo;to be capable of doing something for someone&rdquo;. Weak people want krpa&#x301; from strong people because the strong have that capacity; untalented people want psychic krpa&#x301; from talented people because talented people have that capacity. Both the words krpa and karpa come from the root verb krp &ndash; both words mean &ldquo;hardy, capable.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

The carpet which is decorated with various kinds of handiwork is called ga&#x301;lica&#x301; (in spoken Bengali ga&#x301;lce). The word ga&#x301;lica&#x301; is of Persian origin.<!-- /block --></p>

The nerve centre of the body&#8230; the brain is situated inside the skull. The brain needs a strong container, thus the skull or cranium must be hardy, that is, strong. Bear in mind, that in this case that kapa&#x301;lra [skull] means &ldquo;skull of the deceased&rdquo; in Sanskrit, not &ldquo;forehead&rdquo;. Of course kapa&#x301;lra-likhana means &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; in both Bengali and Sanskrit. In Bhojpuri the word kapa&#x301;lra (pronounced kapa&#x301;r) means &ldquo;head&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

The word is adopted from Sanskrit &ndash; you are all familiar with the ca&#x301;t&#x301;u on which chapatis are cooked. There is a certain kind of ca&#x301;t&#x301;u which has a long handle in front which is the colour of iron. One grabs this handle with a rolled cloth or towel in the hand in order to put it on the stove. This handle is called a karpara. The two rings that one grabs on either side of the kar&#x301;a&#x301; or kar&#x301;a&#x301;i [a wok-like iron pan] (kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha &rarr; kad&#x301;a&#x301;ha &rarr; kar&#x301;a&#x301;a &rarr; kar&#x301;a&#x301;i &rarr; kar&#x301;a&#x301;) used in cooking in order to place it on the stove, are also called karpara.<!-- /block --></p>

Another name for it in Sanskrit is ud&#x301;umbara, and yet another name is karpara. Previously, the Aryans used to consider the wood of the yajin&#x32D;a-d&#x301;umur to be quite hardy, thus during sacrifices (yajin&#x32D;a) they would use it as sacrificial wood. Since it was used as sacrificial wood, its name became yajin&#x32D;a-d&#x301;umur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->5) Another meaning of the word karpara is what we commonly call bhoja&#x301;li, a slightly curved weapon that is used both as a dagger and as a sword.<!-- /block --></p>

The etymological meaning of this word, karbu&#x301;ra, is &ldquo;mixed-colour&rdquo;, &ldquo;varied nature&rdquo;, &ldquo;selfish&rdquo;, and so on. Colloquially it means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->1) Any bright, yellow-coloured object, such as golden tinsel, golden garments, or any bright yellow thing.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->4) The fourth meaning of the word karbu&#x301;ra is &ldquo;the spotted cucumber&rdquo; (ks&#x301;iirika&#x301; variety). The cucumber is generally divided into two groups: the first, which is somewhat small in size, predominantly green in colour, and which grows chiefly in the rainy season; and the second, which is grown with a scaffold &ndash; this rainy season cucumber is called shashakphalam. This shashaka phala is a favourite food of the shashaka (in English, &ldquo;hare&rdquo;). For this reason its name became shashaka phala. However, one shouldn&#146;t think by this that rabbits don&#146;t also love to eat cucumbers. Cucumbers which are not grown in the rainy season, but which are grown on scaffolds rather than being allowed to creep along the ground are also called shashaka phala. If this shashaka variety of cucumber is left to creep along the ground then it easily falls prey to insect attacks and its fruit is destroyed. The field cucumber is called ks&#x301;iirika&#x301;. The ks&#x301;iirika&#x301; variety of cucumber is also eaten raw as fruit by people as well as being used as a cooking vegetable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->5) Something whose surface is spotted &ndash; spotted clothes, spotted leaves on a tree, and so forth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->6) If it is spelled karbu&#x301;rii in feminine form then it means Chinnamasta&#x301; [a truncated form of the goddess Durga&#x301;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->7) One meaning of the word karbu&#x301;ra is daetya [demon].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->8) Another meaning of the word karbu&#x301;ra is the red&#x301;i plant [castor oil plant] (eran&#x301;d&#x301;ah &rarr; eran&#x301;d&#x301;a &rarr; eran&#x301;d&#x301;i &rarr; er&#x301;i &rarr; rer&#x301;i). According to the Pra&#x301;krta rule where ra takes the place of a and a takes the place of ra, er&#x301;i becomes rer&#x301;i. This word rer&#x301;i is used in Bengali and also in the languages of Bihar &ndash; in Hindi, however, it is a&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;i. There are two main varieties of rer&#x301;i. &ndash; cultivated rer&#x301;i and wild rer&#x301;i. The leaves of the cultivated rer&#x301;i are deep green and its seeds (castor seed) yield a very quality oil. Its chaff also makes a good fertilizer for mustard fields. Wild rer&#x301;i is usually known as bheren&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; in Bengal. The word bheren&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; has come from the word bhaeran&#x301;d&#x301;a. The leaves of this plant are somewhat reddish and its fruit is poor in quality. The non-mulberry silk that we get from the cocoons of the silk-worms that grow in the leaves of the rer&#x301;i plant is called en&#x301;d&#x301;i silk. At one time Assam was famous for this en&#x301;d&#x301;i silk; it still is. If some efforts are made, rer&#x301;i can be cultivated nicely in those parts of Bengal, north Bihar and Uttar Pradesh where there is alluvial soil, and en&#x301;d&#x301;i silk can be produced.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->9) Another meaning of the word karbu&#x301;ra is &ldquo;gnat&rdquo;. In this case its feminine form will be karbu&#x301;ra&#x301;, not karbu&#x301;rii. Karbu&#x301;rii means &ldquo;Chinnamasta&#x301;&rdquo;.

<a name="6..148"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=148 type=paragraph -->I went out alone and found myself in the middle of the forest. To the south was the Damodar River and to the east was the Deviidaha. At that time this part of Burdwan District was vast marshland.

The Behula of legend took the dead body of the imaginary Lakhindar on her lap, climbed on a raft and floated down this Ga&#x301;ungur&#x301;a towards heaven. This Behula River has turned into the Deviidaha of today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..149"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=149 type=paragraph -->I walked slowly and came to the edge of the Deviidaha. The Deviidaha that we are talking about was partially destroyed in the Damodar flood of 1913. It was swallowed anew by the Damodar during the time of the Second World War. The time that I am talking about was shortly before the Second World War.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..150"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=150 type=paragraph -->The Deviidaha was created during the time when Shasha&#x301;un&#x32D;ka was the king of Rarh. The Deviidaha was not simply a large pond. Like the Damodar, Banka, Khar&#x301;i, Vadai and other rivers, the vast waters of the Deviidaha as well as the Ga&#x301;ungur&#x301;a used to keep Burdwan District green with grain. Sugar cane was first cultivated in Rarh on both banks of the Deviidaha while cotton was cultivated on its west bank. Historically, it can be seen that this Burdwan District was the pioneer in sugar cane and cotton cultivation, the leading producer. The sugar cane there was sweeter than any place else. Unfortunately the farmers in Burdwan today are not so eager to cultivate sugar cane because sugar cane ties up the land for nearly the entire year, while if other crops would be grown on that same land then three harvests could be taken home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..151"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=151 type=paragraph -->For this very same reason, the cultivation of both the ma&#x301;ghii and caetii types of pigeon-peas is fast diminishing in Burdwan. They are scarcely to be seen nowadays. Even though the Bala&#x301;gar&#x301; area of neighbouring Hooghly District was at one time considered the best for pigeon-pea cultivation, it bears mentioning that there also this cultivation has diminished greatly. Nowadays Purulia and Nadia Districts are preserving the standard of pigeon-pea production in Bengal. If some of the land in Purulia was not used for pigeon-peas then it would remain barren for most of the year, thus there is no recourse but to grow pigeon-peas there. And in Nadia the greater part of the soil is donya&#x301;sh [mixed sandy and clayey soil]. Since there is very little clayey soil many crops cannot be grown there. Still, in the Chakdaha, Haringhata and Kalyani areas of Nadia the cultivation of both sugar cane and pigeon-peas (kandula: kandulam&#x301; baladam&#x301; jineyam&#x301; cos&#x301;n&#x301;am&#x301; tu hitaka&#x301;rakam&#x301;) is diminishing and kitchen vegetables are being grown in their place. Today Nadia District has turned into the world&#146;s best district for growing vegetables. Of course, the traditional areas for growing potatoes have been Hooghly, Burdwan, Nalanda and Farukhbad Districts. The seeds that we import while sitting in Calcutta, such as the recently brought biliti tomato seeds from America, the difficult-to-get red radish seeds from Japan, the extremely long kuli eggplant seeds from China &ndash; some perhaps come from abroad but the better part of them are brought from Nadia District&#146;s Nagar-ukhr&#x301;a&#x301;, bought at bulk rate and stuffed into jute sacks.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..152"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=152 type=paragraph -->The variety of cotton plant which was known as deva-ka&#x301;pa&#x301;s in Burdwan has the longest fibres and is suitable for making the finest thread. The climate of Burdwan is somewhat drier than that of the rest of Bengal, thus those areas which are wetter than Burdwan used to buy cotton thread from Burdwan for weaving fine cloth. Cotton doesn&#146;t grow well in wetter climates; the cotton is subject to insect attack. However these wetter climates are more suitable for weaving fine cloth. Thus Burdwan was not as famous for the weaving of cloth as it was for the production of cotton. This is not Burdwan&#146;s fault; its weather is to blame. This situation continued unchecked up until the time of Akbar.<!-- /block --></p>

A short distance away ran the ruined remains of the Badshahi road, the same road that Pathan Badshah Shershah made at the beginning of the Mughal era, with only a few skeletal traces left to identify it. Burdwan was then the capital of the province of Bengal. This Badshahi road used to connect Burdwan to Dehli in one direction, and in the other direction it connected to the principal port of the time, Saptagra&#x301;m or Sa&#x301;tga&#x301;on, to which the Portuguese gave the name Port-de-Grandee &ndash; it extended south along the Bhagirathi till Shyampur and on the other bank it used to go via Jessore to Dhaka District&#146;s Suvarnagram (Son&#x301;a&#x301;rga&#x301;no).

<a name="6..195"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=195 type=paragraph -->3) Handkerchief [ruma&#x301;l] (the word ruma&#x301;l/roma&#x301;l is of Farsi origin). The word mukhama&#x301;rjanii is also used in Sanskrit, but mukhama&#x301;rjanii can also refer to &ldquo;towel&rdquo;, or ga&#x301;mcha&#x301;. However karvva only refers to &ldquo;handkerchief&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..196"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=196 type=paragraph -->4) One who goes around all the time for the purpose of getting or eating something or other is karvva. Rats are always going around looking for food. If they don&#146;t find anything edible they will cut things with their teeth thinking that after it is cut up it might turn into food. In this sense, the word karvva also means &ldquo;rat&rdquo;. Of course, karvva doesn&#146;t mean &ldquo;mouse&rdquo; (plural, &ldquo;mice&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..197"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=197 type=paragraph -->5) The wolf &ndash; la&#x301;kr&#x301;a&#x301; or la&#x301;kar&#x301; va&#x301;gha&#x301; in north India &ndash; is always going out for the purpose of eating. In some people&#146;s opinion the wolf can take into its stomach quite a bit more than the weight of its own body. Just as the ant can carry a load that is much heavier than its own body, the wolf can eat more. The wolf has very little capacity for carrying loads. Due to his excessive gluttony, the second Pandava brother, Bhima, used to be called Vrkodara (one whose stomach is like a wolf&#146;s). During the time that the Pandavas were incognito, mother Kunti would take the food they would bring home from begging and give half of it to Bhima. The remainder she and her other four sons would eat.<!-- /block --></p>

Once they have filled their stomach they remain in a still, motionless state for many days. Thereafter, once the food has been digested, they again start to move around. Thus, another meaning of the word karvva is ajagar [python]. In this case aja means &ldquo;goat&rdquo;. That which can swallow a goat is ajagar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..201"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=201 type=paragraph -->7) The d&#x301;a&#x301;nsh [gnat] variety of mosquito can also drink excessive quantities of blood. After they drink an excessive quantity of blood they remain torpid for quite some time. Some are of the opinion that their stomach often bursts and they die as a result of drinking too much blood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..202"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=202 type=paragraph -->The da&#x301;nsh variety of mosquito is called &ldquo;gnat&rdquo; in English. Karvva also means &ldquo;gnat&rdquo;. Use the word karva&#x301; for &ldquo;female gnat&rdquo;, rather than the word karvii. The meaning of the feminine gender word iip added to karva, that is, karvii, is &ldquo;the goddess Chinnamasta&#x301;&rdquo; [a truncated form of Durga&#x301;].<!-- /block --></p>

By adding the suffix at&#x301;ac (at&#x301;an) to karva we get the word karvat&#x301;a, whose etymological meaning is &ldquo;that for which there is pride&rdquo;. Colloquially, karvat&#x301;a means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..205"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=205 type=paragraph -->1) Palace-city, that is, that city which is decked out with a string of palaces. At one time Jaipur was known far and wide as a palace-city. This city was made of a collection of &ldquo;p&rdquo;-s of which one was &ldquo;palace&rdquo;. The others were &ldquo;peacock&rdquo;, &ldquo;prince&rdquo;, and &ldquo;pink&rdquo;. The founder of the city was Maharaj Jayasim&#x301;ha and its architect was Pus&#x301;padhara Mitra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..206"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=206 type=paragraph -->2) The second meaning of the word karvat&#x301;a is &ldquo;that city which is situated inside a fort&rdquo;. The last capital of Mughal Bengal, Monghyr, was one such fort-city. Beyond the moat there were the ramparts. Within the ramparts was the city. At that time most of the cities had a moat or a ditch around them, whether or not they had any fortress walls. That used to be the boundary limits of the city, or, in certain cases, the revenue village. The other side of this moat or boundary limit was the jurisdiction of a different police officer. Thus, in many cases, social miscreants used to flee to the other side of the moat or ditch in order to escape from the hands of the police. Even today, in those places where there is no surrounding moat or ditch, we say &ldquo;he has crossed over the ditch&rdquo; when someone passes a little out of reach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..207"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=207 type=paragraph -->Previously I said that even when there were no ramparts within the moat or ditch, the people used to consider what was inside the moat as a fort (gar&#x301;). There was such a ditch between British Chandannagar and French Chandannagar. Even though there was no fixed fort the people used to use the word gar&#x301;. This city inside a fort used to be called karvat&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..208"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=208 type=paragraph -->The king of Nadia, Maharaja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;acandra, had special kinds of moats dug in several of the important places of his zamindaris. For these the poetic words ain&#x32D;jana&#x301;, kam&#x301;kana&#x301;, and so on, were used (probably during the time of Dewan Raghunandan Mitra).<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..209"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=209 type=paragraph -->3) Formerly, most of the important cities were surrounded by a wall and had a main portico. The gate was kept open or closed at particular times according to the instructions of the city police. Normally the gate was closed after nine o&#146;clock at night.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..210"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=210 type=paragraph -->Often social miscreants or people with infectious diseases used to be kept outside these city walls. The keys to the gate used to remain with the constable or with some senior person of the city. This wall-encircled city used to be called karvat&#x301;a. The people of north India used to say ha&#x301;velii &ndash; in certain places ha&#x301;oli in the spoken language. There was a city in Monghyr District by the name of Ha&#x301;velii-Khar&#x301;gpur. In Europe, the one with whom the key to such a ha&#x301;velii gate was kept was called the &ldquo;city father&rdquo; or &ldquo;sheriff&rdquo;. Our Calcutta is not a walled city but here also there is a sheriff in order to maintain the aristocratic tradition. Most likely he also has a key for show. The word &ldquo;sheriff&rdquo; has come from the Farsi word shariif from which comes the substantive shara&#x301;fat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..211"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=211 type=paragraph -->4) Another meaning of the word karvat&#x301;a is &ldquo;the chief city of any country or state&rdquo;, or &ldquo;metropolis&rdquo;. This metropolis may or may not be the capital of the country. During British rule in India, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras used to be considered metropolises or metropolitan towns, and in English the expression &ldquo;presidency town&rdquo; used to be used for &ldquo;metropolitan town&rdquo;. In the same way, the concerning provinces went by the name of Bengal Presidency, Bombay Presidency, and Madras Presidency. Some people use the word &ldquo;metropolis&rdquo; in an offhand way for the capital of a country, even though it isn&#146;t the metropolitan city of that country.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..212"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=212 type=paragraph -->5) Many people call a cosmopolitan city &ndash; or a city in which people from different countries, speaking different languages, live &ndash; a metropolitan city. In this case also, the word karvat&#x301;a can be used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..213"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=213 type=paragraph -->6) The principal official headquarters of a district or county is called karvat&#x301;a. For example, the karvat&#x301;a of Birbhum District was Shiurii (Shivapurii), then Maldaha District&#146;s Engrejbazar, Rajshahi District&#146;s Rampur (Boyalia), Murshidabad&#146;s Baharampur, 24 Paraganas&#146; Alipur (its old name was Alinagar), Bakharganj District&#146;s Barishal, West Dinajpur District&#146;s Balurghat, the then British Tripura&#146;s Comilla, and Hooghly District&#146;s Chunchro.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..214"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=214 type=paragraph -->The modern Bengali synonym for the Sanskrit word bhukti is zila&#x301; (zilla). The word is of Farsi origin. Its proper English equivalent is &ldquo;county&rdquo;. In England a zila&#x301; is called a &ldquo;county&rdquo;; in India, a zila&#x301; is called a &ldquo;district&rdquo; in English. Most likely it was called &ldquo;county&rdquo; since in ancient England each county used to remain under the control of a particular count.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..217"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=217 type=paragraph -->1) The meaning of the word karvara is &ldquo;proud demon&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..218"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=218 type=paragraph -->2) The second meaning of the word karvara is &ldquo;proud animal&rdquo; or &ldquo;large tiger&rdquo;. Another name for what we call &ldquo;royal Bengal tiger&rdquo; in English kundo ba&#x301;gh in Bengali is karvara. It is the largest member of the cat family. Among its various traits are its keen intelligence and its powerful sense of smell.  It is able to ascertain which animals lie in which direction by checking the wind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..219"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=219 type=paragraph -->Although they are much stronger than people, they are much less intelligent and they know this. So if they catch a human scent on the wind they don&#146;t like to tread that path. However, if they happen on a person unexpectedly they will attack them out of a sense of self-preservation. There are a small number of karvara tigers who, despite belonging to the same family, develop a taste for human flesh by eating dead bodies in burial grounds or in the forest. Some can no longer struggle with other animals in their old age, and kill and eat human beings because humans can not run from them or match them in physical strength. It is very easy for them to kill humans, so those karvara tigers who become maneaters in this way, and remain so for a long time, undergo some physical changes. Their snout becomes comparatively long and their stomach becomes thinner. If people are aware which Bengal tigers are maneaters and which are not, they can take more precautionary measures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..220"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=220 type=paragraph -->The word vya&#x301;ghra [tiger] is derived by adding the suffix d&#x301;a to vi-a&#x301;-ghra&#x301;; its etymological meaning is &ldquo;possessing a special form of olfactory ability&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..221"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=221 type=paragraph -->3) Another meaning of the word karvara is &ldquo;lustrous, multi-coloured object&rdquo;. In this sense the peacock&#146;s throat and the rainbow are both called karvara.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..224"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=224 type=paragraph -->6) The meaning of the word karvarii, obtained by adding the suffix iip in feminine gender, is the goddess Durga&#x301; mentioned in the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Puran&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..225"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=225 type=paragraph -->7) The feminine form of the word karvara, obtained by adding the suffix a&#x301;p, karvara&#x301;, means &ldquo;bug&rdquo;. Keep in mind that both karvarii and karvara&#x301; are feminine forms, but karvarii, formed with iip refers to the goddess Durga&#x301;, and karvara&#x301;, formed with a&#x301;p, means &ldquo;bug&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

Various kinds of medicines are produced from the thorn-apple fruit, among which is medicine for rheumatism. Medicine for disorders of the parathyroid gland are made from the fruit of the black thorn-apple.

<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ka &ndash; meaning &ldquo;water&rdquo; or &ldquo;head&rdquo;. Ka + bal + ac = kabala. The word&#146;s etymological meaning is &ldquo;one whose power is in water&rdquo; or &ldquo;one who is invigorated in water&rdquo;; or &ldquo;one whose power is in the head&rdquo; or &ldquo;one whose head invigorates&rdquo;. Colloquially, kabala means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->1) Mouthful; that is, as much as can be kept in the mouth at one time is a mouthful [gra&#x301;s]. You have perhaps seen in the almanac that an eclipse is sometimes full [pu&#x301;rn&#x301;agra&#x301;s] and sometimes partial [ardhagra&#x301;s]. It is said that in this eclipse Ra&#x301;hu has completely swallowed it, and in that eclipse Ra&#x301;hu has partially swallowed it. What happens is that there is an eclipse whenever the moon or the sun is found in one portion of the umbra (in the original umbra) and ketu stands in exactly the seventh sign and concerning degree away from that umbra (&ldquo;in whichever month, in whichever sign of the zodiac/in the seventh stands the moon/if there is a full moon on that day/ra&#x301;hu is sure to come devouring&rdquo;) The type of eclipse &ndash; whether complete or partial &ndash; is fixed according to which kala&#x301; of the sun or moon falls under that umbra. In the annular eclipse of the sun, the sun is considered to fall completely within the original umbra according to mathematical analysis. When the sun or moon passes through that portion of the umbra, it is thought that the sun or moon has come out from the severed portion of the beheaded Ra&#x301;hu.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So now you have understood what the actual meaning of the word gra&#x301;s is. This word gra&#x301;s is derived by adding the suffix ghain&#x32D; to gran&#146;s (grasi). Ka means &ldquo;head&rdquo;. Ra&#x301;hu has swallowed the head-planet; thus we say that the sun or moon has fallen in the kabala of ra&#x301;hu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->2) If someone falls within the range of any wicked animal or demon we say &ndash; &ldquo;he has fallen in the tiger&#146;s kabala&rdquo; or &ldquo;they have fallen into the demon&#146;s kabala.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->3) The third meaning of kabala is &ldquo;to keep both cheeks distended by filling the mouth with water&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->4) Another meaning of kabala is &ldquo;to gargle with the help of the tongue or throat cavity&rdquo;, that is, instead of saying tini ga&#x301;rgl karchen [he is gargling], proper Bengali will be tini kabala karchen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->5) Ka means &ldquo;water&rdquo;. One whose strength is in ka, that is, one whose strength diminishes as they ascend onto dry land is also kabala in the etymological sense. In this case, the colloquial meaning of kabala is bele ma&#x301;ch [sand fish].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Kabalika&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There are three feminine forms of the word kabala: kabalii, kabala&#x301; and kabalika&#x301;. The etymological meaning of the word kabalika&#x301; is &ldquo;that which helps in exerting energy&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which saves one from another&#146;s energetic blow&rdquo;. Colloquially kabalika&#x301; means:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->1) Imagine that you have prepared a shada in a wok [kar&#x301;a&#x301;i]<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (raw or cooked vegetables are called shada)Now the wok has to be taken down from the stove. You don&#146;t have any tongs, or even if you do the wok is so hot that it will still be difficult to take it down even with the help of the tongs. In this case you will use the two handles of the wok to take it off the stove, but if you grab the two handles with your bare hands then you will get blisters on your hands from the striking of the energy of the handles &ndash; from the effect of the heat. In that case, in order to save your hands from the effect of the fire or the heat, you will certainly protect your hands with a towel or cloth or ga&#x301;mcha&#x301; or non-conductor of heat before grabbing the handles and taking down the wok. This non-conductor of heat we call kabalika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->2) You are harvesting potatoes in a field. You are digging on this and that side of the partitions separating the fields. You feel pleasure pulling up the new potatoes but a little while later it fades because you get big blisters on your hands. You will certainly wrap some kind of cloth over your hands to protect your hands or fingers from those blisters. This is also kabalika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->3) Any kind of implement or tool which protects your hands or fingers from blisters or suffering is also called kabalika&#x301;.  Thus, in this sense, the handle [ba&#x301;nt&#x301;] of a knife or chopping knife or hammer is called kabalika&#x301; (ba&#x301;nt&#x301; comes from ban&#x301;t&#x301;ika and bant&#x301;i comes from ban&#x301;t&#x301;ika&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->4) In ancient times a kind of cotton and cloth pad was used by warriors to protect their hands or fingers from blisters caused by rubbing while using a sword. This pad was called kabalika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->5) That sheath that was used or is used to protect a sword from moisture in the air is called kabalika&#x301; (it was kept in it so that it would not rust).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->6) Someone has a carbuncle in some part of their body. The doctor performs surgery on it. Afterwards, of course, he will not leave the operated part open; he will certainly cover it to protect it from external influences. This covering or bandage is also called kabalika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->7) Living beings take birth over and over again in order to undergo the fruits of their actions, and over and over again they are devoured by death. The reactions in potentiality or reactive momenta that one imbibes by their original actions remain with them. Those reactive momenta draw them back again and again. These reactions in potentiality which are the cause of the next life are called sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra or pra&#x301;rabdha. The bondage of this pra&#x301;rabdha is also called kabalika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Kavara<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Previously it was accepted that the verbal roots br and vr were pronounced differently and had separate meanings, however today many people confuse the two. The meaning of the verbal root br is &ldquo;to show honour&rdquo;, &ldquo;to receive with excellence&rdquo;, &ldquo;to welcome&rdquo;. We get the word bara from this verbal root br. Bara means &ldquo;excellent&rdquo;. Although predominantly the a&#x301;tmanepadii verb form barayate is used, the parasmaepadii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is also used. The words bara, baran&#x301;a, barendra, ba&#x301;rendra come from this root.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root vr is &ldquo;to be engaged in work&rdquo;, &ldquo;to cover&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be covered&rdquo;. If we take the word ka to mean &ldquo;water&rdquo;, then the etymological meaning of the word kavara is &ldquo;that which keeps water covered&rdquo;. If we take the word ka to mean &ldquo;head&rdquo;, then the etymological meaning of the word kavara is &ldquo;that which keeps the head covered&rdquo;. There are many colloquial meanings of the word kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->1) Many times, when it is not possible to tie the hair into braids, or for those who are unwilling to tie their hair in braids, or for those who for one reason or another are not permitted to make braids, the hair is usually twisted somewhat and tied behind the head. To tie in this way we call jhunt&#x301;i ba&#x301;ndha&#x301; in Bengali. If this jhunt&#x301;i is tied on top of the head we call it opar-jhunt&#x301;i [upper jhunt&#x301;i]. Whether this jhunt&#x301;i is tied at the back or on the top, it is called kavara in refined Bengali [and Sanskrit]. In order to tie this kavara there is no need of any ka&#x301;in&#x32D;cana&#x301; (long hairpin) or ka&#x301;can (a ribbon for tying the hair).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->2) A cap is a covering for the head, so if we take ka to mean &ldquo;head&rdquo; then kavara also refers to &ldquo;cap&rdquo; or &ldquo;headdress&rdquo;. If we say &ldquo;headdress&rdquo; it means &ldquo;cap&rdquo;, &ldquo;turban&rdquo;, &ldquo;crown&rdquo; &ndash; all of these.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->3) Often the hair becomes tangled for want of care. It also becomes tangled if it is not combed properly (Kankatika&#x301;: kankatika&#x301; &rarr; kankaia&#x301; &rarr; ka&#x301;nkai. Cirun&#x301;ii is still called ka&#x301;nkai in Rarhi Bengali. In this sense a split [cera&#x301;] object is cirun&#x301;ii. Cirun&#x301;ii is native Bengali. Ka&#x301;nkai is a Sanskrit-derivative.) There are those who twist and tangle their hair to get oohs and aahs for this show of their own disinterestedness. If the hair remains twisted and tangled for a long time it ends up becoming matted hair.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Whether bound or loose, the word kavara can be used for all kinds of matted hair.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->4) If different things are combined in a physical mixture or chemical compound where it becomes difficult to separate one from the other (for example, sugar and sand), then this kind of mixture or compound is called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->5) When a new metal is produced as a result of mixing or intermingling or compounding two or more metals together (such as bell-metal, brass, guinea-gold or gold alloy, bronze, Kha&#x301;gr&#x301;a bell-metal), then that new metal is also called kavara or kavaradha&#x301;tu. To turn this kavara metal back into its original metals is extremely difficult. Most often, then, ornaments of guinea-gold are turned into alloyed gold. High quality, bejewelled ornaments do not carry as much value for their gold as they do as ornaments. Such type of gold is usually turned into alloyed gold.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->6) There are a few such plants which have a predominance of salty sap, for example, nune sha&#x301;k (in Sanskrit lonii). We also call them kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->7) The salt that is obtained from such plants is also called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->8) Those mineral salts that we find in the water of certain places (such as Bakreshvara, Siita&#x301;kun&#x301;d&#x301;a) and in other materials is also called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->9) The thick portion of the leaves (what the people call pet&#x301;o in spoken Bengali) attached to that middle portion of the bole of the banana tree which we call t&#x301;hor&#x301; in spoken Bengali is also called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->10) Those fruits which are used as food are collectively known as kavara. The trees of those fruits are also called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->11) The word kavara is also used for a fruit garden or orchard; however in this case the suffix t&#x301;a&#x301; is added to the root word, that is, when we use the word kavara for orchard then we use it in its feminine form, or kavara&#x301; (like the word lata&#x301;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->12) Asafoetida is called kavara because it acts as a medicine for head ailments when taken in moderation.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The asafoetida tree is also called kavara. Keep in mind that asafoetida [him&#146;] and hiun&#x32D;gul  are not the same thing. Asafoetida is a spice that grows mostly in the northwest frontier of India and in Pakistan. However if it is planted in the soil of Bengal it can also grow well in Bengal. Hiun&#x32D;gul means &ldquo;vermilion&rdquo;. You are aware that there is also a river in the western part of our Birbhum District which goes by the name of Hiun&#x32D;gula&#x301; (Him&#x301;lo). The colour of the water of this river is a little reddish so our forefathers named it in this way. The Hiun&#x32D;gula&#x301; is a tributary of the Ajay River.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->13) The leaves of the asafoetida tree are also called kavara, but in this case the word is feminine in gender, that is, one should say kavara&#x301; rather than kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->14) You know that certain aquatic weeds keep the water covered in such a way that from a distance the water can&#146;t be seen. It appears to be a patch of greenery. This is especially true if there are large aquatic weeds in the water like water hyacinth. Although it is a bit off the subject, I will point out that the water hyacinth is not originally from Bengal or India. During British rule, Mr. Lee, the Divisional Commissioner of Dhaka, once went to South America. His wife, Mrs. Lee, felt some attraction when she saw its purple flowers on top of its large green leaves, and when she returned to Bengal she brought it with her and planted it in the lotus pond near their government quarters in Dhaka. In a very short time the water hyacinth spread throughout Dhaka District and thereafter throughout Bengal, and nowadays it has spread throughout almost all of India. Its leaves are quite large, puffed up somewhat like a kacuri [a deep-fried, puffed bread], so the people of Bengal gave that aquatic plant the name kacuri pa&#x301;na&#x301;. Another meaning of the word kavara is this water hyacinth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->15) A bun (jur&#x301;a&#x301; in north India and Hindi) adorns the head, thus a bun is also called kavara, but on account of its loveliness the word is considered to be feminine, but in this case the feminine iip is added rather than t&#x301;a&#x301; making kavarii rather than kavara&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..36"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Tumi alake kusuma na&#x301; dio,<br>Shudhu shithila kavarii ba&#x301;ndhio<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..37"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->[Don&#146;t put a flower in your tress; simply tie it loosely in a bun]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->16) In the Vedic age there was the customary practice of pulling out grey hair with the help of pincers, so pincers used to be called kavara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->17) Foodstuffs are kept covered to keep out dust, flies and so on, and to protect them from cats and other animals or birds. Such a lid is also called kavara, but in this case the feminine diminutive form of kavara is used, that is, a lid is called kavarika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->18) If something is affixed tightly to something else, such as a diamond-set ring, a pearl-studded necklace or pearl-studded earring, then the word kavara is also used in this sense of inlaying or insetting. For example mukta&#x301;-kavara aunguriiyaka [pearl-studded ring], hiiraka-kavara man&#x301;iha&#x301;ra [diamond-studded necklace], padmara&#x301;ga-kavara karn&#x301;apat&#x301;t&#x301;a [ruby-inlaid gold-earring], and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->19) If a metal is coated with something else, or enamelled, or gilded, or plated, then this is also called kavara. For example, we can call a gold-plated wristlet a svarn&#x301;akavara hastalaohika.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->20) The word kavara is also used for all those small aquatic weeds [pa&#x301;na&#x301;] which cover water. (That which stays in water (pa&#x301;nii) is called pa&#x301;na&#x301;, &ldquo;aquatic weeds&rdquo;. Again, that which is drunk (pa&#x301;n kara&#x301;) is also called pa&#x301;na&#x301;; pa&#x301;na&#x301; means sarvat [a sweet drink made from syrup], for example, bel pa&#x301;na&#x301;.) However, in this case kavarika&#x301; will be used as the feminine diminutive form. Da&#x301;mapa&#x301;na&#x301;, t&#x301;opa&#x301; pa&#x301;na&#x301;, pa&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; pa&#x301;na&#x301; &ndash; for all of these the single Bengali word is kavarika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->21) That round fruit whose juice is sweet and sour, and which is originally from Bokhara we call a&#x301;lubokhara&#x301; in ordinary Bengali. We have been familiar with this a&#x301;lubokhra&#x301; fruit for a very long time. Its Sanskrit, as well as refined Bengali, name is kavarika&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Although the word kabr was equally common in ancient times in both Iran and Arabia, the word is Arabic in origin. Kabr means &ldquo;to bury underground&rdquo; or &ldquo;to inter&rdquo;. This grave or tomb is known as mrtsama&#x301;dhi in refined Bengali [and Sanskrit]. That place in which someone is buried [kabr deoya&#x301;] is called kabrga&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..45"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Kavi<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Ku + i = kavi. The etymological meaning of the word is &ldquo;one who sees the expressed world, or ku, with the affection felt for one&#146;s child&rdquo;, that is, one who desires the welfare of the world of living beings. The colloquial meanings of the word kavi are:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->1) Tattvadras&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; [seer of tattva]. The word tattva means &ldquo;the bha&#x301;va [essence or existence] of the essential root entity hidden within every entity&rdquo;. Tattvadras&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;one who sees tattva through supreme knowledge&rdquo;. It is the old, original meaning of the word kavi [poet]. If there is no inner sight then there is no kavi. A metred composition about cigarettes and grog and snack food cannot be called poetry, and its composer is not considered, and cannot be considered to be a kavi. From this point of view, those past messengers of human civilization, those Vedic sages who came from age to age to supply inspiration for human beings to move along the path of consciousness, those great souls who have taken birth in different countries and at different times, are called kavi &ndash; in English, &ldquo;seer&rdquo;. The word kavi used to be used with this meaning in the old Vedic language. From the mouth of a Vedic sage has come:<!-- /block --></p>

Get proper teaching from a worthy seer because this path of shreya [virtue] must be trod with the greatest caution. Bear in mind that one will have to move with understanding because the path is as if it were strewn with sharp razors.&rdquo; Kavi means a tattvadras&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; sage, not a cigarette-grog-snack food merchant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->2) The second meaning of the word kavi is &ldquo;one who, inspired by the thought of welfare, searches for the original cause in different spheres&rdquo;. In this case, kavi does not merely mean &ldquo;philosopher&rdquo;; that philosopher is a kavi who has the thought of welfare hidden within them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->3) Another meaning of the word kavi is &ldquo;highly educated person&rdquo;. However, this highly educated person will be called kavi if it is seen that they possess the thought of welfare for the world of living beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->4) Another meaning of the word kavi is &ldquo;wise or learned persons who have dedicated themselves to the service of living beings&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->5) In modern times kavi refers to a writer of poetry. However, the fundamental strain is the thought of welfare; thus one who writes poetry but is not inspired by the thought of welfare cannot be called kavi according to the prevalent meaning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->6) Yet another meaning of the word kavi is &ldquo;composer of songs&rdquo; or &ldquo;songwriter&rdquo;. What was said about the composer of poetry is applicable in precisely the same way to the composer of songs, that is, according to the modern meaning we can call a songwriter kavi if karmmana&#x301; manasa&#x301; va&#x301;ca&#x301; [through action, thought and vocal expression] is done with welfare in mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->7) The human being&#146;s sight is attracted by the colourful radiance of Venus in the evening time. For this reason, it is called the &ldquo;evening star&rdquo;. It is a planet, not a star, but in spoken Bengali it is mistakenly called a star. This same planet is called shukata&#x301;ra&#x301; at the end of the night (shukra &rarr; shukka &rarr; shuka). Because the human mind is gratified on account of its colourful radiance, one name of this shukata&#x301;ra&#x301; is also kavi. In our childhood in Bihar we used to sit in a small village and sing: A&#x301;dhii la&#x301;lii a&#x301;dhelii nilla&#x301;/jara&#x301; saphedii jara&#x301; sa&#x301; ka&#x301;la&#x301; [Half is red, half is blue, some part is white, the other part is black.]. The planet Venus has attracted human sight since ancient times due to its colourful radiance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->8) In olden times there was a community of people called Asuras who lived in central Asia. Certain branches and subbranches of this Asura community still exist today in India in small numbers in the Gondowana region, especially in the Palamu-Sarguja areas. The Asuras had many qualities, many merits, but they had no one to lead them properly. Shukracharya was the name of a learned and wise man who came forward to help these neglected people despite the abuse that was heaped on his head. Kavi also refers to this Shukracharya. He introduced many kinds of battle tactics and composed many rules and regulations to build a nice society.

The reward for his fame was the appellation, Maha&#x301;kavi [great poet], as the first writer of poetry. Since then kavi has referred to Maharshi Valmiki in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->11) Creation, preservation and destruction together make the world. The creation flows from beginninglessness to endlessness. Within creation is hidden the seed of preservation as well as the thought of nourishing. Within this preservation and nourishing lies the potential of annihilation. After annihilation, the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra-bound living being is created anew within the thoughtwaves of the Great, and the Cosmic imagination, the Cosmic will, moves ahead maintaining a link with this creation. Thus the future prospects of that flow remain merged with this creation right from the outset through otaprota yoga. In the Puranic language, the name that has been given to the director of this creation is Brahma&#x301;. The flow of mobility emanates from Him for the welfare of the flow of the living being.

<a name="7..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->1) The ordinary crow that we commonly see. According to biologists, the crow is not a very old bird.

Shameless people, shouting like a crow, often say such things that courteous people would not say out of modesty. I am not talking about drunkards. Thus, whether one is in normal condition or drunk, a shameless person is called ka&#x301;ka. The word beha&#x301;ya&#x301; [shameless] is of Farsi origin. Be means &ldquo;no&rdquo;; one who has no ha&#x301;ya&#x301; [shame] is beha&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

For this reason, out of appreciation, respect or necessity, there are thirty-one words for yajin&#x32D;ad&#x301;umbar. Ka&#x301;ka also means yajin&#x32D;ad&#x301;umbar.<!-- /block --></p>

In addition to being good for colic, pun&#x32D;i&#146;s many qualities have been spoken about in the old scriptures.

If someone kills a single crow then within a short period of time a great number of crows will gather there and try to collectively harass the killer. When crows gather somewhere in a group, that assembly of crows is also called ka&#x301;ka, but the word for this assembly of crows is feminine plural, that is, ka&#x301;ka&#x301;h (like the plural form of lata&#x301;).<!-- /block --></p>

The fact that women have been attracted to beautiful dress since ancient times is not at all blameworthy, but anything in excess is. Whatever the case may be, in ancient times girls used to have a variety of vanity bags and they used to be called ka&#x301;ka. The word is neuter in gender, thus one must say ka&#x301;kam&#x301; rather than ka&#x301;ka.

If one says, ka&#x301;ka nimphala kha&#x301;cche [the crow is eating neem-fruit], it becomes ka&#x301;kah ka&#x301;kam&#x301; bhaks&#x301;ayati in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>

The Bengali word ka&#x301;han [a unit of measure = 1280] has come from this word ka&#x301;kan. Ka ka&#x301;han khar&#x301; becle [How many ka&#x301;hans of straw did you sell?].

Its feminine form is ka&#x301;karu&#x301;ha&#x301;. Ka&#x301;karu&#x301;ha&#x301; means &ldquo;orchid&rdquo;. The kind of plant that takes shelter on another plant and draws sustenance (chiefly water with salts) from that plant with the help of its own roots, which grows, flowers and in certain cases gives fruit also, that kind of plant is called &ldquo;orchid&rdquo; (not &ldquo;parasite&rdquo;). In Sanskrit it is ka&#x301;karu&#x301;ha&#x301;; in Rarhi Bengali it is called lat&#x301;ka&#x301; because it hangs [lat&#x301;ke] from another plant. In the Chatisgarhi language, this orchid is called kaova&#x301;jor&#x301;ii. A parasite is called benda&#x301; (parabhrta [fostered by a stranger]) by some people).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..135"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph -->The principal difference between parasite and orchid is that while the parasite is within the shelter of the host plant it procures its vital energy from it and as a result the parasite&#146;s host may lose its life-force. The orchid, on the other hand, takes primarily the liquid portion; most of the rest of its sustenance it gathers from the environment. Thus the growth of the orchid does not cause the host plant so much harm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..136"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=136 type=paragraph -->The parasite does not have its own roots. It draws vital juices directly from the host plant. The orchid has its own roots and with the help of those roots it draws vital juices. Since the parasite does not have its own roots, if it is pulled from the host it dies, but the orchid does not die if it is pulled from the host. If it is bound to another plant, a brick, some wood, or a stone, and if meanwhile a little water is given, then it survives and blooms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..137"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=137 type=paragraph -->Compared to ordinary flowers, the orchid&#146;s flower is often much longer lived. On the Bangaon-Calcutta road I once pulled an orchid from a shishu tree and brought it to my Calcutta garden. The plant is still healthy. Its number has increased and it has flowered several times. A single flower remains in full bloom for twenty to twenty-one days at a stretch; it almost seems like a paper flower. I have given the name vaun&#x32D;gaduhita&#x301; to this specific variety of orchid. In Rarhi Bengali it is called lat&#x301;ka&#x301; because although it isn&#146;t part of the tree, it hangs from the tree. Although spices are not part of the food, they &ldquo;hang&rdquo; from vegetables and other foods, both in the physical sense and in the olfactory sense as well. Thus, in ancient Rarh spices were called lat&#x301;kan. Still in certain parts of Rarh a cooking-spice shop is called a lat&#x301;kan shop.<!-- /block --></p>

Out of great respect, people have used the adjective d&#x301;ogra&#x301; for the extremely courageous and straightforward people of Jammu, and their Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta-descended language has been given the name D&#x301;ogrii.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..144"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=144 type=paragraph -->We had now started from this Jammu. Up until the pre-Pathan era, Jammu was an independent kingdom. In olden times Sanskrit, and after that, Dogri, were its local languages. Dogri&#146;s script is a central Indian form of Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script. In ancient India, after the demise of both the Bra&#x301;hmii and Kharos&#x301;t&#x301;hii scripts, three different scripts sprang up in three different parts of India: (1) The Kut&#x301;ila&#x301; script in Allahabad and east of there; (2) Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; to the northwest of Allahabad; and (3) Na&#x301;rada&#x301; or Na&#x301;grii in the southwest. Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; means &ldquo;Sarasvatii&rdquo;, the goddess of knowledge. The Brahmans of this region are known as Sa&#x301;rasvata Brahmans &ndash; they are called this for their erudition. These Sa&#x301;rasvata Brahmans used to live principally in southern Russia, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Jammu and the Saptanada Kingdom [Punjab]. The Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script was prevalent in this territory. Just as there were three branches of Sa&#x301;rasvata Brahmans &ndash; Kashmir Sa&#x301;rasvata, Dogri Sa&#x301;rasvata and Saptanada (Punjabi) Sa&#x301;rasvata &ndash; there were also three branches of Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script &ndash; Kashmiri Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;, central Indian or Dogri Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;, and southern Indian or Punjabi Sa&#x301;rada&#x301;.

During the time of Akbar, Jammu and Kashmir were under the sovereignty of the Mughal court, but in name only. Kashmir, along with Jammu and Afghanistan, fell under the control of the Punjabi chief, Ranjit Singh. After the last Sikh war, that is, after the fall of Queen Jhindan when Punjab came under British control, the British did not take upon themselves the burden of ruling all of Afghanistan. Rather they kept some part of Afghanistan in their own hands for military reasons. That portion they joined to India and gave it the name Northwest Frontier Territory with its capital at Peshawar (its old name was Purus&#x301;apura). The major portion of Afghanistan, however, they returned to the local Muslim Kings of that time; for example, they returned the kingdom of Mahiishu&#x301;r to the descendants of the former king of that region.<!-- /block --></p>

The kingdom&#146;s name became Jammu and Kashmir; its summer capital was Srinagar and its winter capital was Jammu.

Although they don&#146;t have to face any botheration of passport and visa, they often fall into deep trouble as they travel while trying to protect themselves from the cruel clutches of human beings. Many meet an untimely death due to a cruel bullet or fall injured to the ground. Is this their fate! Is there no way to avoid this devilry! Is there no way that a little benevolence can awaken in the human mind! Does mankind&#146;s Neohumanism teach this!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..165"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=165 type=paragraph -->We continued on. We still had far to go, crossing over the border of many former native kingdoms. Nearly the entire journey that we were making this day was through a former kingdom. The king of Jammu-Kashmir was Hari Singh, the successor of its first Dogra king, Golap Singh. His son, in turn, Karna Singh, was not able to become king. Officially he got the government post as Sadr-i-riya&#x301;sat. The remaining parts thereafter were smaller or larger kingdoms. Our destination, Bilaspur, was also a middle-sized native kingdom. But Bilaspur was still quite far away &ndash; hanaoj Bila&#x301;spura du&#x301;r ast. We continued on and on. It was like the lines: Pathik a&#x301;mi pathei ba&#x301;sa&#x301; / A&#x301;ma&#x301;r jeman ja&#x301;oya&#x301; temani a&#x301;sa&#x301; [&ldquo;I am a traveller and the path is my home / It makes no difference whether I come or go&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..166"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=166 type=paragraph -->After going a little ways I suddenly noticed a change. Now there was an apple orchard beside us. This place was well above sea-level, but because there were apple orchards on both sides of us we couldn&#146;t tell how high we were. Here and there were some ciir and pha&#x301;r varieties of trees standing in the apple fields. In some trees I saw some rare birds-of-paradise. They rarely come into contact with people so they are not afraid of them. They don&#146;t know what cruel creatures human beings are. Seeing us, they were not afraid, rather they stared at us eagerly. Their simplicity made me feel uneasy and ashamed at the same time. I felt ashamed thinking that they don&#146;t realize how cruel we human beings are, how complex we are from the mental point of view, and how crooked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..167"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=167 type=paragraph -->After we passed by the apple orchards we came to yet another forest of towering trees. These trees were somewhat similar to oak trees. I noticed that numerous varieties of orchids (ka&#x301;karu&#x301;ha&#x301;) were hanging in the trees. Some of their flowers were in bloom while others were about to bloom. Some of their buds were counting the moments, waiting for the arrival of spring. By judging the amount of warmth in the climate they had guessed that Holi [spring festival] was not far away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..168"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=168 type=paragraph -->I noticed that most of the orchids here bloomed in the months of Pha&#x301;lgun-Caetra.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn12"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn12">12</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> It also appeared that there were a small number of orchid varieties that bloomed in the months of August-September. Some of the orchids looked identical to the orchids that grow uncared-for in the trees alongside the Burdwan-Guskara Road. I have seen these varieties of orchids in Birbhum on the way from Ma&#x301;mud Bazaar to Masha&#x301;njor&#x301;, and in areas near the Jonha&#x301; waterfall (Gaotamdha&#x301;ra&#x301;) on the Jhalda-Ranchi Road. I realized that they didn&#146;t depend on the climate so much, so long as there wasn&#146;t snowfall.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..169"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=169 type=paragraph -->To the left of us, that is, to the north, at a good distance away was the kingdom of Kinnaur, renowned both in history and in the Puranas. This Kinnaur was situated in the northern extremity of India in the Sadashiva mountain range. Some people may not be aware that the Himalayas, stretching from the west until the eastern horizon, are divided north and south into two parts. The Sanskrit name of the part of the Himalayas that touch the northern plains of India is Shivaliun&#x32D;ga Parvatama&#x301;la&#x301; (Shivalic Range). This part is high, but not so high. There is cultivation wherever there are green forested areas in the valleys lying between two mountains, cutting into the mountains with either step-farming or terracing. This Shivalic range is covered with snow in the wintertime, and its highest peaks remained snowcovered all year long. The fossils of prehistoric animals can be found in this part.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..170"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=170 type=paragraph -->At one time the Himalayas were submerged in the bosom of the sea. Northern India was also then at the bottom of the sea. To the south, only Gondawanaland was above sea level. Approximately three million years ago the Himalayas rose up from the depths as a result of an earthquake. The skeletons of some of those animals who used to wander in these parts of the earth three million years ago can be found packed underneath the rocks in the Shivalic range. In later times when the hippopotamus and giraffe were living here, they used to live in these Lower Himalayas. Some of their fossils have also been found in the Lower Himalayas, and more are bound to be discovered in the future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..171"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=171 type=paragraph -->The Sadashiva range (Upper Himalayas) run west to east, directly parallel to the Lower Himalayas. We find this mountain range in Kashmir, Laddak, the northern part of Himachal Pradesh, Simla, Kinnaur, toward the north of Garhwal-Kumayun, the north of Nepal, northern Sikkim and Bhutan, and in southern Tibet. This part of the Himalayas is really quite high. The snow remains all year long but in winter it is really heavy. The highest Himalayan peaks are located in this part. The driest, coldest and most elevated area of the Upper Himalayas is Laddak and Kinnaur. During winter nights the temperature can fall below minus one-hundred degrees. While heating water it freezes and turns to ice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..172"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=172 type=paragraph -->In most parts of this barren mountain land there are snowstorms nearly twelve months of the year. There is virtually no green forest, and hardly any cultivation. I have seen a little barley being grown here in the summertime. People&#146;s primary livelihood is raising livestock. The Indian cow cannot survive here; there are Yaks. Although the ancient land of Kinnaur was some ways from where we were it was not altogether that far. In olden days the people of this region were famed for their beauty, and to some extent they still are. Although their noses are slightly sloping, it does not detract from their loveliness. Seeing their beauty, the people of those days use to think and say that they were not people but angels. Era&#x301; ki nara?

<a name="7..173"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=173 type=paragraph -->The language of the people of Kinnaur is a southwestern dialect of Tibetan, just as Laddaki is a western dialect of Tibetan. The script of the Kinnauri language is also t&#x301;egrii or t&#x301;egra&#x301; (In Sanskrit, trigun&#x301;ii or trigun&#x301;a&#x301; script). Although the common religion of the Kinnauri people is the Lamabad branch of Mahayana Buddhism, it is clearly influenced by the A&#x301;rs&#x301;a doctrine.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn13"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn13">13</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Over the last two thousand years, Ars&#x301;a-ism and Kinnaur&#146;s Mahayana Buddhism (centring around Avalokiteshvara) have coexisted peacefully because Buddhism has avoided clash. The common people revere both the Buddhist grottoes and the A&#x301;rs&#x301;a temples. During hours of worship, the Buddhist lamas place offerings of ground barley, roasted barley powder, etc. before the gods, and these return to the people as prasa&#x301;d [holy remains of the offerings which are then eaten]. In the Hindu [A&#x301;rs&#x301;a] temples the priests place offerings of fruits and vegetables. In the same house one person may be Hindu and another Buddhist, however those who wish to become renunciants generally adopt lamaism and cloister themselves in the Buddhist grottoes. Very few local people become Hindu renunciants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..174"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=174 type=paragraph -->In olden times the number of men in Kinnaur was much greater, by comparison, than the number of women, thus the practice of polygamy was current among women out of social necessity. Some traces of that may still remain today. Some people may consider this strange, but there is nothing to be astonished at, or to think odd. People build their social structure by effecting a suitable harmony between individual and collective necessity, so however this practice of Kinnaur may appear to others, it was perfectly natural.<!-- /block --></p>

So we don&#146;t let our men here work so much. We do much of the work in the apple orchards. We also go and sell in the markets.

<a name="7..200"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=200 type=paragraph -->I looked and yes, in the distance, far away, very far away, the silvery line of a stream was descending from a tall mountain peak. We were travelling from west to east. There was still a little time remaining before we reached the former kingdom of Bilaspur.

<a name="7..201"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=201 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sure, I&#146;ll tell you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There is very little wheat grown here, however, the people here love wheat bread. It poses no difficulty or inconvenience for the rich people to buy wheat and eat bread made from wheat flour. But how much inconvenience the poor people face! In those years when the price of wheat is high or when there is an excess apple production and they fail to find good markets for their apples, then they dry the apples and grind them into a kind of flour.

It&#146;s a troubling situation for them if they are ever forced to feed any guest apple bread; then there is no end to their shame. They will beg that guest&#146;s forgiveness over and over again.

However, in the holes in the ice and in stone hollows clumps of a kind of spinach plant manage to grow. Its leaves are used as a vegetable. The wealthy never suffer any inconvenience.

<a name="7..206"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=206 type=paragraph -->In the land of Kinnaur there was an unusual harmony between the Buddhist and Hindu religions.

He propagated Buddhism in China and had some Mahayana scriptures translated into Chinese.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..208"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=208 type=paragraph -->Kuma&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a&#146;s wife was the Chinese royal princess, Jiiva&#x301;. Kuma&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a&#146;s son, Kuma&#x301;rajiiva, spent the greater part of his life in China, but he went to Kashmir for some time. He also composed some Mahayana scriptures in Sanskrit. He went to Laddak but he didn&#146;t go to Kinnaur. Still, Buddhism was subsequently introduced into Kinnaur from Laddak. Buddhism was first propagated in the original territory of Tibet (whose name was then Kimpurus&#x301;avars&#x301;a) by the royal prince of Udayan, Padmasambhava. What we now call Garhwal-Kumayun was known as the kingdom of Udayan in olden times. The palms of the hands and the soles of the feet of the royal prince were bright red so he was given the name Padmasambhava. Due to his influence Tibet accepted Mahayana Buddhism. The religion of Tibet before that was Bonpa or Bonpa-ism. King Sa&#x301;ungt-sen-ga&#x301;mpo, a follower of the Bonpa religion, had two wives. One was the royal Chinese princess, Den Jing, and the other was Trikuti, the daughter of the Nepali King at the time, Am&#x301;shuvarman&#x301;a, who was a follower of Mahayana Buddhism. The influence of these two queens was considerable in the kingdom of Tibet. The king was inspired by them to accept the Buddhist religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..209"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=209 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;ungt-sen-ga&#x301;mpo was a historically renowned personality, a pious emperor. At that time, Magadha was resplendent for its erudition. The two best universities were then Magadha&#146;s Nalanda and Taxila in the land of Kandahar. Taxila was famous for its philosophical thinking and for its spiritual community. Nalanda was successful in all spheres, and spiritually inspired. The chancellor of this Nalanda University was Dharmapa&#x301;la Diipaun&#x32D;kar. Dharmapa&#x301;la Diipaun&#x32D;kar came from Vikraman&#x301;ipur (its modern name is Vikrampur).

While Diipaun&#x32D;kar was there Buddhism became well established in Kimpurus&#x301;avars&#x301;a (after that time the name of Kimpurus&#x301;avars&#x301;a became Tibet). Buddhism became the common religion of the people of Laddak and Kinnaur at that time as well. The king gave Dharmapa&#x301;la Diipaun&#x32D;kar the title of Shriijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na Atiisha as a reward for his recognized scholarship. After Dharmapa&#x301;la Diipaun&#x32D;kar returned to Magadha, Buddhist pundits in good numbers came from Tibet and studied in Magadha, doing research in Buddhism and translating the Su&#x301;ttapit&#x301;aka, Vinayapit&#x301;aka and Abhidhammapir&#x301;aka into Tibetan.<!-- /block --></p>

No, no, no, it is not sufficient to say cordial &ndash; very cordial. In the middle of the Mughal era we see this cordiality carried over in the letters exchanged between the Maharaja of Coochbihar and the King of Tibet &ndash; in them runs the melody of this same heartfelt sincerity. The letters exchanged between the two of them were in Bengali. The king of Tibet (the then Dalai Lama) was bound to India by ties of affection. In the British administration as well, there were no great obstacles to intercourse between India and Tibet. Indian pilgrims used to go to Mount Kailash and Manas Sarowar without any difficulty. Monks and renunciants used to sit and light the sacrificial fires on both sides of the Himalayas. The closest sea to Tibet was the Bay of Bengal and Calcutta was Tibet&#146;s seaport. Tibet used to export primarily wool, animal skins, precious stones, and medicinal ingredients, while Tibet used to import manufactured commodities and small amounts of foodstuffs. Several of Tibet&#146;s post-offices were under the supervision of Bengal&#146;s Postmaster-General.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..247"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=247 type=paragraph -->It was a long time ago. I was in Sirmaor&#146;s capital then, Na&#x301;ha&#x301;n. Na&#x301;ha&#x301;n is a small city, but I liked it very much. The kingdom of Sirmaor was at one time quite huge &ndash; nearly half of the present-day Himachal Pradesh was in Sirmaor. Moreover, Garhwal-Kumayunr was once included within Sirmaor. Part of neighbouring Tibet was also within the borders of Sirmaor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..248"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=248 type=paragraph -->With the passage of time, many small and large kingdoms fell. A large part of present-day Himachal Pradesh left Sirmaor. In accordance with a verbal agreement between the Panchen Lama and the king of Sirmaor, part of Sirmaor came under the rule of the Dalai Lama. Nepal&#146;s Gorkha king took possession of Garhwal-Kumayun. Sirmaor became much smaller area-wise. Among all those native kingdoms who were assembled to make the present-day Himachal Pradesh, Sirmaor was not altogether insignificant as far as area goes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..249"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=249 type=paragraph -->The language of Sirmaor is Sirmaori (both language and script). It arose from a mixture of Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta and Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta. Sirmaori is closely related to the Pa&#x301;ha&#x301;ri language of Simla.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..250"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=250 type=paragraph -->Sirmaori has its own script as well, but nowadays it is disappearing. If this situation continues Sirmaori script will soon vanish behind the curtain of oblivion, just as Burma&#146;s Sa&#x301;n-Ka&#x301;cin script has vanished. At one time these Sa&#x301;n-Ka&#x301;cins were close relatives of the Bengali Kukii community and their script was also Bengali script. However, in subsequent times they were ruined by northern Burma&#146;s sub-script, but the Kukii script was unaffected. Sirmaori script is in that same situation. Archaeologists should make efforts to see that this script survives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..251"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=251 type=paragraph -->I got to thinking about that pre-Pathan era. At that time the influence of Shankaracharya over Sirmaor was quite high. The kings were making ongoing efforts with greater and lesser success to build a &ldquo;learned society&rdquo;; the relationship between Sirmaor and Bengal dates from that time. Garhwal-Kumayun was still a part of Sirmaor. Yes, Garhwal-Kumayun also left Sirmaor&#146;s control during Nepali rule. Afterwards, of course, when Nepal was defeated by General Octorloney,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn20"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn20">20</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Garhwal-Kumayun went back to the British in accordance with the treaty of Sugaolii (Champaran District). The British kept Garhwal-Kumayunr in their own hands, rather than return it to Sirmaor, and included it within the then United Province of Agra and Oudh (UP). Garhwal-Kumayun was lost to Sirmaor from then on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..252"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=252 type=paragraph -->Let us return then to the subject at hand. The kings of Sirmaor brought some pundits from Bengal and Maharastra and settled them in their own kingdom (in Garhwal and Kumayun) with offers of rent-free land grants. The descendants of these pundits are still there today. They differ from the local Yoshi Brahmans in their manners, behaviours, ways of thinking. Among the sixteen branches of Brahmans in those areas, twelve branches have come from Bengal and four are from Maharastra, that is, they belong to the Maharastran Citpa&#x301;van branch. Those whose forefathers came from Bengal continue to use such surnames as Bhat&#x301;t&#x301;a, Upa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya, Bahugun&#x301;a&#x301;, and so forth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..253"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=253 type=paragraph -->Maharastra&#146;s Citpa&#x301;van Brahmans are mostly vegetarian &ndash; they don&#146;t eat meat or fish but they don&#146;t have so much aversion to onions. The Bengali Brahmans don&#146;t have any distaste for meat but they do for onions. Those who eat meat, or used to eat meat, used to cook their meat without onions. When they came to this mountainous region, however, the Bengali and Maharastri Brahmans came into close contact with one another. From the point of view of spiritual ideologies, there have been five acknowledged Tantras since ancient times &ndash; Shaeva, Sha&#x301;kta, Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya, Saora, and Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava. Shaeva Tantra was equally present in this mountain region and its nearby areas. It was a little stronger in the mountains because this area is called &ldquo;Shiva&#146;s Field&rdquo;. The name of the mountains is also the Shivalic Range. Shiva used to remain mostly in this area, also in the Mount Kailash region.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..254"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=254 type=paragraph -->Earlier I mentioned that until the time of the Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, Mount Kailash and Manas Sarowar were part of Bharatakhan&#x301;d&#x301;a. But from the Sha&#x301;kta and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra point of view, we see that the successors of the Brahmans who came from Bengal principally accepted Sha&#x301;kta Tantra. And the successors of the Maharastra Citpa&#x301;van Brahman community chiefly followed Ga&#x301;n&#x301;patya Tantra. The influence of Sha&#x301;kta Tantra over the common people was greater, by comparison, than that of Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra. The Yoshii Brahmans are close to Sha&#x301;kta Tantra. For related reasons, Shiva and Shiva temples are pre-eminent in this region, but in important places Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, as well, is not neglected.<!-- /block --></p>

Fearful of crows, the owl hides itself in the dark crevices of trees during the day. Crows cannot see at night, so if an owl sees a crow at night it attacks it. But since crows have more strength in their beaks than owls they save themselves somehow. Thus, it is seen that it is the crow&#146;s young that are generally killed by owls. If an owl is not overly hungry it will not eat crow-meat. Since the crow&#146;s meat is bad-tasting, no bird will eat it apart from the vulture.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="7.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.7.fn1">1</a></b>)   According to Indian mythology, at the time of an eclipse the demon Ra&#x301;hu swallows the sun or moon. The story goes like this: Once the gods and the demons undertook a project to churn the ocean. During the churning many precious valuables rose up from the sea-bed. Among these was sudha&#x301; or amrta (nectar). The demons claimed half of it but the gods became afraid that if the demons drank their share of the nectar they would become immortal and thus remain a perpetual source of trouble for the gods. So they postponed the division of the nectar and in the meantime they approached Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and implored him to help them get rid of the demons. Thereafter Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u assumed the form of a beautiful woman and began distributing the nectar among the gods and the demons. The gods drank the nectar  but the demons were too busy staring at the woman. Only one demon drank the nectar but Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u slit his throat before it got to his stomach. The severed head of this demon became known as Ra&#x301;hu and the trunk as Ketu. &ndash;Trans.</p>
