<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Sambhu&#x301;ti and Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti&rdquo;. In the Vedas it has been said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Sambhu&#x301;tiin&#x32D;ca vina&#x301;shain&#x32D;ca yastadvedobhayam&#x301;saha;<br>Vina&#x301;shena mrtyum&#x301; tiirtva&#x301; sam&#x301;bhu&#x301;tya&#x301;mrtamashnute.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[It is better for people to understand Brahma in both Its aspects, sambhu&#x301;ti, or creation, and vina&#x301;sha, or transformation. Through vina&#x301;sha &ndash; changing from one form to another &ndash; they overcome death, and through sambhu&#x301;ti &ndash; the gift of a human body &ndash; they gain a chance for immortality.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti? To acquire knowledge about Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti, you must first understand sambhu&#x301;ti and vina&#x301;sha. The word sambhu&#x301;ti is derived as: prefix sam &ndash; root verb bhu&#x301; + suffix ktin, which combine to mean literally, &ldquo;proper development, proper origin&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->What is proper development or origin? When something is created it is called sambhu&#x301;ti. But when people create something new out of some existing fundamental stuff, it is not called sambhu&#x301;ti. (There are certain fundamental elements which human beings cannot create, but out of which they can create various objects. These objects are called elements, and all are included in sambhu&#x301;ti.) Actually, sambhu&#x301;ti is a special creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What do we mean by vina&#x301;sha? Vina&#x301;sha is derived as: vi &ndash; nash + ghain&#x32D;. Usually we come across three such words: na&#x301;sha, vina&#x301;sha and pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. What we call &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; in ordinary language is called na&#x301;sha. When an object is transformed and cannot be brought back to its original form it is called vina&#x301;sha. For example, when a five-year-old boy grows into a twenty-five-year-old man it signifies a major change. Where has the growing body of the five-year-old gone? It has been annihilated. When an object returns to its original source after being annihilated, it is called pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. Pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha signifies destruction also, but of a different nature. For example, when you prepare puri [unleavened bread puffed by deep frying] out of wheat flour and then transform it back into wheat flour, this is pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Let us take another example. Sugar is made from cane-juice. If the sugar is transformed back into cane-juice, that will be pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. In brief, sambhu&#x301;ti means &ldquo;an original creation&rdquo;, and vina&#x301;sha is the total destruction of an object which cannot be transformed back to its original source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The fundamental stuff of the universe has emerged from Parama Purus&#x301;a; hence all objects, big and small, are the sambhu&#x301;tis of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This sambhu&#x301;ti or creation is divided into various worlds: physical, plant, animal and human. Inanimate and animate beings are divided into various branches and sub-branches, which are also the creations of Parama Purus&#x301;a. In ordinary language they can also be called avata&#x301;ra. When Parama Purus&#x301;a is manifested in some physical object, that physical object is called the avata&#x301;ra of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The word avata&#x301;ra is derived as: ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D;. How diversified is the creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a! What striking differences there are among objects! Even in the plant world some plants are quite developed, while others are totally undeveloped. In the living world the protozoic body is undeveloped, but the metazoic body is developed. There is tremendous complexity within the flow of evolution of living beings. The undeveloped creatures of the living world are called jiivakot&#x301;i, and those which are highly developed are called Iishvarakot&#x301;i. The entire gamut of evolution from protozoic cells up to human beings are called jiivakot&#x301;is. These jiivakot&#x301;is [living beings] evolve through psychic and social clash. For example, those people who are dull and unintelligent today are sure to develop one day in the gradual process of evolution. When they become highly intelligent people, their physical capacity  will also increase. Through intensive self-culture, a jiivakot&#x301;i can achieve a lot. Thus one should not worry; those who have taken the shelter of Parama Purus&#x301;a will certainly merge in Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Like jiivakot&#x301;is, the other branches and sub-branches of creation have originated from Parama Purus&#x301;a. You are not the actual owner of your physical and intellectual strength and spiritual power all these things have come from Parama Purus&#x301;a. All these powers have their limits, but Parama Purus&#x301;a is the source of all power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In a jiivakot&#x301;i, strength can develop only to a certain degree, for the capacity of development of living beings is limited  this is why they are called jiivakot&#x301;is. Suppose a certain man is trying to increase his physical strength through physical exercise. His strength can increase only to a certain degree. The physical strength of human beings is such that it cannot increase beyond a certain point. In exactly the same way, a certain person may develop the power of memory; but this development can take place only up to a certain age. Once that age is reached, there can be no further improvement. An ordinary human being can never become omniscient.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->And what does Iishvarakot&#x301;i mean? In Iishvarakot&#x301;i there is a greater manifestation of divinity. A jiivakot&#x301;i by virtue of sincere and ardent spiritual practice can elevate itself to Iishvarakot&#x301;i. Both jiivakot&#x301;i and Iishvarakot&#x301;i are creations of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus in the gradual process of evolution they will become one with Brahma one day. In the Vedas it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Es&#x301;o ha deva pradisho&#146;nu sarva&#x301;<br>Pu&#x301;rvohaja&#x301;tah sa u garbhe anta;<br>Sa eva ja&#x301;tah sah janis&#x301;yama&#x301;nah,<br>Pratyam&#x301;jana&#x301;m&#x301;stist&#x301;hate sarvatomukhah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Es&#x301;o ha deva pradisho&#146;nu sarva&#x301;. Each direction is a creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He exists in all four directions. There are considerable differences in recommendations as to which way one should face while sitting in meditation or worship. Some say east, some say west; others advise north. Superstitious people consider the south to be inauspicious, as the south is supposed to be death&#146;s door. But the rs&#x301;i [sage] says that all the pradisha [cardinal points]  north, south, east and west  and all the anudisha [secondary points]  northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, above and below  are the sambhu&#x301;tis of Parama Purus&#x301;a. So which way should people face? He pervades all the directions; all are His creations. Thus it is not necessary to face always in one direction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Pu&#x301;rvohaja&#x301;tah. Those objects which existed in the distant past were also His creation. For instance, this planet earth was created after dissociation from the sun about 8,000 million years ago. At that time this earth was only a gaseous substance, but that too was a creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Subsequently that gas cooled and gradually solidified to form the earth. This metamorphosis took place around 2,230 million years ago, long before the advent of human beings. Naturally there was no question of anyone ascribing any name to it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->As the earth gradually cooled, many layers of rock were formed under the crust. Each of these layers is also a creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a, created by certain temperatures, pressures and atmospheric conditions. In brief, whatever was created in the past was the sambhu&#x301;ti of the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The totality of all the sambhu&#x301;tis is this universe. All the entities from the mighty sun to the tiny ant are a part of this universe. All the celestial bodies, living, dying or dead; all the nebulae, galaxies and the Milky Way; are members of the same universal family. A galaxy is vast, an ant is tiny, yet both have equal importance in maintaining the balance of the universe. If even an ant dies prematurely, that mishap may disturb the balance of the universe. Nothing in this universe is unimportant, not even a tiny ant. Suppose an ant moves an inch from the east to the west on a stone. If the balance of the stone is jeopardized by this change, this incident may be the cause of a major earthquake, because ants are also His sambhu&#x301;ti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Through excavation we have discovered many fossils of animals and plants. These discoveries prove that in ancient times various gigantic animals existed, most of which have become extinct. All that remains are the fossilized bones of their bodies. Various ages &ndash; [Archean], Mesozoic, Oligocene, Eocene, etc. &ndash; have come and gone. Each of these ages had its respective animals and plants, which became extinct in a subsequent age. Each age is a sambhu&#x301;ti; each animal, plant and geological layer is also a sambhu&#x301;ti. Nothing is unnecessary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->About 1,700,000 years ago, towards the end of the Miocene Age and the early part of the Oligocene Age, the australopithecine came onto this earth. That animal is now extinct, but its successors, such as orangutans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, still exist. One branch of that group evolved into human beings. Hence the first ancestors of human beings should be called australopithecine and not &ldquo;Ka&#x301;shyapa&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bharadva&#x301;ja&rdquo; [names of early clan leaders]. The ancestors of human beings are monkeys, so monkeys are the relatives of human beings. All things that came on earth in the past were sambhu&#x301;tis of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Sa u garbhe anta. Those beings which existed in the past are not the only sambhu&#x301;tis; those who will be born in the future will also be His sambhu&#x301;tis. Our ancestors used to say in ancient times, Aham&#x301; gaccha&#x301;mi [&ldquo;I&#146;m going&rdquo;]. Later on this was changed into Ahammi gacchata huim. Still later the sentence was changed into Man&#x32D;y ja&#x301;ha&#x301;ta&#x301; ha&#x301;n&#x32D;i. Finally it became Man&#x32D;y ja&#x301;ta&#x301; hun&#x32D; [in modern Hindi]. One thousand years from now the same sentence will be changed into Ma&#x301;i ja&#x301;n&#x32D;i. Thus you see, one sambhu&#x301;ti is dying, yielding its place to a new one. Whatever will come will be an expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a  the changes will be of form and sound only.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Sa eva ja&#x301;tah. Whatever we see at present is His sambhu&#x301;ti also. Nothing in this universe is unimportant, though it may be small or petty. Take the case of alcoholics. To others they are degraded persons, but one has no right to hate them. Hatred is not an expression of moral courage. It is definitely not a praiseworthy tendency.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Sa eva ja&#x301;tah sah janis&#x301;yama&#x301;nah. If all the objects of this universe are the creations of Parama Purus&#x301;a, how can you hate anyone or anything? How is it possible to meditate on one divine expression and hate another? Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti is the object of your ideation. There are certain entities which take a long time in undergoing internal and external change. For example, during the Cretaceous Age this earth was populated by gigantic animals which had immense bodies full of fat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The geography of this earth is constantly changing. Where the sea is surrounded by land on three sides it is called a bay, for instance, the Bay of Bengal. The water of a bay is not ruffled by the high waves of the sea. The carcasses of many animals and creatures used to wash into the waters of such bays and accumulate there. This process resulted in the creation of sargasso seas. The carcasses would form a layer on the surface of the water so thick that small animals could even walk on it. When this hard crust thickened enough, the result was the sargasso sea. Underneath was water, and on the surface people could live and move. As the dead bodies accumulated, the fatty portion of the carcasses was converted into mineral oil under climatic pressures and pressures created in the earth&#146;s surface. Thus by observing the geological structure of the earth, it is possible to determine the location of mineral oil. For example, the Assam valley, the Garo and Khasiya Hills, and the Himalayas, have large deposits of mineral oil, as do Rajasthan and Saurashtra. It takes a few tens of millions of years for animal fat to be converted into mineral oil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The difference between the human beings of one million years ago and those of today is immense. Even the physical structures of developed human beings of today differ from those of undeveloped. The human structure also gradually changes in pace with human progress. All the ectoplasmic cells, nerve cells and nerve fibres of human beings are changing; the glands and plexi are also changing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Pratyam&#x301;jana&#x301;m&#x301;stis&#x301;t&#x301;hate sarvatomukhah. Behind every sambhu&#x301;ti, Parama Purus&#x301;a exists. Suppose you are sitting somewhere thinking about filing a case against your uncle. No one can know your internal thought, but Parama Purus&#x301;a knows. Or suppose your boss has arrived. You give him a proper reception and verbally request him to stay three or four days. But internally you are thinking, &ldquo;The sooner this calamity is over, the better.&rdquo; Here you are maintaining a duality between the internality and the externality. Parama Purus&#x301;a certainly knows your dual role. He exists behind every object, in every existence. For each and every sambhu&#x301;ti He has created a witnessing counterpart. So it is not possible for you to keep anything secret  He has vigilant eyes everywhere. He is equally present in both animate and inanimate objects. We can say allegorically that He is associated with every object of creation through His five faces and His three eyes. The three eyes represent the past, present and future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->It is physically impossible for anyone to have five faces, yet Shiva is called Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nana [&ldquo;Five-Faced God&rdquo;]. So what are those five faces?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Shiva has one face in front flanked by two faces on the right and two on the left. The face on the extreme right is called Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara. This face conveys the message: &ldquo;Listen to me! This will be good for you. You should behave in this way. Follow me. Please follow this path. Don&#146;t indulge in improper deeds, but follow the path of morality and pious deeds.&rdquo; Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara guides people with sweet polite language. Even though it tells one not to do certain things, it is still pleasant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The face on the extreme left is called Va&#x301;madeva. It speaks with a thunderous voice. &ldquo;You worthless chap, why did you do such a thing? I will punish you severely.&rdquo; Thereafter it punishes the wrongdoer with a stick. &ldquo;Don&#146;t take me lightly, your bones will learn what is proper and what is improper!&rdquo; This Va&#x301;madeva is the exact opposite of Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The face next to Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara is called Iisha&#x301;na. It says, &ldquo;Look, my child, follow this path. If you follow any other path, it will bring you only sorrow. Don&#146;t make such a mistake. Prakrti will never pardon you. The result will be disastrous.&rdquo; Iisha&#x301;na clearly states the consequences of misdeeds and gives a few pieces of advice. You may experience Parama Purus&#x301;a either in the form of Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara or in that of Iisha&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->And on the left, the face next to Va&#x301;madeva is called Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni. Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni says, &ldquo;Severe punishment is awaiting you. Your bones will be broken. Stupid! What nonsense are you doing?&rdquo; In this way Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni scolds and threatens to punish, although it does not actually carry it out. Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni tries to rectify wrongdoers by creating fear in them, not by actual punishment. When someone becomes extremely angry we call him agnisharma&#x301; [red as fire]. The face in the middle is called Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram. This face says, &ldquo;Come, dear child, and sit beside me. I hope you are quite well.&rdquo; This is the role of Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram. Thus human beings want only Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->With these five faces the Supreme Entity is watching the movement of each and every human being. He takes steps according to the particular situation. In the Vedas there appears the following prayer:<!-- /block --></p>

He was so still when engrossed in silent, deep, spiritual meditation that white ants had sufficient time and opportunity to build an ant hill around his body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Samamashakena. Mashaka means &ldquo;mosquito&rdquo; or any tiny creature. Samana&#x301;gena. The word na&#x301;ga has three meanings: &ldquo;python&rdquo;, &ldquo;mammoth&rdquo; and &ldquo;mountain spring&rdquo;. Parama Purus&#x301;a has equal love and affection for white ants, mosquitoes and mammoths. Even though a mammoth has a huge body, Parama Purus&#x301;a shows no special partiality for it. He is as concerned about a tiny mosquito as He is about the entire universe. Although this vast universe, along with the so-called heaven and the so-called hell and this world of mortals, is so complex and vast, Parama Purus&#x301;a does not devote any extra time to it, nor does He devote any extra time to the tiny ant. Behind every sambhu&#x301;ti there functions a particular force assigned by Parama Purus&#x301;a. According to scriptures this force is called deva. Deva means a special manifestation of divine power, a special effulgence radiated from Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus no entity should be hated, and none is insignificant.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..45"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->[Supreme Consciousness exists in the form of an unbroken flow of cognition, the supreme source of all kinds of emanative vibrations.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The collection of all vibrations constitutes this universe. The existence and progress of this universe depends on the clash and cohesion of these vibrations. This process brings about some kind of disequilibrium in the sambhu&#x301;tis at a certain stage. That is, the imbalance in collective life becomes something that cannot be corrected by any one sambhu&#x301;ti. Let us suppose five thousand million people live in a particular place. Each of them is a sambhu&#x301;ti of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Suppose that with the passage of time (a change in the time factor) they lose their vitality, they become involved in internecine battles, and pessimism strikes deep in their hearts and creates disillusion and disappointment. This pessimism in collective life cannot be solved by one particular sambhu&#x301;ti; it requires the appearance of a special structure through which the Supreme Entity can fully express Himself. This special manifestation is called Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti [&ldquo;Great Sambhu&#x301;ti&rdquo;]. The role of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti is to properly guide all other sambhu&#x301;tis and, by enforcing proper discipline, to bring about proper harmony and coordination amongst them. This special manifestation does not come within the purview of jiivakot&#x301;i or that of Iishvarakot&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Iishvarakot&#x301;i is also a special manifestation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Normally human beings look upon Iishvarakot&#x301;i as an incarnation of God. Actually even jiivakot&#x301;i is an incarnation of God, but Iishvarakot&#x301;i is a higher incarnation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->In ancient times people imagined God in a series of advents correlated with the evolutionary flow of life on earth. The first expression of life took place in the water. Thereafter, another type of living being emerged which could live both in water and on land. Later land animals evolved, followed by a sub-human level of beings and finally by humans. More and more developed forms of jiivakot&#x301;i and Iishvarakot&#x301;i emerged. A medieval poet expressed this idea in sweet, lyrical verse:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;The Cognitive Faculty and The Supreme Desideratum&rdquo; (Citi Shakti O A&#x301;lambana&#x301;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Both the Supreme Cognitive Faculty and the Supreme Operative Force are present in the primordial Force or the Causal Matrix. Dharma is the means to reach that Cognitive Faculty and Supreme Desideratum. When a microcosm accepts something as the Supreme Desideratum it becomes identified with its desideratum. For instance, when a cockroach constantly thinks of a ka&#x301;n&#x32D;cpoka&#x301; in fear, its body gradually takes the form and colour of ka&#x301;n&#x32D;cpoka&#x301;. When a chameleon thinks about the colour of a leaf on which it sits, its own colour becomes the same as that of the leaf. This is called natural camouflage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The desideratum of the Operative Principle is the Cognitive Faculty. Parami Prakrti ideates on Parama Purus&#x301;a because she is sheltered in Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is why it is said in the scriptures, Prakrtih sa&#x301; nityanivrtta&#x301;: &ldquo;Prakrti is being metamorphosed into Purus&#x301;a at every moment because Parama Purus&#x301;a is Her object of ideation&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Every entity of this created universe is associated with the Cognitive Faculty, either directly or indirectly. Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s first object of creation is Parama&#x301; Prakrti, the supreme Operative Principle. With the Cognitive Faculty&#146;s sanction, the Operative Principle then creates various entities of ever-increasing crudity. Thus the first object which Prakrti creates in the process of evolution is Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s second object of creation. The first object of Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s creation is Prakrti; the second object is the first entity created by Prakrti, and the third object is that which is created by the second object. In this way different objects are being created one after the other.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->These stages are mysterious as far as their external forms are concerned: they are created in such a way that one stage cannot only create subsequent stages, but provide vitality to them as well. These creations are not abrupt. The creative process can be likened to the manufacturing of sugar-cane molasses. First the sugar cane is cultivated; then the juice is extracted from the cane; then molasses is processed from the juice and finally sealed in tins. Just as all these stages occur in proper sequential order, similarly all the entities of the universe are created and connected to one another. Nothing is disjointed or disconnected, nor could that ever be possible. Whenever something is about to become disjointed or disconnected Prakrti immediately places it in an ordered sequence again. Behind these stages of metamorphosis, the factors of time, space and person are active.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Had this gradual metamorphosis within Prakrti not occurred the spatial, temporal, and personal factors would not have been created. To maintain the continued unfoldment of the various stages, time, space and person are indispensable. These three relative factors are not required merely to substantiate existence, and for Parama Purus&#x301;a they are certainly unnecessary ; but they are indispensable for facilitating the process of evolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The primordial point of creation or shambhu&#x301; lies in Prakrti (Svyambhu&#x301; exists between Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti). Hence, shambhu&#x301; is the first object of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The entity which is in full control is called shambhu&#x301;. In shambhu&#x301; there exists dynamicity, endeavour and evolution. The endeavour to transform takes the form of synthesis amongst the spatial, temporal and personal factors. Without these three factors, shambhu&#x301; could never be manifested. When shambhu&#x301; and the Operative Principle become active with the help of the three relative factors the name of that transformed shambhu&#x301; is bhaerava.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Human beings try to awaken the seed which lies dormant in the individual human mind in a congenial environment. Suppose people possess certain good qualities but due to an uncongenial environment are not able to express them. They eagerly search for a congenial environment, and as soon as they find it, they immediately express their latent qualities. The expression is made so quickly that it cannot be accompanied by any firm judgment or analysis. Here speed is the main factor; judgment and analysis are secondary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Likewise, when shambhu&#x301; becomes manifested &ndash; that is, when it is transformed into bhaerava, it moves with tremendous speed in a straight line. At this stage nothing can be created, because to create something a calm mind is required. But when shambhu&#x301; is transformed into bhaerava there is speed, there is a sudden release of energy, but no power of analysis. Its witness-ship is embedded in the Cognitive Faculty. Thereafter, when shambhu&#x301; is being manifested in a straight line, the Cognitive Faculty is witnessing it also. But, in spite of that, it is not able to create anything new because Shakti is suddenly released, and the Cognitive Faculty is only witnessing this release of energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->When people&#146;s suppressed desires begin to take concrete form in the external world, they become confused: they wonder what should be done and what should not be done.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When people watch the externalization of an internal thought which had been confined for a long time in the innermost recesses of the mind, or which had been kept hidden in the jewel case of the inner heart they obviously become confused. The same thing occurs when the tranquil shambhu&#x301; becomes metamorphosed into bhaerava: it can no longer remain within hard and fast rules and regulations. But, in the subsequent stage, when there is some relaxation due to internal clash, it assumes a particular form, although a distorted one This assuming of forms also takes place step by step when shambhu&#x301; remains in the form of the primordial point. It is itself a special stage. Thereafter, when shambhu&#x301; undergoes change in the flow of energy, it reaches its second stage. This transformation is a necessity, because no creation can start from a stationary point. In order to commence the process of creation shambu&#x301; needs to imbibe tremendous momentum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In this tremendous momentum the Operative Principle is more predominant than the Cognitive Principle. The Operative Principle, being a blind force, cannot create anything at that stage, but it heralds the beginning of an impending creation. When the internal clash causes distortion and creates waves, the first emanated wave is the longest wave. When a straight line is changed into a curved line, it is difficult to determine whether the first curvature is an idea or an object, because its wavelength is very long. We can certainly call it a particular stage &ndash; the very first stage. Thereafter the wavelength gradually decreases, resulting in a series of subsequent stages in which objects, elements, compounds, entities, ideas, and relative expressions are created. The first stage, in which, the first expression is in a straight line is called bhaerava. Thus, evolution proceeds gradually from subtle to crude, and from crude to subtle to subtler and, finally, to the subtlest. Thus the conversion into maximum crudity ends at that point where no further crudification is possible. At that point there remains hardly any acceleration; from there retardation starts, and finally the conversion into solid matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->This complete cessation of movement is contrary to the principle of dynamics. In this universe nothing can stop moving: absolute pause or absolute speed simply do not exist. Pause and speed are relative. The cessation of movement is contrary to the principle of relativity, because between these two stages the relative factors are ever-active. It is these factors which cause one stage to be converted into a subsequent stage. This is how the flow of creation proceeds in matter, in mind and in consciousness. When movement reaches the point of maximum crudification, it is given a severe jolt by the relative factors. At that stage there is no scope for further crudification, because the nadir point of crudity has already been reached. This nadir point is called svayambhu&#x301;. The jolt caused by the impact of the relative factors causes the flow of creation to move towards Consciousness, that same consciousness which was once converted into abstract. Consciousness, abstract and matter are the terms used to describe the same Entity in different forms, in three different stages. Some learned fools incorrectly interpret these three stages as being different entities, thereby creating confusion in the common people. These three stages can be likened to ice, water and vapour &ndash; the basic substance is the same it merely takes different forms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->This crudest point, svayambhu&#x301;, is an object of the Cognitive Faculty; the three stages are objects of the Cognitive Faculty and time, space and person functioning within these stages are also the objects of the Cognitive Faculty. The nature of time, space and person is such that when they work on a subtle level they automatically work in a subtle manner. In the subtlest stage, space is not like this terrestrial earth, time is not like the hands of a watch, and person is not like the human form as we know it. Rather in that stage the relative factors assume immense proportions: space is the vast spatial expression which even accommodates Consciousness. Time becomes capable of reckoning the Cosmic Mind, and person is none other than Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. In a well-ordered environment of time, space and person, the finite objects maintain the closest link with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Once the mind is created, Parama Purus&#x301;a is reflected on the mind. That internal reflection is called gun&#x301;a&#x301;tma&#x301;. That is, jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; could reside in the five fundamental factors also if they had minds what to speak of matter. Even a living protozoa has a mind, although a very undeveloped one, so it too receives the reflection of the vast Cosmic Mind. Thus, whenever mind is expressed, or whenever the mind has originated but is not yet fully expressed, the A&#x301;tman is reflected. Where there is no mind, the material body is directly guided by the Cosmic Mind; otherwise, it is guided by its own small unit mind. Whatever exists in this orderly world be it matter or mind-stuff, trees, plants, birds or animals, or human beings, reflects Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus Parama Purus&#x301;a is the witness of everything &ndash; nothing can be kept secret from Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->What is the unit mind? The Macrocosmic Mind originates from Macrocosmic Consciousness. Just as the five fundamental factors originate from the Macrocosmic Mind, similarly out of matter evolves the abstract. The unit is created due to clash and cohesion, which takes place within every material structure. This mind tries to take command of all the activities of that structure, thereby establishing its total authority. But the question is, where does the unit mind, which exists in a protozoa, an evolved human being or a learned scholar, actually come from? The unit mind is a metamorphosed form of matter, and matter is a metamorphosed form of Cosmic Mind. In the process of evolution, the Cosmic Mind takes the form of matter. The unit mind is obviously very small in comparison to the Cosmic Mind. How can such a tiny mind ever expect to use logic to analyse or judge Parama Purus&#x301;a? To attempt to do that would be sheer arrogance, a futile pursuit which merely wastes time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->For a unit mind the wisest course of action is to ideate on the Supreme Entity, for by doing this it will become increasingly elevated. The nature of mind is to become as it thinks. Thus when a mind constantly ideates on the Supreme Entity, it gradually expands and eventually becomes one with the Cosmic Mind and it automatically becomes composed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is the collection of infinite unit minds. Is it therefore not ludicrous for a small unit mind to try to judge Him? How can you ever expect to analyse His vast mind? You require physical eyes in order to see things, but how many things can you see at one time? You can only see objects when light waves are reflected off them and carry vibrations to your eyes, and even then only when the distance is short and the light is not too dim. So you have to make do with limited faculties. But for the Cosmic Mind everything is an internal phenomenon. He sees everything without the help of eyes. Just as a blind person imagines things of vast proportions within his or her mind, similarly Parama Purus&#x301;a sees everything and everyone within His own mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The five sensory organs &ndash; eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin-bring external objectivities in contact with the mind, and express mental ideas in the external world with the help of the nerves. The One for whom nothing is external, who has created everything within His mind, sees every action of the sensory organs. Now what will this unit mind do, this unit mind which has been created after Svayambhu Vindu according to the dictates of time, space and person, or as a result of clash within the material body and according to the momentum of the Cosmic force? The unit mind advances according to the influence and momentum of time, space and person. That being which moves for the sake of movement, is called an animal (pashu). To say that an animal is a being which has an animal-like body is incorrect; it is more precise to say that an animal is a being which is guided by only a few inborn instinctive momenta, thus many human beings can be said to be animalistic. When the number of animal-like humans increases, human society and culture rapidly degenerate. This is the situation in the world today. But this social and cultural collapse will be overcome in the future,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In the long history of humanity periods of degeneration have come and gone. When the number of animals in human form increases, rational people become more active to save society. In response to their collective prayer, Parama Brahma, the Supreme Entity, applies a special power so that human civilization is saved from annihilation, and injected with new life to enable it to advance with fresh momentum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Whenever the nadir point of degeneration is reached, the Supreme Entity applies His special power. This power takes the form of His Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti. He applies His special power in the world when rules and regulations no longer remain effective, when institutions and values crumble. The special advent of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti signifies that the human race will have a new awakening.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->When people are stricken with fear and despair about the future, when the society, country, and culture appear to be on the brink of disaster, then the time is ripe for the advent of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti. Through His special manifestation, Parama Purus&#x301;a will certainly save the society. Our only task is to move according to His guidance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->True human beings are those who move according to the natural impetus of time, space and person. They study their surroundings and the historical events which have caused the present, and the direction in which society should move in future. True human beings can discriminate between right and wrong, just and unjust. True human beings are sure that their goal is the Supreme Goal and they move towards it with steady untiring steps. Only when the true Goal is realized can we say that the auspicious dawn has come in life, and people are worthy to be called human beings. Those for whom the Supreme is not the ultimate desideratum of life, do not deserve to be called human beings in the strict sense of the term.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The innate characteristic of the human mind is that it requires physical objects (a&#x301;bhoga or physical pabulum) for the preservation of physical existence; subtle psychic objects (subtle pabulum) for satisfaction and expansion, and the greatest object of all, Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Goal of life (a&#x301;lambana or the Supreme Desideratum.) Physical objects are limited, for they exist within the periphery of time, space and person. Thus one day they will be totally exhausted. Something which is dear today will be despised tomorrow, and may be treated with indifference the day after tomorrow. An item of food which tastes delicious when it is fresh, may be totally unpalatable after a while. This is what usually happens in the mundane world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Suppose you are attending a party, and have a craving for more rasogollas but your stomach is so full that to eat another is a physical impossibility. You return home disappointed, for you think that had you eaten a few more you would have enjoyed the party even more. This is what happens with physical pabulum  &ndash; being limited it cannot provide unending satisfaction. But the flow of subtle psychic pabulum is endless. Because of its limitlessness, the human mind cannot accept it endlessly. After enjoying it for a while one becomes tired. This sort of pabulum can never provide one with supreme satisfaction or supreme development either. Hence we cannot call psychic pabulum the desideratum of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Something which we cannot accept permanently we may call pabulum, but the desideratum of the spiritual world should not be called pabulum because there is no one to enjoy the pabulum. What deserves to be called the desideratum? The desideratum can only be that Entity which remains unassailed by the three relative factors. Therefore the only desideratum is Parama Purus&#x301;a, for He alone remains beyond the periphery of time, space and individuality. The three relative factors are born after the process of metamorphosis begins from Shambu&#x301; Liun&#x32D;ga. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the only Absolute Entity; everything else is relative. So if one wants to attain the highest realm of existence one will have to transcend the domain of relativity, for everything relative, undergoes metamorphosis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Etada&#x301;lambanam shres&#x301;t&#x301;ametada&#x301;larnvam&#x301;an param<br>Etada&#x301;lambanam&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva&#x301; brahmaloke mahiiyate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->If the human mind has to accept something as its object, it should only accept Parama Purus&#x301;a, and nothing else. If it is to accept any entity without a second, then Parama Purus&#x301;a alone should be accepted. If any entity is to be known, then only Parama Purus&#x301;a should be accepted as the object of knowledge, and none else. Whatever is a desideratum is certainly a mental object. But the Cognitive Faculty is the subject, because He is witnessing everyone and everything. Whatever is being created is a different stage of creation. He is the subject and all other entities are His objects. He is the witnessing entity because He is the Supreme controller. Human beings are His object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Likewise when human beings accept Parama Purus&#x301;a as the polestar of their lives, then Parama Purus&#x301;a becomes the object and human beings become the subject. But how is that possible? When He is the Supreme Subject of all objectivities, then how can He be your object? He is the subject, you are His object. But at the same time no one except Parama Purus&#x301;a should be made the object of life. Nothing except the Supreme Entity is dependable &ndash; no one except Parama Purus&#x301;a deserves to be the goal of life. So what is the solution? Rationality proves that He is the subject of all objects; but on the other hand we find that only He should be made the object of life. But is that possible? Yes, it is.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Human beings work according to the divine plan and while working they take the name of the Lord. They ideate on Him and think internally, &ldquo; I am His object and He is my subject. He is seeing whatever I am doing.&rdquo; So He remains the subject throughout. When He is made an object it is for the purpose of ideation on Him. Moreover, there is an additional benefit: when I think I am His object and He is my subject, I cannot commit any wrong under any circumstances. His ever wakeful conscience will constantly warn me, &ldquo;What are you doing? He is watching you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Thus it is necessary to accept Him as your object and to accept Him as your object this method must be adopted. Consequently He will know all your thoughts and imaginations, all your words and actions. The unit being will remain ever aware of this fact. When someone argues among friends that there is no God, the Supreme Entity immediately hears it. Thereafter when that person becomes frightened on a lonely night and takes the name of the Lord, he confesses &ldquo;Oh Lord, you certainly know that to save my prestige amongst my friends I said that you do not exist. Those words were merely spoken with my mouth and do not represent my true feelings.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->What is the necessity of this hypocrisy? Each and every human being, consciously or unconsciously admits the presence of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Some people lie by saying that they do not accept Him, others tell the truth plainly by saying they do. To give recognition to a simple truth is the sign of courage. But by denying the existence of God one will have to apologise again and again to Him for this hypocritical behaviour. Why should one do that? Why should the educated, intelligent and enlightened people give indulgence to such hypocrisy? Rather, they should declare courageously, &ldquo;I am a child of the Supreme Being. I accept Him. He is the goal of my life. I shall proceed towards Him. Nobody on this earth can create an obstacle in my march towards Him. I will move towards Him drawn by the irresistible Cosmic attraction. This is my dharma &ndash; simple and straight-forward. This is my natural wont. Nothing can detract me from pursuing my innate characteristic.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;The Cardinal Spirit of Action and The Supreme Stance of Devotion&rdquo; (Karma-Sannya&#x301;sa and Para&#x301;bhakti).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is action or karma, and what is its cardinal spirit? The relative change of position of objects is termed karma. This karma can never be performed beyond the periphery of time, space and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The relative change of place of objects presupposes the very existence of time, space and person. This actional faculty is non-existent in the case of the Supreme Entity, because that Entity is beyond the scope of relativity. Now what do you understand by the expression, karma-sannya&#x301;sa? The word sannya&#x301;sa had been derived form sam&#x301; (or sat) plus nya&#x301;sa. The word sat refers to the unchangeable Entity. The word sannaya&#x301;sa implies one&#146;s total identification with that unchangeable Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now let us return to the interpretation of karma-sannaya&#x301;sa (cardinal spirit of action). According to some interpretations, it means total inactivity. Some are of the view that it signifies perfect completion of work. And others opine that unification with the Supreme Consciousness through karma is karma-sannya&#x301;sa.  Now let us judge who is the real agent of karma to attain its finality. As has been mentioned earlier, the periphery of knowledge is bound by the factors of time, space and person. Karma-sannya&#x301;sa is possible only when each factor of time, space and person comes within the scope of tactual relationship with the Subjective Bearing; that is, the time factor with the Eternal Entity, space with the All-pervading Entity and the personal factor with the Supreme Shelter. That is why Karma-sannya&#x301;sa cannot be termed merely as a medium of some kind of achievement; rather it is a state of supreme culmination.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now who is the doer of karma? We know that the range of action is limited within the arena of time, space and person. So there are two functional agents or doers of action: the microcosm on the one hand and the Macrocosm on the other. Apart from these two, no third entity can be of any relevance in the matter of attaining the proper finality of action. The awakening of psychic desire at any moment compels the physical body to be active, but the body is incapable of any function in the absence of an impetus from the mind. There are two reasons for this. First, there is always the attraction of the Cosmic Mind. Therefore if there is any command from the Supreme, the individual entity is bound to move. Secondly, the unit mind can direct the movement of any other entity in spite of its unwillingness. Hence an action is executed either by a unit mind or by the Cosmic Mind. The wind blows: wind is a blind force devoid of its own psyche. This wind is a material entity, but it moves due to the impetus from the Cosmic Mind. It is similar to that of a top spun by young boys. Boys cannot always spin the tops; they spin only when they are thrown in a particular way, in a perfect fashion, otherwise not. A top has no power to spin unless it is made to do so by a second entity. Likewise the sun is moving around its nucleus with its large family of celestial bodies under Divine inspiration. Hence all physical activities originate from the mind which is the prime mover of all actions. No action can take place without the impulse of mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Both the unit mind and the Cosmic Mind function within the bounds of time, space and person, but the difference between the two is that the unit mind may not necessarily consciously comprehend the function of Cosmic Mind, although it (the unit) comprehends on its unconscious level. And even what remains unknown to the unit mind is certainly known to the Supreme, because the Cosmic Mind maintains this cognizant bearing with its independent will. The function of the Cosmic Mind may or may not be prompted by any causes. Regarding the Macrocosmic function, it may be said that it may or may not take place within the relative factors of time, space and person. As long as the causal stance of the microcosmic function of Parama Purus&#x301;a remains within the scope of time, space and person, the unit may be graced with that very realization. But if the Supreme cause is beyond the periphery of time, space and person, it remains indiscernible for the unit mind. In that case the unit mind assumes everything to be a divine play.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->As the mind is the noumenal cause of action, so the latter is dependent upon the mind for its finality. It is said in Sam&#x301;skrta: Mana eva manus&#x301;ya&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; ka&#x301;ran&#x301;am bandha-moks&#x301;ayoh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now let us analyse how the mind functions. In the physical sphere energy is essential for action. What is energy? Energy is the actional state within a material structure. This energy by itself is a blind force and for its activation intellect must exist: a driver is required to direct this blind force. The support of the intellect is a prime necessity for the operation of energy in this material world. If an useful thing is kept easily accessible to the common people in a country or society, in most cases it is misused or spoiled. Those who are considerate and have the power of judgement should be entrusted with the responsibility of controlling the physical power of common people with their intellectual power, otherwise everything will be spoiled. It is like a bullock which, without a driver, is unable to decide whether to pull its cart towards the right or the left. Only a discriminating driver can control everything efficiently.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->As people, guided by their intellect, continue to gather practical experiences of the ups and downs of this world, they gradually start to realize that their psychic capacities are too inadequate to accomplish any great task. Then, faced with the stark realities of life, they realize that they have no alternative but to merge with the Supreme Consciousness. At that stage, whatever they do will have a cosmic support and will be genuine. That is why enlightened persons always prefer to remain unified with the Supreme Entity. This is considered the highest attainment of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Undeveloped human beings consider themselves to be very intelligent and thus at every step they invite innumerable obstacles in the material world. Later on, after climbing some rungs up the ladder of evolution, they realize form the core of their hearts the hollowness of their psychic capabilities. It is the natural rule of the universe that those who possess immense knowledge are quite conscious of their intellectual limitations, whereas people with superficial knowledge think just the opposite. The genuine way of learning for seekers of knowledge is to consider always that they know nothing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->One can execute some ordinary types of work with one&#146;s own little intellect. But if one aspires to undertake any noble ventures, then one has to unite one&#146;s own intellect with the Cosmic Intellect, and work with the help of the Supreme knowledge of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is the spirit of karma sannya&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now what is the method to merge the unit mind in the Cosmic Mind? As the basic trend of the evolutionary process is from the crude towards the subtle, therefore in order to make one&#146;s own intellect subtle, one is to take the ideation of the subtlest entity, not to remain engrossed in crude objects. With the constant ideation of the Supreme, the mind will gradually attain more and more subtlety and will ultimately be converted into the subtlest entity. After this the sense of separation in the microcosm ceases to exist, and it becomes one with the Cosmic Mind. When the unit intellect arrives at this highest point, there is no doubt that it has become one with the Supreme Intellect. This state of pinnacled intellect is called karma-sannya&#x301;sa. So wise people should be ever vigilant regarding karma-sannya&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->What is the relationship between karma-sannya&#x301;sa and para&#x301;bhakti? When the Supreme Consciousness remains in His unassailed state, in His original stance, He is called Para Brahma. But when that Para Brahma is transmuted into different ideas or objects, then that Supreme Consciousness is termed Apara Brahma. Attachment towards Apara Brahma is called apara&#x301;bhakti, and intense love for Para Brahma is called para&#x301;bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->What is knowledge? Knowledge is the subjectivisation of external objectivities. When external objectivities are not subjectivised, there occurs either internal or external reflection or refraction on the mental plate. This is nothing but the resultant of external or internal projections. This is not true knowledge, or direct knowledge; in fact, it is not knowledge at all but a shadow of knowledge. Those who only reach up to the range of reflection or refraction develop ego. But those who are truly learned are devoid of any ego, because they are well aware of the subjective cause of all external objectivities.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Self-realization is the only knowledge. All other types of knowledge are simply the umbra and penumbra of knowledge,&rdquo; because they do not contribute to any real understanding of objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->This self-realization does not consist of any subjectivisation because at this stage the external object, the mind and soul, all become one. Then knower, knowledge and the object of knowledge are all unified in he attainment of Supreme Oneness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->If a teacher of Bhopal city is asked, &ldquo;How many ants are there in the city?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How many bricks are there in the buildings?&rdquo; he or she will not be able to answer, because the external objectivities have not been subjectivised. When it is possible to do so, there is no necessity of reading books. Even without reading, people can form an exact idea about objects reflected in the a&#x301;tman. By knowing the objects reflected in the a&#x301;tman, they can get all the answers to the questions &ldquo;what&rdquo;, &ldquo;when&rdquo;, &ldquo;how&rdquo;, etc. This is true knowledge, everything else is the mere shadow of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The changes in psychic objects bring about a liberation from bondage of those factors which constitute the mind. Knowledge originates in the mind, but it culminates in supreme spirituality. Therefore the base of knowledge, like the base of action, is in the Self. Its origin is in the mind, but its culminating point is in the Self.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Now let us see what is para&#x301;-bhakti. When the Supreme Entity is not under the bondage of Prakrti, He is called Para Brahma; but when He comes under the bondage of Prakrti, He becomes finite and gradually is bound more and more by the gun&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Even great scholars know only a little; they cannot know everything, because they are not omniscient. The culmination of their learning is within the bondage of Prakrti; but the culminating point of their spiritual path is freedom from the bondage of Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->To understand the meaning of para&#x301;-bhakti, it is essential to know its supreme aim, because para&#x301;-bhakti is closely related to karma sannya&#x301;sa. Every action has its end, its objective. The movement towards such an objective has two trends which are known as a&#x301;tmanepadii and parasmaepadii. If a person is greatly attracted towards a limited object, his or her mind will rush towards that object, and when at last the mind attains it, it gradually becomes one with that object. At that time, action and knowledge vanish for they take the form of that object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->You may have noticed, for example, that when some learned people earn recognition or a high degree, they lose interest in even discussing the subject of their degree. Those who have aparabrahma (knowledge of the relative world) as their objective will try to achieve power and authority, and after acquiring them they often ignore the very work they had been doing so assiduously before. In many cases they start misusing their newly acquired power. This is a natural law. To prevent such a degeneration one most accept Parabrahma as the goal, and not aparabrahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Externally some people may render service to society, but internally they desire to become government ministers. Later, when they attain that coveted position, they give up social service entirely. This is a natural tendency of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->What is karma sannya&#x301;sa? It is to go beyond the dimensions of time, space and person. If aparabrahma is the aim of life, then knowledge and action decrease and human beings become crudified.  Karma sannya&#x301;sa is only possible for those people whose goal of life is Parabrahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->What is bhakti? When the mind leaves all objects of the world and races towards the Supreme Entity, that is known as bhakti.  When spiritualists move towards the Supreme Entity their minds are unknowingly and gradually transformed. A caterpillar does not know when it changes into a butterfly. Similarly, the mind of a spiritualist does not know how it changes; one day it simply realizes that it is not longer a unit mind. When one&#146;s individual and personal feelings are completely removed from the mind, at the moment one begins to advance, and the supreme state is attained. The spiritualist should adopt exactly the same sort of loving attitude as Parama Purus&#x301;a has for His children. By working according to the wishes of Parama Purus&#x301;a one can merge one&#146;s mind in Him. If, on the other hand, there is a gap between the wishes of the individual mind and those of the Cosmic Mind, then that individual moves far away from Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. The wish of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is to elevate His children, to love them and to care for them. You should also cultivate this kind of love towards society which is the offspring of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, and according to natural law, you will certainly attain this love, for it is totally natural. There is no other way to attain Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; than to render selfless service to the world. If people try to merge their minds in Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; and seek to become one with Him, or are able to bring their minds near to Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; and serve Him, then they can also attain Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Some people may say, &ldquo;It is not proper to be one with Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;; rather one should be with Him and serve Him.&rdquo;  Others say, &ldquo;The wishes of those who become one with Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; become one with His wishes. Such people perform all actions spiritually.&rdquo; Still others say, &ldquo;Those who love Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; also love His children, and serve them.&rdquo; Why should people think that they will become one with Parama&#x301;tma like that?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->My opinion is that it is proper for human beings to leave everything to Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, because those who are truly devotees know that Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is much wiser than they. This is what is known as pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;ta, and this is fulfilled by para&#x301;bhakti.  There is no alternative. Through para&#x301;bhakti, karma sannya&#x301;sa is also possible; hence karma sannya&#x301;sa is only possible for those who have acquired para&#x301;bhakti. Those who have attained para&#x301;bhakti will be great men and women of action. The strength of their devotion will establish them in their action, and this will benefit the world. Do a great deal of work and acquire much knowledge, but remember that establishment in karmasannya&#x301;sa and progress in the arena of knowledge is not possible without devotion.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Tantra it is said that if one is to practice sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (intuitional practice) the best thing to do is brahmasadbha&#x301;va. What is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; means a systematic and sustained endeavour through proper cultivation to be established in a particular vidya&#x301; or recognized branch of science. To practice dhya&#x301;na or meditation is also a process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The performance of all kinds of deeds is also a kind of sadhana&#x301;. The word sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is derived from the root verb sa&#x301;dh, which means to do something in a sustained way. The best kind of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, however, is ideation on Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->It is said that spiritual practice or Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the superior form of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The next best is the practice of concentration and meditation, even where there is no cosmic ideation. But when sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is based on the internal urge to attain the Supreme Entity, it is called Brahmasa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or absolute spirituality. In the absence of cosmic ideation spiritual practice cannot be called absolute. Where there is no internal urge to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a, the so-called spiritual practice or sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is nothing but the observance of a set of mechanical gestures and postures.<!-- /block --></p>

According to the Ananda Marga system of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, japa is sometimes dhya&#x301;na, and sometimes Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na. Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na is also a type of dhya&#x301;na. Some people chant &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; while counting [[on]] their fingers and at the same time do some other work. This is an example of japatapa (incantation). Stuh means eulogizing. Stuh is merely a way of flattering Parama Purus&#x301;a. For instance, if someone says to another, &ldquo;Your crown looks magnificent, your ear-rings are dazzling,&rdquo; and so on, these utterances are called stuti. Japa and stuti are inferior types of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; yielding no tangible benefit for spiritual aspirants.<!-- /block --></p>

Artisans use their knives and other tools to make images out of sand, clay, stone and metal according to their own imagination. Some images have ten hands, some have twenty hands, some have four hands. Each image holds different weapons in the different hands. How can these imaginary gods and goddesses, created by the fanciful imagination of human beings, ensure liberation or salvation to spiritual aspirants? Obviously they cannot because they depend for their very existence on the human imagination. Hence it is said that idol worship is the worst type of sa&#x301;dhana. Manasa&#x301; kalpita&#x301; murtrirnrn&#x301;a&#x301;m cenmoks&#x301;asa&#x301;dhanii. Let human beings create idols according to their fanciful imagination. A painter also creates pictures &ndash; but that is a different thing. Let there be the cultivation of sculpture and painting, but if the idols thus created are expected to grant salvation to spiritual aspirants, that is absurd. It is just like building an empire in one&#146;s mind and considering oneself to be the emperor of that imaginary empire. That is why it is said, Svapna labdhena ra&#x301;jyena ra&#x301;ja&#x301;no manava&#x301;stada&#x301;. People become the kings of their imaginary world.<!-- /block --></p>

Other people think that by standing knee-deep in water in the winter season they will attain virtue. It is sheer nonsense to expect emancipation in this way.

Na muktirtapana&#x301;ddhoma&#x301;dupava&#x301;sah shataerapi. There are some people who die after fasting for thirty or forty days.

By fasting for prolonged periods we simply invite physical trouble; by standing in icy water in the winter season people shiver with cold. At that time does the mind run towards Parama Purus&#x301;a or towards the freezing cold? The mind certainly thinks more about the discomfort, and the person decides to get out of the water and rub the body dry with a towel. The mind is more preoccupied with the discomfort than with salvation. The proper way to attain salvation is to ideate on Brahma. In the absence of deep love and longing for Parama Purus&#x301;a one cannot attain salvation. Judged in this light, idol worship is the worst sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The first and foremost attribute for liberation or salvation is the irresistible urge for God-realization. Exclusive devotion to Parama Purus&#x301;a is all that is needed; no external ritual has anything to do with liberation or salvation. People practice those things only for their self-satisfaction. The mind has a natural inclination to know more about the Supreme. But the difficulty is that the Entity which the mind yearns to know about, is beyond its very periphery. That is why the mind, while attempting to fathom Him, returns disappointed again and again.<!-- /block --></p>

How inadequate is the intellectual capacity of the human brain! It cannot understand the Supreme Entity, because whatever intellect the brain possesses functions within the periphery of time, space and person. It can never transcend the limitations of these relative factors: the moment it transcends them, it loses its individual identity. There is no other way to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a except through the exclusive urge for him, through a personal relationship with Him. Hence, human beings, discarding the vain effort to follow the path of argumentation and intellectuality, will have to resort to the path of devotion and intense longing for Parama Purus&#x301;a, the path of Supreme Singularity, rejecting the path of multiplicities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->What is the Supreme Entity? How should human beings try to understand Him? When a doll made of salt wants to fathom the depths of the ocean, the doll itself becomes lost in the ocean. Likewise, how far can human beings move with their limited intellect?

As soon as the butter is produced from the ocean the devotees consume it with relish. What do the philosophers do? They start conducting research on the inconsequential portion, the whey. They study the effect of whey on the human body, the liver, the kidney, and so on. They try to ascertain whether it should be eaten on a particular day.

If you create friction in your mind by adhering to truth and performing penance, the fire of meditation will ignite within. This will make it easier for you to realize the dormant Cognitive Faculty. Parama Purus&#x301;a or the Supreme Entity can only be realized through truth and penance, and when one has a one-pointed desire to realize Him. There is no other way. Without exclusive devotion to Parama Purus&#x301;a nothing can be attained. Mere philosophical knowledge will not help one to attain Him. A person may become a doctorate in twenty subjects, but that will not help him attain the Supreme. To attain Him one must cultivate one-pointed devotion for Him. Hence the most pedantic scholar may fail completely in attaining the Supreme Entity, whereas the most illiterate person may succeed. Parama Purus&#x301;a is not bothered about who is a great scholar or who is illiterate. He only considers the degree of one&#146;s mental elevation. Thus the only way to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a is to develop an exclusive devotion for Him by embracing a life of truth and regular penance. Those who try to know the Supreme Entity with their intellect may at best gain a superficial knowledge of Him &ndash; superficial because the mind can never reach Him.

He is always One without a partner. He is One and He will remain One forever. Deva is always One. Here Deva means the expression of the Supreme Occult Power. This expression is the hub of the cosmological order. All other expressions of the divine power have emanated from the Supreme Entity, Parama Shiva. We can easily perceive those individual divine vibrations because they come within the scope of our sense organs. But we can only perceive them partially, not fully. For example, we can only perceive a light wave within a certain range of wavelengths. If the wavelength of the light is beyond that range perception is impossible. That is why we cannot see an object in dim light, even though there is some light. And that is why our eyes are blinded by a strong light. Thus the eyes only have the capacity to function within a limited range. The same principle applies to sound waves. Our auditory organs cannot hear a soft sound and are deafened when a sound is too loud. Our sense organs function within the medium range of wavelengths.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The individual vibrations emanating from the hub of the cosmic order are called Deva (Daeva).

Even among these finite expressions of the Supreme Power there are many which do not come within the range of human perception. So human beings are only concerned with those particular expressions that come within the arena of their psychic and physical justification. These individual divine emanations have their corresponding vibration, form and colour. Some have their respective light waves and sound waves, which human beings can only perceive partially Animals have varying capacities to perceive light waves. Owls, for example, cannot see objects in the day time when human beings can see them, but they can perceive objects in a very dim light, which human beings are unable to do. Moles can also perceive objects in low light. There are many other such examples. Alphabets were evolved on the basis of vibrational sound expressions. Acoustic roots were also formed on the basis of various types of sound.<!-- /block --></p>

This Deva, that is Parama Deva or Parama Shiva, is the Supreme Source of all partial physical, psychic and spiritual emanations. He is the nucleus of the entire cosmos. Therefore, He is described as Eko Deva, the One Deva. The question arises, when the mind cannot reach Him, how can we justify using a numeral, which is a finite term, to describe Him? Numerals such as one, two, three, four, five, etc. are merely psychic concepts. So how can a numeral be used when the mind is unable to comprehend Him? Eka or one is a numeral Similarly aneka (many) is also a numeral. Now the reason why He can be described as Eka or One is that it is only when the mind becomes pinnacled or one pointed that a person can become one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>

So how can that mind know Him, how can it fathom His depths? I have already given the analogy of the salt doll which went to fathom the depths of the ocean. Before it could reach the bottom of the ocean it dissolved. Just as an ocean remains unfathomable to a salt doll, so the Supreme Entity remains inexplicable to the human mind.

No one is hated by Him, neither the most sophisticated person nor the most downtrodden, illiterate person. I have said before that those who believe in casteism, those who have divided the human society into countless segments, are the veritable enemies of society. Even this statement is not condemnatory enough about these people. Their actions reveal that they not only neglect Parama Purus&#x301;a, but actually hate Him. Those who believe in casteism are atheists. When all human beings are the progeny of the same Parama Purus&#x301;a, how can one accept the notion of caste?

<a name="4..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->He is Nirguna due to his innumerable qualities. Human beings must move towards Him, the Non-attributional Entity, if they wish to solve their problems. Human beings should direct all their life&#146;s longings and urges towards the Supreme One, and not towards the manifested entities. If the mind is directed towards multiplicities, all the psychic potentialities will be scattered like a packet of mustard seeds. The seeds &ndash; a packet contains a lot of seeds &ndash; should be thrown in a special way if they are to be picked up and put back in the packet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->In the same way all the urges and longings should be gathered together and directed towards the Supreme. If this is done indomitable psychic energy and invincible spiritual energy will grow from within. This will enable people to solve all the world&#146;s problems &ndash; economic, social cultural, big and small. Unless one develops oneself in this way, as an ideal human being, one will not be able to solve any problem, no matter how madly one beats one&#146;s chest or how loudly one shouts slogans. The solution should be commensurate with the problem just as the prescription should be commensurate with the disease. The present world is plagued with numerous problems. To solve these problems we need ideal men and women who are highly evolved from within; strong men and women whose lives are based on the solid foundation of spirituality. In the absence of such people the problems will remain unsolved. That is why I say, concentrate all your love and devotion, consolidate all your psychic propensities and channelize them towards the Supreme One. Don&#146;t allow them to flow towards any other direction, towards any other object.<!-- /block --></p>

Why? It is said that only the devotee realizes the Lord. The one who cultivates knowledge by studying the scriptures will say, &ldquo;The Lord belongs to all&rdquo;, but spiritual aspirant says, &ldquo;It is true that the Supreme Lord belongs to all, but only devotees can bind Him.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[This Atman or Self cannot be attained by giving learned discourses, nor by listening to pedantic discourses. Rather the Self is attainable by that spiritual aspirant to whom It manifests itself.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Through erudition, deep study, or intellectual cultivation, no one will ever attain the Supreme Entity. Human life is short. Within this short span of time human beings have much work to do. It is not advisable to waste one&#146;s valuable time in vain debate or fruitless study. Similarly, by giving lengthy discourses or by becoming profound scholars, no one can attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. The minimum qualification required to tread the path of spirituality is a pure heart. If one has a pure heart, this is sufficient.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The so-called scholars vainly think that when they can speak in calculated language and smile in a measured way they are superior to the common masses. But in my opinion, how much intellect can be contained in a small cranium? When people become insane, they are laughed at and teased by others. Similarly, when people grow old they lose their power of memory. To cherish the vanity of intellect is meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Some people think, &ldquo;Well, since I have listened to so many learned discourses I have nothing else left to do.&rdquo; If listening to learned discourses were sufficient, then the microphone I am using now certainly would have attained salvation, because it has heard many beautiful discourses. Listening to others&#146; discourses is not enough. It is only when He showers His grace upon one that one attains everything. No one can be a member of the inner circle of Parama Purus&#x301;a (Hariparimandal) by listening to many discourses. Only when one attains the minimum qualification, a pure heart, can one realize the true nature of Parama Purus&#x301;a. One can look upon Parama Purus&#x301;a as one&#146;s personal treasure only by virtue of devotion. A devotee can give up everything except Parama Purus&#x301;a, for He is the life of a devotee. If ever a devotee is separated from Him he win surely die. In this case a devotee is like a miser.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->How does Parama Purus&#x301;a manifest Himself to His devotees? Everyone longs to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a, but the problem is, how? The scriptures say,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->When the Supreme Operative Principle (Parama&#x301; Prakrti) functions through a certain structure, the energy functioning within that structure is called bala (energy). In the human being there are three kinds of energy: physical, psychic, and spiritual. Physical energy, by personal endeavour, can be converted into psychic energy, and psychic energy can be metamorphosed into spiritual vigour by virtue of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Spiritual power is the strongest. Those who are timid shout &ldquo;Non-violence! non-violence!&rdquo; at the top of their voice. All kinds of timidity should be swept away. This requires tremendous psychic energy, which depends on moral or spiritual force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The question is, how can one acquire such spiritual force? By sincerity, one can acquire psychic force, and through the practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one can acquire spiritual force. Those who are persistent in their endeavour do acquire psychic force. When one sits down to meditate after attaining that sort of psychic energy one easily acquires spiritual force. That spiritual force lies latent in you; it is not difficult to attain. You should ensure that the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you choose is not a defective one in which there is a mistake in the beginning, middle, and end. One should move ahead in one&#146;s mission after determining one&#146;s goal. Once the goal is fixed there remains almost no possibility, of error; hence you should always remember your goal. But once you fall into the trap of error it leads to danger. This is the reason why I advise people to remember their guru mantra, to always remain aware of the goal. The souls of those people who practice sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in this way enter the abode of Brahma. Persistent endeavour and practical cult are essential to reach the goal. Hence, in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one should remember two essential factors: constant awareness of one&#146;s goal, and persistent endeavour to attain that goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->During sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the spiritual aspirants should bear in mind that the Supreme Entity does not reside in any particular heaven or vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha, but remains with them at all times.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..14"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a resides in you, just as oil resides in the sesame seed, or butter in milk, or water in the river current, or fire in a flint.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a hears all your internal thoughts. Nothing is unknown to Him. He is like a tape recorder in your mind. You may be forgetful with the passage of time, but not Parama Purus&#x301;a. Oil resides in sesame, yet it is not visible. If you crush the seeds the oil comes out, and the remaining non-essential parts are discarded. For the attainment of Parama Purus&#x301;a an introverted mind is indispensable. In milk lies clarified butter or ghee: but the butter can only be had if the milk is churned. Likewise, Parama Purus&#x301;a lies hidden in the cavity of the human mind. If people roam around in the external world in search of Him, they will never succeed.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Perhaps the places of pilgrimage are full of polluted, murky water, infested with poisonous insects and worms. A dip in that water may cause skin disease. In that case a visit to a place of pilgrimage ultimately causes disease and suffering.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->What should be done by those who are virtuous at heart? They should take a holy bath in their own mind and discover the inner Place of pilgrimage, instead of wasting time and energy in bathing in external places of pilgrimage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The question of fasting (upava&#x301;sa) arises in this context. The Sam&#x301;skrta prefix upa means near. Upava&#x301;sa means sitting near. So upava&#x301;sa by connotation means sitting near Parama Purus&#x301;a as opposed to being extroversial. On the day of fasting people abstain from eating solid food. It is easier to concentrate the mind on those days than on other days. The meaning of the word anashana is &ldquo;not taking food&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->So you understand that it is not possible for people of static nature to attain liberation. Butter lies latent in cream and appears when the cream is churned. Parama Purus&#x301;a is like butter: He resides inside you, not outside. But instead of realizing this, people worship Parama Purus&#x301;a with flowers and wood-apple leaves. This is completely misleading. It is said in A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Pra&#x301;rthana&#x301;rcana&#x301;ma&#x301;traeva Brahmamu&#x301;lam: Prayer and worship are all misleading.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->If one removes the sand from a dry river bed, one will discover the flow of pure water. Here the sand symbolises impurity and the water represents Parama Purus&#x301;a. If you rub two flints together fire is produced: this fire represents Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is how you will attain Him &ndash; by doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->It has been said earlier that the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a is only showered on devotees. His grace is all that matters. It is true that the people of knowledge (jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis) and the people of action (karmiis) may labour harder, but it is the devotees (bhaktas) alone who attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. There are two major obstacles on the path of knowledge: lethargy and vanity. A vain person remains far away from Parama Purus&#x301;a. Of all the different types of lethargy, spiritual lethargy is the worst. Spiritual lethargy means not to sit for meditation regularly. Those with spiritual lethargy have time for all other actions, but for spiritual practice there seems to be no time. They say, &ldquo;It&#146;s already late today &ndash; I&#146;ll do a short meditation right now, and devote more time to sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; tomorrow.&rdquo; They sit attentively inside the cinema hall, but in dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; they feel sleepy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Let me tell you a story in this connection. Laks&#x301;man accompanied Ram and Sita to the forest. For a long period of fourteen years, his duty was to keep watch at all times. One day he felt sleepy, and dozed off. Suddenly he woke up and was about to shoot the Goddess of Sleep with his bow and arrow. She said, &ldquo;Laks&#x301;man, how unbecoming it is for you to do such a thing! People call you a great hero, but you are using your arrow against a woman.&rdquo; Laks&#x301;man replied, &ldquo;You know that I am on duty here, yet why have you come to trouble me?&rdquo; The Goddess of Sleep said, &ldquo;But it is also my duty to come and sit on your eyelids&rdquo;. After a long discussion they finally reached a compromise. They decided that after fourteen years, when Ramchandra would return to Ayodhya to ascend the throne, the Goddess of Sleep would sit on Laks&#x301;man&#146;s eyelids, because at that time he would have no more work to do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Fourteen years passed. It was the day of Ramchandra&#146;s coronation. Laksman was on duty. Suddenly Laksman felt extremely sleepy and was unable to prevent sleep from overpowering him. The Goddess of Sleep had not come alone &ndash; she was accompanied by a large retinue. Laksman felt embarassed. He thought, &ldquo;What a nuisance this sleep is! If I fall asleep now my elder brother will think that I&#146;m not interested in his coronation&rdquo;. But the Goddess of Sleep was adamant. Then Laksman said, &ldquo;Well, I understand your difficulty. But you should find another place to cast your spell. I suggest you go to a place where someone is delivering a spiritual discourse and sit on the eyelids of those in the audience who are impious.&rdquo; And since then, this tradition has been maintained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->One of the major defects of people of action is vanity. Devotees have no such defect &ndash; they work by virtue of their implicit devotion to Parama Purus&#x301;a. There is no room for lethargy in their lives. For devotees, Parama Purus&#x301;a is their controller &ndash; the machine operator &ndash; and they are mere tools in His hands. They think that if they do not do Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s work, then who else will do it? Thus devotees are greater than both jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis and karmiis, people of knowledge and people of action. People of knowledge seek their Lord in books and not through practical realization. The scriptures say,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..28"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Anubhu&#x301;tim&#x301; vina&#x301; mur&#x301;ho vrtha&#x301; brahman&#x301;i modate<br>Prativimbitasha&#x301;kha&#x301;graphalasva&#x301;danamodavat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..29"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->[Foolish people without any God-realization wrongly feel that they have attained Brahma; their elation is pure vanity. It is they who taste the reflection of a fruit in a pond and claim they have tasted the real fruit.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->People of knowledge do not enjoy the real fruits, they enjoy only their reflections. The Lord of the people of action is like a steamroller &ndash; an animate machine. Unless one is endowed with devotion, one cannot realize the Supreme Entity. Devotees feel that their Lord is their constant companion. They feel, &ldquo;I am one with Him&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->People of knowledge know that Parama Purus&#x301;a is beyond the scope of word and thought &ndash; ava&#x301;un&#x32D;manasogocara &ndash; and hence they can never reach Him. People of action are almost like mechanical objects. But the sole intention of the devotees is service to God. For this one will have to come in the close proximity to the Lord. One will have to touch Him. The sama&#x301;dhi of the people of knowledge is a theoretical sama&#x301;dhi, whereas the devotees&#146; sama&#x301;dhi is one of realization. Devotees are happy even when the Lord threatens to punish them because they know that the Lord cannot punish them without touching them. So punishment is also a kind of boon for them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->It is through service that devotees come in contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a. To render service to Parama Purus&#x301;a you should sing kiirtana loudly. This can be nicely illustrated with an analogy. Suppose a mother has three children &ndash; a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii, a karmii, and a bhakta. The jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii reasons, &ldquo;Mother is cooking in the kitchen. I will see her in my spare time.&rdquo; A karmii thinks, &ldquo;What&#146;s the necessity of meeting her? I will just try to satisfy her through service.&rdquo; But the bhakta, instead of thinking, will burst into tears. Parama Purus&#x301;a in the form of the mother will have to come close to the devotee. The bhakta applies his or her intelligence to come in contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a and attain Him. What is the relation between the devotees and their Lord? It is said in the scriptures,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Suppose there are two young boys &ndash; a prince and a farmer&#146;s son. The prince becomes a king, but the farmer&#146;s son merely plays the role of a king in a play. You are all the children of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and thus you are His princes and princesses. You should never allow any inferiority complex to dominate your minds. Always remember the Supreme Truth that you are the powerful and beautiful children of Parama Purus&#x301;a. You are destined to be victorious.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;To Know Him Is to Be Free from All Fetters&rdquo;. No living being in the world wants to he in bondage; the natural tendency of the human mind is to attain all-round emancipation. In all spheres of life &ndash; social, economic, psychic, intellectual and physical &ndash; human beings seek total freedom. If people do not want that freedom, it should be understood that they have lost their inner vitality, the pulse of life has stopped. Such people should have no place in a living society, rather they should reside in the funeral pyre of the burial ground. Now, the question is: how can one attain liberation from all bondages? Today&#146;s discourse is an attempt to answer that question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There is only one Entity who, when known, can give liberation to human beings, and that entity is Parama Purus&#x301;a. The scriptures say,<!-- /block --></p>

The power of perception of the human sense organs (indriyas) is very limited; they can function only within a certain limited range, and beyond, that they are ineffective. Where the indriyas fail to function, the buddhi or intellect takes over. But the intellect also functions within a limited range, although broader than than that of the indriyas. In the case of a very subtle or very crude object, the intellect also cannot function properly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of Su&#x301;ks&#x301;ma&#x301;tisu&#x301;ks&#x301;mam&#x301;? When an object is beyond the power of perception of the sense organs we call it su&#x301;ks&#x301;ma or subtle. That is, an object which the mind can conceive, but which the indriyas cannot perceive, is subtle. That which comes within the range of the sense organs is crude or sthu&#x301;la. And the object which is beyond the conceptual range of the mind is very subtle (su&#x301;ks&#x301;ma&#x301;tisu&#x301;ks&#x301;ma). Kalilasya madhye. The word kalila has a number of meanings. Here it means a very subtle portion of an object. When the human mind ceases to function it is suspended, it becomes ineffective. That state is called the liila, or divine game, of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Take the case of a tiny white ant: it is a very small creature, yet it too has a brain of its own through which it can think. Even in the case of a tiny white ant, the cosmic game of Parama Purus&#x301;a is equally operative. It is not that divine grace is limited only to the crude objects of the senses. Rather, His divine grace continues in the same way in subtle and very subtle objects. The numerous ways in which the divine game of Parama Purus&#x301;a is being played is simply beyond human imagination.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Vishvasya srast&#x301;a&#x301;. What do we mean by Vishva? We know that this vast creation, this quinquelemental universe, is created by the static principle of Prakrti. The very wont of the static principle is to bring everything within the bondage of limitations. Parama Purus&#x301;a created the universe with the help of the static principle of Prakrti. When He functions as a witnessing entity to this creation of the static principle, this quinquelemental universe, He is called Vishva. Now the question is, who has created Vishva, the witnessing entity? The answer is, He has created Himself, and as such He is caged Svayambhu&#x301; (self-created). Thus, in the very subtle sphere where the human mind fails to function, His divine game continues in so many ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There is a subtle difference between liila&#x301; and kriid&#x301;a. When the cause of an effect is easily discernible it is called kriid&#x301;a, but when the cause is unknown and only the effect is easily discernible it is called liila&#x301;. This creation is the liila&#x301; of Parama Purus&#x301;a because human beings do not know why He has created it. With the help of their intellect they are eager to know the cause of creation, but will they ever be successful in this quest? They want to solve the riddle of creation, but they have no notion about the cause. So whatever Parama Purus&#x301;a does is all His liila&#x301;, It cannot be called His kriid&#x301;a&#x301;. I have already said that when one discovers the relation between the cause and effect it is called kriid&#x301;a&#x301;, but when one can see only the effect and not the cause, it is called liila&#x301;. For human beings having only a small unit mind the creation is the liila&#x301; of Parama Purus&#x301;a, but to Him it is His kriid&#x301;a&#x301;. For instance, in the relative world wherever there is time, space, and person, and wherever the limited intellect can function, we can discover the cause behind every action. In this connection you remember the oft-quoted aphorism of Maras&#x301;i Kan&#x301;ada: Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;vat ka&#x301;rya&#x301;bha&#x301;va &ndash; &ldquo;Where there is no cause there is no effect.&rdquo; In the process of tracing the cause-effect relationship back to its original cause we arrive at the last stage. Beyond this stage action does not remain within the scope of time, space and person. Since the cause remains beyond the scope of the three relative factors, it does not also come within the periphery of mind. If the mind transcends the periphery of the relative factors it is automatically annihilated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->So the action which comes within the periphery of the mind but whose cause remains unknown is called the liila&#x301; of Parama Purus&#x301;a. But this cause, whether it remains within or without the periphery of the human mind, is clearly known to Parama Purus&#x301;a. The so-called scholars attempt to discover this cause, but in vain, because it remains beyond the domain of the first effect. Human beings can only try to imagine the cause but they will never come to a decisive conclusion about what it actually is. How can the unit mind conceive of something which is beyond the domain of mind? To attempt do so is a sheer waste to time. In spite of that intellectuals continue their vain attempts, because it is their ingrained habit. But the truth remains forever unknown to them. They can only realize the truth when their minds reach the abode of truth, but in actuality the mind can never reach that abode.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->True devotees never vainly discuss anything. They know that to debate something which is beyond the scope of the mind is a waste of time. Devotees are the wisest people; the pundits are foolish. Pundits foolishly waste their time trying to know something which is beyond the periphery of the mind. Devotees, on the contrary, try to make the best use of their time. They are well aware of their relation to Parama Purus&#x301;a; they know that He is their Creator, and they are His creation. So the relation between the devotee and His Lord is one of creation and creator. This inseparable relation of Creator-creation has been mentioned in the sloka: Vishvasya Sras&#x301;ta&#x301;ramkanewaru pam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->It is a very personal and familiar relationship. Parama Purus&#x301;a is not a judge, nor are the individuals the accused. The relationship between Parama Purus&#x301;a and the unit beings is a sweet and familiar one. The devotees remind the pundits that their attempts are exercises in futility, and declare unambiguously that they belong to Parama Purus&#x301;a, and Parama Purus&#x301;a belongs to them. I told you something in Calcutta about the word Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; is derived from the San&#x301;skrta word Vapra. Vapra-Bappa&#x301;-Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. Vapra means &ldquo;dear&rdquo;. Parama Purus&#x301;a is dear to one and all, and so human beings call Him Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. Likewise, all created beings are dear to Parama Purus&#x301;a, so to Parama Purus&#x301;a all the created entities are Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. This is an unusual relationship. When the devotees sing Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; Na&#x301;m Kevalam, Parama Purus&#x301;a also sings Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; Na&#x301;m Kevalam. This means that Parama Purus&#x301;a exists because devotees exist, and devotees exist because Parama Purus&#x301;a exists. Their relationship is interdependent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->You all know that there is an old conflict between the devotees and the Lord. The devotees say to the Lord, &ldquo;You are great &ndash; You are our life&rdquo;. To this the Lord replies, &ldquo;You are great; you are My very life. I exist because you exist&rdquo;. Who is greater &ndash; the devotees or the Lord? Since time immemorial this conflict has been going on, and will continue for eternity. It will never have any satisfactory solution. Hence the devotees advise the pundits not to waste their valuable time. Human beings come on this planet for seventy or eighty years at the most. If they waste their valuable time in fruitless debate, when will they do their real work? &ldquo;Art is long, life is short&rdquo;, says the old proverb.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The devotees claim that the pundits are mistaken. Before the universe was created Parama Purus&#x301;a was completely alone. Just think of a vast universe where there are neither stars, nor comets, nor satellites, but only one Entity &ndash; Parama Purus&#x301;a. If you remained so completely alone, how would you feel? I am sure you would go mad. Well, Parama Purus&#x301;a was in a similar situation. He had the power to speak, but there was none to hear. He had the power to laugh, but there was no occasion for laughter. He could not even cry, or scold anyone. Just think what a terrible situation He was in. Hence to perpetuate His eternal divine game &ndash; to speak, to laugh, to teach, to scold, to instruct &ndash; He manifestated Himself in numerous ways. This is, in brief, the contention of the devotees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Not only has Parama Purus&#x301;a created the most complex entities out of Supreme Singularity, He has created the tiniest of objects too; so He understands the pains and pleasures of both. He shares their joys and sorrows. If some people think that they are insignificant, illiterate, poor people, and their Parama Purus&#x301;a does not take care of them, they are entirely mistaken. This is not possible, because from the largest to the tiniest everything is within His vast mind. Everything originates from Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Sama plusina&#x301; sama mashakena sama na&#x301;gena<br>Sama ebhistribhirlokaeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->To Parama Purus&#x301;a a small white ant and a mosquito have equal importance. The huge mammoth and the three worlds also are equally important to Him. How vast are the three worlds in comparison to a tiny white ant! But to Parama Purus&#x301;a both are equally significant. That is why I want you to remember always that none of you are petty or unimportant in the eyes of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Under no circumstances can you be insignificant to Him. All of your feelings and longings, all your mental thought-waves, in fact, everything emanates from Parama Purus&#x301;a. He is One, but His manifestations are manifold, unending. His playful expressions are multifarious.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Agniryathaeko bhuvane pravis&#x301;t&#x301;o<br>Ru&#x301;pam&#x301; ru&#x301;pam&#x301; pratiru&#x301;pam jaga&#x301;ma<br>Ekastha&#x301;h sarvabhu&#x301;ta&#x301;natra&#x301;tma&#x301;<br>Ru&#x301;pam&#x301; ru&#x301;pam&#x301; pratiru&#x301;pa vahishca.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Fire is one, but when it spreads to various objects it becomes numerous. Likewise, the One Supreme Entity becomes many when He expresses Himself externally in numerous entities&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->You can certainly claim that the One and the many are mere psychic distortions, the result of psychic assimilation and externalization. &ldquo;One&rdquo; is a particular number, &ldquo;two&rdquo; is also a number, &ldquo;many&rdquo; is another number. One may also be called many, because we arrive at many by adding many ones together. But in the case of Parama Purus&#x301;a, which number should we use? The word &ldquo;one&rdquo; is a psychic creation. The same is the case with the word &ldquo;two&rdquo;. All are the creations of the mind. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is not a creation of the mind. So how can we use the term &ldquo;one&rdquo; to describe Him? We can say one for a unit, but what about Him? Until our mind merges in Parama Purus&#x301;a, we cannot attain Him. To attain Him the mind must become one-pointed and directed solely towards Him. Thus if any number is to be used to describe Parama Puras&#x301;a, only the number one is suitable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Vishvasyaekam&#x301; parives&#x301;t&#x301;ita&#x301;rani. Parama Purus&#x301;a manifests Himself in numerous ways through each and every object of this universe, but His manifestation is not confined to unit beings and the observable universe alone. His existence extends beyond that. In other words, His divine game is not limited to you alone &ndash; it extends beyond that, and continues for eternity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva&#x301; shivam&#x301; sha&#x301;ntimatyantameti. Parama Purus&#x301;a is Shiva. By knowing Him human beings can attain absolute peace. The word sha&#x301;nti is derived from the Sam&#x301;skrta root verb sham plus suffix ktin. Sha&#x301;nti means to remain absorbed in one&#146;s own self. One can attain equanimity and equipose of mind by knowing Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is what is called sha&#x301;nti. Parama Purus&#x301;a is addressed as Shiva. Shiva is also called the Cognitive Faculty (Citishakti); that is, Shiva is also a kind of force or Shakti. In ordinary terms what we call Shakti is Prakrti. So Parama Purus&#x301;a is Citishakti and Prakrti is His imminent power. Only if Citishakti permits it can the binding faculty of Prakrti influence Him. But if the Cognitive Faculty does not desire it, the Operative Force of Prakrti is helpless. Then Shiva remains dormant in His unmanifested stance. We witness the manifested state when the Cognitive Faculty permits the Operative Force to operate. So when someone attains freedom from bondage it means he or she is freed from the bondage of the Operative Principle, and is thus established in the Cognitive Faculty. This is why it is said, Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva&#x301; shivam&#x301; sha&#x301;ntimatyantameti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->It is also said, Ana&#x301;dyanantamakhilasya madhye vishvasya&#x301; sras&#x301;t&#x301;ramanekaru&#x301;pam&#x301;. He not only manifests Himself in the very subtle universe; He is equally beginningless (an&#x301;adi), endless (ananta), and unbarred (akhila).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of akhila? Khila means &ldquo;bolt&rdquo; or &ldquo;shutter&rdquo;. Anything which does not have a bolt or shutter is called akhila or nikhila. For India as a whole we say akhila bha&#x301;rata. For the Sam&#x301;skrta word va&#x301;ra the English equivalent is &ldquo;check&rdquo;. The English word &ldquo;bar&rdquo; carries the same meaning also. For instance, the word Va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asi, according to popular belief, means a place where anas or rebirth is checked or prevented.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Ana&#x301;di. This universe is both beginningless and endless. Parama Purus&#x301;a manifests Himself in subtle forms, but He also manifests Himself in infinite ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Deva. Parama Purus&#x301;a is called Deva. All other entities are not exactly Deva, but are the expressions or creations of Deva. Numerous waves are always emanating from Parama Purus&#x301;a, each wave flowing with a particular speed and wavelength. In common parlance each of these waves is called Deva, but actually they are not Deva because their source or origin is Parama Purus&#x301;a. Every vibration of the universe is called Deva; and the, source of a devas is, called Maha&#x301;deva. So, in reality, who is Deva? He is none other than Maha&#x301;deva. The rest of the so-called devas are merely His reflections. Who is a deva? Sarva dyotanatmakah akhan&#x301;d&#x301;acidaekarasa: the Entity who radiates innumerable vibrations out of His infinite body, whose tendency is to other than Maha&#x301;deva. The rest of the so-called devas are merely called Deva. He is cidaekarasah. Cit means Cognitive Flow, ekarasah means unbroken flow. So cidaekarasah means the singular unbroken flow of consciousness. In this sense only Parama Purus&#x301;a is Deva, and no one else.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The Entity whose vibration vibrates the whole universe, whose effulgence illumines every other entity, from whom all other entities emanate, and in whom all other entities culminate, is the true Deva. All other deities are engaged in the service of the Supreme Deva. Hence He is the God of all gods, the Deva of all devas, that is, Maha&#x301;deva. By knowing Maha&#x301;deva all the binding fetters are removed forever. Here the fetters (pa&#x301;shas) mean all the physical, psychic and spiritual fetters. In the narrow sense pa&#x301;sha means the eight pa&#x301;shas.<!-- /block --></p>

Sometimes it refers also to the fifty psychic propensities (vrtti) of the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Only by knowing this Deva or Parama Purus&#x301;a can human beings attain emancipation from all sorts of bondages. There is no other way to emancipation. To know Him means to merge the unit mind into the Cosmic Mind. Human beings can become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a with the help of their unit consciousness. Only when they attain this stage can they realize that there is no difference between the microcosm and the Macrocosm; that is, knowledge, knower and known lose their individual existences. The knower and knowable become practically one, and the connecting link between the two, that is, knowledge, stands nullified. At this stage there remains no bondage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Ana&#x301;dyananta: ana&#x301;di and ananta. If there is any Primordial Entity it must have its starting point as well. If there is a starting point it must exist in a certain place, and it must have its culminating point also. If the starting point is located at a certain place, the culminating point must also be located in a certain place. If there is a starting point and a culminating point, there must be a middle point also. For these three reasons each and every entity comes within the scope of time, space and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->When one knows Parama Purus&#x301;a, the creator of the starting point, the middle point, and the culminating point, one is free from the temporal, spatial and personal factors. One is liberated from the influence of the binding faculty as the Supreme operative Principle gradually wanes. Hence, regarding Prakrti it is said, Prakrtih sa&#x301; nitya nivrtta&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;Prakrti is the entity that undergoes constant waning.&rdquo; By constant ideation Prakrti ultimately dissolves Herself in Parama Purus&#x301;a. Just as Prakrti is merged in Purus&#x301;a under certain conditions, sa&#x301;dhakas also become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a when liberated from the bondages of the Operative Principle. They attain salvation when Prakrti becomes one with Parama Purus&#x301;a in the process of gradual waning. The very wont of the microcosms is to attain liberation by snapping all their fetters. The only way to do that is to come within the shelter of Parama Purus&#x301;a. There is no other way &ndash; Na&#x301;nya pantha&#x301; vidyate yana&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
