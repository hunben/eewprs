<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The discourse is on &ldquo;Microvitum, the Mysterious Emanation of Cosmic Factor.&rdquo; It is one of the human wonts that whatever we do not know, in order to conceal our limitations or hide our imperfections, we either say that it is non-existent, or in a more intelligent style, we will say it is [[an]] abstract. In this universe of ours, whatever comes within the scope of our senses or within the periphery of our perception, we say, &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; and whatever is beyond the arena of the senses or the jurisdiction of perception, we cannot say anything. Hence, our world functions within the limitations of our senses and perceptions. We know in the realm of Cosmic introvert [[or extrovert that]] in the first phase &ndash; that is, in the phase of extrovert &ndash; &ldquo;subtle&rdquo; is transmuted into &ldquo;crude&rdquo;, and in the returning phase of introvert, &ldquo;crude&rdquo; is metamorphosed into &ldquo;subtle&rdquo;. In this progress, rather in this semicircular approach, there may be subtler objects in the scope of matter &ndash; many objects subtler than electrons or protons, [neutrons] or positrons &ndash; but we find no alternative but to say that they are either electron or proton or positron or neutron. And similarly, in the psychic sphere there may be entities subtler than ectoplasm or its extra-psychic coverage, endoplasm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There are entities which come within the realm of both physicality and psychic expressions which are smaller or subtler than atoms, electrons or protons, and in the psychic realm may be subtler than ectoplasm. For such objects or for such entities I use the term &ldquo;microvitum&rdquo;. This microvitum, or in plural microvita, are not of protoplasmic order, and as such they have got little to do with carbon molecules or carbon atoms, which are treated as the initial points or initial stage of life in this universe. So far as physicality is concerned, the position of these microvita is just between ectoplasm and electron, but they are neither ectoplasm nor electron.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It is a human wont that whatever we know regarding any subject or any object, when we know that it exists but its characteristics or other particulars are not known to us, we say [[it is]] &ldquo;mysterious&rdquo;. So regarding these microvita, we may say it is mysterious. That is why I used the term &ldquo;microvitum, the mysterious emanation of cosmic factor&rdquo;. They are not of protoplasmic order, and hence the question of their protozoic structure or metazoic structure does not arise. They are something mysterious.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, these microvita are not of the same density or the same subtlety. Some of them [[may]] come within the range of a highly developed microscope; and some of them may not come within the range of a microscope, but by their actional expression or through their actional faculty or as a result of their actional vibrations, they may come within the scope of our perception. They are of subtler order. There may be still more subtle forms of microvita which may not come directly within the scope of our perception but may come within the scope of a special type of perception which is actually the reflection of conception within the range of perception in a limited sphere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So these microvita may be broadly divided into three categories &ndash; first, those coming within the scope of [[a microscope]]; secondly, those not coming within the scope of a microscope but coming within the scope of perception as a result of their expression, as a result of their actional vibration; and thirdly, those not coming within the scope of common perception but coming within the scope of a special type of perception which is actually the reflection of conception within the periphery of perception. Such perception &ndash; that special type of perception &ndash; may be felt or realized by persons having highly developed minds, having spiritually oriented minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Regarding these microvita of crude order which may come within the scope of a microscope, people give them the name &ldquo;virus&rdquo;. They say, &ldquo;This disease is of virus origin.&rdquo; But virus is a vague term. The better term will be microvitum, and not virus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now, these microvita move throughout the entire universe, from one celestial body to another. They move everywhere, crossing the boundaries of nebulae, piercing through milky ways, galaxies, stars, satellites, planets and meteors. Like  other psychic and psycho-physical beings,  they have also got basic characteristics &ndash; such as existing,  multiplying and dying.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> They move unbarred, without caring for the atmospheric conditions or barometric readings. How do they move? Everybody requires some media for movement. Mobility means movement through a medium or media. There may be more than one medium, that is, there may be many media at a time in the same movement. These microvita also move through several media. They move through sound. The so-called virus of a diseased person [[may]] move through his or her sound. They may move through tactuality. They may move through forms or figures. In the case of some of the diseases, the disease spreads through the smell of the disease, and in the case of subtler [[metavita [microvita]]], they may move through ideas. A particular idea may get accelerated [[speed]] in a particular planet with the help of a few conceptually developed minds. That is, a great man with a great conceptually developed mind may spread his ideas with the help of these microvita throughout that planet, or even throughout this universe in different celestial bodies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now, what is the root cause of this universe? Which is the starting point of life or vitality? These microvita are the carriers of life in different stars, planets and satellites &ndash; not carbon atoms or carbon molecules. These living creatures with their mysterious movement create minds and bodies, living bodies in different celestial bodies, and they also destroy minds and physical bodies, or developed or undeveloped corpor, in any corner of this universe. So the root cause of life is not the unicellular protozoa or unit protoplasmic cell, but this unit microvitum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, there should be extensive research work regarding this microvitum or these microvita. Our task is gigantic and we are to start our research work regarding these microvita immediately without any further delay, otherwise many problems in modern society will not be solved in a nice way. As Prama&#x301; [equilibrium and equipoise] is an essentiality in the field of intellectuality or intellectual pursuit, similarly in the higher intellectual realm research work on these microvita is extremely necessary. Here we should again remember the fact that these microvita are [[a]] creation in the internal phase, rather in the returning phase of cosmic expression. We are human beings with developed intellect. I think, rather I hope, rather I am sure that the day is sure to come when human beings will have proper control over these microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In ancient times, regarding the singular or collective structures of these microvita, the ancient rs&#x301;is [sages] said that they are of seven types, of seven species, and gave them the names: yaks&#x301;a, gandharva, vidya&#x301;dhara, kinnara, siddha, prakrtiliina and videhaliina according to the nature of their subtlety or the nature of their crudeness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->I think, by dint of our spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, rather our physico-psycho-spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, our minds will develop in all [[their]] strata, and the power of conception, the power of conceiving, will also develop, and with that developed conceiving power, we will know all the secrets of these microvita.<!-- /block --></p>

The form they have at the time of their birth undergoes a radical change. The changes in their forms and sizes take place stage by stage. These stages of metamorphosis are  not the same in all cases. As unicellular creatures, they divide their nuclei and multiply into two or more forms. They have no sex difference and thus there is no distinction between ovum and spermatozoa. These are the creatures  of the primordial stage of creation in this expressed world. But  all the creatures of this group are not of the same type &ndash; some are born from eggs, subsequently taking the form of larvae which undergo external metamorphosis, and acquire their final form as flying creatures. As they have  an orderly growth divided into subsequent stages, they are called &ldquo;krimi&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is worth mentioning that microvita do not belong to the category of krimi. However, like krimi and all other organic and psychic  beings, microvita exist, multiply and die. But unlike krimi and other organic and psychic beings, they are not directly related to carbon atoms or carbon molecules.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Krimi can only survive in certain temperatures and under specific barometric conditions. If there is an extreme temperature or air pressure variation, they will perish. But the jurisdiction of microvita is far greater than that &ndash; they are not subjected to barometric conditions. Krimis live, grow and decay within the scope of the five fundamental factors, whereas the cruder variety of microvita function within the realm of the five inferences. Due to adverse temperatures and barometric conditions, no creatures can go to other planets under normal conditions. Unicellular creatures, however, have some advantages in  this regard. Depending upon their shapes and sizes, krimis can live in stones or any other solid matter, but they normally remain in water and other subtle fundamental factors. For this reason, human beings must ensure that their water and air remain pure. The purity of the Earth should never be neglected. As a  result of air and water pollution, the number of these types of krimi &ndash; particularly disease carrying germs and bacteria &ndash; is on the  constant increase and getting beyond the control of human  beings. The use of pesticides and germicides may be increased, but if the noumenal cause for  disease is not found, and if the degree of pollution continues to increase at the same speed as today, a day is sure to come when the polluted earth, water and air will be the cause of the collective death of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Microvita have no direct relationship to pollution, however they do have an indirect relationship. Even if the earth, air and water are not polluted, microvita will still be produced. Microvita of [[subtler varieties and of the subtlest variety]] may function within the scope of the crude [[mind]] (the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a). [[Collective]] good thoughts can check the flow of negative microvita. For this, mental and physical development is indispensable in collective life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Intellectually and spiritually advanced people, through their thoughts, can destroy or resist the movement of enemy microvita, but if sinful people continue to create newer and newer microvita in their psychic sphere, there will always remain the possibility of the creation of subtler forms of negative microvita.

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>Krimishatru/krimiripu</b>. The meaning of the term is &ldquo;ghor&#x301;anim&rdquo; or &ldquo;maha&#x301;nimba&rdquo; [&ldquo;margosa&rdquo;].  In the world there are different varieties of margosa.  Some are very bitter, some less bitter and some are not bitter at all (such as curry leaves). In certain regions of India where [[cassia trees]] do not grow, people use curry leaves instead of [[cassia]] leaves.  The variety of margosa mainly found in India is margosa indica.  This variety of margosa is used as a bitter food or bitter medicine. In the spring, margosa leaves are a highly beneficial medicine.  They serve as an antidote to skin diseases, remove poison from the blood and function as blood purifiers.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->As a medicine, margosa indica has both external and internal applications.  The juice of margosa leaves may be used as a poultice or bandage on an affected  part of the body.  Margosa oil, margosa ghee and margosa juice are extremely good medicines for skin disease.  The oil extracted from margosa seeds is also a very good medicine.  The margosa fruit is also used as food by birds and poor people.  The most bitter variety of margosa available in India is called &ldquo;ghoranim&rdquo; in Bengali, &ldquo;bakayan&rdquo; in Urdu and &ldquo;maha&#x301;nimba&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta.  The margosa tree is quite large, the leaves are pointed and the fruits are round. The medicinal value of the most bitter variety is immense, but it should not be used as a food because it is extremely bitter. If margosa is used excessively or taken continuously for many days, it may cause blood dysentery.  Just as pigeons and sparrows are attacked with blood dysentery after eating wheat grains continuously for several days,  maha&#x301;nimba also causes blood dysentery in human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The air of the margosa tree destroys the harmful effects of bacteria. It can also fight against negative microvita. This is the reason why margosa is also recognized as one of the five sacred trees (pain&#x32D;cavati). In olden days, people liked to perform spiritual practices sitting in an environment free from the pernicious effects of disease and germs.  That is why they would plant pain&#x32D;cavati &ndash; nimba&#x301; (margosa), bilva (wood apple), shalmali (silk cotton tree), bat (banyan indica) and ashvatha (Indian fig tree) &ndash; in and around the place of meditation or spiritual practice. Some people of course use a&#x301;mlakii (wood sorrel) as a substitute plant.  In pain&#x32D;cavati, maha&#x301;nimba may be planted instead of ordinary margosa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><b>Krimisamkosa</b>. Krimi + sam &ndash; kosha&#x301; = krimisamkosa. One can spell this word with either &ldquo;sha&rdquo; or &ldquo;sa&rdquo;. Krimisamkosa means &ldquo;a kind of epidemic which causes large scale destruction to plants and trees&rdquo;, or it may also mean &ldquo;the type of bacteria that causes the epidemic&rdquo;. Epidemic plant diseases are the worst enemies of plants and trees. Once an epidemic breaks out, farmers become extremely helpless and frustrated because there are very few medicines which can completely or successfully eliminate it. Banana plants, potatoes and egg plants are affected most by epidemic diseases.  Effective, high quality medicines may be used in such an epidemic, but in the absence of such medicines, two to three feet of the diseased part of the plant should be cut off and burnt to ashes some distance away, and the ashes should be buried under the earth. The diseased parts should not be burnt in the same place where the epidemic first broke out. It may be that the epidemic is caused by a variety of microvita which are not easily destroyed by the normal heat of fire. In an area or tree prone to disease, insecticide should be used once before and once after the flowering of the plant. This will greatly reduce the possibility of an epidemic attacking the plants.<!-- /block --></p>

This kind of smell is also emitted from unclean bodies or the bodies of those people who do not bathe regularly. Those who consume a lot of static food also emit this sort of foul smell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Those who have excessively mean propensities also develop this kind of repulsive odour due to the defects in their hormones.  In fact, smell particles are formed out of the hormones secreted from the various glands.  Similarly, an intensely foul smell is emitted from the bodies of tigers because they are carnivorous. Although cats belong to the tiger family, they are partly vegetarian, so there is less foul smell in their bodies. The foul smell particles of some plants work as medicine in other bodies. The indigenous American Indians did not like to eat tomatoes because of their foul smell, although they fed them to their domestic animals. They would only eat tomatoes when they were sick. If the foul smell can be removed from tomatoes through scientific culture, a major change in the qualities of the vitamins may take place. Soybeans also have an unpleasant smell, and for this reason they are not very popular in India. If the repulsive smell of soybeans is removed, then a major change in their qualities will take place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If you happen to pass an abattoir or some temples, you will invariably experience a kind of repulsive smell which is not exactly a stinking smell. The testes of a billy-goat produce a kind of foul smell that spreads throughout its body. Consequently, it is extremely difficult to go close to an adult billy-goat. A hilsa fish (an Indian herring) is extremely fond of flesh &ndash; rotten flesh is its favourite food &ndash; hence it produces a kind of repulsive secretion. If a fish bowl or container which held hilsa fish is cleaned with a cloth, and the cloth is used to clean another container, a  repulsive smell will be emitted from the second container unless it is properly ventilated. A vegetarian will feel uncomfortable if this container is used for eating, drinking or anything else. Strict vegetarians avoid using any container which has been used to hold non-vegetarian food. [[Hilsas, sharks and crocodiles all emit the same type of foul smell, and for almost the same reasons.]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Another meaning of the word &ldquo;khara&rdquo; is &ldquo;a rotten smell or a stinking smell&rdquo;. One will experience this kind of smell if one walks by a place where animal corpses are dumped. When a dead body is left exposed for more than twenty-four hours, germs which decompose the body set in. These so-called germs are in fact negative microvita. The slightest contact with these negative microvita is extremely pernicious for most creatures. However, for those creatures  whose physical structure contains more powerful negative microvita, rotten flesh or rotten fish is not as harmful as is it for other creatures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Milk is turned into curd through microvita.  For about forty- eight hours, these microvita remain in positive form. But if curd remains exposed to heat for more than forty-eight hours, then the positive microvita decompose and change into negative microvita. This is why curd can be eaten up to forty-eight hours after it has become ready for consumption.  Later, when the curd emits a rancid smell, it is unfit for human consumption because it is infested with negative microvita.  As long as there are positive microvita in curd, it is more useful and nutritious than milk.<!-- /block --></p>

One category functions within the world of perception through inferences such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell, and the other category functions directly within the subtler realm &ndash; that is, within the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Those microvita which do not come within the scope of a microscope but come within the scope of inferences are known by their collective form and are called &ldquo;yaks&#x301;as&rdquo;. As they are perceived through  inferential vibrations, their field of action is the human mind. They are instrumental in arousing the propensity to accumulate more and more wealth. Although this propensity has some spatial and personal necessity, it is mostly a psychic ailment. In most cases, this psychic ailment aroused by yaks&#x301;as is more fatal than the diseases called &ldquo;yaks&#x301;ma&#x301;&rdquo; (such as tuberculosis or consumption). It has produced extremely fissiparous tendencies in human society, and has lead to the exploitation of one group of human beings by another group who feel elated to hear the lamentations of others. The overwhelming urge to acquire wealth &ndash; the urge for capitalism and the capitalist structure &ndash; is based on this psychic ailment. It gives rise to the all-consuming and insatiable greed of capitalists. The collective name of the microvita which produce this disease in the human mind, in the human psyche, is called &ldquo;yaks&#x301;a&rdquo;. When a person devoid of any ideology becomes engrossed in the thought of accumulating wealth, yaks&#x301;as begin their frenetic dance in his or her mind. These yaks&#x301;as are one of the seven types of devayonis (the others are gandharva, kinnara, vidya&#x301;dhara, videhaliina, prakrtiliina and siddha) which are the collective names of different categories of microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Gandharva microvita are the collective name of those microvita which arouse love for the fine arts in the human mind. They inspire people to cultivate the fine arts. They intoxicate the human mind and keep it absorbed in the rhythm and ideation of music and dance so that the thought of the external world gets suspended in the world of subtle ideation. The fine arts are known as &ldquo;gandharva vidya&#x301;&rdquo;. When the human mind is exclusively preoccupied with ideating on music and dance, it means that the mind stuff has been totally captivated by these gandharvas. They connect the material  world with the world of subtle ideation. This category of microvita functioning within the human mind are mostly of a friendly nature. They convey messages of the subtle world to human ears in this physical world, and by removing the darkness of crude ignorance, illuminate the  human mind with a flood of divine effulgence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Kinnara microvita is that category of microvita which creates a thirst for beauty &ndash; a strong desire for beautification and decoration. The word kinnara means &ldquo;receptacle of beauty&rdquo; or &ldquo;a beautiful and graceful structure&rdquo;. This category of microvita creates a tendency in the human mind to make the  human body as beautiful as the many forms and figures it observes in the external world. This tendency or propensity is called &ldquo;kinnari vrtti&rdquo;. If the kinnaras direct the mind towards crude matter instead of leading it towards the subtler layers, they are considered to be enemy microvita or negative microvita. And if the same microvita lead the mind towards purity and beautification, and then help merge the refined mind in the Supreme Entity, they are considered to be friend microvita or positive microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Next is vidya&#x301;dhara microvita, the collective name of those microvita which create  a deep urge in the human mind  to attain good qualities. Due to their internal urge and inspiration,  human beings are able to acquire a vast wealth of accumulated qualities. If this urge is directed towards performing noble deeds and praising the divine qualities of Parama Purus&#x301;a, then these microvita become instrumental in promoting human welfare and may be considered as friend microvita. If the same microvita create a tendency in the human mind to seek material gain such as name, fame, etc., they are considered as enemy microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The collective name of the category of microvita which causes human beings to rush headlong towards the crude pleasures of life is known as &ldquo;prakrtiliina&rdquo;. If human beings do not keep company with virtuous people or study elevating books, and if their minds are not saturated with love for the Supreme Entity, then this category of enemy microvita will infest their minds. Ultimately, the structure of those minds will be crudified, and through dogma they reach the nadir point of crudification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There is yet another category of microvita whose collective name is called &ldquo;videhaliina microvita&rdquo;. These microvita cause the human mind to rush from one place to another, and finally lead it away from Parama Purus&#x301;a. They keep the human mind oblivious to the supreme purpose of life. Due to their inner thirst for material gain, they force the human mind to go around in circles, like bullocks trudging endlessly around an oil mill. They make the human mind restless, and by misdirecting it, throw it into utter confusion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The seventh and last type of microvita is known as &ldquo;siddha&rdquo;. Siddha is the collective name of those microvita which help in the domain of spirituality. These microvita enable the human mind to rise above the physical and psychic strata, and they guide it to the world of cognition. Those who already have  an urge to develop the cognitive faculty are helped by these microvita to increase their urge more and more. Those who who have a desire to embrace the life of a renunciate are inspired greatly by these microvita. Finally they develop such an intense desire for that life that they leave their homes. Those who crave mystic realizations ultimately become enlightened beings. These siddha microvita  convey the clarion call of the vast ocean of Supreme Consciousness deep into the  minds of ordinary  human beings who gaze at their tiny plots of land, and lead them towards the Supreme Entity. In fact, this type of microvita helps spiritual aspirants in various ways. Those who have come in contact with the siddhas and understand them say that the so-called Sudharsan Cakra (the cosmic disc of  the mythological god Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u) is nothing but the symbolic name of siddha microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Suppose a growing young man is playing cricket somewhere. In the middle of the game he has a sudden realization which causes a tremendous stir in  his mind. He decides to renounce everything and goes out in search of something as yet unknown to him. This is the work of siddha microvita. A prince living in the midst of luxury suddenly  adopts the life of a renunciate and searches for the cause of human misery. A small boy of eight or ten suddenly becomes restless for the acquisition of knowledge and decides to leave his family and move towards an unknown and as yet unrealized destination. These are all the result of the ceaseless activities of siddha microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Judging from the nature of these microvita, it is clear that they are not the creation of human beings. Nor is it possible for human beings to release them into the vast cosmos. Supermen cannot create these microvita, what to speak of ordinary human beings. Obviously, these microvita are emanations from the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Until now scientists were under the impression that no structure can come into being without carbonic fundaments; that is, the survival, multiplication and decaying of any structure is not possible without carbonic locus standii. Carbons and non-carbons both get their atomic structure from microvita. Microvitum requires space in theory, but not in the realm of physicality. A carbonic framework requires space both in theory and practice. Microvitum is not of carbonic origin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Let us consider the case of the structure of a carbon atom. An atom has a nucleus around which electrons revolve. The weight of an atom is decided by the mass of its nucleus. The difference between two atoms is mainly one of nuclear difference. In this respect, the mass of the satellites is of little importance. If the nucleus of an atom is split up, tremendous energy or calories will surely be released.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It is true that every protozoic structure is based on carbon atoms. A single microvitum is insufficient to form one carbon atom, but when billions of microvita get solidified, a carbon atom is formed &ndash; generally or naturally of heterogeneous nature, and under special circumstances of homogeneous nature. Singularity or plurality of atoms constitutes one molecule and many molecules acquire the status of an element, either elements of homogeneous nature &ndash; hydrogen, carbon, helium, etc. &ndash; or elements of heterogeneous nature &ndash; hydrogen monoxide, hydrogen peroxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, etc. An atom may be internally of both homogeneous and heterogeneous character and also externally of both homogeneous and heterogeneous character. Similar is the case with a molecule. But it is internally more of heterogeneous character and externally more of homogeneous wonts. So an atom stands with its unitary glamour according to its internal homogeneity or internal heterogeneity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Hydrogen, sulphur and oxygen collectively form sulphuric acid. When these combine under certain temperatures and in particular barometric conditions and in specified proportions, we get the result. If one of these conditional factors varies, the result will also vary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->When there is no carbon atoms, protoplasmic structures cannot be formed. Protoplasmic cells are molecular ones of heterogeneous nature. If the nuclei of protoplasmic cells are split up, they release innumerable times more energy than a nuclear explosion does. Obviously, living bodies, being composed of countless protoplasmic cells, possess huge proportions of energy &ndash; something which is beyond ordinary comprehension.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Billions of microvita produce a single carbon atom. That is why it cannot be said that everything comes from carbon atoms. Rather, the carbon atoms come from microvita. Not only carbon atoms, but all other kinds of atoms are the creation of microvita. Naturally, chemistry, biochemistry and all other associated branches of science will undergo a revolutionary change. A day is sure to come when an omega of mathematics will coincide with an omega of biochemistry. All formulae and theories followed up till now will have to be reformulated, redefined and reclassified.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Since an atom does not come within the range of an ordinary microscope or an ordinary telescope, how can microvita &ndash; which are innumerable times more subtle and smaller than atoms &ndash; come within the scope of an ordinary microscope, an ordinary telescope, or ordinary perception in the psychic sphere, or also of inferences?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Each structure of carbonic origin in this universe, whether animate or inanimate, has a mind. That is, a mind is associated with every structure either in manifested form or in dormant form. Where the mind is not expressed there is no endoplasmic coverage, and where the mind is expressed, endoplasmic coverage shall be there. Wherever there is mind, it must require pabula of both carbonic and non-carbonic nature. When psychic pabulum is of carbonic nature, psychic movement is towards the crude, and if psychic pabulum is of non-carbonic nature, psychic movement is towards subtlety. Non-carbonic psychic pabulum helps in spiritual and supra-psychic motivation. A genuine spiritual aspirant must be very careful in selecting his or her food. Pabula of carbonic nature help in maintaining and nourishing the physical structure, and pabula of non-carbonic nature help in strengthening the psychic structure. An intake of more and more defective carbonic pabula adversely affects the psychic triangle of forces, and thus hinders one&#146;s psycho-spiritual progress. A stage may come when the physical structure becomes almost mindless. The mythological fable of Ahalya&#x301; (who was turned into stone for a sin she committed in the epic Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yana) may be cited as a case in point.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->When people get detached from non-carbonic pabula and become increasingly engrossed in carbonic pabula, there are two ill-effects as a consequence. First, the arena of one&#146;s own carbonic pabula will increase and the mind will gradually and steadily drift towards crude matter. Secondly, one&#146;s mind will think in terms of devouring other&#146;s carbonic pabula. This is the psychological explanation of imperialism. That is, imperialism has its origin in the psyche and functions in the psychic arena. When expressed externally it takes various forms, such as capitalism, state capitalism, communism, nationalism, communalism, parochialism, provincialism, socialism, caste-imperialism, male chauvinism, lingualism, (Once I went to a big village where the people&#146;s language was Bengali, but even in the primary school Hindi was taught there substituting the mother-language. It is a glaring example of lingual imperialism.) etc., which are all the same psychic ailments in various forms and figures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Goaded by this psychic ailment, a superpower forces its own selfish national interests on other weaker states to establish its suzerainty politically, militarily, etc. An imperialist power wants to dominate and exploit other socio-politico-economic units as an expansion, perpetration and consolidation of its vested interests; a powerful linguistic group suppresses other minority linguistic groups; the so-called upper castes subjugate the so-called lower castes in society and suck their vital juice under so many pleas and disguises; and opportunistic males curtail the rights of women in various ways. In all these cases, the same inherent psychological malady of imperialism prevails.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Imperialism is anti-human. It runs counter to the spirit of Neo- humanism and the ethics of human life. It is detrimental to prama&#x301; sam&#x301;vrddhi, prama&#x301; rddhi and prama&#x301; siddhi in human society. In a word, it thwarts human progress and creates global wars and all sorts of divisive and destructive forces in society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Imperialism is a negative force, a destructive phenomenon, which generates exploitative and unjust conditions in individual and collective life. Such a poisonous radiation of black force attracts negative forces like negative microvita. Those negative microvita intensify and escalate the demonic activities of imperialism in all aspects of human society &ndash; art, literature, education, trade, commerce, industry, agriculture, morality and social relations. They cultivate a psychology based on slavery, inferiority complex, pseudo-culture and psycho-economic exploitation, and in certain cases are the cause of nihilism and cynicism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In order to wipe out imperialism, which is rooted deep in the human psyche Neo-ethics based on the following points is indispensable:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->1) The Macrocosmic Entity must be accepted as the supreme desideratum in human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->2) There should be happy adjustment and balanced blending between carbonic and non-carbonic pabula.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->This is the Neo-ethics of the present age; a panacea for the present imperialistic social ills and a mesh of psychic disorders. The application of Neo-ethics will lead to multi-lateral salvation of human society by removing economic exploitation, political suppression, religious indoctrination, cultural imposition and social subordination.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The Role of Guru<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->I have already said that if there is a happy adjustment and balanced blending between carbonic and non-carbonic pabula in the human mind and corpor, there will be no imperialism at all. Rather, heaven will descend on the dusty earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->While following the path of Neo-ethics, human beings will attain enormous progress in the spiritual sphere with greater speed. With the help of non-carbonic pabula they will sharpen their psychic penetration within inter- and intra-atomic and molecular space. With the help of microvita they will be able to powder down their ectoplasms and transform them into cognitive faculto-factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The majority of people today do not know the technique of using microvita. The Universal Entity, sitting in one place, has been using microvita to accelerate the spiritual growth of individuals in different celestial bodies in different ways. Only that Supreme Entity who is conversant with these techniques and can teach them to individual spiritual aspirants is the Supreme Guru. He keeps all within His contact, and with the help of microvita, elevates all spiritually.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Living beings, through their own individual efforts, can achieve only a little progress in the carbonic world, but in the non-carbonic world only the grace of the Supreme Guru can lead them towards the supreme goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Hence, it has been rightly said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->This alone is the supreme truth. This is the be-all and end-all of life.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_title>Four Dimensions of Micropsychic Longing</div>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know, human longings are expressed through different lateral directions of so many waves, and of so many aspirations, hopes and longings. Hence the subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Four Dimensions of Micropsychic Longing&rdquo;. These micropsychic longings are many in number. They are also multifarious, not only in number but also in quality and quantity. But they may be brought within the range of four broad categories.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->One category, as you know, is psycho-physical longing for physical pabulum &ndash; that is, the longings concerning inborn instinct. Not only human beings, but all living beings are goaded by this primordial nature of longing, that is, psycho-physical longing for physical pabulum. We say it is a natural instinct for each and every object &ndash; even in the case of non-living elements we find this type of longing &ndash; in the case of both animate and inanimate objects. In each and every physical and psychic structure there remain certain self-controlling faculties. In the case of this inborn instinct, or, say, psycho-physical longing, there are self-controlling faculties also. But these faculties cannot move against the characteristics of the vital force. When these controlling faculties go against the characteristics of the vital force, disintegration and dissociation start both within and without the framework. This is the wont of the individual structure. And in the case of collective structures, regarding these psycho-physical longings, if it is seen that the collective body of a particular nature of living being or expression does not like it, then the controlling faculty creates a sort of change and metamorphosis in the physical structure, and as a result the nature of the longings also changes. That is, in the case of the individual structure it is to be goaded by the controlling faculty only up to a certain range or certain stratum. Otherwise the structure will start disintegration or dissociation both within and without. And in a collective body, the collective controlling faculty may create a sort of change in the physical structures if such a change is supported by Macrocosmic conation, otherwise not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The second category is psycho-physical longing, in this case also for physical pabulum. But this longing is not of inborn nature. These longings are created after the development of so many plexi and change in the nature and structure of so many hormones secreted from those newly-created or newly-developed plexi. The difference between the first category and the second is that the first one is inborn and the second one is not inborn, it is created later on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now you see, both the pabula are of physical nature, are physical pabula. But in the second case the controlling faculty, the inherent controlling faculty, can move a bit forward, but when this movement goes ultra vires to the fundamental principles of the physical structure, the structure cannot remain as before; that is, it starts decomposition. It cannot maintain its integration or structural solidarity. In this case, one&#146;s physical structure may be saved if one applies or rather ascribes the Macrocosmic grandeur to physical pabulum. There is no other way. But in the case of the collective body, or the collective structure, there may be change, and that change may not go against the characteristics of the physical structure if there remains a constant endeavour for such a change, rather for such a metamorphosis. This is the second longing, and both the pabula are of physical nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The third category is psychic longing for psychic pabulum. That is, this occurs when one wants that one&#146;s psychic emanations should be from crude to subtle and cover all spheres of existence and non-existence. In this case an aspirant may move forward till the psychic body maintains a close cooperation or parallelism with the physical waves or the physical existence. But otherwise the mind may get dissociated from the physical structure; for which a psychic diversion, a properly-measured diversion, is necessary or rather indispensable. And that diversion should always maintain proper equipoise and proper equilibrium with the fundamental principles of prama&#x301; [dynamic adjustment], otherwise the physical structure will be lost and at the same time the psychic structure will also be lost. Human beings who do not follow the propriety of psychology may undergo, rather may face, such a future. In our collective body, as a result of this type of endeavour &ndash; constant endeavour &ndash; constant longing for all-round expression of micropsychic potentialities will create a sort of balanced world, an earth of prama&#x301;, an earth well-balanced by prama&#x301;; and it will create, it will assure, a bright future not only for all humanity, but for the entire animate and inanimate world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The fourth category is, we may say, to encourage apexed psychology or pinnacled psychology. Here the mental faculties along with the controlling faculties will move upwards and finally get pointed, and that point is lost in the Supra-Cognitive Entity. This is the goal of all living beings. In the course of this endeavour, there comes hardly any obstacle from within, but there may come hindrances and obstacles from without in the shape of ideological clashes. The sources of such clashes are the degrading and degenerating forces working in the realm of the manifested Cosmos. In the case of the collective body, if such a practice is encouraged, the entire physical structure of the universe will slowly be metamorphosed into the psychic world and the psychic world will be metamorphosed into spirituality. That is, it will help the sain&#x32D;cara [extroversial] and pratisain&#x32D;cara [introversial] movement of the Macropsychic conation. It will help the movement of Macropsychic conation, and human beings living on this earth will enjoy the bliss of heaven on this earth of dust. You should know this, and you should propagate this supreme psychic future of humanity in a better way, in a nice way.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Khamu&#x301;rtti.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.9.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#9.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Kha + mu&#x301;rtti = khamu&#x301;rtti. Khamu&#x301;rtti literally means &ldquo;image in space&rdquo;. Since ancient times rs&#x301;is, sages, yogis, and spiritual aspirants have sometimes seen a kind of luminous body or disembodied soul, by the divine grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. These luminous bodies assist spiritual aspirants in all possible ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Only spiritual aspirants are able to see these luminous bodies through the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Though they are visible to the naked eye, they cannot be photographed. Spiritual aspirants can speak to these luminous bodies and get answers to their questions. While the words of a spiritual aspirant may be recorded on a tape recorder, the answers given by the luminous bodies cannot be recorded. If a spiritual aspirant asks them for any mundane object, they may or may not grant the request. If they do grant the request, they do so only once, and after that they will never come within that person&#146;s sight again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If a spiritual aspirant asks for something spiritual, one may get it either directly or through the siddhas. Siddhas are a category of microvita<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.9.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#9.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  which are very helpful to spiritual aspirants. I have already told you about the different categories of devayonis or microvita, and in that connection I have said something about siddhas. Yogis and spiritual aspirants say that sometimes during their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; they see siddhas and receive direct help from them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->People see khamu&#x301;rttis due to the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. But the guru cautions them that they should never ask for any object of enjoyment or any mundane object from a khamu&#x301;rtti. If people want objects of enjoyment, they will find themselves caught in the insidious snare of enjoyment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->It is worth mentioning here that one should not confuse khamu&#x301;rtti with cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a. Cha&#x301;ya&#x301; Purus&#x301;a is a mere game of light and shade. If someone gazes intently on a dazzling white object and then looks at a dimly-lit object, one will only see a shadow. This shadow is called cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a. If you look towards the sun for a while and then look at another part of the sky, you will see a kind of shadow. Similarly, if you look at the flame of a burning lamp for some time and then look at a source of dim light, you are sure to see a kind of shadow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In ancient times, people who practised hypnotism<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.9.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#9.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> would see cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a at night with the help of the moon, or with the help of a burning lamp (fueled by ghee) on new-moon nights. With their vision fixed on the cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a, they would gradually become conversant with the science of hypnotism. Since olden times, the practice of Avidya&#x301; Tantra and the science of hypnotism have been well known in India and China. In modern times, the science of hypnotism was used to cure disease by Dr. Mesmer, a [European] physician. Since then, curing diseases by the science of hypnotism has been called &ldquo;mesmerism&rdquo;, after him. So now you understand that cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a as used in hypnotism or mesmerism is only a game of light and shade.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->A khamu&#x301;rtti, however, is a thoroughly spiritual vision. Cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a is a mere image of a shadow, whereas khamu&#x301;rtti is an image of bright effulgence. If any of you have had a chance to see such a khamu&#x301;rtti or are still seeing one on any occasion due to the grace of the guru, you should not pray for any mundane object or for any finite object of enjoyment from these khamu&#x301;rttis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There is yet another kind of shadowy appearance unrelated to khamu&#x301;rtti. In Tantra this is known as yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii darshana. As a result of practising a special type of Tantra, people attain the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi. (Such people are known as yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhas &ndash; sa&#x301;dhakas who have attained a type of occult power.) These yaks&#x301;in&#x301;iis<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.9.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#9.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> work under the instructions of the siddhas, and provided that some rules and regulations are not violated, they abide by their instructions. Usually the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;iis cannot be induced to perform any evil deed. They have no influence in the supernatural and spiritual spheres &ndash; their influence is primarily exerted in the physical sphere and to some extent in the psychic sphere. They follow the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhas like a shadowy image, and very often can be found moving on walls or inside rooms like black shadows. I have never heard of anyone being harmed by a yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii, but it may have happened.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->I know a certain person who was a professor of physics in a college in Bihar. Let us suppose his name was Swapneshwar Chattopadhyaya. I heard that he had attained yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi. He did not have a son, but a daughter who lived far away from him, in the house of her father-in-law. She had a daughter who used to live with her grandparents (Swapneshwar Chattopadhyaya and his wife). The granddaughter was very young &ndash; about two or three years old.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Once Mr. Chattopadhyaya had to go to Calcutta for quite a long time in connection with his academic pursuits. His wife &ndash; say her name was Kanika &ndash; was a very good but a timid woman. The thought that she would have to live alone for a long time made her feel half-dead. After all, how far could she rely on her tiny granddaughter? Mr. Chattopadhyaya consoled his wife, saying, &ldquo;Don&#146;t worry. My yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii will take care of you. She will help you in all ways.&rdquo; On the eve of his departure for Calcutta, he showed his wife a black shadowy image reflected on the wall of their meditation room. Though the figure was very small, it looked like a human figure. Mr. Chattopadhyaya said to his wife, &ldquo;This yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii will protect you from all troubles and dangers.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->He set out on his journey and was expected to return after forty-five days. Immediately after his departure, many strange things began to happen. Wherever Kanika went, the image of the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii followed her like a shadow. For the first few days Kanika was a bit nervous, seeing the shadowy image, but later on, as she was obliged to spend time in its company, she overcame her fear. Rather, she grew more courageous than before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->At noon one day, while Kanika was washing the dishes in the kitchen, she suddenly noticed that the image of the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii was shaking abnormally. At first she was puzzled, but then she saw the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii move quickly out of the room. She followed the image and also left the room. The yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii came to the door of the living room beside the main gate. Kanika discovered that a thief dressed like a gentleman was about to escape with a suitcase that was kept in the room. The thief caught sight of Kanika and took to his heels, leaving the suitcase behind. The main gate had been left open by mistake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->On another day, Kanika was sitting in the kitchen kneading flour. Suddenly she noticed that the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii was shaking violently again. Kanika looked at the figure in utter amazement. Immediately it went out of the kitchen, and Kanika followed it closely. The yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii rushed towards the well across the courtyard of the house. As soon as Kanika looked towards the well she became alarmed&#8230; horrified. She noticed that her three-year-old granddaughter was sitting precariously on the edge of the well, looking down into it. If she moved slightly this way or that, or if she moved only a little to look at her own reflection in the water, she would immediately fall into the well. No one could prevent her certain death. Kanika moved stealthily forward from behind, picked the child up, and placed her on her lap.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Barely a month had passed since Swapneshwar had left for Calcutta. One day Kanika was cutting okra (&ldquo;ladies&#146; finger&rdquo;) in the kitchen. Suddenly she looked at the image of the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii on the wall, and she noticed that it was gradually disappearing. She looked all over the wall but could not see the image anywhere. Meanwhile, she heard the sound of someone knocking at the front door. Kanika went to the door and opened it, only to see Swapneshwar standing on the doorstep. Seeing Kanika, Swapneshwar said, &ldquo;I was supposed to stay in Calcutta for one and a half months, but as the job was finished in one month, I came home without delay.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I am narrating what little information I have about yaks&#x301;in&#x301;iis. Formerly, some people used to perform yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; according to the prescribed Tantric rituals. I do not know if people still do the same thing today. In the past there were no caste or communal barriers as far as these Tantric practices were concerned, nor are there any today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The system of performing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; on various deities is not exactly the same as this, but somewhat similar. Deities like shadowy figures also become visible through this practice. Although this sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is different to some extent from the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi, the psychology in both is the same. All the systems of Ka&#x301;lii siddhi, Durga&#x301; siddhi, d&#x301;a&#x301;kinii siddhi, yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi, etc., are different in practice, yet they are similar theoretically. In case one wants to achieve the siddhi of various deities, one should acquire more mental purity than in the case of yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi, da&#x301;kinii siddhi, yoginii siddhi, etc., because this subject concerns the psychic stratum. It is of elevated nature, but it has no relation whatsoever to the realm of genuine spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Once when I visited Allahabad, a certain gentleman came in contact with me. He told me that he had attained Ka&#x301;lii siddhi. I said to him, &ldquo;Well, can you try to tell me something about your experiences? For instance, what do you see, what do you understand, etc.?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->He said, &ldquo;I perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; according to such and such system. One day after sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; I saw a shadowy image of Ka&#x301;lii on the wall. Since then, whenever my mind gets concentrated, that image of Ka&#x301;lii produces some kind of vibration in my mind which enables me to understand what it wants to convey to me. Last night that image conveyed to me that you were coming to Allahabad today from Bihar and that you would stay here for a few days.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->I asked him, &ldquo;Can you see the red mark on Ka&#x301;lii&#146;s feet, her ankle bells, her iron bangles, the garland of skulls around her neck, the garland of fingers, etc.?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->He replied, &ldquo;No, I do not see anything like that. All those things are mixed up in the shadow. The shadow itself is the combination of all those things.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Then I asked him about yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi, and I also asked if he knew the difference between yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi and Ka&#x301;lii siddhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In the case of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi, there is less devotional intensity due to lack of deep ideation. But during Ka&#x301;lii sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; there is a fair degree of devotion, and at the same time the psychic state is somewhat peaceful.  Usually, people do not utilize Ka&#x301;lii shakti for destructive purposes, but of course there may be some Avidya&#x301; Tantrics who use their acquired power for malevolent deeds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->This type of siddhi of various deities is a kind of psychic achievement of a higher order, yet this has nothing to do with the spiritual world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..24"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Uttamo Brahmasadbha&#x301;vo madhyama&#x301; dhya&#x301;nadha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;;<br>Japastutih sya&#x301;dhadhama&#x301; mu&#x301;rtipu&#x301;ja&#x301;dhama&#x301;dhama&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..25"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->[Ideation on Brahma is the best, dhya&#x301;na and dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; are second best, repetitious incantation and eulogistic prayer are the worst, and idol worship is the worst of the worst.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->You may have heard that some people attain bhu&#x301;ta siddhi or preta siddhi (the ability to communicate with ghosts). This ability is greatly inferior to yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi.  In olden days, some people would follow the practice of bhu&#x301;ta siddhi, usually to extend their influence or to do harm to others, and would perform many misdeeds. Today no one follows this practice; if some people do, they are very few.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Instances of people being possessed by ghosts, gods and goddesses, d&#x301;a&#x301;kiniis, yoginiis, etc., are somewhat similar to this from the psychological perspective. You may have noticed that sometimes people look for those who are &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; by Manasa&#x301; [snake goddess], Satii-Ma&#x301; [Mother Satii], etc., when they feel an immense desire to find answers to their questions. Others visit special places or localities to attain the exact answers to their problems.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Although these things are similar psychologically, they are somewhat different in practice. To treat various diseases by performing a special type of dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; [deep concentration] on various gods and goddesses, is nothing but the play of the conscious, subconscious and unconscious levels of the mind.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.9.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#9.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->If, due to the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, someone gets the chance to see a khamu&#x301;rtti and asks that entity for success on the path of self-abnegation, then one may get such inspiration from that siddha devayoni (positive microvitum). One will merge one&#146;s individual existence and spiritual flow into the Macrocosmic stance of Parama Purus&#x301;a and attain savishes&#x301;a or savikalpa samadhi, the state of partial absorption of mind; or, by merging in the supreme stance of Parama Purus&#x301;a, attain nirvishes&#x301;a or nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi, the state of complete absorption of mind. This is the summit of spiritual attainment. In the final stages of one&#146;s spiritual journey, the entitative existence of the sa&#x301;dhaka is merged into Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->According to their nature, microvita<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> are of three types &ndash; negative, ordinary and positive. Negative microvita function on their own through nature, while positive microvita function through specially created waves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Negative microvita primarily function in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra and sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakras and gradually rise upwards. If negative microvita are applied to the upper cakras, they will function very rapidly, but this may cause death to human beings. That is why negative microvita by nature function in the lower cakras of the human body, and their influence is mostly felt in the pain and disease of the kidneys, loins, waste, etc. Negative microvita function very perceptibly in the reproductive and excretory organs. Concentrated negative microvita are not usually applied to the human body because they immediately start affecting the human brain and bring death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Ordinary microvita may affect the kidneys, liver, abdomen, chest, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Positive microvita are never spread through nature. A mighty personality, a Sadguru, if He so wishes, may emanate positive microvita through His own waves, and thus create similar vibrations in the male human body though positive microvita. In this case, the male body means those who are above twenty-four years of age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the undeveloped male body &ndash; that is, in those who are less than twenty-four years old &ndash; although shukra [a vital fluid which has three stages &ndash; lymph, spermatozoa and seminal fluid] is produced, the semen is not yet fully nourished or developed. In the male body, shukra starts being produced at the age of twelve or thirteen. It may be subsequently turned into semen, but that semen cannot be considered fully nourished semen before the male is twenty-four years old. Consequently, I usually treat thirty year old males as the standard age for being a medium for receiving positive microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Young brahmaca&#x301;riis [trainee monks below twenty-four years old] always try to preserve their semen, hence their nerves are healthy. In the case of females, whether they are young or old, they discharge ova and other materials during their monthly menstrual cycle, and hence their nerves are weak.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->As boys up to the age of twelve or thirteen years of age do not develop semen, they are very sentimental, like women. There is little difference between boys and girls up to to the age of twelve or thirteen. After the age of twelve or thirteen, ova are created in the female body, but that is usually ejected from the body at a particular period in every month, hence the nerves in the female body are comparatively weak. Such bodies cannot successfully absorb the strong vibrations of positive microvita. Birds, animals, trees and plants also cannot absorb vibrations of positive microvita. Even in a five-thousand-year-old banyan tree or a gigantic and extremely powerful animal, the mind remains undeveloped and the nerves remain undernourished and weak. If positive microvita are applied to such bodies, they will cause death. The application of positive microvita may emancipate animals and plants through a galloping jump, but their death is inevitable. So, positive microvita should never be applied to children, animals, birds and plants. Similarly, positive microvita should never be applied to the bodies of women. When the waves of positive microvita are widespread, they influence everyone and help in their all-round development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Spiritual progress is effected through the pineal gland, and psycho-spiritual progress is effected through the pituitary gland. If a man is a diehard sinner or inveterate criminal, and if positive microvita are applied to him, the Sadguru will have to labour hard. If a man is psychically or mentally weak, the Sadguru will also have to labour hard while applying positive microvita to his body. And in the case of those who are physically, psychically and spiritually weak, He will have to labour still harder.  In this case, the nerve cells and nerve fibres in the body of the weak man will have to be thoroughly cleaned, hence the labour involved will be immense. Due to the unconditional grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, if positive microvita are applied to a male body which is less than twenty-four years of age, the person may survive if he can adjust with the initial shock, but the probability of death is great. Boys below the age of twelve or thirteen years are sure to die.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Positive microvita can only be applied by Parama Purus&#x301;a,  but negative microvita are spread through natural forces, as in the case of conjunctivitis. If positive microvita are created through satsaun&#x32D;ga [good company], this will influence the collectivity. It has been observed that when a sa&#x301;dhaka meditates alone, he or she may enjoy spiritual bliss, but if one is in the company of many sa&#x301;dhakas, one will enjoy more bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In principle, negative and positive microvita are the same, but their field of activity is different. For instance, if negative microvita are applied to a male body, they will bring torture and afflictions and sometimes death. In the case of women and children, they will bring instant death. This is also the case with animals, birds and plants.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="11..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Microvitum is the inner secret of life, the inner secret of vital progress in the three fields of physicality, psyche and spirituality. This theory of microvita must not be neglected or ignored. You must properly propagate and establish the theory, denomination and emanation of microvita. Many chemical formulae are to be changed, many structures in the entire universe are to undergo metamorphosis. The entire world is eagerly waiting for you to bring all-round metamorphosis. The question is why chemical formulae are to undergo metamorphosis. Just now I told you that the application of microvita in the practical field will bring about radical changes in various chemical formulae. Now the question is, What sort of change or metamorphosis will take place? I would say in reply that up till now the concept of physical science was that carbon atoms are indispensable for the origin of life. After people are acquainted with the theory of microvita, they will no longer subscribe to the old concepts. People will be introduced to higher and subtler formulae than the present ones regarding the internal structure of objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Let me explain this matter more elaborately. Take for instance the case of green vitriol. Up till now the recognized formula for green vitriol (ferrous sulphate) is FeSO4 7H20.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->But after a chemist is acquainted with the theory of microvita, he or she will no longer use this formula. He or she will prefer to use the new formula &ndash; say FeSO4 7H20 (Group A MV 20 million). Take another case, say copper sulphate (blue vitriol). The present chemical formula is CUS04 5H20, but after the theory of microvita is well established, a chemist will use the new formula &ndash; CUS04 5H20 (Group B MV 20 million). This means the chemical formulae regarding the inner structure of objects is undergoing a tremendous change. Of course, it is true that the size of formulae will be bigger than what they are today. It is also true that the denomination of the object and its internal qualities will not be changed. There will only be a change in the case of chemical formulae. A scientist in the microvita age will refuse to accept the carbon atom as the rudimental factor for the emergence of life. To him or her a carbon atom is nothing but billions of microvita getting solidified.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->All microvita are not of the same type. There are qualitative differences amongst different varieties of microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->According to the modern biologist, protoplasmic cells are made of carbon atoms, but in the microvita age the biologist will say that the protoplasmic cells are not made of carbon atoms, rather they are the collective solidified form of innumerable microvita. By controlling the microvita of the protoplasmic cells, big changes can be effected within the human body. Ordinary people can be made extraordinary. Their mental qualities and capabilities can be enlarged by supplying microvita in sufficient quantity. That is to say, the theory of microvita has immense potentialities in introducing numerous changes in human society. By changing microvita, ectoplasmic changes will come which in turn will bring about endoplasmic change, and thus the mind will be able to control the organism, the physical body, in a better way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Consequently, there will be remarkable changes in the over-all personalities of human beings. These changes will take place in the internal sphere as much as in the external structure. The personalities of human beings will not be the same as they are now. Due to changes in the nerve cells, a change in the ectoplasmic cells also occurs, and as a result the effulgence of the body changes. In the age of microvita, the appearance of the physical body will change. Human beings will become more psychic than physical, and in the next phase they will become more spiritual than psychic.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->How will the chemical formulae undergo changes due to research on microvita?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As a result of intensive research on microvita, there will be many significant changes in the chemical formulae of various objects. During scientific experiment in chemical laboratories, you have surely noticed that the results of chemical reactions are not always the same in spite of temperature, atmospheric pressure and atmospheric conditions remaining the same. This is due to the difference in the number and denominations of the microvita present in the samples. Suppose there are two samples of calcium phosphate (CaPO2). Chemically, both the samples contact the same amount of oxygen, yet the number of microvita present in the oxygen of sample A may be 10 million more than that of sample B. Obviously, in chemical reactions the results will vary. Whatever may be the external chemical structure, the internal structure will be greatly changed due to an increase or decrease in the number of microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A little intensive research will make the situation clearer. For instance, take the case of calcium sulphate. Suppose there are two samples of calcium sulphate. The formulae in both cases is the same, that is, CaSO4. Suppose sample A has 20 million more microvita than sample B. In that case, the new formula for sample A will be written as CaSO4 (Group A MV 20 million). In the changed circumstances, the size of chemical formula will be bigger that what it is at present, and accordingly, they will give much more information. In case of sodium carbonate (NA2CO3) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), this is more applicable. Any change in the external structure will automatically introduce qualitative changes in the objects. For instance, when hydrogen monoxide (H20) is changed into hydrogen peroxide (H202), there is change in the external structure and a corresponding qualitative change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Will microvital research affect the commercial transaction of this Earth? If so, why so? If not, why not?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Intensive research in microvita will surely bring about radical changes in the realm of commercial transactions. Suppose a certain country is making a huge profit by selling sodium nitrite. Now, if the denomination and the number of the microvita present in the oxygen of the sodium nitrite is decreased or increased in the sodium nitrite factory of another country, then the buyers may not like to buy sodium nitrite supplied by the former country. Naturally, there will be a change in the pattern of international commercial transactions as a result of the production of commodities with the increase or decrease in the number of microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Again, take the case of jute. The quality of jute in the different districts of Bengal varies, although the jute seeds are the same everywhere. In Bengal, all are aware of the fact that there is a clear difference in the quality of jute in the districts of Maymansingha, Jalpaiguri and &#146;Murshidabad. The cause is the same in this case also &ndash; the varying number of microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Take another case &ndash; the case of potato. Even after the use of the same chemical fertilizer, the rate of production and taste of potatoes in all cases are not uniform. Perhaps many persons are not aware of the cause of the difference in the rate of production and taste of potatoes from one place to another. The cause lies in the number and denomination of microvita. The difference in the number of microvita in oxygen accounts for this difference.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->By the way, it may be mentioned that the oxygen present in sodium nitrite acts as a fertilizer in soil. Sodium nitrite in colloquial Bengali is called &ldquo;shora&#x301;&rdquo;. In Bihar, the Sone river is bigger than the Falgu river, and in both the rivers there are good deposits of sodium nitrite, but the sodium nitrite of the Falgu river is more productive than that of the Sone river. This is why the soil of Mokamatal, which is inundated by the flood waters of the river Falgu, yields a richer harvest than the fields flooded by the Sone river. Chile in South America is the largest supplier of sodium nitrite in the world market.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In India there is a constant shortage of tin and copper. By bringing changes in the inner physical structure of objects with the application of microvita, necessary elements can be created. In the same manner, petroleum can be artificially synthesized with the help of microvita. This sort of change takes place with the change in the internal structure of objects. There is greater scope for change in metals than in non-metals. Newer varieties of explosives will be created in the future. In fact, there will be radical changes in the field of pyro-technology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->How will the theory of microvita affect pharmaco-chemistry and biotechnology?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There will be revolutionary changes in the fields of pharmo-chemistry and biotechnology. A particular object has its particular medicinal value. Take, for instance, the case of copper sulphate. It contains copper, sulphur and oxygen. Any variation in atomic proportions brings changes in the quality and effectiveness of medicines. Changes in the number of microvita bring qualitative change. Intensive pharmaco-chemistry research will reveal the amount of microvita required to produce particular kinds of medical effects, and accordingly a scientist will be able to evolve accurate and effective formulae for various medicines. Naturally, the old and outdated formulae will be discarded. Hence, pharmaco-chemistry is sure to be affected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->It is often found that the same medicine produced by different companies has varying effectiveness. The medicine produced by one company is found to be more effective than the one produced by the another company. Here also variations in the number and classification of microvita account for such differences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Similarly, microvita theory will also influence pyro-technology. It is noticeable that fire crackers manufactured by one company produce more or less sound than those of another company. The greater the internal movement, the higher the frequency, and as a result the explosive potential is intensified, producing greater sound. The mobility of microvita influences the internal movement. Consequently, there will be great changes in the control and production of highly powerful bombs. And as this is concerned with speed, the very nature and mode of the speed of rockets will be affected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now a question arises. How does the theory of microvita affect biochemistry?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The internal protoplasmic formula will change. Nuclei can also be affected by microvita, and protoplasm will be affected by bringing changes in the nucleus with the help of microvita. The displacement of the nucleus can be brought about with the help of microvita, which will bring qualitative change in the internal structure. Internally, the hormones will be affected, and thus externally, the corporeal structure will also be affected. The longevity of all forms of protoplasm is twenty one days.

It can be done as per the process stated above by changing the pressure. In that case, there can be a change in the atmospheric pressure without changing the temperature. There will be a change in calorie, but that does not mean that there will be a change in the temperature.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>1) Question</b>: Suppose in a particular country there is balanced physical prama&#x301;trikon&#x301;a, balanced psychic prama&#x301;trikon&#x301;a and balanced spiritual prama&#x301;trikon&#x301;a, but these three types of prama&#x301;trikon&#x301;a do not coincide &ndash; generally they coincide in the spiritual stratum &ndash; in that case or in that particular country, how can good thinking people fight against the depraving effects of enemy microvita?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Microvita are your friends and they are also your enemies. If controlled by good people microvita are your friends, and if controlled by bad people microvita are your enemies. By nature some microvita are your friends, by nature some microvita are your enemies. Those which are by nature your enemies may also become your friends if controlled by good people. Poison is used as a medicine; snake venom is also used as a medicine.<!-- /block --></p>

Their inner balance will be destroyed. When they coincide, the triangle of forces comes in proximity with the gun&#x301;atrikon&#x301;a &ndash; there are several million physical prama&#x301;trokon&#x301;as, several million psychic prama&#x301;trikon&#x301;as and several million spiritual prama&#x301;trikon&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->If prama&#x301;trikon&#x301;as are destroyed, in that case good people would take the help of friend microvita. Some microvita are, in effect, your friends and some are your enemies. By nature, no microvitum is either a friend or enemy of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Microvita which are inimical by nature may become your friends if controlled by good people.

<a name="13..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><b>2) Question</b>:  How can good people fight against the evil effect of negative microvita? Microvita may be your friend &ndash; the collective body of microvita may be your friend &ndash; or they may not be your friend. What are good people to do under such circumstances?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: There will be a tug-of-war amongst these three triangles and finally they will get deranged, they will get disturbed. The Prama&#x301; amongst all these three triangles will be lost.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>3) Question</b>:  In order to encourage the movement of positive microvita and to discourage the movement of negative microvita, should the education system of the entire world and the entire universe be reoriented? What should be done regarding the educational system of the universe, not only of India and this small planet of ours? What should be the approach? What should be the stages, the phases, the physico-psychic and psycho-spiritual approach?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: The question is a bit knotty. We must develop the physico-psychic aspect of students through proper physical culture, which will include yoga a&#x301;sanas, proper diet, games, sports, etc. And to develop the psycho-spiritual aspect, we must reorient the entire curriculum of all schools from kindergarten to postgraduate level according to the Neohumanist philosophy, and must incorporate the practices of As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga Yoga into the curriculum in all grades. This will be the practical approach. And the guiding philosophy, the controlling philosophy should be: &ldquo;This universe is ours&rdquo; &ndash; and &ldquo;we&rdquo; means humans, animals and plants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><b>4) Question</b>:  Should the knowledge regarding microvita be treated as para&#x301;vidya&#x301; or apara&#x301;vidya&#x301;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  Certainly it is apara&#x301;vidya&#x301; because para&#x301;vidya&#x301; is psycho-spiritual knowledge.  But this apara&#x301;vidya&#x301; will help us much in attaining the stage of para&#x301;vidya&#x301;, the layer of spirituality, the lower strata of para&#x301;vidya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><b>5) Question</b>:  Do these microvita occupy any space?  If so, what is that space &ndash; is it ethereal, psychic or supra-psychic?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  According to degrees of subtlety, some microvita occupy ethereal space, some occupy psychic space, and some occupy supra-psychic space.  Supra-psychic means where the psychic comes in continuous touch, continuous contact, with the spiritual &ndash; the silver lining between the spiritual and psychic.  The spiritual level, the spiritual space, is not for microvita because they are something created by the cosmic mind.  Some microvita occupy the subtlest layer of the physical sphere, and some are subtler than that:  they are psychic.  And some are still higher, they are supra-psychic.  According to their subtlety, some microvita can be seen by a microscope; some cannot, but come in contact with mind through their actional faculty; and some can be seen by highly developed conceptual minds functioning within the field of perception.  Microvita do not only function within the physical stratum, they also function within the psychic stratum, but they do not function within the spiritual stratum.  They cannot affect the spiritual structure, but they can affect both the physical and psychic structures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><b>6) Question</b>:  Can there be any correlation between the specialities of the nuclear structure of the carbon atom (mobility, motivity and existential faculty) with those of microvita?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  You know nothing about the nuclear structure of microvita; you know a little about the nuclear structure of carbon atoms, and you know a few specialities of carbon atoms. So far as positive or friend (&ldquo;ami&rdquo;) microvita are concerned, there can be a proper adjustment, there can be a correlation; and for some microvita there cannot be any correlation; they are ultravires to the existence of each other.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->There are positive or friend microvita, negative or enemy microvita, and neutral microvita.  If controlled by good people, microvita are your friends; if controlled by bad people, microvita are your enemies.  And by nature some microvita are your friends; by nature some microvita are your enemies.  Those which are by nature your enemies may also become your friends if controlled by good people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->When a few negative microvita penetrate your body, you feel very uneasy. But when millions of negative microvita enter, it does not take more then a few seconds  for even an elephant to die. If neutral microvita enter your body, you do not feel anything special.  When friend microvita enter your body, you do not feel anything special.  When friend microvita enter your body and mind, you have a comfortable feeling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->A few negative microvita, when they enter the human body and mind, bring much change in the feelings, but when millions of them enter, it becomes very difficult for anyone to survive long. Ordinarily microvita become more active in the night when human beings are asleep.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>7) Question</b>: Is there any difference of sex in protoplasms, as there is in the case of developed plants and animals?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  In the case of unicellular and multicellular protozoa, the entity is divided by self-dividing processes &ndash; by an inner fissiparous tendency &ndash; so the question of sex difference does not arise as in the case of animals or plants. But there are sex differences in the case of metazoic cells. The human body is the most complex multicellular metazoic structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The male structure differs from the female structure in that the number of microvita in the male structure is more than  in the female structure. The sex difference is due to the number of microvita. Suppose in the male protoplasm the number of microvita is ten billion, then in the female protozoa there are five billion. Not only the number, but also the varieties of microvita in the male and female structures differ. The male body can tolerate the application of positive or negative microvita after the formation of semen starts. In a boy above fifteen years of age, the formation of semen has started. (In hot countries this usually occurs at thirteen to fifteen years and a little later in cold countries.) As soon as semen has formed, the number of microvita is also increased in the male body. A female body or a male child in whom semen formation has not yet started, cannot tolerate the application of positive or negative microvita. But in the case of the male body, as the testes glands are functioning, the application of microvita will not do any harm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Yet females or children will also enjoy divine bliss if they satisfy Parama Purus&#x301;a. Only by His grace, by the grace of the supreme, can one attain divine bliss by satisfying Him.  In anything and everything human might, human power and human brain are extremely limited. Everyone depends on Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the past there was no mass imposition of positive microvita. For the first time the collective application of the positive microvita is being done to elevate the spiritual standard of the general mass.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><b>8) Question</b>: What causes an unpleasant odour in the body?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Due to the accumulation of dead protoplasmic cells, a bad smell arises in the body.  The reason for this is not taking a proper bath and washing away the dead cells.  In certain animals and plants, due to the secretion of smelly hormones, an unpleasant odour is emitted from the body.  Everyone should take a bath at regular intervals to clean the body and eat vegetarian food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..8"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><b>9) Question</b>: Can you say whether micropsychic movement in individual life or in collective life, in animate or inanimate objects, is of unilateral order or of multilateral order too?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  Everything in this world, whether animate or inanimate, moves. Everywhere movement is from imperfection towards perfection, but in circum-rotarian style. Not only microcosms but ectoplasms or microvita also move from imperfection towards perfection in circumferential style. Those microvita, or say the collective form of microvita, with the coverage of endoplasm, move in the same style.  Each and every microvitum moves according to propensive propulsion wrought by the Macrocosm.  Impact and tactuality both come from the Macrocosm.  As the microcosm is the unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, it cannot move in so many directions, but it appears to move in many directions.  Because movement is always from imperfection to perfection in circumferential style in the unit body, although the movement is in so many directions in the case of the unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; or microcosm, the movement is always unilateral, not unilineal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>10) Question</b>:  What is the relationship between the collective body of ectoplasm and microcosm, and the relationship between endoplasm and microcosm? Is there an inter-ectoplasmic gap that links up the unit mind with something external?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  So many microcosms, so many microvita, are there.  They have not got clear &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling.  Their existence is more of physical nature than of psychic nature.  The collective body of microvita is another name of carbon atom.  Carbon atom is another name of so many microvita with so many specialities, with so many characteristics.  The collective body of microvita is the collective &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling maintaining a relationship with the physical body.  There is no such relationship in the case of a dead physical structure.  The relationship is inert.  In animate and inanimate objects there is the intra-atomic gap; there is the intra-microvitum gap, inter-carbonic gap and so on, but these gaps are not vacua. They are filled with macropsychic conation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The collective body of microvita is carbon atom, and when carbon atoms are in cohesion with other carbonic atoms, &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is created.  As coverage of these collective bodies there is endoplasm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In animate objects there are intra-protoplasmic and inter- protoplasmic gaps.  These gaps are also not vacua; they are also filled with macropsychic conation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So far as a microcosm is concerned, it is composed of ectoplasm but the movement of ectoplasm is decided by the movement of microvita. They move in circum-rotarian style wrought by Macrocosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><b>11) Question</b>:  What is the structural formula of microvita?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Previously, people were under the impression that molecules were the minutest particles of elements.  Later it was found that atoms, not molecules, were the minutest entities.  Still later it was discovered that even an atom is not the minutest particle, for atoms are made of electrons, protons and many other imaginary and non-imaginary particles.  So, neither atoms nor molecules are the minutest particles of elements because they are composed of many other particles of the expressed world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->People are under the impression that something called a &ldquo;virus&rdquo; is the minutest living being.  But virus is a vague term; there is in fact nothing like a virus &ndash; thus the question of it being a living being does not arise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Microvitum is the minutest entity.  The collection of microvita forms a carbon atom.  As a microvitum is the minutest entity, it cannot have a structure like that of an atom or a solar system.  As a microvitum is a singular entity, it has no structure. By nature it is more energy than matter, so it travels and moves through inferences, whereas other entities cannot move through inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><b>12) Question</b>:  What is the difference between positive microvitum and negative microvitum?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Positive microvitum is pro-ectoplasmic &ndash;  it is more ectoplasmic than matter. Negative microvitum is pro-materialistic &ndash; it is more matter than mind, than ectoplasm.  Positive microvitum, being more of ectoplasmic nature, starts functioning or working first in the mental level then filters down towards physical matter.  Negative microvitum starts functioning in matter and moves towards the mind, towards ectoplasmic stuff and endoplasmic coverage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><b>13) Question</b>: What are the possible physiological effects of the application of positive or negative microvita?  How and why do they take place?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>:  If a large quantity of positive or negative microvita enter a person, there may be instantaneous or gradual death. If the body is not properly developed, as in the case of boys below 16 years of age, or in the case of women whose minds are very sentimental, the application of positive or negative microvita may bring about instantaneous death. To receive positive microvita, the body should not be carnivorous; it must be vegetarian.  Non-vegetarians are not fit to receive the application of positive microvita.  Positive or negative microvita can affect the protoplasmic cells of a structure directly, and even bring about a change in the genetic structure. Even the sex of a person can change due to the application of positive or negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The glands and sub-glands also are directly affected by negative or positive microvita, which in this way influence the hormone secretions as well as the nerve cells or nerve fibres.  One may gain or lose memory or gain or lose strength as a result of positive or negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><b>14) Question</b>:  What are the possible psychological effects of the application of positive or negative microvita, and how and why do they take place?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: The psychological impact of microvita occurs due to their influence on the plexii, and through the plexii all the three types of vrttis (propensities of the mind) are affected &ndash; pro-physical propensities, psychic propensities and pro-spiritual propensities. All the fifty vrttis are affected by positive or negative microvita. The positive microvita, being pro-ectoplasmic, can move both towards the subtler existence of the human spirit and also towards the cruder manifestations of human existence, but negative microvita, being pro-matter, can move only downwards.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Negative microvita can function directly at the physico-psychic plexus (at the Vishuddha Cakra) but they cannot move upwards to the occult plexus (at the Guru Cakra). Only with the application of force by a powerful personality, can they be raised to the lunar plexus (at the A&#x301;jin&#x32D;a Cakra).  This raising of negative microvita above the physico-psychic plexus is called &ldquo;rusti&rdquo; or &ldquo;risti&rdquo;.  The application of negative microvita on the human mind deranges the mind and causes many psychic ailments such as eccentricity, schizophrenia, mania, melancholia, etc. In the case of positive microvita, the reaction takes place after they cross the lunar plexus, both in female and male bodies.  Only positive microvita can touch the lunar plexus and be elevated up to the occult plexus. They start their journey in the lunar plexus, and as they move upwards they increase their speed and bring about acceleration in spiritual progress, both in the case of males and females. (Positive microvita may also be used for intellectual development and for imparting certain occult powers.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The lunar plexus is the highest point of positive microvita, but if they are raised upwards to the occult plexus, this is called &ldquo;krpa&#x301;&rdquo; (grace).  And raising positive microvita from the lunar plexus to the pinnacled point of human glory is called &ldquo;karun&#x301;a&#x301;&rdquo;. Without krpa&#x301; there cannot be karun&#x301;a&#x301;; there cannot be any galloping jump. You should always try to avoid rusti, the raising of negative microvita, and always try to receive the glamour of krpa&#x301; or karun&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph --><b>15) Question</b>:  What will happen to microvita at the boiling point, and at freezing temperatures?  Will they die?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: No, they will undergo contraction and hibernation at freezing temperature and expansion and hibernation at boiling temperature.  Negative microvita will die a natural death after their natural life span.  In order to kill negative microvita before the end of their life span, the number of positive microvita has to be increased by good thinking and sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (spiritual practice).  Only by increasing the number of positive microvita is the unnatural death of negative microvita possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->If under extreme conditions of temperature microvita died, then some of the diseases now prevalent would have ceased to exist, but this has not happened. Rather, diseases have become more complicated &ndash; malaria has become malignant malaria.  During the First World War the decaying bodies of dead soldiers attracted negative microvita from other stars and thus the influenza disease originated.  Even now influenza is fatal to human beings in cold countries.  Influenza has a natural duration of four days whether medicine is taken or not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->When negative microvita devour the positive microvita of a diseased person, then that person dies.  Medicines only reduce the pain caused by disease in different parts of the body, and so it is not proper to say that medicine cures a disease. The disease can be cured only when the numbers of positive microvita are increased, and they devour the negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->There are certain person who can cure diseases merely by touch. The science behind this is also the application of positive microvita. And the cause of the decomposition of anything over time is negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: There is no doubt that the medicine prepared in a sentient environment by sentient people, from a medium or mother tincture which is also prepared in a sentient environment, will attract more positive microvita than ordinary medicines, so it will have a much greater effect in curing a patient.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If a person contracts a disease caused by negative microvita before initiation and does dhya&#x301;na sincerely after initiation, the disease will not spread but be contained. However, for different types of diseases one has to follow different food restrictions and practice dhya&#x301;na at specific times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->If a person contracts a disease caused by negative microvita after initiation, does dhya&#x301;na perfectly and follows certain food restrictions, the disease will be completely cured. Dhya&#x301;na attracts many positive microvita. Negative microvita can only be controlled by positive microvita. The positive microvita eat the negative microvita and this is the reason why the disease is cured. For example, if a person is suffering from jaundice, a disease caused by negative microvita, and if dhya&#x301;na is practised perfectly, the disease will be cured very quickly. In the case of cancer, say stomach cancer, certain food restrictions will have to be strictly followed. When pain starts in the stomach one should sit for dhya&#x301;na, but just prior to this one should take some juice from a sweet tasting, not a sour tasting fruit. After performing dhya&#x301;na, one should take another drink which is different from the first drink. The patient should also avoid any food which causes gas in the stomach, such as pappad, cauliflower, cabbage, turnip, etc.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Human beings came here one million years ago, but the history of civilization starts from the time of the Rg Veda, fifteen thousand years ago.  From one million years ago to fifteen thousand years ago &ndash; for so many years, nine hundred and eighty-five thousand years, between the Miocene and the Oligocene ages &ndash; was human society in a dormant state?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Humans invented pictorial letters less than seven thousand years ago. A full-fledged civilization, with the four symbols of advancement &ndash; agriculture, the wheel, dress and script &ndash; started seven thousand years ago. Is there any role of microvita, positive or negative? It is another question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->With regard to civilization, there has been little progress during the long span of nine hundred and eighty-five thousand years. All the progress has taken place within the last fifteen thousand years, from the time of the Rg Veda, the oldest unwritten book of the world. (At that time people  could not write).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Do microvita influence the mind first, or matter first, of any human or living structure? Negative microvita can function directly at the physico-psychic plexus, but they cannot reach even directly to the occult plexus.  Only positive microvita can touch the lunar plexus and they may be elevated up to the occult plexus, but negative microvita may be elevated to the lunar plexus by another course. If negative microvita affect the mind, the mind may undergo derangement, but negative microvita cannot affect the mind directly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Positive microvita may be used for intellectual development and for imparting certain occult powers, but not for spiritual power or spiritual development. Suppose a man is deaf and dumb. As the functions of hearing and speech are controlled by nerve cells or nerve fibres, they are activated with the help of nerve cells or nerve fibres.  Nerve cells are controlled with the help of the lunar plexus.  Positive microvita may function directly up to the lunar plexus, but there at the lunar plexus, if positive microvita are to influence the nerve cells, they require some special power. Positive microvita cannot do something supernatural with the help of the nerve cells &ndash; they require some special power of some powerful person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Suppose the Sadguru is saying something, and the deaf or dumb man wants to hear it but cannot. If one concentrates the mind on vara&#x301;bhaya mudra&#x301;, there will be the direct effect of positive microvita on the auricular or other nerve cells and also on the controlling cells, and it may be that all of a sudden he may get back the power of hearing.  One should look towards these two mudra&#x301;s and not to anything else.  Microvita are radiated through these two mudra&#x301;s. This is the inner secret.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This is supernatural, but not illogical.  Certainly it is supernatural because it does not come within the scope of natural phenomena.  Here the inner secret does not lie with microvita, it depends on something else.<!-- /block --></p>

Did you mark that after Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (DMC) the speed has accelerated? This is the effect of positive microvita through these two mudra&#x301;s.<!-- /block --></p>

During this DMC, some boys mentally expressed that we should go on fighting. Now see our boys and girls will go on fighting, and fight in the realm of spirituality means victory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The highest point up to which negative microvita can function is the physico-psychic plexus, but with the application of some force they can be raised up to the lunar plexus.  This raising is called &ldquo;risti&rdquo; or &ldquo;rusti&rdquo;.  The lunar plexus is the highest point of positive microvita, but if positive microvita are raised above this point, it is called &ldquo;krpa&#x301;&rdquo;. That is, raising positive microvita from the lunar plexus to the occult plexus is called &ldquo;krpa&#x301;&rdquo;.

In the case of women where the mind is very sentimental, death may take place even in the case of positive microvita. In the case of positive microvita, good reactions take place after they move above the lunar plexus. Positive microvita increase their speed above the lunar plexus. Spiritual advancement is accelerated after crossing the lunar plexus, both in the case of male bodies and female bodies. The recipient should be vegetarian, not carnivorous. Those who follow a non- vegetarian diet are not fit for the application of positive microvita.

<a name="17..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Microvita may affect the glands and sub-glands or the nuclei of the nerve cells, and even the transformation of species and the transformation of sex may occur. Microvita may directly affect the plexii, and through the plexii the mental propensities or vrttis are affected. Vrttis or propensities are of three types &ndash; pro-physical propensities, psychic propensities and pro-spiritual propensities. All these three types of vrttis are affected.  A person may become eccentric or experience a reaction of schizophrenia, mania or melancholia, or one may experience both psychic and physical disease.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Microvita make no difference or find no difference amongst different living beings. In living beings with complex structures there are different glands and sub-glands which secrete different types of hormones. Microvita develop, invigorate, increase or decrease the hormone secretions of these glands and sub-glands, therefore developed beings &ndash; physically and psychologically complex beings &ndash; have greater scope to progress through the aid of microvita than undeveloped creatures. This is the difference between the effect of microvita on developed creatures and the effect on undeveloped creatures. Let us take an example. On a moonlit night light is showered equally on one and all, but not everyone can utilize that light properly. The moon cannot be blamed for this. Similarly, microvita emanating from the cosmic factor are for one and all.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="20..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>Answer</b>: Microvita pervade both the ectoplasmic and endoplasmic worlds, and their presence creates various wavelengths. Waves are created when microvita move through the media of inferences. Inferences are the major waves, but sub-waves are created in them by moving microvita. The major waves function as the controlling waves for the sub-waves. When there is a change in the wavelength of a controlling wave, the entire inference, with all its qualities, gets transmuted. However, if there is a change in the wavelengths of the sub-waves only, the qualities contained in the major wave &ndash; that is, in the inference &ndash; change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->For example, solid objects contain all the fundamental factors, hence they carry the five inferences of smell, taste, form, touch and sound. If the microvita moving through the particular smell inference of a solid object are changed without effecting the major wavelength, the solid would not be changed because  there would be no change in the major wavelength, although there would be a qualitative change in all the five attributes of it. But if the major wavelength &ndash; that is, the inferential wave &ndash; of the solid object undergoes a change, all the inferences will be transmuted accordingly.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Microvitum and its Effect on Human Body and Human Mind.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As you know, microvitum moves through the media of inferences and the difference, rather the fundamental difference, between positive microvitum and negative microvitum is that positive microvitum starts its journey in the lunar plexus and moves both ways &ndash; towards the subtler existence of human spirit and also towards the cruder manifestations or emanations of human existence &ndash; but the negative microvitum cannot move above the physico-psychic plexus and can only move downwards. Indirectly, it can affect the lunar plexus, but directly it cannot.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In cosmic space, both positive and negative microvita move through the inferences of the cosmic mind &ndash; the internal inferences of the cosmic mind &ndash; and also with the help of the cruder portion of ectoplasms. As you know, in the ectoplasmic structure there is the effect of both spirit and physicality. The cruder portion is closely associated with the physical structure and the subtler portion with spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In a particular plexus, say in the basal plexus, the desire to increase human longings is created or encouraged both by positive and negative microvita. But the encouragement from the negative microvita is towards crudeness, and that of positive microvita is for the conversion or transmutation of crude desires into subtler ones. The desires to attain success in all worldly affairs are created by both positive and negative ones. But the negative ones make a person selfish and the positive ones make a person a universalist. Like this, the longing for physicality or physical wealth comes from negative microvitum, and the longing to attain something cosmic comes from positive microvitum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->It is the characteristic of humans &ndash; rather it is the characteristic of all living beings &ndash; to free themselves from all fetters of smallness. The desire to be free in the realm of worldly socio-politico-economic life comes from negative microvitum, and the desire to attain all-round liberation comes from positive microvitum. Similarly, in the fluidal plexus, the indifferent attitude for something comes from both the types of microvita, but this indifferent attitude for something good comes from negative microvita and the indifferent attitude for something crude comes from positive microvita. Want of a sense of responsibility &ndash; that is, irresponsibility &ndash; comes from negative microvitum when it is for something noble, and from positive microvitum when it is for something limited. Likewise, one tolerates injustice when the inspiration comes from negative microvitum, and one does not tolerate injustice when inspired by positive microvitum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Not to recognize anything beyond the jurisdiction of the senses or the sensory organs &ndash; this spirit or this mentality comes from negative microvita and the spirit &ldquo;not to recognize anything transitory or moving as absolute&rdquo; from positive microvita. These propensities are associated with the fundamental spirit of the fluidal plexus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Similarly, both these positive and negative microvita function in the solar plexus, in the aerial plexus, in the physico-psychic plexus, in the lunar plexus and in the occult plexus. But in the case of the lunar plexus, positive microvitum can function independently, but in the case of negative microvitum, it cannot go directly beyond the jurisdiction of the physico-psychic plexus. If it wants to go beyond, it will have an indirect effect on the lunar plexus but no direct effect. So in the case of negative microvita, microvital spirit may be operative only if done by a powerful entity, otherwise not. Similarly, psychic diseases associated with the lunar plexus may appear when the force of the negative microvita is far bigger or greater than that of the positive microvita working in the lunar plexus. (If a person&#146;s lunar plexus is badly affected by negative microvita, one is commonly known as a &ldquo;lunatic&rdquo; or &ldquo;moon-struck&rdquo;. People were and are under the impression that this type of mental ailment comes from the moon or from moonlight.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->To fight out the effect of negative microvitum on the lunar plexus, one is to encourage right thinking, good thinking and meditation. A person doing spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or meditation cannot be attacked by negative microvitum. A person in the stage of meditation cannot be attacked by negative microvitum, but positive microvitum can work directly in the lunar plexus and it can move, rather it does move, up to the occult plexus (the Guru Cakra). But it cannot go beyond the occult plexus &ndash; it cannot touch the macro-propensive plexus. (Micro-propensive activities mean activities concerning the propensities of microcosms and macro-propensive activities mean the activities concerning the propensities for the all-round development of all created beings.)<!-- /block --></p>

In the universe, when the collective strength of negative microvita becomes more than that of positive microvita, the world moves towards degeneration, and where the collective effect of the positive microvita is greater than that of negative microvita, spiritual revolution takes place. If the lunar plexus is attacked by negative microvita, the world moves fast towards degeneration, and that degeneration is now active in this universe.<!-- /block --></p>

So you will have to become more active and work jointly with maximum speed and maximum zeal to do something concrete with the help of positive microvita. Negative microvita will not help you in this connection.<!-- /block --></p>

Due to the movement of these numerous celestial bodies &ndash; movement which undergoes retardation or acceleration &ndash; a multitude of various types of visible and invisible rays are emanated.

Human beings will have to remain unaffected by undesirable microvita and the negative effects of the macrocosmic rays&#146; microcosmic blendings, X-rays, Z-rays or cosmic rays. So that human beings absorb only their beneficial effects and advance by avoiding their negative effects, they must be aware of and understand their cyclic order.

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="23..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The topic of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Mobility and Movement of Microvita.&rdquo;  As you know, everything in this universe moves.  Speed is not only the essence of life, speed represents existence; that is, there is speed, there is movement wherever there is the existential faculty &ndash;  both animate and inanimate entities are to move.  The position of microvita is just on the silver lining of animate and inanimate.  Microvita also move and they recognize no inter-planetary, no inter-spatial, no celestial hindrance, impediment or barrier.  They move.  How do they move?  Each and every movement of the universe is of systaltic order.  It is not just like a straight line, it is to some extent angular, of angular nature; and where the speed is less &ndash; that is, the speed is not the dominating factor &ndash; it is a bit circular.  Where it is circular in Sam&#x301;skrta it is called &ldquo;kala&#x301;&rdquo; and &ldquo;ka&#x301;sta&#x301;&rdquo;.  Otherwise it is angular.  The greater the speed, the less will be the angle created by it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Microvita move; they recognize no impediment, no barrier, physical or supra-physical; but as their media are of inferential nature, so the movement has something to do with the physical world. As I have clearly told you last year, microvita are of both positive and negative character; those which are of negative character move in the range of physicality and touch the arena of the psychic world, but they cannot cross the threshold of the psychic world. This is the case with negative microvita. Positive microvita move freely in the physical and psychic worlds, and touch the border of the spiritual world, but cannot cross the threshold of the spiritual world.  So for elevation or acceleration, or rather accelerated movement in the spiritual world, microvita may help one indirectly, but direct help in the spiritual world comes from the great grace of the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the physical world, when negative microvita move, they move in systaltic order, creating angles, and where the speed is much accelerated, the angles are smaller, less in degrees.  In their movement they touch all the static items of the physical world, or in the case of living beings, the static portions of the physical body, and these negative microvita maintain a sort of adjustment with the staticity of this physical world and also of the unit physical framework.  But where one angle is in the realm of staticity, what will be the next angle?  Certainly it should be in the realm of mutativity. It tries to maintain a particular type of adjustment with the mutative world, and as a result of the angle created by negative microvita in the mutative world or in the mutative portion of any structure, that mutative entity is to undergo a certain metamorphosis.  Its arena decreases, its density increases, and as a result it is slowly transmuted into staticity, and the realm of the neighbouring staticity increases. Staticity in its own realm increases both in area and density.  The mutative portion also undergoes certain changes and metamorphoses, as a result of which the sentienthood of the sentient portions of the physical world is also changed. That is why one should try to be pure not only in body but in mind also, because a mind engaged in degenerating thought invites negative microvita.  Good company, good books, good literature, good songs, kiirtanas (devotional chanting) elevate the mind and the mind becomes sanctified. That is why negative microvita do not get much scope to touch the mutative and sentient portions of the structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So we see that in the case of negative microvita, not only is the static portion strengthened, but the mutative portion becomes weak and the sentient portion also becomes weak. In the case of the movement of negative microvita, the movement is always of systaltic or angular nature and never of circular nature.  In the case of positive microvita, you know positive microvita can move freely in the physical world or in any physical structure, and they can move freely in psychic structures also, but they cannot cross the arena, the threshold, of the sentient world.  In their movement in the physical structure or in the external physical world, the movement is certainly of angular character, but in the psychic world it is a bit of circular nature. If the mind remains engaged in elevating thoughts, that circular movement is converted into angular movement, that is, the kala&#x301; and ka&#x301;sta&#x301; become angular; and the positive microvita do not touch the static portion of any structure &ndash; they create angles in the sentient portion also as a result of which the neighbouring mutative portion is also influenced; and as a result the static portion also loses its staticity to some extent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So we find that positive microvitum sanctifies the physical body, sanctifies the psychic body and helps in spiritual elevation, not only of the human body but also of any living body; and it helps in the thought of Parama Purus&#x301;a, it helps the Prati-sain&#x32D;cara portion of Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s thought or conation in creating a better world.  We should always try to invite positive microvita for our all-around and integrated development, not merely of a particular human body or a particular living body, but for the all-around development of all existences; that is, all existential faculties are to be benefited by this positive microvitum.  Inanimate objects will become animate, carbon atoms sleeping in an inanimate body will get life, will get the stir of vitality in them, and that vitality is slowly to be transmuted into a gigantic living structure like a human being.  You should remember that here we are to invite positive microvita for our all-around progress and all-around elevation, and we are to denounce the advancement of negative microvita because it is detrimental to the cause of a sweet and beautiful universe.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhagokula</b>. Gandha + gokula. Gandhagokula means &ldquo;any living creature which emits a pleasant smell.&rdquo; You know that there are certain living creatures which emit a kind of smell &ndash; whether pleasant or unpleasant &ndash; from their bodies. This is nothing but the secretion of a particular type of hormone from specific glands. Moles emit a foul smell from the secretions from the hormones of their glands. When moles move, a kind of foul smelling secretion which seems repulsive to the human nose is emitted from certain lymphatic glands in their bodies. The repulsive smell that comes out of a tiger&#146;s body does not come out of a cat&#146;s body due to differences in the hormone secretions. Very little of this smell is emitted from the bodies of wild cats, and this sort of smell is not conspicuous in civet-cats, but the bodies of smaller creatures belonging to the same family emit this type of repulsive smell. The hyena, for example, though smaller than a tiger, emits this kind of foul smell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the case of any male animal, fluids from the glands emit a bad smell, but when those animals are castrated they do not emit such a smell.  Hence, the good or bad smell of animals means the good or bad smell of the fluids secreted by their glands.  In the case of billy-goats, the foul smell emitted from their bodies is very prominent, but in the case of a castrated billy-goat, this smell is conspicuously absent. Those who consume a lot of onions, garlic, [[d&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;ga&#x301;r kalmii [land-growing kalmii],]] unchewed vegetable stems and tough meat are bound to emit a foul smell while secreting hormones from their glands. Those who are careful about the food they eat but do not allow themselves to perspire, will also smell bad. (Usually perspiration has no bad smell of its own, but if it is not washed off the body within about 45 minutes after it is emitted, it putrefies and creates a foul smell. This is why it is best to wash one&#146;s body immediately after one perspires, or rub the body with a towel.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The physical bodies of those who practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or do a lot of kiirtana (devotional chanting) secrete fluids from certain parts of the Ana&#x301;ha&#x301;ta Cakra, Vishuddha Cakra and A&#x301;jin&#x32D;a Cakra.  The smell of these secretions is somewhat, but not exactly, like a light smell of jasmine flower or ripe jackfruit. The bodies of those with a devotional nature or who regularly practise yoga usually emit this kind of fragrance. In fact, the emission of a sweet aroma is one of the criteria for ascertaining the degree of one&#146;s devotion to God. If a person sits for a while in a lonely place and tries to feel the presence of Parama Purus&#x301;a, one senses something like a sweet, light smell. This is nothing but the accumulation of an aromatic secretion on the tip of the nose. Although this experience is purely physiological, what else can it be called except an expression of divine grace?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There are a few creatures whose bodies by nature emit a smell like the fragrance of ba&#x301;dsha&#x301;bhog or ka&#x301;n&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;liibhog (popular Indian varieties of fine rice used for preparing sweet delicacies). Gandhagokulas are such creatures. These wild animals are between a fox and a mole. Like owls, they cannot see clearly in broad daylight &ndash; they are almost day-blind &ndash; but they are not night-blind. As a rule, their visual capacity is very limited during the day, and in addition they do not dare to come out openly during the daytime due to fear of dogs.  When they come out at night and sit somewhere for five or ten minutes, the next day  that place will remain full of the smell of scented sun- dried rice for a long time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The gandhagokula is a creature of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h (that part of Bengal to the west of the Bha&#x301;girathi river extending up to the Pa&#x301;rasnath Hills). There was a time when these creatures were found in abundance in Burdwan, Midnapore, Bankura and Manbhum districts.  The cruelty of human beings is accelerating the extinction of these historic creatures. They are very mild by nature, which is why people can easily kill them. If proper steps are not taken immediately to ensure their survival, they may vanish from the face of the earth in the near future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhasarpa</b>.  You know that although the cobra and the black cobra belong to the same genus, but they are of different species. Black cobras are comparatively thin, blackish and prefer to remain in jungles, bushes or the boundary ridges of fields, away from human habitation. Though their bodies are somewhat cool, their tempers are extremely hot. Their bodies do not emit a good smell; rather they emit a sort of pungent smell, perhaps due to their frayed temper&#8230; due to their easily excitable nerves. If one loses one&#146;s temper, one may experience a kind of pungent smell from one&#146;s body.  Sometimes we get this type of pungent smell from the bodies of courageous people. If they are virtuous, their bodies emit a kind of sharp smell like that of many marigold flowers, but if they are not virtuous, they smell something like wet earth after a light shower in the early part of the rainy season.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->One of the differences between the nature a cobra and a black cobra is that a cobra likes to live in houses, particularly in abandoned houses. While they do live in bushes, the jungle or on the embankments of ponds and water tanks, their favourite haunt is dilapidated houses. A black cobra is more poisonous than a cobra but less poisonous than a shaunkhacur (the biggest variety of cobra). A cobra does not usually attack people, but if somebody accidentally steps on one, it will strike in self- defence. In old age when its tail drops off, it finds it difficult to move, and in that state it does not hiss or strike at any creature. It survives on overripe bananas, worms, insects, milk and food rich in fat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In rural Bengal these cobras are called &ldquo;ba&#x301;stusa&#x301;p&rdquo; (meaning snakes which reside in human dwellings). There are many people who do not kill these snakes if they are living in their homes, however it is not wise to knowingly allow poisonous snakes to remain inside one&#146;s house. Saha sarpen&#x301;a grhe na va&#x301;sah. &ldquo;You may do whatever you like with your enemies, but do not live under the same roof with them.&rdquo; There are some people who leave overripe bananas, milk and other edibles in one corner of the house for snakes of this type. We say jokingly, &ldquo;Milk and bananas for a good natured cobra.&rdquo; As they grow old, cobras and black cobras secrete a certain kind of hormone from their bodies which smells like sun-dried rice. If you notice this kind of smell in any room of a house, you should look to see if there is a hole somewhere with a snake hiding in it. As a rule, snakes cannot make holes by themselves. They occupy rat holes either by devouring the rats or driving them away. Anyway, the type of cobra (ka&#x301;ligokhro, padmagokhro, cakragokhro, etc.) which gives out a smell like that of sun-dried rice, is called &ldquo;gandhasarpa&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhaghra&#x301;n&#x301;a</b>. Gandha + ghra&#x301; + lyut&#x301; = gandhaghra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;. Etymologically, gandhaghra&#x301;n&#x301;a means sensing any smell. The smell inferences vary from object to object.  They vary more according to intensity and lightness, but they also vary according to extent or limit. After a living entity has died, the parts of its body separate from the main structure because of a lack of centralized control. The various parts become disconnected from one another. The different stages and sub-stages of separation continue till the fragments finally merge into their respective original sources (that is, pain&#x32D;ca ma&#x301;ha&#x301;bhuta &ndash; the solid, liquid, luminous, aerial and ethereal factors). Through this process a corpse or carcass decomposes, and at each succeeding stage of decomposition, a kind of foul smell starts being emitted. The emission of stinking smells continues till the various parts of the corpse merge in the different quinquelemental factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Whatever be the nature of the smell inferences &ndash; whether pleasant or unpleasant &ndash; human beings receive them according to their intensity or lightness and depending upon the capacity of the nostrils to sense smell.  Whether the smell inferences are of a pleasing or offensive nature depends on one&#146;s inherent reactive momenta. According to some of those who like fish, uncooked fish smells offensive, but after the fish have been cooked, the offensive smell disappears and the cooked fish taste delicious. But those who do not like rotten or decomposed food say that when food smells repulsive, how can one even think of eating it! It is a question of reactive momenta. The vulture has no objection to eating rotten flesh, but the mynah bird has much objection, and so does the dove.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The act of assimilating or receiving the smell of an object according to the capacity of one&#146;s smell na&#x301;diis (psychic energy channels) as well as one&#146;s nostrils, is called &ldquo;gandhaghra&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Another meaning of gandhaghra&#x301;n&#x301;a is &ldquo;that which helps one to receive smells&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the nostrils or the nose.  The Latin words &ldquo;nose&rdquo;, &ldquo;nasal&rdquo; and &ldquo;nostril&rdquo; came from the Vedic words &ldquo;na&#x301;sa&#x301;&rdquo; and &ldquo;nastril&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhacelika&#x301;</b>. Gandha + cel + kan + ta&#x301; = gandhacelika&#x301;. Literally, the words &ldquo;cela&rdquo;, &ldquo;celi&rdquo;, &ldquo;celii&rdquo; and &ldquo;celika&#x301;&rdquo; mean &ldquo;attractive objects which draw people by dint of their attractive colour or smell or both.&rdquo; At weddings in ancient Bengal, young brides used to wear dazzling red saris made of simul cotton. These saris were not very durable, but for weddings the red celi made the small bride look quite attractive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The other meaning of gandhacelika&#x301; is &ldquo;sweet scented musk accumulated in and around the navel portion of the musk deer.&rdquo; The musk deer lives in cold countries and looks ugly, but the hormone secreted from its glands gradually accumulates in the navel. Eventually the liquid portion evaporates and the remainder becomes hard, and the harder it gets, the stronger its fragrance becomes. The female deer does not have this musk scent. The male deer becomes so intoxicated with its own fragrance that it goes berserk searching for the source of the smell. It fails to realize that the source of the smell is its own navel. Ultimately, after much running, the exhausted musk deer falls down dead. Sometimes businessmen collect the dead bodies, cut out the navels and grind them into powder. Various medicines and cosmetics are prepared from the musk. These medicines preserve the heat in the bodies of dying people for a little while and help to keep them alive for a short time.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhaja</b>. Gandhaja means &ldquo;a very small worm born in a foul smell.&rdquo;  Ancient people were not acquainted with microvita, otherwise they would have said that gandhaja means microvita carried by the smell inference. Smell &ndash; whether pleasant or repulsive &ndash; is an entirely relative factor. A smell is called &ldquo;pleasant&rdquo; or &ldquo;repulsive&rdquo; depending upon one&#146;s likes and dislikes caused by the inherent reactive momenta in the human mind. This is not only true for human beings. The vibrations of smell are conveyed to the nerve cells in the brain to produce the sense of smell in all creatures whose nostrils have the capacity to carry minute smell particles or the waves created by smell. The nature of a type of smell is determined by one&#146;s innate reactive momenta and the vibration of the smell conveyed to the sense organs. The capacity to carry smell vibrations is highly evolved in many undeveloped creatures.  For instance, a tiger or a wolf is inferior to a human being in all respects, but the capacity to sense smell is not less developed in tigers and wolves than in human beings.  So, living beings consider some odours pleasant and others repulsive due to their peculiar reactive momenta or the degree of the capacity of their propensities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When the corpses of dead animals are dumped in a boneyard, one avoids the place, and if one is forced to go there under the pressure of circumstances, one will cover one&#146;s nose with a handkerchief. But as soon as the foul smell from a decomposed corpse enters the nostrils of a vulture, it flies in the direction of the smell and easily locates the corpse. For the vulture, the smell of the corpse is not foul, and the rotting flesh of the corpse is not harmful for its health either. But if a human being eats rotten flesh, his or her death is inevitable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The differences between pleasant and repulsive smells amongst human beings depend upon their inherent reactive momenta. For example, an inhabitant of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is repulsed by the smell of dried fish, but there are many regions in the world where people think the smell of dried fish is like a fragrant bouquet. This difference between the sense perception of one person and another is due to differences in the inherent reactive momenta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There are people who cut slices of flesh off dead animals in order to cook and eat them.  Once I observed a vulture eating part of the rotting corpse of a cow as a girl cut off another part and carried it away in a basket. Who knows if that rotten flesh was sold to a nearby restaurant or hotel! Was there any difference between the behaviour of the vulture and the girl? With my own eyes I saw the girl cut off the flesh with one hand and drive the vulture away with the other hand, and the girl was a human being! Although the flesh was not completely rotten at the time, but there was definitely a foul smell coming from it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So, a pleasant or repulsive smell depends on whether the type of vibration it produces in the mind is pleasant or repulsive.  When the vital energy or pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h  &ndash; the controlling force of the body &ndash; wanes, and when the psychic force &ndash; the controller of the vital energy &ndash; also wanes, the physical body starts to decompose and disintegrate.  One part of the body becomes separated from the other parts because the force that controls the vital energy is conspicuously absent in a dead body.  If the vital energy or the psychic energy wanes and is lost, a person very quickly becomes inert and lifeless, and we say that the vital energy of the person has become dormant. In that state it is not possible for the person to connect one part of the body to another part and correlate one sense organ with another. Likewise, if the vital energy remains largely intact but the psychic power is considerably weakened, then it will not be possible to control the vital energy of the body because the vital energy is a material force &ndash; a blind force. In the absence of proper directives by the psychic power to the vital energy, the person will find it impossible to control the physical body &ndash; one cannot do anything. Vital energy is somewhat like the power of electricity. It is the psychic power of human beings that controls electricity, otherwise the electricity may cause serious problems at any moment.  So, either there is first the death of the mind and then the death of the body, or there is the suspension of the vital energy in the body and then the death of the mind. When there is the death of both the body and mind, that is actual death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In many people, clear physical awareness persists to the last moment of breathing, so we say that they died a conscious death. In such cases, the mind functions for some time even after the death of the vital energy. Even if one is declared physically dead after clinical tests, the mind does not die simultaneously. If by some means or another the life force or the vital energy is revived, one may survive.  Similarly, if one is declared mentally dead, the vital energy does not die simultaneously.  A physician may be able to revive the lost psychic energy with the help of the vital energy.  Hence, it is advisable not to cremate a dead body until the death of both the body and the mind.  Usually people cremate a dead body after only one of the forces has left the body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->As a result of the loss of control by the vital energy directly and the psychic power indirectly in the human body, the different parts of the body start to disintegrate and merge into the five fundamental factors. Until this process of disintegration and merger is complete, some kind of foul smell continues to be emitted during this process.  When a sub-part of the body separates from the whole, at that point a huge quantity of foul smell is released. The smell particles enter the nostrils, and after they move through the smell carrying afferent nerves by producing a sympathetic vibration in the nerve fibres, which in turn creates a similar vibration in the nerve cells, one perceives the foul smell. The subtle entities which are created to consume the rotting objects and are carried by the medium of smell are negative microvita. Similarly, the subtle entities which are created to consume the sweet, pleasant smells are positive microvita. I have already said that both sweet and foul smells are relative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Just as a foul smell is produced as a result of internal disintegration due to the lack of vital energy and psychic power, a sweet smell arises when, as a result of the combination of physical energy and psychic power, two or more entities synthesize. Positive microvita come there.  Sometimes even a static object is connected to various mutative or sentient objects through the process of disintegration, resulting in a pleasant smell.  By static object, I mean that which comes within the scope of ordinary sensory perception. A mutative object means that which comes within sensory perception with a little effort, and a sentient object means that which comes within sensory perception after long or short mental concentration or meditation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Whatever can be attained through a brief period of meditation can certainly be attained through prolonged meditation or prolonged ordinary penance. When spiritual aspirants develop a certain degree of psychic concentration through incantation and thereby attract the blissful mood of Parama Purus&#x301;a, it is also a type of penance.  This is called &ldquo;incantation&rdquo; or &ldquo;japa&rdquo;. Similarly, when human beings surrender all their concentrated mental power into the cosmic infinitude and become free from microcosmic bondages, that is also a kind of penance, and is called &ldquo;dhya&#x301;na yoga.&rdquo; In order to penetrate into the subtle world, static energy will have to be transformed and assimilated through the processes of incantation, japa yoga and dhya&#x301;na yoga. Thus, a spiritual aspirant will have to saturate his or her mental pabulum with the greatest amount of cosmic ideation. To ordinary people, this is usually conveyed though such terms as &ldquo;japa yoga&rdquo; and &ldquo;dhya&#x301;na yoga&rdquo;. In fact, the terms &ldquo;japa&rdquo; and &ldquo;dhya&#x301;na&rdquo; represent the vastness of cosmic ideation only partially, not fully. It is disadvantageous for both the teacher and the disciple if cosmic ideation is not conveyed with immensely suggestive language, hence the custom of conveying ideas symbolically. Teachers are forced to convey the value of incantation through the term &ldquo;japa&rdquo;.  In the same way the word &ldquo;dhya&#x301;na&rdquo; has detailed explanations in karma yoga, dhya&#x301;na yoga, kriya yoga, karma dhya&#x301;na, anudhya&#x301;na, avidya&#x301; dhya&#x301;na, etc.  For all these various aspects of dhya&#x301;na, we loosely use the common term &ldquo;dhya&#x301;na&rdquo;. This japa yoga or dhya&#x301;na yoga which elevates human beings through constant self-analysis, obliterates the very existence of the non-spiritual, and expedites one&#146;s elevation into the supreme spiritual stance, is practised with the help of positive microvita by the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence, whatever might be one&#146;s intellectual attainment, the essence of everything is prapatti or complete surrender.  Without the wish of Parama Purus&#x301;a, not even the leaf of a tree moves &ndash; not even a blade of grass grows. The gradual ascension of a unit being towards the supreme spiritual stance which is helped by positive microvita, brings a kind of very pleasant smell.  Spiritual aspirants, at a particular stage, sense this smell. But it should be remembered that the sensation of smell is a minor thing &ndash; it is a mere drop of cosmic grace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So, pleasant and unpleasant smells are relative matters.  A standard which has been followed since ancient times is that a spiritual aspirant is required to concentrate on the A&#x301;jin&#x32D;a Cakra or the pituitary gland, and to try and bring his or her mind under control. The pleasant smell that arises through this process of meditation is highly attractive. The group of smells that creates pleasant feelings in the minds of those engaged in this type of yoga sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; are good smells, and all other smells are bad smells.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Microvitum, whether positive or negative, is a very subtle entity, hence it is conveyed through inferences.  The subtlest of these inferences is sound (which is accepted and conveyed by the auricular nerves, and is vibrated naturally by dynamic objects such as aerial waves, liquid waves, electromagnetic waves, etc.). Cruder than the sound inference is the inference of tactuality (which arises due to the touch of other objects).  Cruder than touch is the form inference (which is carried and received through light waves). Cruder than that is the inference of taste (which is the fluidity of a liquid substance).  Cruder than that is the inference of smell (which is conveyed by smell particles). Usually, the subtler the inference, the easier it is for it to convey positive microvita, and the cruder the inference, the easier it is for it to convey negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Love for the supreme is an innate tendency in all living beings, including human beings.  The sleeping divinity at the basal plexus or Mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra Cakra has a natural tendency to identify with Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  But there is something more to this. The movement of positive and negative microvita is determined by the following principle.  If smell, the crudest inference, is associated with something subtle, then it becomes an ideal carrier of positive microvita. If the same smell is associated with something crude, then it will ultimately create a wave of negative microvita.  Again, if someone makes a sound like &ldquo;ra, ra, ra &ndash; cha, cha, cha,&rdquo; or if someone sings, &ldquo;Follow my song! Let us sing and dance our way to hell,&rdquo; these are sound inferences, but they carry a very crude idea.  Hence, each and every sound inference is not necessarily an ideal carrier of positive microvita only.  Conversely, it cannot be said with certainty that each and every smell inference is an ideal carrier of negative microvita only. An intelligent person should select and absorb sound inferences associated with subtle ideas and avoid sound inferences associated with crude ideas. At the same time, they should effect the large scale emanation of subtle vibrations, and dissolve crude vibrations in the vast wave of cosmic ideas, leaving them to rest forever in the ocean of forgotten expressionlessness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The pervasive, stinking smell which results from the decomposition and disintegration of rotting animal or plant bodies attracts negative microvita. This negative microvita causes the creation of newer carbon atoms and other sub-atomic particles. These particles then create unicellar life, and sometimes, somewhere, multicellar heterogeneous life also. The origin, existence and disappearance of these entities are rooted in negative microvita.  Similarly, in ascending order, is the path of high grade spiritual practice &ndash; the path of supreme synthesis &ndash; for many diverse elements and ideas. This happens in the highest world of wisdom &ndash; in the highest world of intuition &ndash; beyond the domain of all kinds of dialectics. This is the path which human beings will have to select.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Those who opt for the path of synthesis are bound to enjoy some kind of spiritual aroma. This divine aroma can hardly be compared with any worldly smell. We can say that this divine aroma somewhat resembles the fragrance of a champak or magnolia flower, but people will have to remain satisfied with the description, &ldquo;somewhat resembles&rdquo;. If a spiritual aspirant concentrates his or her mind on particular parts of the Sahasrara Cakra or A&#x301;jin&#x32D;a Cakra (as learned from one&#146;s spiritual master) and practises meditation assiduously, one can and does enjoy the sweetness that lies in the different layers of the vast storehouse of divine aroma. But the most important thing to remember is this. Spiritual practice is not done to come in contact with divine smell &ndash; rather spiritual practices are performed to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. An ideal spiritualist will never ask for occult powers, which are devoid of even one percent of all the inferences. He or she will only ask for the controller of the cult, not the occult power.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->While mentioning the Sahasrara and A&#x301;jin&#x32D;a Cakras, one more thing should be explained. All kinds of spiritual experiences, both from the higher world and the comparatively lower worlds, are attained through the divine nectar secreted from the Sahasrara Cakra and A&#x301;jin&#x32D;a Cakra &ndash; the pineal gland and the pituitary gland.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Some people say that the spiritual realizations of the highest order are not attainable by women because the physical bodies of women are deficient. In this connection I wish to make it clear that there are some differences between the male and female bodies concerning certain crude physical propensities, but this is not the occasion to discuss this subject. If I ever get the scope to explain the nature of human propensities in detail, I may explain this topic in more detail. [See Yoga Psychology by P. R. Sarkar.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->It is a fact that there are differences between males and females concerning the lower glands and sub-glands, and the number of propensities also varies. As the direct controlling point of the lower glands and sub-glands, the A&#x301;jin&#x32D;a Cakra and Sahasrara Cakra in the male and female bodies have some subtle difference, but as I said, only with regard to certain physical propensities, such as the propensity of attachment to objects and individuals (where a friend is an intimate friend, and an enemy is a mortal enemy). In the spiritual and psycho-spiritual or supra-mental spheres, there is no difference between men and women.  That is to say, the highest spiritual realization accessible to men is also accessible to women. There is no reason whatsoever to deprive women of the highest spiritual experiences or to impede their spiritual progress.  Those who say that only men are entitled to liberation or salvation and that women will have to be reborn as males are saying something totally irrational. This sort of statement betrays their underlying exploitative sentiments, and is designed to promote their selfish individual and collective interests.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhalolupa</b>. I have already said that all living and non-living objects in this world have smell. In fact, every living being has a collective smell as well as an individual smell which is determined by one&#146;s inherent reactive momenta, food habits and physio-psycho-spiritual practices. Flies, being guided by smell, move to various objects.  In the human body, the smell which emanates from a subtle part is different from that which emanates from a crude portion. The negative microvita of various diseases which are carried by smell also spread disease. Through smell, flies can easily understand where a wound or boil is located on the human body, so they start hovering around the ulcerous wound. This practice is more applicable to the large variety of flies which hover around overripe mangoes and jackfruits on rainy days in India, than to the small variety of flies. The large variety has a greater attraction for smell. If you break open a ripe jackfruit in the late spring, you will find that small flies will soon come buzzing around, but not the large ones. Large flies usually come on extremely damp, rainy days and hover around overripe or rotten mangoes and jackfruits.  After the mangoes and jackfruit season is over, they move to other regions.  This type of fly have a special capacity which is attracted by the smell inference and is called &ldquo;gandhalolupa&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

He wants to snap open the bondages of the microcosms. He wants to open the iron gate to their bondages.  Human beings cannot easily attract the Supreme Entity, from whom all kinds of emanations arise. Parama Purus&#x301;a, by dint of the five types of inferences, eternally calls living beings to keep the gates of their sense organs open. In this case, the inferences, whether sound, touch, form, taste or smell, are not the causes of bondages, rather they are the causes of liberation. The smell which inspires the human mind to move into the subtler realm brings the human mind into the closest contact with the Supreme Entity, the repository of all smell.  Parama Purus&#x301;a is sending out this call to the living beings through all the inferences.  When He sends His call through the inference of smell, He fills living beings with a  vast Macrocosmic resonance. This power of Parama Purus&#x301;a is called &ldquo;gandhabrhatii.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

It is claimed that diseases are caused by various types of virus. The word &ldquo;virus&rdquo; is somewhat defective. Instead, the term &ldquo;negative microvitum&rdquo; should be used. Negative microvita cause various ailments in the human body and mind and spreads them.  Negative microvita are not only carried by the inference of smell, but also by the other inferences of sound, touch, form and taste. They not only move on the planet Earth, but they also travel freely from one plant to another.  Some diseases of this type are spread through vision.  Some ocular diseases are contracted by looking  at the infected eyes of a diseased person, while some other diseases are transmitted by the smell of the particular disease &ndash; like cholera, for instance. Although the negative microvita that cause small pox and influenza are carried by all kinds of inferences, they are mostly transmitted by taste, colour and smell. This type of negative microvita is called &ldquo;gandha&#x301;ks&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

On the other hand, disembodied souls attain the status of pretayonis until they are reborn in other forms. That is, when people with many demerits die, they become pretayonis according to their defective mentality. These pretayonis are divided into several categories &ndash; durmukha, kabandha, madhyakapa&#x301;la, maha&#x301;kapa&#x301;la, brahmadaetya or brahmapisha&#x301;ca, a&#x301;ka&#x301;shiipreta, and pisha&#x301;ca.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It has already been stated that microvita move through tanma&#x301;tras, that is, the inferences of sound, touch, form, taste and smell.  These five inferences are the carriers of these microvita. The movement from sound to smell represents movement towards crudity, and the movement from smell to sound represents movement towards subtlety. Negative microvita prefer the smell tanma&#x301;tra&#x301; more than the sound tanma&#x301;tra&#x301;, and in the same way positive microvita prefer the sound tanma&#x301;tra&#x301; more than the smell tanma&#x301;tra&#x301;. In other words, negative microvita do not like the sound tanma&#x301;tra&#x301; as much as they like the smell tanma&#x301;tra&#x301;, and similarly positive microvita do not like the smell tanma&#x301;tra&#x301; as much as negative microvita do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Previously, in another context, I said that various kinds of negative microvita which have, up to now, been called a &ldquo;virus&rdquo;, damage human beings. Different diseases take the help of different kinds of tanma&#x301;tras.  From country to country, from planet to planet, and from the far distant frontiers of the universe, these negative microvita carry the seeds of destructive diseases. These varieties of negative microvita also spread mean-mindedness and negative psychic complexes.  Similarly, from various planets and distant nebula, varieties of positive microvita bring pious, sentient thoughts and elevating sentiments. Likewise, the pious aspirations and sentiments of a mighty personality and those of many individuals penetrate into the cosmic wave and spread throughout the universe with the help of these positive microvita.  Positive microvita convert milk into curd and thereby serve humanity. They also guide human sentiments and ideas along the path of synthesis so that these sentiments and ideas are eventually transmuted into pinnacled intellect. You may say that these positive microvita are the emanations of Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; the effulgence of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There are some diseases &ndash; and their number is not negligible &ndash; which are carried by the inference  of smell.  Most of the skin diseases and boils which have a bad smell are carried by the smell inference.  The disease of the laryngitis (in which the voice becomes hoarse and ulcers in the throat emit a foul smell) is invariably carried by the inference of smell. Those who sing for long periods of time or deliver lengthy speeches are likely to be attacked by laryngitis which is carried by negative microvita. This disease can be avoided or cured if sarvaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sana (shoulder stand) and matsyamudra&#x301; (fish pose) are practised regularly in ascending and descending order, then cloves and betel leaves are boiled together and the warm water is drunk through the nose, and the portion of the tongue near the uvula is then cleaned with the middle finger of the hand  while the water is still in the throat. Finally, the water should be ejected from the mouth.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Although the human mind and body are attacked via all the five inferences, virulent attacks come from the smell inference, and then next from the form inference.  Even if a decent man visits an area which is not usually frequently by decent gentlemen, his mind is bound to degenerate. When referring to &ldquo;evil company&rdquo;, good people include bad places. Negative microvita carried by the smell inference cannot easily influence the minds of those who are engaged in elevating their minds through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, those whose minds mostly roam in the upper plexii, or those who are keen to roam in the upper plexii.  Even if negative microvita do influence the minds of such people, they cannot influence the mind as easily as the body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Negative microvita cannot influence a person&#146;s mind at all when one&#146;s mind is moving in the higher cakras. They cannot even fully control the body, although they can have a negative influence to some extent.  If a person in a state of meditation keeps his or her mind concentrated at a higher cakra for a long time, and immediately after that negative microvita carried by the smell inference enter the body, these negative microvita cannot overpower the person, but they can do so partially. But if the mind moves towards crude objects, at that time the negative microvita do not spare the person &ndash; they will attack the person severely. This sort of negative microvita about which we are talking is called &ldquo;gandhapisha&#x301;ca.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Ghosts or elves are not really ghosts and elves &ndash; they are gandhapisha&#x301;cas.  With the dawning of reason and intellect on the dogma infected minds of the people of the past, the clouds of ignorance began to disappear from the human mind. So-called ghosts, elves, goblins, demons, etc. are disappearing into nothingness. The disembodied minds of diseased persons who have certain merits or demerits were sometimes wrongly called &ldquo;pretayonis&rdquo;. In fact, they are the entities which are the carriers of so-called merits or demerits. Of all the varieties of negative microvita, those which are carried by the senses and are harmful are known as &ldquo;gandhapisha&#x301;ca.&rdquo; These gandhapisha&#x301;cas have their different categories.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="32..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><b>Gandhayaks&#x301;inii</b>. It is said that so-called pretayonis are of seven types, but in fact they are the seven varieties of negative microvita.  Not all the seven varieties of pretayonis are carried by the smell inference.  Gandhayaks&#x301;inii refers to the pisha&#x301;ca variety of pretayoni which are carried by the smell inference. Although there are seven varieties of pretayonis &ndash; that is, negative microvita &ndash; there may be some other pretayonis besides these. Similarly, there are seven varieties of devayonis &ndash; that is, positive microvita &ndash; and besides these there may also be other varieties of positive microvita. The seven varieties of devayoni are yaks&#x301;a, kinnara, gandharva, vidya&#x301;dhara, prakrtiliina, videhaliina and siddha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Those who were decent human beings and deeply spiritual, and used to collect money for a noble cause, but in the process of fund raising forgot Parama Purus&#x301;a and attached greater importance to their fund raising at the cost of Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; that is, they remembered Parama Purus&#x301;a as part of dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and collected money for a great cause, and although Parama Purus&#x301;a was the goal collecting money became the dominant desire &ndash; attain the state of yaks&#x301;a devayoni after their demise. In feminine gender, yaks&#x301;a becomes yaks&#x301;inii. Although yaks&#x301;inii sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is a part of Avidya&#x301; Tantra, the yaks&#x301;inii itself is an an entity between vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301; because the person&#146;s mind in whom yaks&#x301;inii tendencies or positive microvita come was not a bad person. So gandhayaks&#x301;inii refers to that type of microvita which does not come within the scope of positive or negative microvita.  As there was a predominant sentiment for dharma in such entities, they are positive microvita, and later as the dominant spiritual sentiment became secondary, they are negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This sort of positive microvita exerts greater influence on the mind than on the body. They cannot exert their influence when the human mind remains spiritually elevated, but as soon as the mind descends, their influence starts. These microvita do not divert the mind from the path of dharma, but they do not allow the human mind to accept dharma as the dominant propensity. They advise human beings, &ldquo;Practice dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; as and where you are.  Continue it in perfect adjustment with everything.&rdquo;  That is, they advise a kind of selfish adjustment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This sort of negative microvita have both a positive and negative influence on the body, but not a destructive influence.  For easy understanding, we may use the term &ldquo;intermediate microvita&rdquo; instead of the terms positive microvita or negative microvita.  Of these intermediary microvita, which are of the nature of yaks&#x301;as &ndash; that is, who did not forget Parama Purus&#x301;a, but who wrongly attached greater importance to amassing wealth and accept the smell inferences as their media in the disembodied state &ndash; are  called &ldquo;gandha-yaks&#x301;inii&rdquo;. By careful research it will be found that they travel through many special types of smell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Suppose Shyam Babu was about to set out for Calcutta from Burdwan on urgent business, and the purpose of his trip was good. But when he was about to depart from his house, he suddenly developed an acute pain in the abdomen, so he could not leave at the appointed time. After a while, he arrived at the station to catch the next train. At the station, he learnt that the train he was supposed to have taken had met with an accident at Mogra station. As his journey was delayed his work was no doubt inconvenienced, but his life was saved.  This was the work of gandhayaks&#x301;inii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It may also have happen that Shyam Babu arrived late at Burdwan. He naturally thought that his work would be delayed because as the next train would come much later, he would be late in reaching Calcutta. Meanwhile, the scheduled train arrived. As there was no departure signal at Khona Junction, it was late in reaching Burdwan. This was also the work of gandhayaks&#x301;inii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In fact, yaks&#x301;inii is not a goddess or any particular entity, but an intermediary microvita which is partly positive and partly negative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><b>Gandharukmin&#x301;ii</b>. Let us discuss Rukmin&#x301;ii.  Rukmin&#x301;ii was Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s wife. She was the daughter of the King of Arunacala. In the British period, Arunacala was known as N.E.F.A. &ndash; North Eastern Frontier Agency.  During the rule of the Ahom Dynasty, it was part of Assam and Kamrup state and its old name was Balirpara.  Even in the early part of British rule, the old name was retained.  Now, Rukmin&#x301;ii had an irresistible spiritual urge. She took an unusual interest in propagating spirituality and helping unfold the spiritual potential of human beings. When ordinary people came in her contact, they felt a tremendous change in themselves, and automatically became more spiritual than before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The positive microvita which are carried through the smell inference try to forcibly take the human mind from ordinary mundane consciousness to the spiritual world, and as a result people notice a sudden change in themselves. They develop a feeling of non-attachment to worldly enjoyments.  Their minds rush towards rtambhara&#x301; tatra prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; or the underlying omniscient faculty, and they develop a tremendous inner urge for spirituality. Nima&#x301;i Pandit (later known as Chaetanya Maha&#x301;prabhu), who was full of intellectual pride and would debate with the greatest scholars of the age just to defeat them, was suddenly attacked by an invisible power and was completely transformed.  He gave up all his worldly bondages and set out in quest of the truth.  The force, the positive microvita, which finally brought him from Navadwip to Katowa, the confluence of the Bha&#x301;grathi and the Ajay rivers, was nothing by gandarukmin&#x301;ii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>Gandharva</b>. Positive microvita are divided into seven main categories, but there are positive microvita beyond these seven categories. These seven categories are as follows &ndash; kinnara, vidya&#x301;dhara, yaks&#x301;a, prakrtiliina, videhaliina, siddha and gandharva.  Just as pretayonis are divided into seven categories, devayonis are also divided into seven categories, as just mentioned. Similarly, just as there are seven lokas in the ascending order &ndash; Bhu&#x301;, Bhuvah, Svah, Maha, Jana, Tapah and Satya &ndash; there are seven lokas in descending order &ndash; Bhu&#x301;, Tala, Atala, Tala&#x301;tala, Pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, Atipa&#x301;ta&#x301;la and Rasa&#x301;tala.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Kinnara. How handsome, how beautiful, how sweet! Is it a human being or some other entity? Kinnara is equal to &ldquo;kinnarh&rdquo;. In North India, in the present state of Himalchal, there is a region called &ldquo;Kinnara&rdquo;. There is some Mongolian influence amongst the people, and the inhabitants of that region are very handsome. In the past, they were called &ldquo;Kinnara&rdquo; and the region was called &ldquo;Kinnaradesha&rdquo;.  The ancient name of Tibet was &ldquo;Kim&#x301;purus&#x301;avars&#x301;a&rdquo;. One meaning of &ldquo;vars&#x301;a&rdquo; is &ldquo;land&rdquo; or &ldquo;country&rdquo;. For instance, Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a means &ldquo;the land of Bha&#x301;rata&rdquo;. The inhabitants of Tibet have very little hair on their bodies, so it is often difficult to distinguish between males and females, just as it is difficult to distinguish between males and females in Bhutan.  Hence, in ancient Tibet, people would wonder if a person was a male.  In Sam&#x301;skrta the land was called &ldquo;Kim&#x301;purus&#x301;avars&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;devayoni&rdquo; means &ldquo;an entity which has a number of divine qualities&rdquo;.  That is to say, devayonis are positive microvita. Though siddhas are elevated human beings, those who have some aesthetic attraction for physical objects like money, ornaments, etc., become kinnaras after their demise.  As spiritual aspirants they are elevated to some extent, and as human beings they are decent, but they prayed to Parama Purus&#x301;a for beauty instead of for Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. Such people, after their demise, attain the status of kinnara devayonis. They will not hurt anyone; they are completely devoid of the instinct of harming others. Ancient people used to pray to kinnaras for guidance in the art of beautification and decoration. The science of cosmetics was once known as &ldquo;kinnaravidya&#x301;&rdquo;. In olden times, very handsome men were called &ldquo;kinnaras&rdquo; and very beautiful dancers were honoured as &ldquo;kinnaris&rdquo;. So, this type of positive microvita represent the psychology of beautification. All theatrical knowledge regarding cosmetics and aesthetics, and the art of beautification or aesthetic taste, came within the scope of kinnaravidya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301;dhara. The disembodied souls of those who were good people and elevated spiritualists, but who gave more importance to intellectual attainment instead of trying to realize Parama Purus&#x301;a, attain the status of vidya&#x301;dhara.  Maybe vidya&#x301;dharas are slightly more developed then kinnaras, but they also will not attain Parama Purus&#x301;a.  After their accumulated reactive momenta are exhausted, they will have to reincarnate as living entities.  Vidya&#x301;dharas may or may not have external physical beauty, but they certainly possess mental beauty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Incidentally, let me tell you that devayonis are composed of three fundamental factors &ndash; ethereal, aerial and luminous. The solid and liquid factors are left on the earth after the death of the physical body.  Perhaps you know that mental beauty exercises some degree of influence on the human body. A woman who is unattractive but is mentally elevated or has a loving nature will look beautiful to others. You must have heard that to a child, the most beautiful woman in the world is his or her mother. Vidya&#x301;dharas also have a kind of beauty due to their inherent intellectual faculty. Vidya&#x301;dhara microvita assist those who seek intellectual attainment. As vidya&#x301;dharas are devayonis, they do not harm anybody. They are a type of positive microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In one of my short stories I narrated the following experience. When I was a boy, the day before one of my examinations commenced, I was studying alone past midnight in my room on the third floor of our house.  There were two rooms on the floor, covered by a roof.  The staircase from the second floor to the third floor was closed with a gate so that thieves could not climb up to the fourth floor, so I was separated from the other members of the household. Suddenly, a peculiar sound came simultaneously from all the four corners of the room, &ldquo;Learn such and such lines from such and such poem by heart.&rdquo; I did accordingly. When I sat for the examination, I discovered to my utter amazement that a question concerned with the same lines of the poem appeared in the examination paper. But, however good these vidya&#x301;dharas might be, they do not attain Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Yaks&#x301;a. Yaks&#x301;a refers to a type of devayoni which, in its previous life, asked for material wealth from Parama Purus&#x301;a, or gave more importance to accumulating wealth to perform noble deeds than to supreme spiritual attainment. It forgot Parama Purus&#x301;a, and amassing wealth became the purpose of its life. In olden times, people would worship yaks&#x301;as in the hope of gathering wealth, particularly in the Buddhist and Jain periods.  Usually a particular place under a fig tree or banyan tree outside a village was fixed for the worship of yaks&#x301;as.  Those places are called &ldquo;Brahmastha&#x301;na&rdquo; today in Bihar and some areas of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, and some people are afraid to visit these places late at night.  Yaks&#x301;as are not harmful entities.  They help human beings, but they cannot attain Parama Purus&#x301;a.  They will have to be reborn in the form of living beings after their reactive momenta have exhausted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Prakrtiliina. Those who want Parama Purus&#x301;a but worship crude matter out of misguided devotion attain the state of prakrtiliina after they die. These disembodied minds are transformed into bricks, stone, wood, etc.  Those who pray to the idols made of clay, metal or wood out of misguided devotion can never attain Parama Purus&#x301;a because one can never attain supreme knowledge through this type of worship. The state of prakrtiliina is very miserable indeed because human beings who are endowed with a developed consciousness get transformed into crude matter like stone, wood, etc.  After their accumulated reactive momenta are exhausted, they attain a human body again, but as they wanted to realize Parama Purus&#x301;a, they were devayonis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->If one sits for meditation in that particular place where these devayonis exist in the form of stone or wood in ardent expectation of their emancipation, positive microvita will help a spiritual aspirant. As they are devayonis, they do not harm anyone &ndash; rather they assist spiritualists. You must have noticed that while meditating at some places the mind becomes concentrated very quickly.  This usually happens due to the grace of the Guru.  It also happens through the cooperation of those devayonis which have attained the state of prakrtiliina. If mental concentration comes with the help of devayonis, a spiritual aspirant will sense a light sweet smell in the nose, but if this happens due to the grace of the Guru, along with the sweet smell the spiritual aspirant will glimpse fragmented waves of effulgent light, like glittering poppy seeds, whether the eyes are opened or closed. Either by the cooperation of devayonis or by the grace of the Guru, both experiences are manifestations of divine grace. When spiritual aspirants experience the direct grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a during meditation, they perceive a kind of light smell which makes their minds intoxicated with joy. Simultaneously, they  visualise fragments of effulgence and experience a state of intoxicated hilarity which makes them oblivious to all kinds of petty differences, and transports them into the realm of cosmic oneness. In that state of blissful communion, the Guru and Iishvara become one, producing a kind of sweet vibration in the spiritual aspirant who realizes:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="32..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Videhaliina. Those who continue their spiritual practices and at the same time seek liberation from the bondages of the solid and liquid factors pray, &ldquo;O God, I am fed up with all these mundane problems, please grant me liberation.  So many problems come and distract my mind.  Why do I experience so many misfortunes? My son failed his examinations; my daughter fell seriously ill; the bank where I kept my savings closed down.  How many more misfortunes are waiting for me?  Enough of all this.  Please grant me emancipation.&rdquo; People with this type of psychology attain the state of videhaliina after their demise &ndash; an unbearable condition. After their reactive momenta are exhausted, they are reborn again.  These videhaliina devayonis help living beings. They do not harm anyone because they are positive microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Siddha. The best and most useful of all the devayonis are the siddhas.  Those who continue their spiritual practices, crossing the various stages due to cosmic grace, develop occult powers in the process of their forward movement.  The collection of the six types of occult powers are called &ldquo;sa&#x301;da aeshvarya&rdquo;. The collection of the eight occult powers are called &ldquo;a&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;a  aeshvarya&rdquo;. Some of these occult powers are not attainable by ordinary penance, but they may be attained due to unconditional cosmic grace.  Some of these occult powers &ndash; which are nothing but the unconditional grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; are paraka&#x301;ya- pravesha or entering into the body of others; sarvajin&#x32D;atva&#x301; or omniscience; va&#x301;k siddhi or the power to make whatever one says come true; etc.  By dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, when sa&#x301;dhakas are established in the supreme truth, theoretically one can attain these states, but practically omniscient intellect is attained only by unconditional cosmic grace.  Some other occult powers &ndash; for instance to perform the work of one sense organ through another sense organ, or to express one indriya through another indriya &ndash; are not attainable through individual effort. Due to unconditional grace, Parama Purus&#x301;a does not distribute all these occult powers, and the reason why He does not is known only to Him. These powers are the exclusive powers of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The powers which are confined to Parama Purus&#x301;a alone are known as &ldquo;vibhuti garima&#x301;&rdquo;, not &ldquo;garima&#x301;&rdquo; alone.  Garima&#x301; means &ldquo;one of the occult powers of a&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;a aeshvarya&rdquo;.  As Shiva was endowed with all sorts of occult powers, one of the names of Shiva is &ldquo;Vibhutina&#x301;tha&rdquo; or &ldquo;Vibhutibhu&#x301;s&#x301;an&#x301;a&rdquo;. To Shiva, these occult powers were mere trinkets, so the common people called Shiva &ldquo;Vibhutina&#x301;tha&rdquo;. Vi &ndash; bhu&#x301; + ktin = Vibhutibhu&#x301;s&#x301;an&#x301;a. One of its meanings is &ldquo;any occult power&rdquo;. Vibhuti also means &ldquo;the final state of something&rdquo;. As you know, the final state of anything is ashes &ndash; everything in this universe becomes ashes in the end. Vibhuti also means &ldquo;ashes&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Hence, if spiritual aspirants start practising meditation and in the process acquire a few occult powers, and thereafter these occult powers become the focal point of their efforts and Parama Purus&#x301;a becomes the secondary objective, such aspirants attain the state of siddha after their physical demise. A siddha is the highest state of devayoni. They help spiritual aspirants in various ways; their roles are primarily those of aids or guardians.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->There are some people in the world who are regarded as great personalities, and in the past there were also some great personalities, but no one knows about their Gurus.  It is said that these great personalities were initiated by the siddhas.  That is, these personalities used to follow spiritual practices according to the knowledge they had acquired.  Suddenly the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a Mantra of their previous life was conveyed to them by the siddhas, hence these types of people were called &ldquo;siddha diiks&#x301;ita&rdquo; or &ldquo;siddha initiated&rdquo;. These siddhas are highly evolved sa&#x301;dhakas, but they deviated from the path of spirituality to attain occult powers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->In the olden days, people used to describe occult powers as &ldquo;siddha&rdquo; in the Hindustani language.  You should remember that these occult powers are a kind of test in which genuine sa&#x301;dhakas should not be trapped. If Parama Purus&#x301;a says, even through hints, &ldquo;I am ready to give you occult powers, are you ready to accept them?&rdquo;  You should say in reply, &ldquo;No my Lord, let Your occult powers remain with You alone and shine in resplendent glory. I do not want them. I want only You.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In this connection I am reminded of an old story.  I knew two people from Muzzaffapur who were good sa&#x301;dhakas.  Once they decided to go to the other side of the Bur&#x301;igan&#x301;d&#x301;aka river and practise meditation there late at night.  It was a dark night in the rainy season and the river was full to the brim.  Though the river was not very wide, it was very deep.  They wondered how they would cross over to the other side. Suddenly, they noticed a bright light a little distance in front of them.  They decided to go and find out what it was, so they began walking towards it.  The light moved on, and sometime later it came to a place where it began to move across the surface of the river. They followed the light very closely, and to their utter amazement they found that the river was quite narrow at that spot and the water was not even knee deep. They easily crossed the river, then did their meditation quite alone.  Later, they wondered how they would return, because they were again faced with the problem of how to cross the river. Shortly, the same light reappeared, so they followed the light as before.  At the same place in the river, the light crossed over to the other side and disappeared.  This was positive microvita of the siddha group.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_title>Microvita and Their Influence on Micropsychic and Macropsychic Corporal Structures</div>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="34..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Microvita and their Influence on Micropsychic and Macropsychic Corporal Structures.&rdquo; As you know, this universe is a mesh of waves of so many lengths, and along these wavelengths so many positive and negative microvita move in so many directions in the entire universe. Microvita are mainly of two types: the positive and the negative ones, each having their peculiar influences on different animate or inanimate structures; that is, they have influence on both animation and inanimation. And in living structures also, where there is a flow of vitality, they function in their own ways, creating either static or sentient influences in different portions of the human body, mind, glands and sub-glands. Except for the pineal gland and the upper layers of the pituitary gland, they influence almost each and every atom of the human structure; only the negative microvita cannot influence any portion of the body above the pituitary gland. The positive microvita may function above it but cannot touch the pineal gland.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Amongst the different plexi of the body, or the different nerve centres, microvita function directly on nerve centres and indirectly on other portions and other sub-glands of the body. They greatly influence the solar plexus and the sidereal plexus. In the solar plexus they influence the vocal, ocular and auricular capacities of the human structure, either in pro-materialistic order or pro-spiritualistic order. But above the igneous plexus the negative microvita cannot function properly; that is, above the igneous plexus the role of positive microvita is prominent, and the role of negative microvita is insignificant, far less than that of positive microvita. Similarly, in the igneous structure and below, the influence of negative microvita is prominent, and that of positive microvita is insignificant. So regarding the igneous plexus or other plexi, human beings should be well equipped with spiritual strength to resist the influence of negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the sidereal plexus, if positive microvita are allowed to function properly, accelerated by spiritualistic mobility or stamina, people become sanguine in each and every activity of welfare and service; that is, they will be assets to human civilization and human society. But if those positive microvita are not properly helped, their speed will not be accelerated. Rather, the influence of negative microvita will go on increasing and all the person&#146;s thought-waves will be goaded unto the materialistic sphere, which may be detrimental to the cause of the all-round development of human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The next important influence of positive microvita on the sidereal structures is the propensity of endeavour, the propensity to do something concrete. If not properly directed, this sentient solar psycho-panoramic maximitis may be converted into static solar panoramic minimitis by negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Someone is energetic in doing something good, and someone else is very energetic in doing something bad. If properly directed and accelerated by the influence of positive microvita, such people may do a lot, but if not properly directed they will move towards nihilism, towards cynicism, and destroy all the assets of human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Another propensity, psycho-physical attachment in [[a]] good sense, is also created by positive microvita when they influence the sidereal plexus. The reverse is true if negative microvita are allowed to function. If there is no spiritual [[pursuit]], certainly the influence of negative microvita will go on increasing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Conscience &ndash; what is conscience? Conscience is the spirit of differentiation between good and bad, merit or demerit. This also depends on the influence of positive microvita on a sub- gland of the sidereal plexus, otherwise this conscience will die a premature death. Psycho-physical inertia is also created if negative microvita are allowed to function in the sidereal plexus, otherwise the positive microvita will crush the influence of negative microvita in creating psycho-physical inertia. Greediness is also encouraged if there is want of spiritual practice or spiritual pursuit; that is, in that case negative microvita will increase greediness in human minds. Hypocrisy in the human mind is also increased as a result of the influence of negative microvita on the sidereal plexus. The psychology of feeling repentant is also created by positive microvita as a result of its influence on the sidereal plexus. But as I have already said, above the igneous plexus all plexi are influenced more by positive microvita than by negative microvita; regarding the solar plexus I said that it directly influences vocality, ocular expression and auricular potentialities. These potentialities can do something concrete in uplifting the entire living society of the world; but if negative microvita are allowed to function, if there is no spiritual practice, naturally the reverse will be the case.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Similarly, in the case of the igneous plexus, where the influence of negative microvita is more than that of positive ones, the result is the static physico-panoramic maximitis of negative microvita; but if there is spiritual practice and spiritual longings, the reverse may be the case; that is, this static physico-panoramic minimitis may be transmuted into sentient psycho-panoramic maximitis of positive microvita. So one should develop the psychology of doing spiritual practice. Similarly, in the pneumatic plexus [at the ana&#x301;hata cakra] also, inertia regarding worldly affairs is converted into inertia regarding something bad, something worsening.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->I said that the influence of positive microvita on the human body creates sentient propensities, and that of negative microvita creates static propensities. I did not say anything regarding mutative faculties or mutative propensities because the mutative factor is not at all an attribute or wont or qualification, it is just a transitory phase moving from sentient to static or from static to sentient. The igneous plexus that maintains the balance of the physical structure and also the symmetry of the psycho-physical and psycho-spiritual orders, is the controlling point, hence it is the hub of the body, the nave of the body. Similarly, in the case of our social structure, a collection of two or more than two persons is called a society. As in the case with micropsychic order, the same is the case with macropsychic order also, and the collective body, as a result of the influence of positive microvita or negative microvita [[&ndash; the entire social body, the entire social structure &ndash;]] undergoes degradation or elevation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->I hope that you will not allow any degradation to take place in the human order, in the human system, and so you should encourage others on the path of righteousness and spirituality so that negative microvita will not get any scope to function on micropsychic corporal structures or Macropsychic corporal structures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Human beings are social beings, and so in our social life, microvita must not be allowed to function. One of the important expressions of negative microvita on the human mind or human society is dogma. If you want to encourage positive microvita, if you want to encourage spirituality, you must fight dogma in different spheres and levels and arenas and strata of our society. This never-ending fight against dogma will help you a great deal in establishing a society of spiritualistic order, and in maintaining a balance amongst the three layers of human existence, the physical, the psychic and the spiritual.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->For spiritual advancement spiritual practices are a must, and in spiritual practices the role of the cakras [plexi] is immense. In fact, the most important aspect of spiritual practice is cakra shodhana and cakra niyantran&#x301;a [the purification and control, respectively, of the cakras].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is a cakra? It is a collection of glands and sub-glands, and the location of these glands and sub-glands differs from animal to animal. In humans the cakras are situated at the intersecting points of the id&#x301;a&#x301;, sus&#x301;umna&#x301; and piun&#x32D;gala&#x301; [psycho-spiritual channels]. In the human mind various thoughts are constantly emerging and dissolving. Behind these psychic phenomena are the underlying vrttis [propensities] which are primarily related to the inborn sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta] of human beings. Propensities are formed according to one&#146;s inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, and the expression and control of these propensities are dependent upon the various cakras. The fifty main propensities of the human mind are expressed internally or externally through the vibrational expression of these cakras. These vibrations cause hormones to be secreted from the glands, and the natural or unnatural expression of the propensities depends on the degree of normal or abnormal secretion of the hormones. When these propensities can be expressed we say that the human mind is alive because the mind exists as long as the propensities are there. When the propensities are destroyed, however, the human mind loses its existence.<!-- /block --></p>

But this theory relates to all the effects of all the celestial bodies on the human glands and sub-glands &ndash; not only the celestial bodies of this solar system, but of all other existing solar systems, stars, planets, satellites, meteorites, nebulae and galaxies. So this theory is beyond the scope of astrology and astronomy. Astrology and astronomy consider only a bit of the effect of the planets on fate, fortune, etc., but this theory considers the effect not only of the direct rays, but also of the indirect reflected and refracted rays, on the glands and sub-glands.

<a name="36..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Why does microvita research need to be done in physical laboratories? Because atoms have two parts &ndash; the cruder part and the subtler part. Microvita also have two parts &ndash; the cruder part and the subtler part. So far atomic research has been done taking into account the cruder part of atoms. The subtler part of atoms has not been investigated. For research into the subtler part of atoms, psycho-spiritual practice is needed. When the cruder part of atoms could give energy for atom bombs, nuclear bombs, etc., much more can be achieved by exploring the subtler part of atoms. You will utilize the cruder part for the physical development of society, but many great things can be achieved by using the subtler part of atoms. This is yet to be seen. When research into the crude and the subtle part of atoms proceed together, then only will there be great benefit for the entire creation. The subtler part is closer to idea and the cruder part is closer to matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Considering that microvita are living entities, they have bodies, though their bodies are as subtle as idea. Research work in physical laboratories needs to be done on microvita because they are living entities. Then again, microvita bring spirit closer to matter.  That which helps in the creation of life comes within the spiritual or supra-psychic urge, and as such research cannot be done on this aspect of microvita in physical laboratories.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Microvita exist in the world of ideas as well as in the crude world. That which exists purely in the world of ideas is beyond laboratory research, but in the latter case research can be done in physical, chemical and biological laboratories.  Though this microvita research is to be done within the inner mind, inside idea, inside spirit, tests are to started in physical laboratories.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Microvita are a happy blending of matter and idea.  There is a silver lining made of the initial stage of matter and the final stage of microvita. Or in other words, between the final stage of microvita and the initial stage of matter there lies a silver lining.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="37..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Although microvita are very, very subtle physical bodies, they are living beings. Research can be done on them in chemical laboratories and medicinal as well as medical laboratories. A subtle technique is to be applied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The initial stage of matter is beyond perception. It falls into the category of the subtle realm of science. Most of the atomic research done until now has been done on the basis of the guessing method, because different stages of the atom, and different constituent parts of the atom, do not come under direct perception &ndash; they come within the arena of human concept. That is why microvita research is to be done first in the mental laboratory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Both atoms and microvita have subtler and cruder portions. The portion which is closer to idea is subtler and the portion which is closer to matter is cruder. For studying the cruder portions of both atoms and microvita physical laboratories are necessary. For studying the subtler aspects of both spiritual practices are necessary. The portion of atoms which have a close proximity to idea &ndash; that is, the subtler portion of atoms &ndash; is understood by spiritual practices. This part cannot be understood in physical laboratories only.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Why are physical laboratories necessary for microvita research? By just sitting and doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you cannot utilize microvita for the good of humanity. You have to engage yourself in physical research. If laboratory tests go on side by side with psycho- spiritual practices, then the research will have tremendous results. The case is similar for atomic research.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There are different kinds of atoms which do not come within the physical arena or even within the realm of physical perception. So research should be in the physical, psychological and spiritual spheres. If you want to utilize a certain state of atom &ndash; that is, the subtler portion &ndash; you will have to do spiritual practices, and if you want to know about the cruder portion you will have to do research. Both these two aspects are fast developing. Research into certain subtler portions of atomic matter cannot be done without spiritual practices, and research into the cruder portion of microvita cannot be done without physical laboratories.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So, in the case of matter, in the initial stage, research is to be done in the psychic, psycho-spiritual and spiritual arenas. If you want to know the different subtler stages of matter, concentrate your mind through japa, dha&#x301;rana&#x301; and dhya&#x301;na. If you want to know and use the cruder portion of microvita, translate this psychic research into action; that is, translate your psychic potentials into action, into physical acts in laboratories.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So I say, these two aspects of matter and human wonts are fast coming nearer. Research on the subtler portion of atoms is concerned with spiritual action, and research on the cruder portion of microvita is concerned with the different physical applications of science.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="39..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Doctors are mainly concerned with negative microvita. Each and every day microvita &ndash; more negative microvita &ndash;  bring so many ailments from other planets and celestial bodies to Earth. They come through different inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the course of their study, doctors should try to find out the coincidence between the characteristics of metazoic cells and multicellular protozoic cells in both the physical and psychic realms.  This will greatly help doctors in finding out the medicines for many diseases. Moreover, doctors are not acquainted with many diseases that are yet to come to Earth. If doctors can find out the factuality of negative microvita, they can prevent attacks of negative microvita before they occur &ndash; before they reach the planet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Disease is caused by negative microvita. When people take allopathic medicine to cure a disease, the medicine disturbs the ecological balance of the body because more negative microvita get concentrated at the point of the disease. Allopathic medicines do not kill diseases &ndash; diseases die by their own natural death. Although the medicine may check the disease, the increased concentration of negative microvita can overcome the effect of the medicine.  In fact, the increased concentration of negative microvita caused by allopathic medicines creates many new types of diseases, and due to this, two or three new diseases are presently being created every decade.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So what is the solution to this problem? Our approach should be two fold &ndash; external and internal. Externally we should take medicines to check diseases, but internally we should perform spiritual practices to increase the concentration of positive microvita and thereby kill the negative microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Today medical science has reached a threshold point. People know the specific medicines exist for certain diseases, so if they get sick they take these patented medicines. Consequently the role of doctors has diminished. Now medical science is at the top of a declining slope, and except for surgery it has lost its importance for ordinary people. Only microvita theory can overcome this situation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In homoeopathy also  the need for doctors is not so great because all the medicines are mentioned in books. If people feel the need for some medicine they can easily prescribe for themselves. Homoeopathy should embrace surgery, and if this is done it will be good for the all-round welfare of the people.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="40..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Matter and Abstract.&rdquo;  Some intellectuals are of the opinion that matter is bottled-up energy.  No, matter is not bottled-up energy. The characteristics and different wonts and specialties of energy are quite different from those of matter.  The mass of matter has got nothing to do with energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is matter?  It is &ldquo;known I&rdquo; in the cosmic arena in different planes of inferences, and these planes of inferences have nothing to do with one another. They have got minimum proximity to one another.  Somewhere there is maximum solidity, somewhere maximum dilution, and these phases of dilutions and solidities vary in huge number.  So matter is not bottled-up energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Chlorophyll and sun rays are not the same thing.  Sun rays are light energy, which as per the rule, may be converted into electrical energy, sound energy, magnetic energy and so many energies known and unknown to the world.  They are interchangeable and inter-transmutable.  But the position of matter is not such.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Chlorophyll is helped, is moved, by sun rays.  It is the inherent wont of energy to create movement.  Rather, energy and movement are inseparable.  They are inseparable from each other.  Chlorophyll is conveyed, is carried, by sun rays &ndash; and not only sun rays, but by the different rays of different celestial bodies.  And this movement of different bodies through the media of energies does not pass in a straight line; that is, the movement is of systaltic character, of pulsative nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Where this movement in the plane of inferences of cosmic nature, that is, in the cosmic arena, creates a reflection only, there the reflected energy creates a sort of sentient reaction.  And where there are reflections as well as refractions, these are of mutative character, creating mutations of various nature.  And where there is no reflection, only refractions, they are of static nature. There is staticity in them.  So matter is not bottled-up energy &ndash; it is &ldquo;known I&rdquo; in the cosmic arena, in the arena of the cosmos.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, the entity or entities coming within the conception of the mind are pure abstract, and those coming within the perceptions or feelings of the sensory or motor organs are matter, pure matter.  But the position of energy and microvita is on this silver line of demarcation between matter and abstract.  Energy generally comes within the range of perception, but not always.  Energy in its subtle form does not come within the range of perception. Subtle microvita also do not come within the range of perception, but they come within the range of conception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->You know, both microvita and energy are active in different planes of expressions, that is, in different physical or psycho- spiritual planes of the unit or collective propensities, and in the physical planes of inferences.  But microvita are more active in the physico-psycho-spiritual strata, and energy is more active in the physical planes of inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Regarding the strength or influence of energy and microvita, this much can be said &ndash; energy is stronger in the physical planes of inferences than in the physico-psycho-spiritual planes of the unit and collective propensities.  And microvita are stronger in the physico-psycho-spiritual realm of the unit mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Regarding positive and negative microvita &ndash; negative microvita function in a better way in the physical and physico-psychic strata, and positive microvita in the psychic and psycho-spiritual strata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So there should be maximum utilization of the potentialities of the expressed and emanated energy as well as of the expressed and emanated microvita, both positive and negative.  There is also use of negative microvita for the all-round and integrated development of this living world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Microvita influence human intellect and also a portion of human intuition. The favourite fields of positive microvita are the psychic and psycho-spiritual strata, and the favourite fields of negative microvita are the physical and physico-psychic strata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Energy is a blind force.  It has got no conscience &ndash; what is to be done or what should not be done, this sort of conscience is lacking in energy.  But microvita are not like that; that is, they are not blind forces.  They have the support of conscience behind them. This is another fundamental difference between energy and microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The effect of energy on different material bodies comes within the periphery of human knowledge if the wavelength is of medium standard &ndash; not extremely long or not extremely short. But the effect of microvita is to be felt &ndash; it cannot be expressed through language, it cannot be shown in the physical level. You must not try to acquire that occult power, but sometimes, by the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, it appears automatically.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Microvita, like energy, pass through various planes of inferences, and also through various planes of propensities.  In the inference of say touch, microvita increase the temperature in the external sphere and decreases it in the internal sphere.  In the case of odour, they decrease the temperature in the external sphere and increase the same in the internal sphere. But generally, regarding other inferences, such as sound and others, sometimes they may increase externally and sometimes they may decrease externally, according to the medium through which those microvita pass.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now, energy is inter-transmutable and interchangeable, but matter is not inter-transmutable or interchangeable.  It undergoes metamorphosis, metamorphosis once, but not always; that is, one way but not vice versa.  In the cosmic arena, in the cosmic stratum, if we try to dissociate what we feel or what we conceive or what we perceive into the &ldquo;knower&rdquo; and &ldquo;known&rdquo; portions, the cosmos in the physical level is the &ldquo;doing&rdquo; entity in the physical level and is microvita; and the &ldquo;done&rdquo; portion is the world of physicality.  And the &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; faculty in the cosmic level is the supreme cause or the subtlest form of energy, and the &ldquo;known&rdquo; portion or the &ldquo;known&rdquo; counterpart is the psychic and psycho-spiritual worlds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Energy, if it comes in direct contact with this world of physicality, is converted into so many energies &ndash; magnetic energy, electrical energy and many other energies.  And when that very energy functions through the cosmic &ldquo;known&rdquo; world, the Cosmic &ldquo;Known&rdquo; Entity, then it creates different psychic faculties, different psychic worlds. And if after passing through the Cosmic &ldquo;Known&rdquo; Entity it comes down towards the plane of cosmic or individual propensities, its movement is towards the crude, towards crudification.  But if it moves towards the cosmic cognitive faculty it is converted into psycho-spiritual movement, and finally spiritual movement or into the Spiritual Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Similarly, a microvitum, although it is initially the &ldquo;doer&rdquo; portion of the cosmic arena, if it passes through the expressed world of &ldquo;done&rdquo;, then it may create something good or something bad in the universe. If the movement is from a subtler plane to a cruder plane, it deteriorates or depraves the human mind or the standard of human conduct. But if the movement is towards a subtler plane, towards the subtler inferences of cosmic light, then it helps human beings, it helps spiritual aspirants, to attain the goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Microvita, when passing through different planes of inferences and also planes of propensities, can not only change the bodily temperature or temperatures of the mass, they can also create a radical change in the psychic wave, a change in wavelengths, a change in hormone secretion, and metamorphosis and transmutation in the mass and movement of hormones.  This should also be carefully remembered and noted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->It is the duty of the intellectuals of the world to continue doing research work regarding the movements of energy and of microvita when passing through the &ldquo;done&rdquo; world of the cosmic or individual propensities, or through the &ldquo;known&rdquo; world of cosmic inferences, or passing through both  types of planes; and also regarding the movement of energy passing through the plane of the &ldquo;known&rdquo; or the &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; world &ndash; the world of the &ldquo;known&rdquo; counterpart of the cosmos &ndash; and also through the world of individual propensities and different planes of individual inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->I would like intellectuals in the future to conduct experiments in their external physical laboratories and also in their internal psycho-spiritual laboratories. And you boys and you girls, you are to help them in accelerating the speed of their research work.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="41..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->When the doer &ldquo;I&rdquo; of the aspirant is goaded towards the Supreme Entity, it uses the vital energy acquired through different quinquelemental factors, passing through different planes of inferences, and through different propensities of the human mind, without suppressing those propensities of the mind. The question of suppression, repression and oppression does not arise in the realm of spiritual cult. You are simply to maintain equilibrium and equipoise &ndash; that is, you are to move maintaining proper parallelism with the fundamental propensities of the human mind. So spiritual practice is performed by the doer &ldquo;I&rdquo; with the help of energy, of so many energies which are converted into vital energy when they pass through the different planes of inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It is not proper to think that this movement, this spiritual advancement, is something purely of individual character. No entity in this universe exists individually. Ours is a universal family. Each and every entity &ndash; living and non-living, moving and non-moving &ndash; helps others in maintaining not only their equilibrium, but also the equipoise of the entire universe, not only of this small planet Earth. We are to move together with all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Even if an ant dies a premature death, it is bound to jeopardize the balance of the entire universe. Even if a 110 year old widow thinks that her life has no existential value on this planet, that she is a mere burden to society, it is a defective idea. No &ndash; even the life of such an old widow contributes to maintaining the balance of the universe. If such an old person dies prematurely, it is bound to jeopardize the balance of the universal society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If people think that they will make steady progress in the spiritual sphere even if the society goes to the dogs, they are mistaken. You who are genuine spiritualists should practise spiritual cult thinking that by doing so you will become effective in maintaining the universal balance. You must think, &ldquo;I will personally move towards the supreme desideratum, and at the same time I will try to assist those who are suffering from despair, those steeped in blind superstition and those wallowing in poverty.&rdquo; Our family is universal, our abode is also universal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Hararme pita&#x301; gaorii ma&#x301;ta&#x301;<br>Svadesha bhuvanatrayam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The Universal Father, Shiva, is our Father. The Universal Mother, Gaorii, is our Mother. She is the causal matrix. And this universe is our homeland.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This spiritual cult is the only cult; others are not cult, they are mere dogma. If the cult is proper &ndash; if it is cult in the true spirit of the term &ndash; it creates a sort of subtlety in one&#146;s mental flow. Under such circumstances, we receive necessary help from positive microvita. This help that we receive by dint of our spiritual practices is composed of eight occult powers. These powers are known as &ldquo;occult&rdquo; because they are acquired through cult. But while acquiring these occult or so-called &ldquo;miraculous&rdquo; powers, we cannot do anything without the help of positive microvita. These occult powers are an&#x301;ima&#x301;, laghima&#x301;, mahima&#x301;, iishitva, vashvitva, praka&#x301;mya, pra&#x301;pti and antarya&#x301;mitva. The entity who is endowed with all of them is known as &ldquo;Iishvara&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->An&#x301;ima&#x301; means &ldquo;converting one&#146;s psychic existence into a small point and then transforming it into a minimum entity.&rdquo; One may understand anything by entering into each and every physical particle and becoming one with the different waves of expression and emanation, by dancing with the wavelengths of objects or ideas. Unless and until one&#146;s very psychic existence is converted into a point, one cannot move or dance according to the wavelengths of objects or ideas. This occult power acquired through positive microvita is called &ldquo;an&#x301;ima&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Laghima&#x301; makes the mind light, free from the bondages of so many liabilities. This carefree mind, freed from the fetters of materialistic bondages, can understand and think properly. So by dint of this occult power, one may understand any idea, subtle or crude, in the abstract realm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Unless you understand how much pain and sorrow is accumulated in others&#146; minds, how many tears well up in their eyes, you cannot alleviate their sorrows and sufferings. Through laghima&#x301;, you can acquire this particular power to study others&#146; minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The third one is mahima&#x301; or expansion of mind. With the help of positive microvita, mind can be expanded. The radius of the mind may cover the entire universe, and we may have ideas about different subjects even without reading books and literature. And in this way, too, we may feel our oneness with the varied entities of this universe &ndash; unity in variety, unity in diversity. By associating our benevolent thoughts with each and every entity, we will contribute to universal progress and prosperity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Iishitva enables the spiritual aspirant to guide other minds who suffer from different psychic ailments. So many people in this world are crying in pain and agony. So many miseries and afflictions have paralysed human beings physically and mentally. In leading this afflicted humanity to their physical progress and psychic well-being, this occult power of iishitva will help you tremendously. It can be achieved through positive microvita which is in turn acquired through the regular practice of cult. By sitting idle and crying constantly one cannot achieve this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Vashvitva helps a person to bring defective ideas, or people goaded by defective ideas, unto the path of supreme greatness. If people are to be guided towards their definite progress, they will first have to be brought under one&#146;s control. If such people work haphazardly and do not follow the right path, they cannot be expected to reach the state of welfare. So, if you really want to help people, you will have to bring them under control and then direct them along the right path to their goal. This occult power can be achieved through positive microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Praka&#x301;mya or the right mode of thinking aimed at promoting universal welfare, brings light to the entire universe. Through this occult power, spiritual aspirants acquire what is needed to serve the entire world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Pra&#x301;pti means helping oneself and helping the souls of so many people to acquire and be benefited by the grace of the supreme.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->And the eighth one is antarya&#x301;mitva &ndash; to be able to enter within the ectoplasmic or endoplasmic structures of others, and thereby to know the pains and pleasures, the hopes, aspirations and longings of others to guide them properly. It is somewhat like the transmigration of souls. Regarding this eighth occult power, spiritual cult alone will not suffice &ndash; it requires the special grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->There is yet another occult power &ndash; the power of omniscience, to be all-knowing. This power of omniscience cannot be achieved only through the practice of cult, nor with the help of positive microvita &ndash; one must reach the height of devotion and achieve the grace of the supreme. Otherwise, even if people dash their heads against a wall, they still cannot acquire omniscience with the help of positive microvita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->And above all occult powers is the supreme knowledge &ndash; ensconcement in Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is not only a sort of omniscience, rather it elevates the aspirant to be one with the supreme cognitive faculty. Of course, those who are already endowed with devotion will automatically acquire this power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..23"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Bhaktih bhagavato seva&#x301;, bhaktih prema svaru&#x301;pin&#x301;ii,<br>Bhaktira&#x301;nanda ru&#x301;pa&#x301;ca, bhaktih bhaktasya jiivanam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Devotion means service unto the Lord. Devotion is of the nature of selfless love. Devotion is bliss incarnate. Devotion is the very life of the devotee.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Devotion means working in the service of the Supreme according to His satisfaction. Without devotion, one&#146;s mind cannot rise beyond the pituitary gland &ndash; if one wants to take the mind beyond that, one needs devotion. So the supreme spiritual progress of microcosms is never possible without devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->If you have devotion, you can call Parama Purus&#x301;a to you; He will certainly come to you, rather He must come to you. For this, you may or may not have anything else, but if you have devotion, you have everything. By dint of that, one attains Parama Purus&#x301;a, one becomes identified with Him. This is the summum bonum of human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Regarding prema or selfless love, it is said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..28"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Samyaun&#x32D;masrn&#x301;ito sha&#x301;nto mamatva&#x301;tishaya&#x301;unkitah;<br>Bha&#x301;va sa&#x301; eva sa&#x301;ndra&#x301;tma&#x301; budhaeh prema nigadyate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The attitude which makes the mind smooth and placid, and radiant with the deepest love for the Lord, is called &ldquo;bha&#x301;va&rdquo;. Wise people call this &ldquo;prema&rdquo; or &ldquo;divine love&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Prema is the attraction for Parama Purus&#x301;a overcoming the attraction for all other finite objects. Those who are endowed with such divine love are bound to receive the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; they need not worry about it. If they practise the spiritual cult regularly, positive microvita are sure to help them. Those who arouse devotion through action and knowledge are certain to attain the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This grace need not be huge in quantity &ndash; even a wee bit of it will be enough.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..31"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Mahatkrpayaeva bhagavatkrpa&#x301;lesha&#x301;dva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;One can attain the supreme stance by the blessings of the exalted ones, as well as a wee bit of Macrocosmic grace.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Only such people endowed with the grace of the supreme are in the best position to render maximum service to this universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->While practising spiritual cult, it should be remembered that spiritual aspirants must not practise in order to acquire these occult powers. The goal of spiritual practice is to realize the Supreme Entity. To search for any other thing is wrong. Occult powers are just like the dust on the roadside. The attraction for Parama Purus&#x301;a is the most valuable object &ndash; all else is only the dust of the earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Hence the spiritual aspirant must not run after these inconsequential occult powers, although while prasticing spiritual cult they may develop. You must not forget that all your achievements must maintain adjustment with the main propensities of the mind, and in the process of adjustment, all these eight types of occult powers present themselves to the spiritual aspirant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; starts in the plane of physicality and moves towards the physico-psychic plane. This first phase of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is performed by the &ldquo;doer I&rdquo;. Then from the physico-psychic plane to the pure psychic plane, and from the pure psychic plane to the psycho-spiritual plane &ndash; this portion of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is done by the &ldquo;knower I&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->In the final stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the pure spiritual phase, none of these can help the spiritual aspirant; even positive and negative microvita cannot function above the psycho-spiritual level, beyond the pituitary gland. No vibration is of any help. In such circumstances, finally you will have to depend on the grace of the supreme and nothing else. One is obliged to declare, Brahmakrpa&#x301;hi kevalam, that is, the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a is everything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Everything in this universe is created, everything survives and everything ultimately dissolves in and through Him. Regarding this Supreme Entity, the scriptures say,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..39"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Yato vishvam&#x301; samudhu&#x301;tam&#x301;<br>Yena ja&#x301;tain&#x32D;ca tis&#x301;thati;<br>Yasmin sarva&#x301;ni liiyanta<br>Jineyam tadbrama laks&#x301;anach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Out of the grace of the supreme, the universe has emerged; due to His grace, the universe preserves its existence; and because of His grace, everything will finally dissolve in Him.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->So the final word in the realm of spirituality is the supreme grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Intelligent people will understand this supreme truth and move accordingly. It is true not only in the physical level, nor in the physico-psychic level, nor in the psychic, nor in the psycho-spiritual level, but in all levels.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Finally, whatever you say or think, everything is finally embedded in the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The sooner this fundamental truth is realized, the better it will be for all.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="42..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In human beings and other animals, some propensity or other is either activated or slowed down by the impact of different inferences at various stages. Though this is not an easy subject, the impact that the inferences have at various stages on the body, mind, propensities, mass, hormones, etc. must be studied.  We have to study the impact of inferences on the human body, the human mind and human psycho-spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The inferences of sound, touch, form, taste and smell all operate on different planes and their effects are also different. &ldquo;Doer I&rdquo; or Krta Purus&#x301;a is the concentrated form of positive and negative microvita in the universal arena, maintaining equilibrium &ndash; functioning in the arena of the universe. Positive microvita are utilized for physico-psycho-spiritual practice. Energy is &ldquo;knower I&rdquo; or Jin&#x32D;a Purus&#x301;a, plus and minus the microvita passing through the universe. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is not possible without taking proper food because the vital energy one derives from food is a transformed form of other energies. Only positive and negative microvita will not do &ndash; vital energy is also required.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Microvita come from outer space, from the extended universe and the universal planes, through sound and other inferences.  Sound and other inferences have various planes, stages and phases.  Microvita pass through the different phases of these inferences.  Positive microvita are concerned with energy or the psychic realm and negative microvita are concerned with the physical body because the physical body contains inferences, that is, matter.  Matter is clearly associated with inferences &ndash; the original planes of inferences or the reflected or refracted planes of inferences. For example, mind receives the odour of a rose flower, but in the microcosmic plane of odour. This odour encourages certain propensities and discourages others. The mind certainly runs towards propensities, but one cannot achieve success by suppressing the propensities because more energy will be consumed in this effort.  One has to divert the propensities by learning the art of pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, the question is, How do positive and negative microvita maintain both equilibrium and equipoise in the universal strata &ndash; in the physical, physico-psychic, psychic and psycho-spiritual realms?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Microvita have nothing to do directly with the spiritual stratum. Positive microvita equal negative microvita &ndash;  that is, the sum total of positive microvita equals the sum total of negative microvita.  This is so in the entire macrocosm and in individual microcosmic structures.  If there is over-utilization of positive microvita during psychic and psycho-spiritual practices, then there will be a shortage of positive microvita for balancing the negative microvita in the physical and physico-psychic strata, because the sum total of positive and negative microvita must balance each other.  Thus, human beings should utilize their strength in all the strata. In the physical strata, utilize the immense power of negative microvita, otherwise the surplus of the negative microvita will become very strong due to accumulation.  Good people should not go to the Himalayan caves. Rather, remaining in society, they should serve the society in the physical and physico-psychic strata with the help of negative microvita, and in the psychic and psycho-spiritual strata with the help of positive microvita. If good people neglect the use of negative microvita in the physical stratum, catastrophes are sure to come. Everything will be in pell mell order.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="42..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There should not be negative use of negative microvita and there must not be negative use of positive microvita. You should always be positive. In the physical sciences, there are immense possibilities for the positive use of negative microvita. Positive and negative microvita are both necessary for balance. Due to the excessive use of positive microvita, it will become difficult to control and balance the negative microvita in the physical and physico-psychic strata because there will be a shortage of positive microvita. You must not run after occult powers.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="42..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->By splitting up the atom immense energy is released.  This is due to the fact that the energy which is packaged up in matter comes out.  To claim that energy is obtained due to the destruction of matter is theoretical and not physically proven.  In fact, the energy comes out from within the store of the atom.  Energy always requires a material shelter &ndash; a container.  After the destruction of the container, the immense released energy moves very fast with tremendous speed in all directions in search of some or other material shelter.  Finally, it finds a way in some country, in some human physical body, in structures and other material objects scattered around, or in the ocean, etc. Matter needs a shelter, and the shelter of matter is the earth.
