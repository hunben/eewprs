<div class=book_chapter_title>Rudra</div>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Every living being belongs to the family of the Supreme Being, Rudra. Where there is one Supreme Father, how can there be different castes and creeds? You are all equal; none is inferior and none is superior. Those who create distinctions are the enemies of human society. Fundamentally you are all one and only apparently you are many. Rudra is the final substance of all beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Why call the Supreme Being &ldquo;Rudra&rdquo;? The word Rudra in Sanskrit means &ldquo;weeping.&rdquo; But the Supreme Being not only makes all weep, He also makes them laugh! In both the circumstances, that is, of extreme pain and pleasure, there are tears in the eyes. In pain the tears come from the middle of the eyes, in pleasure they come from the corners of the eyes. A mother weeps when her daughter goes to her in-laws&#146; house. She also weeps when her daughter returns from the house of her in-laws. In one case she weeps for pain, in another she weeps for joy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If living beings were to live in one state always, there would be extreme monotony and no one would want to continue life. If in a drama we know the end in the very beginning, there would be no interest in the play. We need suspense, ups-and-downs and eleventh-hour surprises to keep life interesting. God, that is, Rudra, is a first-class dramatist. He keeps life floating within the two extremes of joy and pain; hence His liila&#x301;, His play, goes on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->We pray to Rudra in the following way: &ldquo;O Lord! take me from the transitory to the eternal!!&rdquo; All forms are momentary; only God is changeless, sat, truth. Therefore take me from asat, the transitory, to sat, truth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;O Lord! Guide us from darkness unto light!&rdquo; Darkness here means Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or ignorance which creates confusion about reality. When this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is removed, the individual soul becomes the Universal Soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;O Lord! Take me from death unto life!&rdquo; Death simply means change. In this created universe all will change and all are changing. Thus everything, every being is subject to death. Save me from this realm of death and make me a non-changing absolute, which alone is immortality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;O Lord Rudra, you are manifested in all things and forms; I want to feel your presence in my heart!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Sadhakas [spiritual aspirants] will get this feeling with the slightest effort. You people will complete your mission here and in this life, so that we may all take up another mission on some other planets!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Rudra is Guru [dispeller of darkness], father and teacher all rolled into one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Rudra is described as having five faces. What do these indicate? Rudra is one, but has five types of administrative functions. Everyone has his duty. The Supreme Being, also having manifested Himself into relativity, has His duties. He works hard for His mundane beings, who are His children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The face to the extreme right is called Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara. Its role is to tell the human beings, &ldquo;Please my child, do not do this &ndash; I shall be pained if you do this.&rdquo; This is a gentle warning to prevent evil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The face on the extreme left is called Va&#x301;madeva. It says, &ldquo;Why did you do this? I shall smash you.&rdquo; It actually punishes and destroys.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The next face to the extreme right is Iisha&#x301;na. It says, &ldquo;Do not do this, you may get punishment for this.&rdquo; It is mildly rebuking but not threatening.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The face next to the extreme left is Ka&#x301;lagni. It threatens severely but does not actually punish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In the middle is the face of extreme serenity and beauty. It is called Kalya&#x301;n&#x301; Sundaram. Suppose there is a child of 3-4 months. Both the parents look at him with great affection. There is no desire to punish at all. This central face of the Rudra is His permanent nature. It is the quality of grace and beauty which is the only lasting characteristic and property of Rudra. Changes in this to the right or left are only due to administrative requirements.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The devotees pray to Rudra, &ldquo;O Lord, kindly look at me with your extreme right face so that I may be prevented from evil and hence punishment.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->But God is one and always graceful and kind. The concept of God and devil co-existing is neither logical nor practical. There cannot be two rival powers contending for superiority. The destructive aspects of God are also due to His extreme kindness towards His creation. When a shirt is torn and you change it for a new one, it is not an act of cruelty. God creates this universe, maintains it and goes on destroying its useless parts or changing them for new ones. Rudra, being the final power in this universe, also has final responsibility to protect, maintain and control it. Power and responsibility should go hand in hand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->When He finds a particular structure incapable of performing its part well, He discards it for another. It is like the organizer of a puppet show changing one of His puppets. Therefore in His destroying aspect also, God is not to be feared. He is only to be loved.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There is going to be no final destruction of this creation. But suppose this were going to happen, even then the human beings need not be afraid, as they will remain on the lap of Rudra even in that state. So no one should feel afraid. The word &ldquo;fear&rdquo; should be removed from the dictionary of mankind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Do not think that because you are small or uneducated, God will not attend to you. He bestows the same measure of care for the biggest elephant as He does for the smallest ant. For Him both are one and the same &ndash; His progeny. If no one else thinks of you, do not worry, Rudra will think about you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The more inward you go in your mind, the nearer you are to Rudra. Finally when your mind merges in its source, you are one with Rudra. You have immense possibilities; the Supreme Being, the Supreme Power is within your easy reach. Why then fear anyone?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The sweetest part of liila&#x301; &ndash; God&#146;s play &ndash; is that He is hidden in everyone and everyone is searching for him. He wants His children to go round and He plays hide-and-seek with them. This is so that they may perform certain essential functions in the process. This gives interest and pleasure to both the Creator and the created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Thus all things are one. There is no distinction due to sex, age, or anything. Male and female, young and old are all actors playing different roles in the drama of this universe. Their forms differ, but their substance and purpose is one. God is male, female, child, youth, and old age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->God has His faces in all directions. No one can hide anything from Him. He sees both our external and internal actions. Do not hate those who are small. You have no right to hate anyone. Do not be afraid of nature either. The thunder and the roar of the oceans hide His sweet music within their apparently frightful sounds. Fear none and hate none. All are One.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->This Universal Form of God, Unity in all &ndash; you will be able to see in this very life. Strive on &ndash; go on doing your sa&#x301;dhana intensively, you will succeed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Movement is life. Where this is towards God, the Subtle, the All in One &ndash; it is progress, otherwise it is degradation. The moment a man is born he starts his journey. The end of his journey is death. The gap between these two is life. It is a small gap. Waste no time. Every minute takes you nearer to the grave. There is no time to waste. This mission of life &ndash; to be one with God &ndash; has to be fulfilled here and now.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The mind also moves and changes, but it has no relation with this body and its grave. Bodies are given up one by one, but the mind remains the same continuing unit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->All creation is dancing round the Parama Purus&#x301;a, whether knowingly or otherwise. The steps and the direction of one&#146;s dance are according to one&#146;s nature. Those who are becoming degraded are dancing away from Him. Others are expanding and moving towards Him. This dance is the cycle of Brahma [Brahmacakra].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Every mind is dominated by one particular desire. Some pray to God, &ldquo;Please remove my stomach-ache.&rdquo; Others say, &ldquo;If my daughters get married I shall leave the world and come to You.&rdquo; God smiles at these prayers in silence, as laughing openly would embarrass His children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Every body and mind is structured according to its dominant desire. You can recognize a good man by his face. People with the same dominant desire easily become friends though they may belong to different countries of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->This dance of individuals according to their desire is ra&#x301;saliila&#x301; or the play of the waves in God&#146;s Ocean. As a boat goes up and down on a wave, so the human beings go up and down on the Cosmic waves of their desires. As long as one considers oneself separate from the Lord, this dual dance goes on. When one knows the Supreme Being, the rhythm changes and becomes soothing and graceful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->But coming to know Him is only possible through His Grace. Scholarship will not lead you to God. A devotee will always win when there is a conflict with a scholar. The scriptures are like curd which is churned by scholars &ndash; while they analyse the butter and buttermilk, the butter is eaten up by the devotees and only stale buttermilk is left for the scholars.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->How to get this kindness, this Grace from God? You have to snatch it from Him, just as a little child by weeping bitterly snatches his mother&#146;s love and attention, though the mother at first may be unwilling to leave the kitchen for the child.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->But the devotees always plead for God. They justify His actions. They say, we are doing our sa&#x301;dhana not to get pleasure but to please our Lord. He feels happy when He sees His creation making attempts to meet Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->God&#146;s Grace is forever raining over all but we keep umbrellas of our ego aloft and hence do not get drenched in it. Devotees, however, puncture this ego. They surrender themselves to Him and thus get His Grace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Since all beings have come out of Rudra, He is also their final Goal; merging in God is as natural as being born. Sa&#x301;dhakas will surely achieve this. Go on doing your part. I shall do mine and help you in establishing yourself in the Supreme. I have come on this earth for this sake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->If someone wants to inject an inferiority complex in you, do not be affected. You are the children of God, not inferior to anyone. Make attempts to meet Him and success will surely be yours.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Victory is yours. You are the dear ones of God. Move on and achieve the Goal.<!-- /block --></p>
