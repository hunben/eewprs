<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The exercise of comparing one philosophy to another is a difficult intellectual task, but there are many precedents for it. This book attempts something perhaps unprecedented &ndash; comparing a philosophy to a personality. Here in Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram (&ldquo;Salutations to Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the Beautiful&rdquo;), Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti has compared not just one philosophy, but at least ten, to the life and personality of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The author sets out here the two distinct facets of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s personality: Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the lord of devotion, and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the lord of karma yoga, ceaselessly engaged in the battle against injustice. Taken together, the two aspects of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s life symbolize the dharma of all humanity: spiritual realization fused with selfless service and the fight for justice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Though Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not during His lifetime attempt to create a formal system of philosophy, the author&#146;s basic premise is that the deepest understanding of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a must implicitly bring with it a correct and sublime philosophy; and that the essence of that philosophy will be advaetadvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da &ndash; non-dualistic dualistic non-dualism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So the author herein presents, if not a system of philosophy as such, then a system of philosophy as embodied in the personality of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a; and in order to fully elaborate that philosophy, the author has compared Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the historical personality, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the Sadguru of His age, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the human being, to most of the important philosophical trends of India. For an outline of these trends, please see the &ldquo;Indian philosophies&rdquo; entry in the glossary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram is a collection of twenty-seven Sunday discourses given in Calcutta between August 1980 and April 1981, together with a brief appendix. The discourses were given in Bengali, and all of them were recorded on tape. Translation into English started before the series of discourses was completed, and the Bengali and the English books were both published by A&#x301;nanda Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301; (the full-moon day of the Bengali month of Vaesha&#x301;kha), 1981.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The Bengali version was later reprinted without change in a Second Edition (Shra&#x301;van&#x301;ii Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301;, 1981) and a Third Edition (1990). Many chapters of both the Bengali and the English were reprinted in Parts 6, 7 and 8 of Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell, 1988. In the case of the English, a certain amount of revision was done at that time by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Vijaya&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta and A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Vishvaru&#x301;pa&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->For the Bengali Fourth Edition of 1995, all of the tapes were carefully listened to, in an environment detached from the intense deadline pressures of 1981. Many previously-untranscribed or hastily-transcribed words and passages came to light. The new or corrected material was incorporated into the new edition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->That new material has now in turn been incorporated into this English Second Edition. In addition to the new material, various existing passages, most of them brief, were found to require retranslation. Apart from the new material and retranslation of limited passages, the wording of the 1981 edition or (where applicable) the Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell edition, has been maintained here.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the editors have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Eds.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s role is divided into two main parts &ndash; one is Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a; and the other is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king of Mathura. The natures and jurisdictions of the duties of the two aspects were different, hence the roles also were different. People in general could not become as easily intimate or familiar with the king Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; as they could be with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of Vrindavana. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was a sweet personality, and that sweetness was mixed with spirituality; whereas Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king was a tough personality, but that toughness was also mixed with spirituality. In both roles Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a set a unique example before the Indian people as well as the entire world, and the necessity to hold that example up before others is not yet over. Although the first part of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s life was that of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, instead of first discussing Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, I wish to discuss first Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king &ndash; Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->I have already said many things about Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. I gave a series of discourses on the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in Ranchi stretching over a long period. But the main theme there was the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata, and not Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. In this series of discourses, however, I propose to focus more upon Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a as the central figure. The context of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata will come up only incidentally, because it does not cover the whole life of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata cannot stand if we remove Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a from it; while if we wish to remove the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata and retain Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a will stand a bit diminished, though He will stand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Let us come first to the context of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king. He came to Mathura after leaving Gokula and Vrindavana.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Although valour, intrepidity and all such virtues had been much evident in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a during His early career in Gokula and Vrindavana, the element of sweetness was the most predominant quality in Him. To attract and draw people closer to Him by playing sweet and melodious tunes on His flute, to establish sweet relations of love and affection with all, and, in case of necessity, to take up arms in the interests of His favourite friends and followers &ndash; these were the deeds He used to do. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s devotees felt that He was their own. They would say, &ldquo;He is one of us. Of course, He is a great hero, far superior to us in all respects, but still He is ours.&rdquo; But that same Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a who did so much for His devotees, remaining so close to them in prosperity and adversity, found that that role did not permit Him to render maximum service to the human society that was being unbearably persecuted, humiliated and neglected. Therefore He gave up that role and assumed the role of a king. And that role started with the annihilation of Kansa.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of the term kam&#x301;sa? It means &ldquo;an entity that endangers the existence of others, that impedes their all-round progress and welfare&rdquo;. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, on the other hand, means &ldquo;an entity who leads others towards fulfilment&rdquo;. So the Entity who leads others towards perfect attainment, who cannot tolerate destructive ideas or destructive elements, was destined to annihilate Kansa and remove the thorns of sin from the physical, psychic and spiritual planes.

Mercy or compassion may intervene, requesting, &ldquo;No, don&#146;t do that,&rdquo; but the circumstances compel it; and for this, an element of toughness is indispensable.

<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Regarding the main role of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, I have already mentioned that although the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata does not cover all aspects of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s life and personality, it is nevertheless a fact that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s main role [i.e., that which the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata does cover] was that of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->First I shall analyse the origin of the word &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rtha&rdquo;. &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rtha&rdquo; is derived from &ldquo;Prtha&#x301;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prthu&rdquo;. Prtha&#x301; is the name of a particular kingdom, a kingdom where the princess Kunti lived. The word &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rtha&rdquo; is derived &ldquo;Prtha&#x301;&rdquo; + suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;a (imparting the sense of &ldquo;progeny&rdquo;, or &ldquo;offspring&rdquo;). That is, &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rtha&rdquo; means a son of Kunti (as does also &ldquo;Kaonteya&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In ancient India, before the arrival of the Aryans, the matriarchal system of inheritance as well as the matrilineal order of society was in vogue among the Austric and Dravidian communities. The people of those prehistoric times used to identify themselves in terms of their mother&#146;s lineage, and as such used to take on the name of their mother, grandmother or great-grandmother. If one was asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; one would have to give one&#146;s mother&#146;s, grandmother&#146;s or great-grandmother&#146;s name. Along with this matrilineal order, the matriarchal system of social inheritance, whereby the daughters would inherit the property from their mothers, was also in vogue. Two thousand years ago, the mother&#146;s name was considered the most important factor in naming a child. For instance, Lord Buddha&#146;s two main disciples were Sa&#x301;riputta and Maha&#x301;maggallan Arhan. &ldquo;Sa&#x301;riputta&rdquo; means &ldquo;the son of Sa&#x301;ri&rdquo;. His mother&#146;s full name (these people were all from Magadha, incidentally) was Ru&#x301;pasa&#x301;ri; and thus the son&#146;s name became &ldquo;Sa&#x301;riputra&rdquo; in old Sanskrit. In Pra&#x301;krta, it was changed to &ldquo;Sa&#x301;riputta&rdquo;, just as the Sanskrit word &ldquo;Ra&#x301;japutra&rdquo; became changed to &ldquo;Ra&#x301;japutta&rdquo; in Pra&#x301;krta (and &ldquo;Rajput&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rout&rdquo; [common surnames] in modern languages). And in the second case, the mother&#146;s name was Maha&#x301;maodgalii in Sanskrit, which became &ldquo;Maha&#x301;maggali&rdquo; in Pali. Her son was thus known as &ldquo;Maha&#x301;maggallan&rdquo; Arhan.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Here is another example: Once a merchant promised, as per the direction of Buddha, that he would build the new capital city of Magadha near the confluence of the Ganges and the Sone Rivers. The name of that merchant was Pa&#x301;t&#x301;aliputra,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> because his mother&#146;s name was Pa&#x301;t&#x301;ali. This demonstrates that ancient Indian society followed the matrilineal order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Thus Arjuna<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> was popularly known as Pa&#x301;rtha [&ldquo;the son of Prtha&#x301;&rdquo;]; he was also called Kaonteya [&ldquo;the son of Kunti&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->And what was the role of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? The role of a sa&#x301;rathi. Now let me explain what sa&#x301;rathi means. Sa&#x301;rathi means one who looks upon a chariot as one&#146;s own child. You may have come across some car drivers who take meticulous care of their motor cars. &ldquo;Hey, don&#146;t touch the paint job&#8230; don&#146;t jump in like that&#8230; don&#146;t sit down so hard&#8230; my car will be damaged&#8230; Hey, no, my car can&#146;t carry six or seven people, it will be damaged&#8230;&rdquo; They go to great lengths to ensure that their cars are not scratched or damaged in any way. In fact, they treat them as if they were their own children. One who similarly looks upon a ratha [chariot] as one&#146;s own child is called a sa&#x301;rathi. Rathena saha saratha [&ldquo;The one associated with a chariot is a charioteer&rdquo;]. Saratha + i suffix (imparting the sense of &ldquo;child&rdquo;) = sa&#x301;rathi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The sa&#x301;rathi of the chariot of Pa&#x301;rtha (i.e., of Arjuna) was none other than Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Himself [hence &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a assumed the role of sa&#x301;rathi.

And with a chariot as nucleus, one can move. Hence Shariiram dharmamandiram [&ldquo;The human body is the temple of God&rdquo;]. The human body has to be kept neat and clean.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn1">1</a></b>)  Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata literally means &ldquo;Great  India&rdquo;. Hence Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata became the name both for the campaign led by Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to unify India, and for the epic composition about that campaign. Both the campaign and the narration of the epic begin at a point when Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is already a king &ndash; Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi.<br> After the author of the present book had spoken in Ranchi in 1968 on the two topics (the campaign and the epic), those speeches  were collected in the book Discourses on the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata. &ndash;Eds.</p>

Mathura was and still is an important city. The Gokula and Vrindavana  of that time fall within what is now the larger town of Vrindavana.  All lie in the modern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. &ndash;Eds.</p>

He imprisoned King Ugrasena  (Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s grandfather), usurped the throne, and, out of  fear arising from a prophecy, imprisoned his cousin Devaki and her husband Vasudeva, killing each  of their children as they were born. Two of the children, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a  and his brother Balarama, escaped destruction. Kansa spent years trying  to find and assassinate the young Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn4">4</a></b>)  &ldquo;Vraja&rdquo; was a term for Gokula and Vrindavana  (for further discussion of the term, see p. 47). Kuruks&#x301;etra  was the battlefield of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata war. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn5">5</a></b>)  The city that the merchant built was also named Pataliputra, and is now a well-known part of modern-day Patna, capital of the Indian  state of Bihar. &ndash;Eds.</p>

In the shloka  the sa&#x301;rathi represents the buddhi, the discriminating  faculty, or pinnacled intellect. But since it is the buddhi  that brings spiritual aspirants in close contact with Parama  Purus&#x301;a, the sa&#x301;rathi ultimately comes to represent  Parama Purus&#x301;a. &ndash;Eds.</p>

<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In prehistoric times people were no better than animals. There was no difference between primitive humans living in caves and ape-men and proto-apes living in caves. But one branch of primitive humans made significant advances in knowledge and intellect.

<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->It was Lord Shiva who trained those ancient humans &ndash; who were neither fully human nor completely animal &ndash; to live a harmonious and systematic life. Since those people liked to dance, Shiva taught them the art of dancing. He introduced a fixed system in every sphere of life. Shiva observed that the people of His age were contemplative, so He formulated a particular discipline to help them attain psychic progress and spiritual elevation. He introduced a rhythm and a systematic lifestyle into the lives of those primitive people and showed them the path that leads towards subtlety. The highest and greatest contribution of Lord Shiva was that He helped develop every aspect of human life and guided human beings from the animal stage to the domain of subtlety. That tradition has continued for many thousands of years.<!-- /block --></p>

Society  had not yet realized the need or significance of beautiful collective living. It was an imperative necessity for people to feel, to realize, that they needed to build a society which guaranteed the basic necessities of food, clothing, shelter, education and medical treatment to all its members. It was essential for those advancing along the paths of their individual lives to realize that others should have equal opportunities to follow the same broad highway of morality and spirituality in collective life. Otherwise, with the degeneration of the collectivity, the degeneration of the individual is inevitable.<!-- /block --></p>

Teaching society this lesson was the onerous responsibility of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, and to make the lesson crystal clear to His contemporaries, He had no other choice but to assume the role of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->This was a prodigious task, beset with difficulties and obstacles. Society in those days, the entire ancient India, was fragmented into a large number of small kingdoms. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a fervently hoped that all the petty kingdoms would unite and construct a well-knit society, a stable, greater India. In a strong and united India, coordinated cooperation among the federated units would bring stability to socio-economic life and improvement in the moral standard, enabling people to progress spiritually. His mission extended from individuals to the collectivity. Such was the aspiration of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The role of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was to guide people along the path of bhakti [devotion]. He was the very embodiment of softness and sweetness, never showing the severity needed in battle. Of course, struggle was present, but the primary factor was devotion. To guide people along the devotional path was the main theme, and the realization they received as a result was aparoks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti [direct experience]. But in the case of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the realization they received was both direct and indirect. For instance, people developed superior intellect. They built a happy and prosperous society, and cultivated higher knowledge, whereby they could determine the dos and don&#146;ts of social life. They learned the secrets of action by cultivating the science of yoga and learning the practical process for finishing any action adroitly. These lessons fall within the scope of paroks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti [indirect experience]. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a showed humanity the path of knowledge which is in itself an invaluable aid for aparoks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti. Likewise, He demonstrated the art of karma yoga, which is an aspect of paroks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti, yet a most valuable aid for aparoks&#x301;a a&#x301;nubhu&#x301;ti. He also taught sharan&#x301;a&#x301;gati [the cult of surrender] to enable people to surrender to Parama Purus&#x301;a and come within His supreme shelter. This is the stage where paroks&#x301;a and aparoks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti become one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The Foremost Difference<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a showed humanity the way to attain aparoks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti. Jiivas [unit beings] come closest to Parama Purus&#x301;a through devotion, through sweet love for Him (Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va). Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a taught His devotees that they must realize the sweetness of the world &ndash; for everything in this world is sweet &ndash; and make it their own through love. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, on the other hand, said that although everything in this world is sweet, people have to taste that supreme sweetness through severity, harshness, struggle and bitterness. Struggle in life is inevitable. This is the first and foremost difference between the two roles of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The one wished to lead humanity to the highest realization through aparoks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti, while the other wished to lead humanity to that highest state of human excellence first through paroks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti and only then through aparoks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti. The difference is very vast indeed. The resoluteness, the firmness, that is found in Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is conspicuously absent in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Similarly, virtues that are found in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a are totally absent in Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is ever ready to take up arms for the protection of those who have come under His shelter, whereas Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a protected His followers with softness and charming sweetness. He never exhibited His toughness, His firmness, to anyone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Can anyone say which is the greater of the two? My reply is this: the question of who is superior or inferior does not arise at all; it is irrelevant. The fact is that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had to assume different roles out of necessity. In one role, He converted an ordinary community of people into a God-loving and highly devotional group, and in the other role, He goaded that same community to greater and nobler deeds, and established them in the highest excellence of human glory. Both roles were equally necessary then and both are necessary even today.<!-- /block --></p>

The privileges enjoyed by the people are the veritable proof of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma&#146;s advent or incarnation. Let us analyse how Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a tried to help and actually did help elevate people on the path of spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When people attain progress in the realm of spiritual realization, that progress is divided into six stages &ndash; sa&#x301;lokya, sa&#x301;miipya, sa&#x301;yujya, sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya, sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi and kaevalya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><b>Sa&#x301;lokya</b>: At the stage of sa&#x301;lokya, people feel that they have come onto the earth at the same time as Parama Purus&#x301;a. The greatest achievement of human life is that one has come to live in this world at the same time that Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself has chosen to incarnate on this earth as Ta&#x301;raka Brahma. The great devotee Vrindavana Das observed, &ldquo;It is my greatest misfortune that I was not born at the same time that the Lord chose to incarnate Himself on this earth.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

I was born later.&rdquo; It is truly a great misfortune, a spiritual affliction, to be born a little before or after the Lord&#146;s advent &ndash; it is indeed a spiritual affliction. The very thought that Parama Purus&#x301;a was on earth at the same time that I was brings a sense of ecstasy, an immense joy. This state of joy or bliss is termed sa&#x301;lokya. (Loka means &ldquo;the world&rdquo;. In Bengali loka means &ldquo;human being&rdquo;, but in Sanskrit it means a stratum [in this case, the world].)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was in Vraja, the people felt intense joy and a sense of pride that a great personality in the form of a young man had chosen to live in their midst. Those who came in contact with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a also felt that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was with them, guiding them, on all strata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Oddly enough Duryodhana, even though he was apparently Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s enemy, was convinced that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was not an ordinary person. He thought that if he could win Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s support, he would be very fortunate. So on the eve of the Kuruks&#x301;etra war he went to Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to ask Him for help. Both Duryodhana and Arjuna went to Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a for help.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Arjuna was more advanced than Duryodhana so far as the realization of sa&#x301;lokya was concerned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Duryodhana arrived at Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s palace before Arjuna to find Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a lying in bed with His eyes closed pretending that He was fast asleep. Arjuna came afterwards and took his seat near Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s feet. [Duryodhana had seated himself beside Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s head.] Suddenly Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a sat up and acted as if He had just awakened. He did it in such a way that He looked first towards Arjuna sitting near His feet and said, &ldquo;Oh, welcome Arjuna, you&#146;ve come. It&#146;s good to see you.&rdquo; Then He caught sight of Duryodhana and said, &ldquo;Welcome Duryodhana, you have come too. It&#146;s good to see you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This was all pretense, of course, because Duryodhana had actually come earlier. But his realization of sa&#x301;lokya was less than Arjuna&#146;s; he did not have the deep realization that Parama Purus&#x301;a, Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, had incarnated on the earth. Hence he could not get the benefits of sa&#x301;lokya, while Arjuna easily could. Now the entity who was pretending to be asleep was not Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the constant wielder and player of the magic flute, but instead was Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the keen-witted person, the person with the pinnacled intellect. Had He been Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, he would have played His magic flute, drawing Duryodhana as close to Him as Arjuna. Here lies the difference between Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a employed the tactics of diplomacy whenever necessary &ndash; and in those days that was quite often.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>Sa&#x301;miipya</b>: The second stage of spiritual realization is sa&#x301;miipya. Now in the first stage, people realize they have been born at the same time and in the same world as their Lord. In the second stage, they feel close to Parama Purus&#x301;a, close enough to talk to Him on friendly terms, even regarding extremely personal matters, and thus be relieved and comforted by Him. Sometimes people feel so close to Him that they go to Him not necessarily to disclose their personal difficulties, but for relief, for consolation and to gain sufficient strength to withstand the difficulties and troubles, the storms and stresses, of personal life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Many people who came to Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; and they were very common people &ndash; had this realization of sa&#x301;miipya. But those who had the privilege to come in contact with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a were either highly-educated people and great saints, or kings and dignitaries. Not everybody had the privilege to come into contact with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and enjoy the realization of sa&#x301;miipya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those who had the experience of sa&#x301;lokya or sa&#x301;miipya had to pass through various difficulties and hardships. The path of attainment was in no way simple and smooth. In the case of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the realization of sa&#x301;lokya and samiipya was attained with very little difficulty, but in the case of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, one would not necessarily get the realization of sa&#x301;miipya as an inevitable concomitant of sa&#x301;lokya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>Sa&#x301;yujya</b>: Next comes the stage of sa&#x301;yujya. It implies close contact, almost body contact, the closest proximity imaginable. Most of the people of Vraja had enjoyed the realization of sa&#x301;yujya, for they had dined, sung, played the flute and danced with, and sat close to, their dearest Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. But it was not so easy to attain the state of sa&#x301;yujya with Pa&#x301;rasara&#x301;thi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Only Arjuna, the third of the five Pandava brothers, was blessed with this realization. None of the other brothers had the opportunity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><b>Sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya</b>: The next stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practice] is sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya. It implies that &ldquo;Not only am I close to Him, but whenever I think of Him I see Him in all directions.&rdquo; Now how do people attain this state of realization? One may attain this state by becoming His closest and most intimate companion &ndash; His father, mother, wife, son, or any near and dear relation &ndash; or one may realize Him in another way. If one commits many sins and becomes a confirmed sinner, one always remains in mortal fear and thinks of Him &ndash; &ldquo;Ah me, I am doing such ignoble deeds, the Lord is watching everything.&rdquo; While thinking thus, one either becomes mad or dies. Ravana<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> looked upon Parama Purus&#x301;a as his enemy, and ultimately died at the hands of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Kansa also looked upon Parama Purus&#x301;a as his enemy. Consequently, just one week before his death, Kansa saw the reflection of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a everywhere: in the sky, in the wind, in the trees and in the land and water. History tells us that in those days the primary school children were taught &ldquo;Ka is for &lsquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rsquo;&rdquo; The followers of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a would say, &ldquo;Ka is for &lsquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rsquo;&rdquo; But Kansa, out of extreme fear of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; a kind of fear complex &ndash; demanded that teachers teach &ldquo;Ka is for &lsquo;Kansa&rsquo;&rdquo; instead. Kansa saw Him everywhere and consequently became mad: became mad a week before his death, and then met his physical death. (Ravana also looked upon Parama Purus&#x301;a as his enemy.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now it is true that one may attain Parama Purus&#x301;a by being His enemy, but that path is a torturous and cruel path. It would be better that no one be made to endure such afflictions, because such a person remains condemned by society as long as human history endures. When this realization of sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya (visualizing Parama Purus&#x301;a in each and every particle of this universe) results out of immense love for Parama Purus&#x301;a, that is the genuine realization, the true realization, and is something enjoyable, something exceedingly sweet and precious. When human beings become restless for the attainment of Parama Purus&#x301;a, when they strive hard to realize Him in all their actions (and ultimately succeed), their zeal, their irresistible urge for the Lord, is called ara&#x301;dhana&#x301; in Sanskrit (a &ndash; ra&#x301;dh + anat&#x301; + ta&#x301; [feminine suffix] = ara&#x301;dhana&#x301;), and the entity who does this ara&#x301;dhana&#x301; is known as &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;. Here Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; represents the mind of a devotee. The people of Vraja felt and realized Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in all their thoughts and actions.<!-- /block --></p>

The Pandavas experienced this realization as His inseparable friends and devotees, and the Kaoravas as His formidable foes. Those who are criminals or sinners think of Parama Purus&#x301;a as their enemy. &ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s foes would think in fear, &ldquo;here comes the enemy Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rdquo; Thus the whole world became polarized during His lifetime. This polarization also took place during the period of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but it remained partial. At the time of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the polarization became complete. Society became divided into opposing camps: on the one side those who were extremely committed to Him, ever ready to lay down their lives for His mission and ideology, and on the other side those who became so angry and so hostile that they could not even tolerate His name, far less His existence.<!-- /block --></p>

Sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi occurs when spiritual aspirants realize Parama Purus&#x301;a in all possible ways and in all conceivable manners. Not only do the devotees see Him, they also remain united with Him, one with Him. That is, the sa&#x301;dhaka has the feeling that &ldquo;I exist, He also exists, and there is a link between us.&rdquo; There is a subject, there is an object, and there is a verb connecting the two. This is the proper significance of sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi. There is some difference between the meanings of sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi and of sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya. In sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya, the import is, &ldquo;I exist and, my Lord, You also exist,&rdquo; whereas in sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi it is, &ldquo;I have become one with You.&rdquo; But the question of my having become one with You remains. That is, there is an &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, though very tenuous. Otherwise how can I say that I have become one with You? To put the idea in another way, here in sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi the devotee and the Lord are extremely close, but duality remains nevertheless. The devotee exists and feels that his Lord is also there, so it is dualism. &ldquo;I don&#146;t want to become sugar, I want to taste sugar.

In Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava scriptures, not much mention is made of kaevalya (though it is not altogether non-existent), for sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi is generally considered to be the highest stage. This stage of realization was attained through Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, and also through Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but in a different way. Generally speaking, the realization is similar in the cases both of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but for Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the realizations of sa&#x301;miipya, sa&#x301;yujya, sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya, and sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi came through madhura bha&#x301;va [sweetness], pleasing ideation and intimacy at every stage, through joy and overflowing bliss. In the case of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the realization came through struggle, through privation and hardship. Unlike Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the sa&#x301;lokya stage does not inspire the hearts of His devotees by playing beautiful music on His flute. On the contrary, His directives to His devotees are: &ldquo;Do your worldly duties, build a stable society upon a sound economy, fight against injustice, and build a secure base for both individuals and the collectivity. Be pragmatic and remain united against all evil forces. Unite the different groups in society upon a common platform.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->You all know that it was Lord Shiva who first taught human beings how to live a systematic and harmonious life and how to oppose the fissiparous tendencies resulting from animal propensities. This was considered enough during Shiva&#146;s time, but during Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time there was greater social consciousness. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a wanted to arouse a strong urge in people&#146;s minds to fight against evil forces. Although Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not provide any socio-economic-political theory, He made people conscious in the social, economic and cultural spheres, and advanced society by providing inspiration in His own unique way. That is, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a helped the people to advance by expanding their social consciousness. That is why those who had received schooling from Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi jumped to the stage of sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi right from the lowermost stage of sa&#x301;lokya. They did not rise gradually to successively higher stages through joy and sweet blissful experiences, but advanced to the highest stage all at once. But this sudden expansion involved labour, toil and struggle. It entailed great risk and demanded uncompromising fighting spirit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In the case of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the devotee developed a unique spiritual consciousness. The one thought that filled a devotee&#146;s mind was, &ldquo;I want to go to Parama Purus&#x301;a,&rdquo; and that journey passed through madhura bha&#x301;va. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s teachings were quite different. He said, &ldquo;Well, you want to advance. That&#146;s all right, but others must come with you. You must all come together.&rdquo; This approach certainly impairs madhura bha&#x301;va to some extent because it involves an element of roughness. If we are to use an analogy, we can compare a very sweet thick-skinned mango to Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. You can easily peel away the skin and relish the sweet juicy fruit to your heart&#146;s content &ndash; no trouble, only happiness. If someone asks you how sweet it is, you cannot express your delight in words and you illustrate the sweetness through gestures. But Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a may be compared to a firm, ripe bel [wood apple] with a hard shell. You have to take some trouble to break the shell, and while breaking it you have to be careful not to let the fruit fall to the ground and smash into pieces. The pulp is no doubt very good for the stomach, perhaps even better than a mango, but it is not so nice to eat. It is not as juicy as a mango. If Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a can be likened to high quality cakes like gokulapiit&#x301;ha&#x301; or pa&#x301;t&#x301;i sa&#x301;pt&#x301;a&#x301;, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a may be likened to sweets made of boiled, condensed sugar cane juice.<!-- /block --></p>

However, things were different with Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. His flute produced different notes at different times. When devotees achieve some spiritual progress through madhura bha&#x301;va, they hear a sound similar to a cricket sound. If you meditate in a lonely place with deep concentration you will hear the sound of crickets. Of course the crickets become silent after a while, whereas the Cosmic sound never stops its continuous refrain. This is the first stage of the flute sound of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the field of human intellect and intuition, there was and still is a nice idea &ndash; the idea of prapatti. In the light of this idea of prapatti we shall analyse the roles of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In India, in the realm of spiritual practice and philosophy, the importance of prapattiva&#x301;da [the doctrine of prapatti] is very great. &ldquo;Philosophy&rdquo; is a Latin term; the Arabic equivalent is phalsapha&#x301;, and darshana is the Sanskrit term. Philosophy is the theoretical aspect of actional flow. What should we do? How and why should we act? These things are what constitute the scope and subject matter of philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->From a perusal of ancient Indian history, we know that Sada&#x301;shiva was born over seven thousand years ago. People in those days were not intellectually advanced. It is futile to discuss philosophy with people of undeveloped intellect; it is a mere waste of time both for those who do not grasp philosophy and for those who try to explain it. When the human intellect develops sufficiently, only then do people begin to understand philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->While trying to unite the scattered human groups into a well-knit social system, Lord Shiva marked that for the advancement of humanity, the essential prerequisite was spiritual progress, and this required the awakening of the spiritual urge. Lord Shiva awakened the spiritual urge in the people of His time. He taught them spiritual practice. He taught them the practice of Tantra, which is the practical aspect of spirituality, as you know. He also taught them spiritual dance, that is, ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava. Pa&#x301;rvatii gave society the lalita ma&#x301;rmika dance. Shiva also taught Maharshi Dhanvantari the vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra. (Here one should remember the difference between the vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra and the a&#x301;yurveda sha&#x301;stra, another school of medicine. The school of medicine that depends on the Vedas is called a&#x301;yurveda, and the Tantra-based school of medicine is called the vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra. In Bengal the vaedyaka sha&#x301;stra is more popular than a&#x301;yurveda.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Lord Shiva also taught Maharshi Bharata the science of music &ndash; nrtya, giita and va&#x301;dya [dance, song and percussion music].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Thus He opened various channels for the expression of human intellect and wisdom. But He did not expound any philosophy, because the people of those days were not sufficiently developed intellectually. But whether people are intellectually developed or undeveloped from the philosophical point of view, everyone is entitled to spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, everyone can attain the supreme height of spirituality. One may or may not comprehend philosophy, but still one can attain Parama Purus&#x301;a by dint of spiritual cult. For that, the knowledge of the three R&#146;s is not essential. Rather, Lord Shiva cautioned that those who were dabbling in philosophical discussions in those days were just confusing people&#146;s minds and misguiding the masses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->(Of course there was no recognized philosopher in Shiva&#146;s time. Maharshi Kapila, the first recognized philosopher on this earth, emerged much later than Shiva. Kapila was born at a place near Jhalda in the district of Purulia in West Bengal, and he did his sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; at Gangasagar in Sagar-dwip.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Common people cannot understand philosophical intricacies. Someone will say &ldquo;a&rdquo; [as in &ldquo;what&rdquo;], someone else will say &ldquo;a&rdquo; [as in &ldquo;cat&rdquo;], and so on and so forth. For instance, the single letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; in the English alphabet has got twenty-one types of pronunciation. Suppose a kindergarten child is taught twenty-one types of pronunciation by twenty-one teachers, the child is bound to get lost and confused. One should learn these things step by step. A-N-T alone is pronounced &ldquo;ant&rdquo;, but A-N-T in &ldquo;elephant&rdquo; has a different pronunciation.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Lord Shiva branded those philosophers who were spelling out confusing philosophical ideas to the common people as Lokavya&#x301;mohaka&#x301;raka&#x301;h [&ldquo;Their only work is to inject disease into human life&rdquo;]. Loka means &ldquo;the world&rdquo;, vya&#x301;moha means &ldquo;disease&rdquo;, and ka&#x301;raka&#x301;h means those who inject these so-called philosophies into people&#146;s minds. Lord Shiva drove such philosophers away from society. He clearly opined that such so-called philosophers would not be able to help the then society to progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Maharshi Kapila came much later than Lord Shiva and some time before Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s advent. He propounded his school of philosophy, elaborating his ideas regarding creation and evolution through twenty-four principles. These twenty-four principles, he said, were there at the beginning of creation &ndash; not one or two or four or five, but the total number of twenty-four principles was there. Since Maharshi Kapila fixed the total sam&#x301;khya&#x301; [number] at twenty-four, his school of philosophy came to be known as &ldquo;Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya&rdquo;. In fact, in his Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, Kapila did not say anything about Parama Purus&#x301;a, but by way of elaborating his philosophical views he said, &ldquo;Sure enough, there is one Supreme Entity &ndash; the Creator of this universe. To that Entity I give the name Janya Iishvara.&rdquo; (Here the implication is &ldquo;for the creation&rdquo; [janya means &ldquo;for&rdquo;].) &ldquo;We are bound to accept this Iishvara.&rdquo; This much only Kapila said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This exposition of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy caused some whispering, some murmuring, among the people immediately after Kapila&#146;s time. People wondered how Kapila, the greatest scholar of that age, who had long pondered the mysteries of creation, having formulated those twenty-four principles and given the concept of Janya Iishvara, had utterly failed to elaborate or clarify this concept further. He said, &ldquo;Sorry, I can&#146;t say any more than what I have already said.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Some of the people then began to think that the very intellect with which Kapila had invented his philosophical doctrine was provided by no other entity than Janya Iishvara. Thus to say anything about Janya Iishvara naturally remained beyond the intellectual capacity of Kapila. This sort of philosophical whispering became vocalized in later periods. People began to boldly say, &ldquo;No, Kapila is not right &ndash; he is wrong in his philosophical assertions. How could he say anything about the Creator, without whose will not even a blade of green grass can move? How could Kapila dare pronounce anything about that Supreme Entity!&rdquo; Thus arose a new philosophical idea &ndash; the idea of prapattiva&#x301;da [the doctrine of prapatti], as it is called today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And sure enough, in the wake of this prapattiva&#x301;da, its antithesis also came into the being, the idea of viprapatti. And aprapatti also arose, which neither supported nor opposed prapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The Shaivites &ndash; those who pursued the Shiva cult &ndash; were instructed by Lord Shiva to steer clear of any philosophical discussions. Lord Shiva had announced that the world would have the right sort of philosophy at the opportune time, and now it was pointless to bother about so-called philosophies. Hence the Shaivites were aprapattiva&#x301;diis, that is, they were neither supporters nor opponents of prapattiva&#x301;da. Both viprapattiva&#x301;da and prapattiva&#x301;da, as philosophical ideas, were becoming quite popular.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was born into this philosophical environment.

Prapattiva&#x301;da, which received special support directly or indirectly from Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, found a permanent place in Bha&#x301;gavata sha&#x301;stra, which evolved at a much later date.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->By studying the Sanskrit language, one can easily determine the period of composition of the scriptures. If we find etad nas dha&#x301;mah, we should immediately conclude that the composition is about 12,000 years old, because the language is Rgvedic. But if we find idam&#x301; asma&#x301;kam&#x301; grham&#x301; asti, we should conclude that it is 1500 years old at the most. The language of the Bha&#x301;gavata sha&#x301;stra clearly indicates that this scripture was composed much later than Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time, and it has given a direct recognition to prapattiva&#x301;da.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Vaishnavism, or the cult of devotion, chiefly rests on the idea of prapatti. In the initial stage, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma [the faculty of knowledge and the faculty of action] threw out a challenge to prapattiva&#x301;da, but finally they gave in with these words: &ldquo;We just put up a facade of resistance. In our heart of hearts we accept your supremacy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The word prapatti is derived pra &ndash; pat root + ktin suffix. Prapatti means complete surrender. The inner spirit of prapatti is that whatever is taking place in the universe is all due to the Cosmic will. Had Parama Purus&#x301;a willed otherwise, things would have been different. Hence the Cosmic will is at the root of each and every action. Thus we should say, &ldquo;O Lord, Thy will be done. I am but a machine. Utilize this machine in any way You like. I am nothing but a mere tool in your hands.&rdquo; This is the spirit of prapattiva&#x301;da. This inner spirit of prapatti is nicely reflected in a modern Bengali song:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Sakali toma&#x301;r iccha&#x301; iccha&#x301;mayii ta&#x301;ra&#x301; tumi;<br>Toma&#x301;r karma tumi kara ma&#x301; loke bale kari a&#x301;mi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->[All that is happening is Your own thought-projection. Whatever You wish to do becomes implemented. It is You who do everything. People foolishly claim the credit for doing things.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Though this song was composed by a follower of the Shakti Cult, it represents perfectly the spirit of Vaishnavism. The idea is more in conformity with Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;aviiya [Vaishnavite] prapattiva&#x301;da than with the Shakti Cult. However, this is not the subject of the discourse today, or else I would point out how the Shakti cult was influenced by the doctrine of Vaishnavism. The subject is prapattiva&#x301;da.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a does not say anything verbally about prapatti, but all His actions, His behaviour, the music from His proverbial flute, His call to the people &ndash; all these clearly reflect the spirit of prapattiva&#x301;da. Nevertheless, He abstains from vocalizing His approval of prapattiva&#x301;da. At the same time, He desists from speaking for or against jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma. He is simply making the people float in the stream of devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a played the most regaling notes on His flute. The waves of ideation that emanated from His music, the trough and crest of the waves, flowed and reached the innermost recesses of the mind, and aroused a responsive ideation in the devotees. Each devotee felt that the sound of the flute was calling him or her alone. &ldquo;I can no longer afford to ignore the sound of the flute and stay away, for the flute is calling me by name.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Thus human beings advanced and moved on. How do people progress? They progress according to the vibrational waves and inspiration emanating from the mind of the Boundless Entity, and this reaches the inner cores of their minds and souls. These billowing waves drive the jiivas [living beings] forward and bring them into close proximity to the Boundless Entity. That is to say, the music emanating from Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s flute shook the minds of the sa&#x301;dhakas, causing them to echo and vibrate. This resonance is nothing but prapattiva&#x301;da. Here there is scope neither for jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na nor for karma. Here mobility is the only task, the only dharma. &ldquo;The way He is calling me &ndash; I am to move accordingly.&rdquo; This state of mind is one of the sweetest states, the madhura gun&#x301;a [sweet quality] of prapattiva&#x301;da. &ldquo;I am rushing ahead due to the sweet call of His flute and entering into His sweet and blissful environment.&rdquo; Hence for Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, there is no need to interpret the faculties of knowledge and action. There is no scope for fighting over philosophical ideas. Only complete prapatti is there, and once it shakes the jiiva, he or she can no longer stay away. One rushes out and starts running after Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Prapatti-orientated psychology generally resembles the psychology behind the science of phonetics. Just as in the science of phonetics there are three types of pronunciation &ndash; short, long, and drawled (or prolonged) &ndash; so in prapatti there are three distinct kinds of psychological expression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->We started our discussion about Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and prapatti. To make the topic clear, we must analyse a few more things. When people utter something and when that utterance keeps adjustment with the collective acoustic flow in the ethereal void, that sound is called pluta [prolonged sound]. In the Sanskrit language there is the system of pluta sound, but this is absent in Bengali and the rest of the world&#146;s languages. If I use a short pronunciation I will say agni-miilre; if a long pronunciation, I will say agni-mii-i-lre; if a prolonged pronunciation, I will say agni-mii-i-i-lre.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In Bengali there is hardly any prolonged pronunciation. For that reason, Rabindranath Tagore spelled the word ra&#x301;n&#x301;ii as ra&#x301;ni, and n&#x301; as n. Anyway, when one&#146;s psychology conforms to the one vast flow, one eternal flow, of bliss, flowing from beginninglessness to endlessness, wherein every entity is inundated, saturated and drenched with bliss &ndash; when I am identifying my psychology with that flow &ndash; this psychology resembles the psychology of the prolonged phonetic sound, and is called prapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This idea may be explained in another way. An all-pervasive idea is originating from the universal Nucleus and flowing towards Infinity. We should bear in mind that this universe of ours is very vast but not infinite, because it has been created by three principles &ndash; the sentient, mutative and static principles. The sentient principle cannot be measured, neither in idea nor in practice. The mutative can be measured in imagination but not in practice. The static can be measured in both ways; however, the sphere of the static principle is so vast that it is difficult to measure it, even in practice. For example, the Himalayas, though very, very vast, can theoretically be measured, but practically speaking, it is impossible to measure them. For such cases, we use the Sanskrit term visha&#x301;la, which means &ldquo;vast but within the scope of measurement&rdquo;; and the Entity that is too big to be measured is called vira&#x301;t&#x301;a. This universe is very vast, visha&#x301;la, but not infinite, vira&#x301;t&#x301;a. Though very big, it has limitations. While people are small, the universe is very large.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->These forces, these waves of different lengths emanated from that singular, universal hub, that universal nave, are constantly advancing towards infinity. That is, those waves are not confined to this world. This should be borne in mind. Whenever something remains within the scope of this universe, within the circumference of this universe, we call it vishvagata, and when it goes beyond the scope of this universe, we call it vishva&#x301;tiita. When human beings proceed along these waves &ndash; along these pencils of waves and pencils of rays &ndash; their movement, although vishvagata in the initial stage, becomes vishvatiita in the end. Those who are clever will identify their limited individual identity with the Cosmic emanations and they will thereby finally become Cosmic. As long as they remain vishvagata, they continue to enjoy the waves of bliss, the blissful expressions, and when they attain the vishva&#x301;tiita state, they remain forever in the ocean of bliss. Then the sa&#x301;dhaka becomes detached from everything else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now whatever Parama Purus&#x301;a does, He does for the good of humanity. Not a single blade of grass can move without His desire. This very endeavour to obtain bliss by identifying one&#146;s microcosmic waves with the Cosmic emanations is called prapatti. I have already said that this prapatti resembles, to a great extent, the prolonged sound in the science of phonetics. Those of you who have achieved some spiritual elevation will hear a prolonged sound &ndash; one that is neither short nor long, but a prolonged sound that continues smoothly without changing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Next comes the long sound of the science of phonetics, that is, a medium sound. The sa&#x301;dhaka feels that he or she is able to hear that sound by dint of his or her own efforts. If drawn out to a great length, it may become a pluta sound, and if shortened, it will be a sound which generally conforms to aprapatti. But where there is only individual effort regardless of one&#146;s capacity, to the exclusion of prapatti, aprapatti and thoughts of Parama Purus&#x301;a or the universal acoustic emanation, it is similar to short pronunciation &ndash; it resembles viprapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->It has been said earlier that Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a attracted people with His magic flute. Innumerable sound waves emanated from His flute, and His devotees rushed towards Him in the flow of those sound waves. Clearly, this is prapattiva&#x301;da. Although there is an element of knowledge and action, devotion is the predominant factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was different.

<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301; phales&#x301;u kada&#x301;cana [&ldquo;but not to the fruits of the action&rdquo;]. Regarding karma, it is said that for each and every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, provided the three fundamental relative factors, namely, the temporal factor, the spatial factor and the personal factor, remain unchanged, remain unassailed; otherwise, there will be a change in the reaction. The reaction in that case will not be equal and opposite in nature. Suppose, for example, you borrow one hundred rupees from a particular person. If you pay back the amount then and there, you will not be required to pay back any additional money. If you pay back the loan after a long time, however, say a few years, you will have to pay back the capital with interest. Thus the amount of one hundred rupees returns in a changed form due to the change in the temporal factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In prapattiva&#x301;da, if the devotees respond in the same manner as the musical flute calls them, there will not be any change. But with karma, it is different. Here Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a says, &ldquo;You are certainly entitled to action, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions.&rdquo; The result of action changes with the changes in time, place and person. Therefore, you have control over the original action but not over the reaction. Hence it is said, Ma&#x301; phalesu kada&#x301;cana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Here you should remember one thing. There are some opportunistic people in this world who distort the meaning of this shloka from the Giita&#x301; and thus manage to perpetuate the machinery of exploitation. This is very amusing. I bring it into the domain of philosophy because it is highly illustrative. Those exploiters glibly make their views known: &ldquo;These poor people, these toiling people, these intellectuals, they have no doubt the right to work, but they have no right to the results of their actions. The results, the fruits, should accrue to us, the owners, the proprietors. &lsquo;Increase our wages, give us more remuneration, pay us a bonus&#8230;&rsquo; &ndash; they have no right to say all these things.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->However, let us get back to the main topic. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, Ma&#x301; karmaphalaheturbhu&#x301;ma&#x301; te saun&#x32D;go&#146;stvakarman&#x301;i [&ldquo;You must not do actions that will bind you, but you must not be averse to action, either&rdquo;]. Do your duty, your karma. Now, is this karma in conformity with prapatti or is it antagonistic to prapatti? The teachings of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a are clearly consistent with prapatti. His existence, His actions, the music of His flute, the way in which He attracts people and gives them shelter &ndash; all these are in perfect harmony with prapatti, because an individual feels free after surrendering everything to the Macrocosmic Entity. Here Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, &ldquo;Do your karma, for you have an inalienable right to your karma.&rdquo; Karma is defined as Karma Brahmeti karma bahu kurviita &ndash; &ldquo;You are human. Simply look upon karma as a veritable expression of Brahma [Supreme Entity] and do as much karma as you can.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Is this in agreement with prapatti or at variance with prapatti? It seems to be opposed to prapatti but in actuality it is not. If we go deeper into the subject, we see that this quinquelemental body, this body of flesh and bones, this mind made of ectoplasmic stuff, this reflecting plate that acts as the witnessing entity (known as a&#x301;tman or purus&#x301;a in philosophy) &ndash; all these have their origin in Parama Purus&#x301;a. It is the Cosmic desire that is the source of the creation of the human body, mind and soul. If we utilize this body, mind and jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; [soul, self, unit consciousness], we are only following the path of prapatti. That is, we are utilizing the things given to us by Parama Purus&#x301;a. All these things, the body, mind and self, are His gifts. Had He willed otherwise, they would not have existed. Without Cosmic desire, nothing can exist, nothing can move, not even a blade of grass. So in accordance with the spirit of prapatti, that the body is a machine, we can say that He has been kind enough to provide the body and mind, to be utilized for work only. Hence I follow the spirit of prapatti in using them.<!-- /block --></p>

It is definitely in conformity with prapatti. So a boy or a girl who does work is surely following the path of prapatti. Even if there is any room for indolence while enjoying the flute of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, there is not the least room for inaction in the clarion call of the karma yoga of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->We will discuss Tantra a little in relation to prapatti, viprapatti, and aprapatti. The original propounder of Tantra was Lord Sada&#x301;shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->From the viewpoint of geography, Tantra has two main divisions &ndash; one is the Bengal school of Tantra, the other is the Kashmir school of Tantra. The Bengal school is less ritualistic and more practical, while the Kashmir school is more ritualistic and less practical. And from the viewpoint of spiritual practice, Tantra has five main divisions: Shaeva Tantra, Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, Saora Tantra, and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra. It is said that Shaeva Tantra attaches more importance to the faculty of knowledge and to the elimination of caste and other social discriminations. Sha&#x301;kta Tantra lays greater stress on the attainment of power and its judicious application. Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra aspires to lead humanity towards Parama Purus&#x301;a through the cult of sweet, divine bliss, but there is less social consciousness. Saora Tantra places much importance on medical treatment and astronomical progress, and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra provides inspiration for people who are divided into different social groups to work unitedly.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Here I do not propose to say anything special about Shaeva or Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, but I must say something about Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra. It is said that Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra aspires to lead spiritual aspirants towards Parama Purus&#x301;a through the cult of blissful experiences. (If I ever say anything in the future regarding Saora Tantra, I will discuss it at great length and during that discussion I will point out that Saora Tantra was not only concerned with the sciences of medicine and astronomy. It was much more than that, especially in the Middle East and India about one thousand to three thousand years ago. However, in the present context this is irrelevant.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->While dealing with Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra [Vaishnavite Tantra], we notice that although it had its origin in India, more particularly in southern India, it was later significantly influenced by the Middle East. As a result, the modern Vaishnavism, or rather the Vaishnavism which was prevalent during the Mughal period, was greatly influenced by the Sufism of the Middle East.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Our topic of discussion is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and His life. During Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s lifetime, Sufism was not in vogue in the Middle East. The Vaishnavism of southern India, as enunciated in the Bha&#x301;gavata sha&#x301;stra &ndash; that is, the Shriimad Bha&#x301;gavata [of that sha&#x301;stra], not the Shriimad Bhagavad Giita&#x301; &ndash; came much later than Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The Dravidian Brahmans of southern India had not yet become clearly divided into two branches; later they were to become divided into the Ayengars and the Aiyars. (The Ayengars were Vaishnavites and the Aiyars were Shaivites. One could easily distinguish the Aiyars from the Ayengars by their distinct styles of decorating their foreheads with holy ash.) While the different classifications of Tantra could be found in those days, they were not very rigid or distinct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If the forward march towards Parama Purus&#x301;a through the cult of sweet, divine bliss is the basic spirit of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, then that spirit must have been reflected in both Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. This forward march can be effected only through prapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When a devotee advances through the cult of sweet devotion, he or she prefers to avoid the path of philosophical intricacies. Suppose you have been allotted a certain duty and you have to run hard to perform that duty. If you are offered some delicious sweets you will say, &ldquo;No thank you, not now. Let me run first, then I will take some rest and enjoy the sweets little by little with great pleasure.&rdquo; While running, one&#146;s mind remains at a high speed, tremendously preoccupied. That is why you cannot, at that speed, savour even delicious food. Similarly, when you advance in the cult of sweet devotion, you enjoy more and more sweetness. While advancing, you enjoy bliss at every step. Obviously, at that stage, you do not like the tormenting harshness of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->I have said several times prior to this that prapatti &ndash; that sweetness of divine ecstasy &ndash; was fully developed in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. But as I have also said, the karma yoga which is the hallmark of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is not opposed to prapatti. Now let us analyse whether the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na ma&#x301;rga [path of knowledge, or discrimination], as associated with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, is more consistent with the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na ma&#x301;rga of Shaivism or with the cult of sweet, divine bliss found in Vaishnavism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a demonstrated an enormous wealth of knowledge. All His teachings were based primarily on the cult of knowledge. He taught His philosophy to Arjuna, and it does not smack of negativism or escapism. According to Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, whatever takes place in this universe is designed by the Cosmic will. Nothing can happen without the Cosmic desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Jiivas are compelled to act under the impact of two personalities. One is the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; which craves to accumulate so many things, big or small, and to give so many things to society. The small &ldquo;I&rdquo; creates a world of its own centring around that little &ldquo;I&rdquo;, a world of illusion wherein the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; is entrapped and where it considers itself to be the supreme monarch. But simultaneously there is a larger world, the much larger world of Parama Purus&#x301;a, a world where the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; is a mere bubble. All the hopes and aspirations, all the desires and urges, of that insignificant bubble residing within the vast mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a, attain supreme fulfilment only at the time when it merges itself in the main stream of the Cosmic flow. Otherwise, individual hopes and desires remain forever unfulfilled and unrealized. Human beings cherish thousands of desires in their hearts, but those desires generally remain unfulfilled, because the waves of individual human desire do not maintain parallelism with the waves of the Cosmic desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->It was quite natural for Arjuna to hesitate in slaying His friends and relations on the battlefield. The Kaoravas were his dear kinsmen, and there were many other kings and vassals who were bound in ties of intimate friendship with Arjuna. He felt compassion for all his friends and relatives, but that love and compassion for his relatives and friends was something related to Arjuna&#146;s unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. It had no validity in the Cosmic world. Therefore Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a addressed and exhorted Arjuna in the following manner: &ldquo;Oh, Arjuna, don&#146;t think that you are killing anyone. No one ever kills or is ever killed. Weapons can never kill anyone.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So what will you do? Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s flow of imagination continues unceasingly. No one can resist that mighty flow of Cosmic imagination. It was erroneous for Arjuna to think that he himself was killing his dear kinsmen, the Kaoravas. Thus Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said: &ldquo;Things are already planned and predestined by Me. I have already planned everything out in My mind. You are just an instrument.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There are two things to note here. The first thing is that according to Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da [the Doctrine of Illusion], the very existence of the material world, though not altogether denied, is given little importance. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s teachings, however, are not actually Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da. In Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, the systaltic movement of the Macrocosm is not altogether accepted. Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dii philosophers argue that the universe is the magic of the miracle-creating Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;: aghat&#x301;ana ghat&#x301;ana pat&#x301;iiyasii Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; [&ldquo;the dexterous hand of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; that can even create things impossible to create&rdquo;]. &ldquo;Nothing is really happening, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is doing everything&rdquo; &ndash; it is strict monism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The second thing to note is that in the teachings of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, there may not be absolute prapatti at first; when Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a advanced so many philosophical arguments, it seemed to be viprapatti, just opposite to prapatti. However, when at the next stage He told Arjuna, &ldquo;I have already set everything in a pre-arranged plan, you are a mere tool in my hands,&rdquo; it was clearly aprapatti. Till then it had not been clearly stated that &ldquo;It is I who do everything. Everything takes place as per My wish. Your wish, your desire has no value.&rdquo; Finally this aprapatti became prapatti when He said,<!-- /block --></p>

I have already said that progress in the physical and psychic spheres is not possible. Progress is possible only in the spiritual stratum. Sarvadharma&#x301;n means the various propensities or various instincts [of a human being], that is, the various fetters and enemies of the mind. The microcosms, with their numerous sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, are rushing along. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said to them: &ldquo;Stop running after your desires&rdquo;&#8230; Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja &ndash; &ldquo;Follow Me. Take Me as your final refuge.

<a name="7..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The fact is, the more one advances towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, the more one becomes free from blemishes, the more one is cleansed of the dirt and dross of mundane life. Parama Purus&#x301;a lifts His devotees and places them on His lap. This can be considered the last word of the Giita&#x301;, the summum bonum, or goal, of human life. It is the final statement about the supreme human desideratum. Regarding the path of movement, many things are said, but regarding the goal the final word is this: &ldquo;Forgetting all other things, forgetting your desires and aspirations, come to Me.&rdquo; Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja &ndash; &ldquo;take shelter in Me.&rdquo; This is nothing but prapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Now, is there any difference between the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na of Shaivite philosophy and the prapatti of Vaishnavite philosophy? The Shaivite philosophical knowledge is hair-splitting knowledge which aspires to arrive at the goal through the conflicts and clashes arising from affirmation and negation, and through analysis of the law of cause and effect. On this path there is neither prapatti nor aprapatti. In the initial stage one makes use of viprapatti, but after reaching the goal, nothing remains, neither viprapatti nor prapatti nor aprapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->From the earliest times there existed differences of opinion between the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava scholars and the Shaeva scholars. This was an ideological conflict. And though Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s teaching [of prapatti] forms part of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, it is also resplendent in its own brilliance.<!-- /block --></p>

Then He said [expressing aprapatti], &ldquo;It is I who do everything. You are doing nothing.&rdquo; (Actually, people have very little strength. If a person fasts for twenty-four hours, he or she feels fatigued. If a person fasts for forty-eight hours, he or she cannot think. How weak people are!) And in the third stage Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said to humanity, &ldquo;You need not worry about anything. I will do everything for you.

In Saora Tantra it is Su&#x301;rya (the sun  or the sun god), and in Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra it is Gan&#x301;apati  (Gan&#x301;esha). In all the cults, the more subtle practitioners understand  that their particular deity is a representation of the infinite Brahma. &ndash;Eds.</p>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Sama&#x301;ja gurus [social preceptors] are those who lead the entire society by virtue of their extraordinary intelligence, deep wisdom, towering personality and leadership ability. Hence it can be easily imagined that this world has been blessed with few such social preceptors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Kaolas are those who do kula sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [the spiritual practice for the elevation of the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii] and elevate their minds to the level of Cosmic Consciousness through the realm of intuition by turning microcosmic negativity into Macrocosmic positivity. A Maha&#x301;kaola is one who makes others kaola by his infallible spiritual guidance. But Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is quite a different Entity, a unique Entity, for He is spiritual preceptor, social preceptor, kaola and Maha&#x301;kaola all in one. He is also something more: He acts as a compass in every stratum of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sada&#x301;shiva was Ta&#x301;raka Brahma. As sovereign preceptor He did whatever was necessary for the undeveloped humanity of that age, providing inspiration and active help in every sphere of intellect in human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Humanity advanced a lot during the time of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. But together with the flowering of human intellect there arose various mundane, social and psychic problems. To solve those problems Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had to play various roles. Naturally the question as to which role was more significant and which less significant, or which situation was more difficult and which less difficult, is of no consequence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time philosophy was undeveloped. Even though the sage Maharshi Kapila had been born before Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, his philosophical ideas had not been elaborated on, commented on, annotated, etc. The great Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya commentator Iishvarakrs&#x301;n&#x301;a, a follower of Kapila, was born much later. So there existed no particular philosophy in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time in the light of which Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s activities could be judged.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->At the time of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, our present age lay far in the future. It is not possible to judge Him properly from the perspective of the present age, because people today are not at all familiar with the environment of the age in which He lived. Nevertheless, we can analyse His activities in the light of the various schools of philosophical thought which have been discovered (or we could say invented) since His time and say how far His actions agreed with or deviated from their philosophical outlook.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy is accepted as the oldest school of philosophy. Kapila, its founder, declared as its principal idea that the fundamental elements which make up the jagat [the world], the jiivas [microcosms] and Iishvara [God] have been specifically enumerated; that is, the world is a composite of those twenty-four elements. (Those elements were not elements in the sense in which contemporary science uses the word.) In Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, for practical purposes recognition was given to God as Janya Iishvara<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->. But the main role of director of the universal drama in the flow of creation was assigned to Prakrti [the Operative Principle], and thus She was given another name as well &ndash; Pradha&#x301;na [Foremost]. The presence of Purus&#x301;a [Consciousness] is like that of a catalytic agent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->For instance, gold is used as a catalyst in the preparation of makaradhvaja [a type of a&#x301;yurvaedik medicine]. Once it has been prepared, the gold can easily be separated out. Yet makaradhvaja thus prepared is called svarn&#x301;a-ghat&#x301;ita makaradhvaja [gold-made makaradhvaja] &ndash; gold was the catalytic agent. Similarly, in the Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy it has been recognized that Purus&#x301;a does not actually do anything, yet without His presence nothing can take place in the universe. Purus&#x301;a does not actually do anything Himself; in this sense it is all the same whether Purus&#x301;a is there or not. It is the vast, dominant Prakrti which does everything. Purus&#x301;a is seen as the entity which remains inseparably associated with the countless tiny jiivas. Thus the chief contention of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy is that there are many purus&#x301;as but only one Prakrti. Behind this one Prakrti and many purus&#x301;as there is the presence of one catalytic agent (i.e., whose existence is indispensable), a kind of iishvara [controller] called Janya Iishvara. That is, everything is done because of [janya] this Entity, hence Janya Iishvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, if we consider Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, we see that Ekameva&#x301;dvitiiyam &ndash; &ldquo;Purus&#x301;a is one without a second, and all the jiivas are Prakrti.&rdquo; Here there is not a singular Prakrti but a multiplicity of Prakrtis. What is the nature of Prakrti? Prakrti Sa&#x301; nityanivrtta&#x301; [&ldquo;Prakrti always undergoes change and decay, little by little&rdquo;]. In this respect She can be likened to ghee, which grows radiant when it comes in contact with fire but ultimately burns itself out. In the same manner Prakrti (and every jiiva is Prakrti) is nityanivrtta&#x301; [&ldquo;constantly decaying&rdquo;]. When the jiivabha&#x301;va [microcosmic bearing] becomes pinnacled and advances towards Parama Purus&#x301;a to the complete exclusion of all other thoughts, becomes &ldquo;I don&#146;t want anything of this world, I want only Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Entity,&rdquo; it is termed &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;. This is the expression of the single-minded devotion of the microcosmic mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Many people are not aware of the real import of the term &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;. The actual import is this: When the human mind realizes that nothing of this quinquelemental world is permanent, that nothing is absolute or final, that all thoughts and activities are extremely brief and transient, that the only reality is Parama Purus&#x301;a, and says, &ldquo;I will run only after Him, not after anything else,&rdquo; that very mentality is Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. How long can human beings hope to remain alive? One hundred or one hundred twenty years at most. During Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s time, there was a popular belief that the average human life span was one hundred twenty years. Later on this idea changed and people began to believe that the average longevity of human beings was one hundred eight years. The earlier idea is mentioned in Ks&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301;&#146;s saying:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Nara&#x301; gaja&#x301; bishe sha-y ta&#x301;r ardhek ba&#x301;nce hay;<br>Ba&#x301;ish balda tera cha&#x301;gla&#x301; bale gela bara&#x301; pa&#x301;gla&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[Humans and elephants live for one hundred twenty years. A horse lives for half that time; a bullock for twenty-two years, and a goat for thirteen years. That was the calculation of the astrologer Baraha.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Human beings and elephants live for one hundred twenty years.&rdquo; No one lives forever, no one eats forever. Not only that, if at one meal someone is offered more food than he or she can eat, he or she will have to decline it: food is not absolute, clothing is not absolute, nothing is absolute&#8230; Parama Purus&#x301;a is the only real entity, the only absolute entity. The further the jiivas move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, the more elevated their minds become. When they reach a very subtle stage of elevation, their concentrated mind-stuff speeds towards Him with the one-pointedness of an arrow. Such a mentality is called Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. One who aspires to know the concept of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;-Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in depth must possess a sufficiently-developed intellect. The Bha&#x301;gavata sha&#x301;stra, considered to be the most authentic texts on the bhakti [devotional] cult, does not give a satisfactory explanation of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; tattva [the concept of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;]. Those texts have failed too.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->What is Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va? When devotees feel in their heart of hearts that their existence is meaningless without attaining Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, that they cannot survive a single moment without feeling His blissful presence, they have attained the stage called Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. Such devotees know nothing other than a&#x301;ra&#x301;dhana&#x301; [total mental absorption in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; the Supreme]. This Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; mentality is found manifest in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and nowhere else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->People come to this world for a short time for some fun and games, and then they go. So for human beings the earth is like a traveller&#146;s inn, where they will not stay for long. Or it might be compared to a railway waiting room, where passengers from different places come and sit together for a while. The moment the train whistle blows, they forget each other, pick up their bags, and set off for the train. They do not look to right or left. Parama Purus&#x301;a Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is that train, and this world is the waiting room.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->This is an extraordinary idea &ndash; this is Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va [the realization of Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;], in which a&#x301;ra&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the main thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a is one without any second &ndash; Ekameva&#x301;dvitiiyam. But now I will show that Purus&#x301;a is neither the purus&#x301;a nor the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. According to Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy there are many purus&#x301;as, but in the spiritual cult there is only one Purus&#x301;a. There are many Prakrtis, but one Purus&#x301;a; many Radha&#146;s, but one Is&#x301;t&#x301;a, one Nucleus; only one sun, but many planets and satellites orbiting around that singular sun. The significance of human existence does not lie in philosophy or in argument, but in racing after Parama Purus&#x301;a. This beautiful notion will not be found anywhere except in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. There is not even a passing reference to it in any scripture or philosophical text.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Earlier I mentioned that the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy can be compared to the gold which is used as a catalyst in the preparation of svarn&#x301;a-ghat&#x301;ita makaradhvaja. He is there, passive, watching everything, but doing nothing in particular. But Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a as Purus&#x301;ottama, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a as Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, is extremely active (this concept of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is completely alien to Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy). Unlike the Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya purus&#x301;a, Ta&#x301;raka Brahma calls everyone towards Himself: &ldquo;Come, come, come to Me. I have come here for you and you alone. I am verily yours. Come and surrender to Me without any hesitation, without any reservation. I will take care of your future.&rdquo; Ta&#x301;raka Brahma provides this great assurance to humanity, and Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is an embodiment of this great assurance. He is not passive like the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Suppose someone is starving, or is being tortured or persecuted. The Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya remains a mute spectator to this suffering (and its witness-ship goes unrecorded), whereas Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a calls to suffering humanity, saying: &ldquo;You, the starving, the persecuted, the tortured, come to Me. I will liberate you.&rdquo; The sweet sound of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s  flute conveys the message of liberation to the ears of all. Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy cannot come anywhere near this idea, cannot even touch Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s fingernail. It is far, far away from the practical reality. Where there is a tremendous expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a, how far can philosophical dabbling solve the actual problems? So we see that the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya and Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a are not the same thing. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is the collection of all the divine qualities and occult powers, whereas the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya is almost a static entity whose presence matters very little to the created beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->According to Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya, a brick, a piece of wood, an insect and a cat each are all purus&#x301;as, and they are all moving about in respective structures which are parts of Prakrti. But with Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a things are quite different. His philosophy is that each and every entity is a partial manifestation of Prakrti on which the one radiated Purus&#x301;a is reflected. When in contact with the purus&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;sa [expression of consciousness], the jiivaprakrti [unit prakrti] realizes that the Cognitive Faculty, the sweet expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a, pleases the hearts and minds of the microcosms. Human beings feel very happy to live in the world because they experience a blissful feeling all over. Madhuram&#x301; madhuram&#x301; sarve hi madhuram&#x301; [&ldquo;Everything in this universe is saturated with sweetness&rdquo;]. So how blissful must be Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, from whom such sweet vibrations come! A rasagolla&#x301; [Indian sweet] definitely tastes sweet, but Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is an infinite number of times sweeter &ndash; sweeter beyond measure. Thus as soon as jiivas understand deeply who Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is, they rush towards Him with a fervent desire to merge in Him &ndash; this is jaeva dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The interesting thing is that here jaeva dharma, ma&#x301;nava dharma and Aeshvariiya dharma<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> are combined harmoniously, fusing together into something excellent and unique. The devotee becomes indifferent to any censure or praise and rushes towards Parama Purus&#x301;a in the form of Manomohana Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a [&ldquo;the one who nourishes the human heart with divine bliss&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is also called Mohana [literally, &ldquo;attractive&rdquo;] because He charms everyone and attracts everyone towards Himself. A devotee does not like to be with Him in the presence of others, but wants to enjoy the intimacy and sweetness of being with Him alone. Such a devotee does not like to think that He belongs to everyone, but to him or her alone. But when the devotee and He are alone together, does the devotee then think, &ldquo;He is all mine&rdquo;? No, the devotee then forgets what to say to Him, and becomes oblivious to himself or herself. When people are self-conscious, hundreds of questions arise in their minds. Only when that self-consciousness merges into Parama Purus&#x301;a, do the questions come to an end. Because in the presence of the Entity who is beyond all questions, the devotee becomes self-forgetful. That is the stance of Cosmic bliss. Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, or for that matter any philosophy, does not come anywhere near that stance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->There is no mention of and no scope for bhakti in Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. Bhakti is like a tether which draws people near. In the cult of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, one remains where one was, and in the case of karma, one remains preoccupied with hundreds of actions. Without the cultivation of bhakti, one can never come in close proximity to Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The cult of devotion first originated during the period of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. (Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a came later.) We find Parama Purus&#x301;a in charming form, in attractive form, in the form of one&#146;s own (more one&#146;s own than anyone else could be), for the first time in human history in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. In the cult of devotion, devotees view Parama Purus&#x301;a from their respective viewpoints according to their individual sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. The people of ancient India adored Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in three different ways: va&#x301;tsalya bha&#x301;va, madhura bha&#x301;va and sakhya bha&#x301;va.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Nanda and Yashoda&#x301; [Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s foster father and mother] adored Him in va&#x301;tsalya bha&#x301;va, whose spirit is: &ldquo;How lovely the child is, how pleasingly He speaks, how charming is His smile, how sweet is his inarticulate &lsquo;Pa-Pa-Pa Ma-Ma-Ma&rsquo;. I shall feed Him, I shall dress Him, I shall bathe Him, I shall make Him laugh. I shall caress Him, placing Him on my lap.&rdquo; Such devotees are busy exclusively with Him. Nanda and Yashoda&#x301; were the first to find the Cosmic bearing of Parama Purus&#x301;a reflected in a tiny child. The name of this bha&#x301;va [attitude, stance] is va&#x301;tsalya bha&#x301;va. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s own father, Vasudeva, and mother, Devakii or Daevakii (one person, two names) were separated from Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a during His childhood and thus were deprived of va&#x301;tsalya bha&#x301;va. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a only returned to them when He was quite mature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; attained Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a through madhura bha&#x301;va. In Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a she found everything that was charming and sweet in life. The spirit of madhura bha&#x301;va is this: &ldquo;I will make my entire existence, whether physical, mental, social or spiritual, one-pointed to derive bliss from my dear Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.&rdquo; Usually ninety-nine percent of all devotees maintain this Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va due to its sweetness. Never before in history did anyone attain Parama Purus&#x301;a in madhura bha&#x301;va; they attained Him for the first time in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. And Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a increased the degree of sweetness by playing His flute. People might say, &ldquo;I will never look at Him again&rdquo; &ndash; but then the flute sound would come to their ears and they would say, &ldquo;How can I not look at him?&rdquo; Or they might say, &ldquo;I will never even think of Him again, but will remain content to look after my little worldly family&rdquo; &ndash; but then the notes would call to them: &ldquo;Why didn&#146;t you come today? Are you not coming? I&#146;m waiting for You.&rdquo; This is madhura bha&#x301;va. In the history of the world, Parama Purus&#x301;a first appeared as the personification of charm and sweetness, to be attained through madhura bha&#x301;va, in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In analysing Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, we see that, being the embodiment of Parama Purus&#x301;a or Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, He is beyond the reach of philosophy. It is said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[Brahma is the One from whom words and mind return disappointed, after failing to fathom Its depths. But one who has known the blissful nature of  Brahma is not afraid of anything.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Words fail miserably to reach Him, and the mind is obliged to return after meeting the same fate.&rdquo; Parama Purus&#x301;a is beyond the eloquence and fluency of language, so how can philosophy fathom His greatness?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy contains the highest expression of intellect, but intellect, after all, is not everything. To reach the Supreme Entity, one must go beyond intellect and enter the realm of intuition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Some people may say that Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was comparatively easy to attain, for He mixed freely with the common people. Thus it may have been possible for Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy to say something about Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but even then it could not. That shows that Parama Purus&#x301;a, though established in the human mind, cannot be grasped by the human prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; [intellect].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->This applies even more in the case of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Being a king, He did not have much contact with the masses, but was confined to the circle of kings and vassals. Judged in that perspective, it is even more difficult for philosophy to reach Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi than to reach Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. It should be added that although Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was a king, and thus beyond the reach of the common masses, mentally He was always with the people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The word sa&#x301;rathi comes not only from Rathena saha, but also from the suffix i [imparting the sense of &ldquo;offspring&rdquo;]. That is, a sa&#x301;rathi is one who treats the chariot as his own child and thus takes constant precautions to ensure that it is not harmed in any way. One does not qualify as a sa&#x301;rathi merely by being able to drive a chariot.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, ratha does not only mean a horse-drawn chariot. What is its actual meaning?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->He is Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi because He encompasses the human intellect. [Buddhintu sa&#x301;rathim&#x301;: &ldquo;the intellect is the sa&#x301;rathi.&rdquo;] He supplies the human intellect with His intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Human beings are not concerned only about their physical existence. Behind the struggle for the minimum necessities of life (food, clothes, education, medical treatment and shelter) works the mind, which, in its turn, draws inspiration from the a&#x301;tman. People in today&#146;s world become fatigued by their wants and needs, attractions and aspirations, pleasures and pains, and weaknesses and imperfections. The One (as their charioteer) who leads them from the depths of darkness to the realm of brilliant light and strengthens them with divine inspiration, is Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. Only He has the might to shoulder such an immense responsibility, only He has the requisite vital force and intellectual acumen. So how can philosophy describe His greatness?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now, let us compare Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a with Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy says that there are many purus&#x301;as and one Janya Iishvara. Now what relationship can one [special] purus&#x301;a have with jiivas [microcosms], with the world, and with Iishvara? From the microcosmic point of view, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is a mighty, vigorously active purus&#x301;a, who brings about radical changes in the lifestyles of human beings and imparts benevolent guidance to them. Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya does not mention anything about such a Purus&#x301;a. According to Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya, there are many purus&#x301;as &ndash; a separate purus&#x301;a in each jiiva. But Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is not like that. Nor is He like the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, whose presence is [only] a necessity for the creation of the world. He is a superhuman personality as mighty as a meteor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is a great personality reflected in every word, in every direction, and in every divine expression of His Macrocosmic imagination. He is great because He is turning the vast chariot wheel of the Cosmos, He is guiding all things, all sentimental living entities. He is Ta&#x301;raka Brahma. He absorbs everything within His mind and guides humanity. What is the need for Him to guide and advise individual entities? Being Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, whatever He imagines mentally will take place accordingly in the outer world. He whose thoughts take the form of actions is called Cinta&#x301;man&#x301;i<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.9.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#9.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in the scriptures. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is Cinta&#x301;man&#x301;i. What was the need for Him to advise the Pandavas, to advise the Kaoravas, and to teach the Pandavas war strategy? Should He be considered like the unit purus&#x301;a as described by Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya? No, certainly not, for it is impossible for the unit purus&#x301;a to think such grand thoughts, to make such powerful thought-projections. So since He is not Janya Purus&#x301;a, He is Cosmic Consciousness personified, why should He take the trouble to work in a planned way, advising people, teaching people lessons on the value of system? Why? Simply by thinking He could have materialized His goals. Why did He go out of the way to create a drama? The battle of Kuruks&#x301;etra was a big drama. Why was it necessary? He could have thought, &ldquo;Well, the Kaoravas are finished,&rdquo; and the work would have been done. In fact, that is how things happened in the end, but only after staging a huge drama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->At the end of the war, Kuruks&#x301;etra was turned into a burial ground. Gandhari, Dhritarastra and their one hundred widowed daughters-in-law came there to have a last look at the dead bodies of their nearest relatives. All wept profusely. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Kunti, Draupadi and the Pandava brothers arrived on the other side of the battlefield for the same purpose. They too were weeping. It was indeed a heart-rending sight. While everyone was crying in deep sorrow Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a addressed Gandhari. &ldquo;Mother, I beseech you not to weep,&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;Sometimes tragic calamities like this befall humanity; so lament not, O Mother.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Gandhari was a noble lady of firm principles. A woman of integrity is called a satii. (In Sanskrit, the term sat means a virtuous man, whereas satii is used to describe a woman of integrity and pure character.) Both a maiden and a widow can be called satii na&#x301;rii. Gandhari was a noble lady of high integrity. She was virtuosity par excellence. She was a princess of Ga&#x301;ndha&#x301;ra, or Kandahar, a province of Afghanistan. When she was told that she would be married to Dhritarastra, who was born blind, she immediately blindfolded her eyes with a piece of cloth. Her contention was that as her husband was blind, she too should be blind. She removed the blindfold from her eyes only twice in her lifetime. The first time was on the eve of the Kuruks&#x301;etra war when Dhritarastra instructed his one hundred insolent sons to go to her and ask for her blessing. &ldquo;Go, my sons, to your mother. She is a lady of uncommon virtue,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go to her and ask for her blessing.&rdquo; They did according to their father&#146;s bidding.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now, one cannot bless others with closed eyes. Dhritarastra thought that Gandhari would surely take off her blindfold while blessing her sons, and that she being a satii na&#x301;rii, blessing with her eyes open, the blessing would certainly be effective. Dhritarastra reminded his son Duryodhana that his arch-enemy was Bhima. He advised him, &ldquo;My son, your mother being a satii na&#x301;rii, if she casts a benevolent glance on your body, it will become as hard as a thunderbolt.&rdquo; At that time Duryodhana was already a fully grown man, so he went to his mother wearing a loincloth, not completely undressed. The story goes that when Gandhari blessed him, his body grew as hard as a thunderbolt, except that portion covered by the cloth, which remained as soft as before. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a alone knew this fact. At the end of the war, when Bhima was trying in vain to strike Duryodhana down, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a signalled to Bhima to indicate the soft point on Duryodhana&#146;s body where Bhima could deal a mortal blow with his mace. Bhima struck Duryodhana on that soft point and he died.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So Gandhari first removed her blindfold when blessing her sons. (As she was firmly committed to dharma, she did not say, &ldquo;May you be victorious,&rdquo; but proclaimed, Yato dharma tato Krs&#x301;n&#x301;ah, yato Krs&#x301;n&#x301;ah tato jayah &ndash; &ldquo;Where there is dharma, there is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a; where there is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, there is victory&rdquo;. It was against her principles to pray for the victory of the impious. However, it is not our intention to analyse the character of Gandhari here, for I have already done that in Discourses on the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->And she removed the blindfold for the second time when the battlefield of Kuruks&#x301;etra had become a burial ground. After Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had spoken some words of consolation to Gandhari, she said, &ldquo;O Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, I know and admit that You are Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, that You are Parama Purus&#x301;a. If You had only wished something to happen, it would have certainly taken place accordingly. What then was the necessity of enacting such a bloody drama? It was totally unnecessary. You played the role of an ordinary man. You wrote the drama to serve as a lesson and inspire the common people. Yet you played the role of an ordinary man. Being Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, whatever You mentally imagine will take place accordingly. But no, You unnecessarily killed my sons and made my one hundred daughters-in-law widows. Had You only wished the victory of dharma, dharma would have been victorious.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy this same question comes up. Since He was the vast Purus&#x301;ottama, whatever He wished would have come to pass. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a replied, &ldquo;It is true that Parama Purus&#x301;a could do everything by mere wish. He could do everything without creating this world, without this Cosmos. But the drama of the Kuruks&#x301;etra war was enacted to teach the common people that ultimately dharma always triumphs over adharma [injustice, unrighteousness]. It was meant for popular education. If Parama Purus&#x301;a were to accomplish everything by mere thought-projection, that would be hidden from people&#146;s sight, and people would not learn anything from it. But when people see these events with their own eyes, they learn what should be done and what should not be done. Hence, the battle of Kuruks&#x301;etra had to be conceived and dramatized. You, being an intelligent lady, certainly understand this.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The bereaved Gandhari understood, but she threw back one more question. &ldquo;I understand that You conceived of such a drama to educate the masses. But was it necessary to give my sons the roles of the adha&#x301;rmikas? You could have given the Pandavas the roles of the adha&#x301;rmikas, and my sons the roles of the dha&#x301;rmikas.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The argument was irrefutable. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had no choice but to keep silent. Then Gandhari said, &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, I shall pronounce a curse on You. Accord me Your permission.&rdquo; Before cursing Parama Purus&#x301;a, one should first take His permission. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said, &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo; Gandhari then uttered the curse, &ldquo;Just as the Kuru princes perished before my very eyes, let the Yadava princes die in Your presence.&rdquo; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said, Tatha&#x301;stu [&ldquo;Let it be so&rdquo;]. This very utterance, Tatha&#x301;stu, proves that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was not an ordinary purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

Abhimanyu also had to sacrifice his life, because the drama was not designed to be one-sided. If an evil man falls on the battleground, the virtuous will also have to face some blows. It would not be natural for the virtuous to return from the battleground completely unscathed. Such an intricate plot and vast drama can only originate from a gigantic Purus&#x301;a &ndash; it is beyond the capacity of an ordinary purus&#x301;a. Thus Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a remains beyond the reach of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>

Labouring hard, extending His personal influence, He made immense progress in advancing their welfare. He left us some 3500 years back, but He is still dearly loved and will continue to be loved by oppressed, suffering and struggling men and women.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In my previous discourse I analysed Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, but much still remains to be said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is said, Otah protah yoga&#x301;bhya&#x301;m&#x301; sam&#x301;yuktah Purus&#x301;ottamah &ndash; &ldquo;Purus&#x301;ottama, or Parama Purus&#x301;a, is associated with microcosms and the world through His ota yoga [individual association] and prota yoga [pervasive association].&rdquo; It is enormously difficult to be Purus&#x301;ottama: He must always remain associated with everything and everyone. None of His created beings should be neglected or slighted. He must associate Himself with everyone&#146;s mind, listening to their thoughts and alleviating their sufferings, whether they are literate or illiterate, rich or poor, shouldering the responsibility for the entire creation. Only then does He deserve to be called Purus&#x301;ottama. He who remains motionless like a distant star, indifferent to the sorrows and sufferings of created beings, but accepting their worship, is not Purus&#x301;ottama. To be Purus&#x301;ottama one has to remain associated with the created beings both individually and collectively through ota and prota yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The personal relationship with each and every individual, with every particle of dust, every drop of water, is termed ota yoga. That is, Purus&#x301;ottama is aware of your individual thoughts and feelings, your joys and sorrows, and takes suitable steps to remove your distress and afflictions. Here I deliberately used the word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo;, for He has to remove one&#146;s afflictions without jeopardizing the collective interest. For example, if the sunset were delayed for one hour for the good of one individual, it would go against the collective interest. This He cannot do. So without jeopardizing the collective interest, He is bound to pay attention to the needs and feelings of every individual. This is His ota yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And prota yoga is Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s association with the entire creation &ndash; humans and other living creatures, the world and the universe &ndash; collectively. Here He is obliged to listen not to the individual problems of individual beings, but to the collective problems of the collectivity of all beings. It is not an easy task to be Purus&#x301;ottama. He has to be associated with one and all in ota and prota yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Every jiiva, as part of its birthright under prota yoga, enjoys His grace. So no one is small, no one is insignificant. If anyone laments, &ldquo;I am such a useless person, such a helpless sinner, that Parama Purus&#x301;a can&#146;t possibly wish to listen to me,&rdquo; I will point out that when He listens to the collective prayer, then He naturally listens to the individual prayer too. And when He listens to every individual in ota yoga, then is a sinner outside the creation? All so-called sinners are within His mental domain and so He is inseparably associated with them too. One should remember,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->According to Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, there are innumerable unit purus&#x301;as. But actually Parama Purus&#x301;a is One. Parthasa&#x301;rathi is not at all like the purus&#x301;a of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. Let us see what relationship exists between the purus&#x301;a of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya on the one hand, and the jiiva, the jagat and Iishvara on the other; and let us also see what relationship exists between Parthasa&#x301;rathi on the one hand, and the jiiva, the jagat and Iishvara on the other.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a united Arjuna with the many other righteous Indian kings of the day. The land that was then known as Jambudviipa extended from Afghanistan in the west to Burma in the east and from the Pamir [Range] in the north to the Indian Ocean in the south. The major part of this vast land was known as Bha&#x301;ratakhan&#x301;d&#x301;a or Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a. Most of the world&#146;s population at that time lived in Jambudviipa or Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a. (The remaining parts of the world were mainly covered by jungles and forests. Gradually people cleared those forests and built new settlements.) So in those days, the only way to do good to human society was to start a war between the moralists and the immoralists in India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a concentrated on this task. He worked for the propagation of dharma. Here &ldquo;dharma&rdquo; denotes the path of human welfare (it is called ima&#x301;n in both Arabic and Persian, and not majhab [religion]). He started preaching His liberal ma&#x301;nava dharma [human dharma]. As previously mentioned, He was a king, and had direct contact mainly with other kings; He did not have the same degree of contact with the masses (nor would that have been natural). But His desire for human welfare was universal; it embrace all of society, from the highest stratum down to a blade of grass. And for the sake of human welfare, He selected among the contemporary kings and monarchs. The kings of India of that time became perfectly polarized: on the one side the kings who gave Him their full support, and on the other side  those who vehemently opposed Him. The historic battle of Kuruks&#x301;etra was fought between these two warring groups. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi wished to establish dharmara&#x301;jya [the rule of moralism].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The question may arise why Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was so intent on establishing a moralistic social order. Wicked people will say that they do not understand such things as dharmara&#x301;jya, but virtuous people will say, &ldquo;The rule of moralism? Oh yes, it&#146;s the only answer for society&#146;s problems.&rdquo; A poet once voiced the feelings of Duryodhana:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..14"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->[This is all the trick of that cunning Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, evil advice from that ruthless conspirator. The slogan of dharmara&#x301;jya is a hollow sham. The fact is that this gang of conspirators, together with Draupadi (also known as Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;), call themselves friends of, but are really the slaves of, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, that black sheep of the Yadu dynasty, who misguides them with a deceitful smile.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Duryodhana raged against Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Why? Because Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a wanted to establish dharmara&#x301;jya, the rule of moralism. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s mission was best understood by the Pandavas. That is why the Pandava brothers and Draupadi used to give the utmost attention to Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s advice. Seeing this, Duryodhana said that the gang of conspirators together with Draupadi followed Him like da&#x301;syas [slaves, servants]. But in fact, the Pandavas looked upon Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a as their sakha&#x301;, their most intimate friend. Sakhya bha&#x301;va is one of the different bha&#x301;vas or relationships between the devotee and the Lord. In the case of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a people mainly experienced da&#x301;sya bha&#x301;va, sakhya bha&#x301;va or va&#x301;tsalya bha&#x301;va, but with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a they mainly experienced sakhya bha&#x301;va. He was friendly to all, to the exclusion of none, and made it His mission in life to provide food, shelter, clothing, medicine and education to everyone &ndash; to bring those deprived of education to the light of learning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Atya&#x301;gasahano bandhuh [&ldquo;One who cannot tolerate separation from his or her friends is called a bandhu&rdquo;]. That person is said to be a bandhu [friend] whose bond of love is so deep that he or she constantly endeavours to come even closer, and constantly radiates love from the depths of the heart to receive one with a smiling face. Purus&#x301;ottama is called Jagadbandhu [Friend of the World]. This attitude of friendliness which draws the creation close to Him is called sakhya bha&#x301;va. And not only is Parama Purus&#x301;a the sole friend of humanity, human beings are the only friends of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is the spirit of sakhya bha&#x301;va. Only Purus&#x301;ottama, and no other, can be your lifelong friend in prosperity and adversity alike.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->When this sakhya bha&#x301;va matures, when this love for Parama Purus&#x301;a deepens, it is transformed either into da&#x301;sya bha&#x301;va or into madhura bha&#x301;va. &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is my best friend. He loves me.&rdquo; When a person thinks like this, he or she draws close to Parama Purus&#x301;a. From a distance one cannot feel His greatness, but when one comes within His proximity one realizes that He is unfathomable, immeasurable, and thinks: &ldquo;Oh, although He is my sakha&#x301; [my friend], how great He is! How vast! I consider myself fortunate to have come so close to Him.&rdquo; When one thinks in this way, one&#146;s sakhya bha&#x301;va is transformed into da&#x301;sya bha&#x301;va. One then feels that since Parama Purus&#x301;a is so great and loves one so much, it is one&#146;s duty to serve Him and fulfil His desire in every possible way. One feels, &ldquo;Since He is earnestly seeking human welfare it is my duty to do His work.&rdquo; This is the spirit of da&#x301;sya bha&#x301;va. &ldquo;He is my Master, my Lord &ndash; I am His servant.&rdquo; And the spirit of madhura bha&#x301;va is as follows: &ldquo;He is so vast, endowed with innumerable attributes, yet even then He loves me. He is so great, yet He is still my most intimate friend, so very close to me. What joy! What joy!&rdquo; This is madhura bha&#x301;va. This friendship between the Pandavas and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was born out of sakhya bha&#x301;va, out of mutual friendship, but to Duryodhana it appeared to be nothing more than a slave-master relationship. To him, the Pandavas were mean-minded and ruthless conspirators.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Why did Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a wish to establish dharmara&#x301;jya? He was Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, endowed with a deep love for humanity. In order to do good to humanity by eradicating exploitation one will have to work cooperatively in every stratum of life. If, for example, people work cooperatively<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in the spheres of production, distribution and similar activities, then they can easily save themselves from the fiendish exploiters. But &ldquo;If there is a demon in the mustard seed it will not drive away demons.&rdquo; And similarly, if there are wicked people among the leaders of a cooperative society, then the lion&#146;s share of the profit will be misappropriated by them. That is why the rule of morality should be established in every sphere of human life. One may argue that it is sufficient to act morally, but this is not supportable because morality is based on dharma, or ima&#x301;n. Without a strong dharmic base, morality cannot stand. A strong current of selfishness or a flowing river of sin can easily wash away the sandy walls of morality. The only solution is to build the concrete embankment of dharma. Permanent human welfare cannot be brought about unless dharmara&#x301;jya is established.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Unless people work in close cooperation, nothing great can be achieved. In order to promote human welfare and to fulfil the material needs of human beings, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi had to raise the slogan of dharmara&#x301;jya. He knew that without dharmara&#x301;jya nothing can be achieved. We also know it, and yet we are still discovering it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The purus&#x301;a of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya has no relationship with jiiva and jagat [microcosm and creation]. It is merely an entity created by Prakrti which only possesses the capacity of witness-ship within a microcosmic structure. It has nothing specific to do. Yesterday I said, Ya&#x301; devii sarvabhu&#x301;tes&#x301;u Shaktiru&#x301;pen&#x301;a sam&#x301;sthita&#x301; [&ldquo;The goddess who is immanent in all created beings in the form of Shakti, the Operative Principle&rdquo;]. Here the manifestation of Shakti means the manifestation of Citishakti [the Cognitive Faculty], and not the manifestation of jad&#x301;ashakti [material energy]. This manifestation of the Cognitive Faculty emanates from Supreme Consciousness. But the purus&#x301;a of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya has no such manifestation. He is simply a witness playing no active role (rather like the Indian god Jagannatha who has neither arms nor legs), who simply looks on passively doing nothing in particular. What use do we have for such inactive gods? We want those gods who will do something for us, who will inspire us to noble deeds, who will protect honest people from sinners, and strengthen the hands of the moralists. This is exactly what Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi wanted to do. He undertook this noble task with the help of the kings of the day and finally attained success. What we understand by the purus&#x301;a of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya is quite different from Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was much higher than that: He was exactly what we call Purus&#x301;ottama in our philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..21"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The Purus&#x301;a of Sam&#x301;khya<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Now we shall analyse the relationship between the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya, the unit purus&#x301;a, and the role that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi played.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya is only a causal agent, having no specific role. His role is so passive that if a dishonest person tortures an honest person, He won&#146;t even lift a finger or utter a single word in protest. He doesn&#146;t have the capacity to do anything. Purus&#x301;ottama is not like that; Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was not like that either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->With the help of the Pandavas and other powerful and virtuous people, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi destroyed wicked people wherever they were dominating Indian society. (Such as Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, whom he defeated in a long, drawn-out battle). These events unmistakably prove that the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya is nothing like Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Things and events occur due to natural law. But a passive entity like Janya Iishvara cannot do anything about it, cannot even inspire the jiivas. According to Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya, &ldquo;inspire&rdquo; is also a verb and thus the Janya Iishvara is also incapable of inspiring. If an Entity does not provide inspiration for anyone, can its existence be justified? Let such a god reside in heaven; He is of no value to human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is altogether different. He existed for all. He took birth in order to supply the material needs of all, to punish the wrongdoers and to protect the virtuous. He is not like the unit purus&#x301;as or the Janya Iishvara of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya. He is Purus&#x301;ottama Himself. He is not like the star in the distant sky, or the nebula of the endless void, or the pearl lying in the oyster in the depths of the unfathomable sea; He is a brilliant jewel carefully protected in the deepest layers of the human mind. He is a rare treasure in individual life and the highest object of worship in collective life. He does not come within the purview of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. In vainly trying to count the number of fundamental principles in the creation, Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya has made its biggest mistake in forgetting to count Parama Purus&#x301;a. Perhaps he [Maharshi Kapila] did not have sufficient intellect to realize that Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Supreme Primordial Principle.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.11.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#11.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The usual name of the Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da school of philosophy is Uttara Miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301; Darshana. It was originally propounded by Va&#x301;dara&#x301;yan&#x301;a Vya&#x301;sa, yet it was developed by Shankaracharya, and more than ninety percent of it was influenced by Shankaracharya&#146;s Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da [the Doctrine of Illusion]. Needless to say, Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da and Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da emerged long after the advent of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There is no scope to discuss Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da or Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da in great detail here, nor is it necessary to do so. Its chief contention is Brahma satyam&#x301; jaganmithya&#x301; jiivah Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah &ndash; &ldquo;Brahma alone is real; the jagat [the creation] is false or illusory; all jiivas are nothing except Brahma.&rdquo; Later I will explain what is really meant by the term Brahma, and what is meant by &ldquo;Brahma alone is real.&rdquo; I will also explain how they interpret the concepts of jagat and mithya&#x301;. But just now I will discuss jiivah Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah &ndash; &ldquo;all jiivas are nothing except Brahma.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Jiivas are finite entities, handicapped by microcosmic limitations, suffering from numerous imperfections and weaknesses. People err all the time on account of their ingrained psycho-spiritual weaknesses. They often commit errors unknowingly and then realize that they have acted improperly and feel repentant. Sometimes they do not repent at all and sometimes they do not even realize their mistakes, what to speak of repent. These are the inherent imperfections, the ingrained weaknesses, of the microcosm. No right-minded person can deny this. Had all the microcosms been Brahma, such digressions would never have been made. Thus the contention that all jiivas are Brahma is a glaring defect of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da in the practical sphere. If, even after seeing this serious flaw in their philosophy, they still contend that the philosophy is true, does it not amount to hypocrisy?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->If after realizing the ingrained defects of the microcosm someone argues that they are not actually defects in practice, but only appear to be so due to the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, then the question arises, what is this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;? Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is explained as aghat&#x301;ana ghat&#x301;ana pat&#x301;iiyasii Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; [&ldquo;the dexterous hand of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; that can even create things impossible to create&rdquo;]. Advaetava&#x301;da [non-dualism] contends that in reality nothing happens, but Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; works in such a dexterous way that it seems as if something is happening. She who is very dexterous in this business of making what is not happening seem that it is happening, is known as Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Suppose, for example, that Calcutta is non-existent, but due to the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; appears to exist. If Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; can make something appear, then where did this something come from? The city of Calcutta must have come from either something or nothing. If it appeared out of nothing, then that nothing must have a negative existence; and if it appeared out of something then that something must have a positive existence. Whether it is positive or negative in character, it is, after all, existence. If everything except Brahma is false then this existence is also false. So it logically follows that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has built the city of Calcutta out of false materials. The whole thing seems impractical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now, if one contends that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has built something out of false materials then one must admit the existence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. By admitting the existence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; in this way one recognizes the existence of two entities: Brahma and the miracle-creating Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Brahma exists along with the dexterous Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; which makes nothing appear as something &ndash; non-existent Calcutta as existent Calcutta. So how many entities are there? Two. Then is this advaetava&#x301;da [non-dualism, monism] or is it dvaetava&#x301;da [dualism]? Monism surrenders to dualism and thereby digs its own grave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->To avoid the stigma of self-contradiction, the proponents of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da go one step further and declare that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is mithya&#x301; svabha&#x301;va&#x301;; that is, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; also is unreal. It is the folly of madmen to claim on the one hand that whatever we perceive is the creation of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and on the other hand that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; Herself is unreal. Hence Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is full of contradictions from beginning to end. This sort of error is called prama&#x301;da in Sanskrit: error in the beginning, error in the middle and error in the end. The entire advaetava&#x301;da is prama&#x301;dagrasta [full of errors].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Jiiva Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah. It is as if Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; was trying to convince the jiivas, &ldquo;You are jiivas with bodies of flesh and blood, but living in a non-existent Calcutta, and those physical bodies are also unreal. You think you are jiivas, but actually you are Brahma.&rdquo; They claim that you are unreal because you have been created by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, but in the next breath they claim that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; Herself is unreal. Thus the entire philosophy is self-contradictory in nature. When one tells a lie, one is forced to concoct hundreds of additional lies to protect oneself from the stigma of falsehood. In exactly the same way, the proponents of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da have had to concoct one lie after another to protect their untenable position.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Once a certain maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a who happened to be an orthodox Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;din was walking along the road in Kashi [adjacent to Varanasi]. The popular saying goes that Kashi is famous for four things, for s&#x301;a&#x301;nr&#x301;, ra&#x301;nr&#x301;, sinr&#x301;i, sannya&#x301;sii &ndash; the bulls which throng the streets; the many widows; the stairs which one has to climb up or down every few metres; and the thousands of itinerant monks &ndash; and that in Kashi one should carefully avoid these four things. Anyway, one morning a wild bull suddenly started to charge that maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a, so he ran away as fast as his legs could carry him. A logician who happened to be standing nearby asked the maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a, &ldquo;Well sir, if you say that this world is unreal, then the bull is also unreal, so why are you running in fear?&rdquo; That maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a would not accept any defeat in logic and replied, &ldquo;My running away is also unreal.&rdquo; This is the way things went on for many centuries.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Though not so relevant, it would be good to mention one thing here. In those days, Baoddha [Buddhistic] Shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da was the dominant school of thought. It was a kind of nihilism. This philosophical doctrine had left the people cynical and brought them to the brink of disaster. In order to eliminate Shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da by any means, the word Brahma was used in place of the word Shu&#x301;nya. This was not the Brahma as understood by genuine spiritualists, rather, it was merely an equivalent of the term Shu&#x301;nya. It was nothing more than that, and this has been stated in clear terms. Shankaracharya said, Yatha&#x301; shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;dina&#x301;m&#x301; Shu&#x301;nyam&#x301; Brahma Brahmavida&#x301;m&#x301;statha&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;The Brahmava&#x301;dins use the term Brahma in the same way as the nihilistic Shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;dins use the term Shu&#x301;nya.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->To use the term Brahma in this way is acceptable neither to a philosopher nor to a devotee. If advaetava&#x301;da contends that this manifested universe has emanated from the One and will return to the One, that this plurality has evolved from the Supreme Singularity &ndash; Ekam&#x301; Sad vipra&#x301;h bahudha&#x301; yad vadanti [&ldquo;The Supreme Entity is one, but intellectuals explain It in various ways&rdquo;] &ndash; and if they present thousands of similar arguments, then their contention will not stand in jeopardy. But if, while trying to justify the existence of this kind of Brahma (the Shu&#x301;nya of nihilism) they deny the existence of any other entity or idea operating in the psychic, physical or psycho-spiritual spheres, then it is unmitigated foolishness. Regarding this, Jayanta Bhatta, the famous scholar and courtier of the Kashmiri king, Shankar Varma, said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Yadi ta&#x301;vat advaetasiddheh prama&#x301;n&#x301;am asti, tarhi tadeva dvitiiyamiti na&#x301;dvaetam atha na&#x301;sti prama&#x301;n&#x301;am. Netara&#x301;n&#x301; advaetam apra&#x301;ma&#x301;n&#x301;ika&#x301;ya&#x301; siddherabha&#x301;va&#x301;diti mantra&#x301;rtha<br>va&#x301;dottha vikalpamu&#x301;lam advaetava&#x301;dam&#x301; parihrtya tasma&#x301;d upeyata&#x301;mes&#x301;a pada&#x301;rthabhedah pratyaks&#x301;a liun&#x32D;ga&#x301;gama&#x301;gamyama&#x301;nah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The first part of his observation is quite correct. The fallibility of advaetava&#x301;da has been clearly shown. Only the portion upeyata&#x301;mes&#x301;a pada&#x301;rthabhedah is debatable. The fallibility of advaetava&#x301;da and its uselessness in the field of dharma are bound to be accepted by all. Advaetava&#x301;da can be compared to unalloyed gold which itself is of no practical use. The scholar argues, &ldquo;If you contend that there are prama&#x301;n&#x301;as [proofs] in support of advaetava&#x301;da, then you are obviously supporting dvaetava&#x301;da [dualism]. Advaetava&#x301;da on the one hand, and its supporting logic on the other hand, are two entities, and so it is dualism. If you say &lsquo;No, my advaetava&#x301;da is not based on any valid logic, it is only advaetava&#x301;da,&rsquo; then I will not accept advaetava&#x301;da! Without proof I will not accept it.&rdquo; That is why Jayanta Bhatta declares that advaetava&#x301;da is based upon jugglery of words and philosophical rigmarole and as such does not deserve to be accepted. He asserts in his defense, upeyata&#x301;mes&#x301;a pada&#x301;rthabhedah; that is, people should acquire knowledge according to its three valid sources (direct perception, inference and authority) as propounded by Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya or Nya&#x301;ya philosophy. However, one should not base one&#146;s deductions on Nya&#x301;ya philosophy, which contends that the jiivas and Parama Purus&#x301;a continue to remain separate entities, that the Supreme Entity does not attract the jiivas towards Himself nor do the jiivas attract the Supreme entity towards themselves. This is opposed to the fundamental principles of science. According to science, every entity attracts every other entity, sometimes knowingly, sometimes unknowingly. That Entity whose irresistible attraction frees the jiivas from bondage is Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Let us now turn to Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a (as I mentioned earlier that we would). Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is not the Brahma of advaetava&#x301;da. Neither is He any worldly entity; He is an entity beyond the world. And jiivah Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah. In fact, Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is none other than Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. This is something which can be readily demonstrated. I told you a little while ago that every entity attracts every other entity. Due to this force of mutual attraction, the stars, planets, meteors, and nebulae continue to move in their respective paths. In the event of the slightest weakening of this force the whole cosmological order would lose its balance and fall like a meteor. Just as planets continue to move around the sun in their respective orbits due to the force of attraction, in exactly the same way, all created beings move round Parama Purus&#x301;a, my beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, knowingly or unknowingly. Some love Him consciously, others unconsciously. Some love Him while thinking &ldquo;I don&#146;t love;&rdquo; some sincerely believe in Him and love Him passionately, yet nonetheless continue to argue about Him because they want to find more and more justification for their love of Him. Even those who say &ldquo;I don&#146;t love Him&rdquo; have love for Him, but their love is a negative love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->There are devotees who long to hear the name Ra&#x301;dheshya&#x301;ma [a name of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a] over and over again. So if anyone says &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dheshya&#x301;ma,&rdquo; they pretend to be extremely angry. Seeing how irritated they have become, the utterer of &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dheshya&#x301;ma&rdquo; takes delight in repeating it again and again. The devotees are also delighted for they get a chance to hear the Lord&#146;s name spoken so many times. This is why they so cleverly feign anger.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There is a story in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Sita was surrounded by a number of ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asiis<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.11.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#11.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> who were guarding her in the Ashoka forest. Ravana, being obsessed with the annihilation of Rama, his arch-enemy, repeated Rama&#146;s name over and over again, saying that he should be defeated in battle. To repeat Rama&#146;s name was actually his inner desire. But he had instructed Sita&#146;s ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii attendants to tell her not to take the name of Rama. However, by telling Sita, &ldquo;Sita, Rama&#146;s name is not to be uttered,&rdquo; they were also unwittingly repeating the name of the Lord: Sita-Rama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->All human beings love Parama Purus&#x301;a, some consciously, some unconsciously. A healthy person who delivers fiery lectures on atheism during a symposium quickly apologizes to the Lord when he starts getting heart palpitations. &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, You know how deeply I love You,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;I only said those things to help the theists to find more points in favour of God.&rdquo; Then and there the palpitation stops and he says, &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, this shows that You love me whether I speak for theism or not. In the future, I&#146;ll criticize You more, just to save my prestige among my friends, but I&#146;ll beg Your forgiveness before doing so.&rdquo; Similarly, there are many leaders today who accept money from the capitalists to get their work done, but tell the people, &ldquo;We hate the capitalists, we hate the capitalists.&rdquo; But behind the scenes they tell the capitalists, &ldquo;We are just telling the people these things. It will be to our mutual benefit.&rdquo; The atheist psychology functions like this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->All created beings in the universe move around Parama Purus&#x301;a for their very survival, otherwise their existence would be jeopardized. The centripetal and centrifugal forces can never coexist. So the contention of Vedanta philosophy (Vedanta is another name for Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da), jiivah Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah [&ldquo;all jiivas are nothing except Brahma&rdquo;] is downright falsehood. In reality, the jiivas are moving around Him. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the shelter of the jiivas, and the jiivas are sheltered in Him. When devotion is aroused in the jiivas, that is, when the centripetal force becomes predominant, the jiivas rush towards the Nucleus, decreasing their radius with every surge in devotion. The closer one comes to Parama Purus&#x301;a, the more the devotees feel that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is not a man, but a bha&#x301;va [devotional sentiment born out of psycho-spiritual parallelism] personified. The more one advances on the spiritual path, the more one realizes that Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is not only a bha&#x301;va, but is the life of one&#146;s life. As one advances even further one realizes, &ldquo;He is not only the life of my life; I have no existence apart from Him. My existence depends upon His existence alone. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a exists and due to this, I exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So we find that Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da is a defective, illogical and impractical philosophy. When human beings realize that their hearts can be illuminated by the spiritual effulgence of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a they turn away from the arid desert of philosophical rigmarole. Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da is like last week&#146;s newspaper &ndash; it carries no importance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, resplendent in His own glory, has been illuminating the minds of all jiivas of the universe, and thereafter attracting them to Himself. This is a never-ending process. It started in beginninglessness and will merge into endlessness. Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da shines for a few days in the world of logic, but is subsequently extinguished in the folds of darkness. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, however, will continue to exist as the source and nucleus of the endless creation, and at the same time will continue to draw all unto Him by the force of His irresistible charm and universal love. Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da came into existence as a school of philosophy only recently, just 1500 years ago. But Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a existed even before philosophy emerged, long before human beings were born on the soil of the earth, and will remain in future. He will still remain when not even a single microcosm remains alive on this planet. He is eternal and infinite. He is established in His own matchless glory; He is the embodiment of effulgence; He is vast. Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da concedes defeat to Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a even more ignobly than does Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. It cannot approach the greatness of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Moreover, it has not the least capacity to taste the sweetness of His great personality.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In my previous discourse, I analysed Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da, but the discussion was incomplete. I mentioned that there are various branches and sub-branches within the school of Uttara Miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301; Darshana. It is even true that the whole of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da is not the same as Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, though most of it is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->First I proved that the statement jiivah Brahmaeva na&#x301;parah is not worthy of being accepted, and that Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is an entity who is diametrically opposed to this idea. Judged in the light of such an idea, Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a will remain beyond human understanding. People&#146;s theoretical or philosophical knowledge will not be deep enough for them to comprehend Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in this way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now, the second part of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da&#146;s contention is jaganmithya&#x301;. Brahma satyam&#x301; [is the first part,] jaganmithya&#x301; [is the second part]. What does mithya&#x301; really mean? It means &ldquo;non-existent&rdquo; or &ldquo;unreal&rdquo;. The contention here is that this perceivable world which we can see, touch, hear, smell and taste does not exist; and that since the sensible world does not exist, the sense indriyas [organs] such as the eyes, ears and nose do not exist either; and that in the absence of the indriyas, the jiivas&#146; bodies do not exist either.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So there is no relationship between the body and the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a. In that case there is neither life nor body. And in that case this expressed world of vision, hearing, understanding, etc., also vanishes in a moment. But the question is, if we say that all these do not exist, then why do we see them, why do we hear or feel them? It is a very pertinent question. Then again if some argue, as does Ks&#x301;an&#x301;ika Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nava&#x301;da<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (Ks&#x301;an&#x301;ika Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nava&#x301;da is part of heterodox philosophy and is included in Buddhist Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;n&#x301;a doctrine) that all these are not totally mithya&#x301; but partly mithya&#x301;[, even then it will not be tenable.] One somewhat following Ks&#x301;an&#x301;ika Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na would say that we perceive the world as a particular form at one moment but not at the next, depending on the systaltic movement of the light waves. If the crests of the waves are considered as real, then the troughs are considered as unreal. Now if we wish to see the crests only (the real world) and ignore the troughs (the unreal world), then we shall see only the collection of crests, and there will be a continuity of seeing [crests]. Again, if we want to see the troughs only, then we shall see the collection of troughs &ndash; that is, nothing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->If this doctrine is accepted, then one will have to perceive either the collection of crests (the collection of &ldquo;somethings&rdquo;) or the collection of troughs (the collection of &ldquo;nothings&rdquo;). Therefore some people will argue that the world exists and others will say that the world does not exist, depending upon their psychology or psychological condition. Judged in this light, a &ldquo;something&rdquo; is within the scope of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;&#146;s mithya&#x301; svabha&#x301;va [illusoriness] according to Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da. Though we see that something, it is because the indriyas deceive us. The light-waves are defective in some way, and this is due to the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. If we take a &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; attitude, that is, if we say that mithya&#x301; means na&#x301;sti &ndash; or if we say (as does Ks&#x301;an&#x301;ika Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nava&#x301;da) that it means na&#x301;sti [non-existent] one moment and asti [existent] the next moment &ndash; then the world does not exist from an absolute point of view. So it is said, jaganmithya&#x301; [&ldquo;the world is false&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Those who advocate the proposition jaganmithya&#x301; commit a serious philosophical and physiological blunder. They say aghat&#x301;ana ghat&#x301;ana pat&#x301;iiyasi Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;It is the work of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; to make what is non-existent appear to exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->For instance, the &ldquo;rope-as-a-snake illusion&rdquo;: While taking a walk along a path at dusk you may wrongly take a rope to be a snake. &ldquo;A snake, a snake!&rdquo; you shout, startled and afraid. The Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dins say that the world is just like that. There is actually a rope, but you see a snake; there is actually nothing, but you see the world. Actually there is no world, just as actually there is no snake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Or the &ldquo;oyster-as-silver illusion&rdquo;: An oyster being shiny-white, one who sees it may take it to be a piece of silver. Actually there is no silver, but one thinks there is silver; actually there is no world, but one thinks there is a world; actually there are no jiivas, but one thinks there are jiivas. And actually the &ldquo;I&rdquo; that everybody feels that one has, one does not have; one only thinks one has it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->You all have an &ldquo;I&rdquo;; but according to this doctrine you do not actually have it, you only think you have it. In other words, other than self-deception, nothing exists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da makes another philosophical and psychological mistake in this regard. And that is, what kind of people can fall victim to the &ldquo;rope-as-a-snake illusion&rdquo;? Only those who have seen a snake can make such a mistake! The snake illusion cannot trap those who have never seen a snake. Only one who is already acquainted with a snake can have the defective perception of a snake. Similarly, an oyster can only be mistaken for a piece of silver if one has seen a piece of silver; one who has not seen silver will not make the mistake. At most one can think it to be a glittering substance, but one will not conclude that it is not an oyster or that it is a piece of silver. In this example, both the perception and the analogy designed to expose the perception are defective!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->They make another serious mistake when they say:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..14"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Mrgatrs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;mbhasi sna&#x301;tah khapus&#x301;pakrtashekharah;<br>Es&#x301;ah bandhya&#x301;suto ya&#x301;ti shashashrungadhanurdharah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..15"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->[Having bathed in the water of a mirage and adorned his head with flowers grown in the sky, the son of a barren woman holds a bow made from the horns of a hare.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->What is the nature of this world? It does not exist in reality but only apparently exists &ndash; Mrgatrs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;mbhasi sna&#x301;tah &ndash; like a mirage. A mirage, of course, does not exist anywhere. Due to reflection, it appears that there is water at some distance. When you go near it, it appears to recede from you. Running thus after the water of the mirage, people die of thirst. Mrgatrs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;mbhasi sna&#x301;tah means &ldquo;having bathed in the water of a mirage&rdquo;. Khapus&#x301;pakrtashekharah means &ldquo;adorning the head with flowers grown in the sky&rdquo;. Es&#x301;ah bandhya&#x301;suto ya&#x301;ti means &ldquo;the son of a barren woman&rdquo;. How can a barren woman have a son? A woman is called barren becauseshe has no child. Shashashrungadhanurdharah means &ldquo;holding a bow made from the horns of a hare&rdquo;, but a hare does not grow horns. The contention is that to accept the world as real is just like accepting these things as real.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The person who composed this shloka must have had a very good sense of humour. The shloka is nicely composed, no doubt, but unfortunately makes a fundamental mistake. It says Mrgatrs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;mbhasi sna&#x301;tah &ndash; &ldquo;having bathed in the water of a mirage.&rdquo; One should remember that there is such a thing as a mirage (there is no water in the mirage, but there really is a mirage), and there is also such a thing as water (perhaps not in the mirage, but in other places). Only this much can be said, that there is no water in the mirage. Similarly, khapus&#x301;pakrta shekharah: kha means &ldquo;sky&rdquo; and pus&#x301;pa means &ldquo;flower&rdquo;. There is a sky and there are flowers, so at most we can say that there are no flowers in the sky. Again, es&#x301;ah bandhya&#x301;suto ya&#x301;ti: well, barren women do exist, and so do sons, though the sons of barren women do not exist. At most we can say that there cannot be any son of a barren woman. Shashashrungadhanurdharah: Shasha means &ldquo;hare&rdquo;. (And shashaka means &ldquo;rabbit&rdquo;; khargosh is a general term for the two.) There is an animal called a hare and there is also such a thing as a horn, though horns do not grow on hares.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So while elucidating their philosophical points, the proponents of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da are making big mistakes. They want to say one thing, but in making their point they say something completely different. The most interesting thing is that all the items used in their analogies to prove the illusory nature of this world &ndash; mirages, water, barren women, etc. &ndash; are themselves objects of the world. Then they declare that the world is unreal. If the world is mithya&#x301; [unreal], then all the objects of their examples are also unreal, so the examples are unreal, and therefore fail to substantiate the viewpoint.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dins, instead of declaring the world as outright mithya&#x301;, could better have said that no worldly form remains unchanged for a long period of time. The world always undergoes metamorphosis; this is how it maintains its existence &ndash; through evolution, through transformation. That is why I say the world is never static, is always moving. The Sanskrit word jagat means that which is always moving, always changing. Gam (the root verb) plus kvip (the suffix) [i.e., jagat] means &ldquo;that whose nature is to move&rdquo;; sam &ndash; sr (the root) + ghain&#x32D; = sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra, or &ldquo;that which is always changing its position&rdquo;. Jagat and sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra are synonymous. So those who deny the mobility of the world and declare it as false are only practising self-deception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Now let us analyse Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. To Him everything is sweet; every atom or molecule of this mundane world is sweet. He attracts all the atoms and molecules, all the ions, of this world, towards Himself by playing His flute, by radiating His charming smile. Had any one of these atoms and molecules, any one of these expressions &ndash; from a lowly blade of grass to Brahma&#x301;, the Creator of the world &ndash; been false, then His flute-playing would also have been false, because whom then would He have been calling? And regarding Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;&#146;s creation, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da says that this world, this &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;, which we take to be &ldquo;something&rdquo;, is produced by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. If in reply to this, someone contends that since Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is creating, certainly She must be creating something (and creating that something out of something), they will again reply, &ldquo;No, She is creating nothing out of nothing. The nothing only appears to be something.&rdquo; If in reply to this one argues that the Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; that is creating certainly must exist, otherwise how can She create, they in their turn will reply that there is only one singular Brahma; just as there is no prama&#x301;n&#x301;am<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> [supporting proof] as a second entity, so there is no Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; as a second entity. Then who is creating these unreal objects? Well, it is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. So then Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; does exist? No, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; doesn&#146;t exist, She only appears to exist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->What a miserable logical position! Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the entity that creates this world, this apparent world, does not have any existence at all. She is by Her very nature false. Her existence is basically unreal. Her existence is based on non-existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->This is all manipulation of words. That is why it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..23"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Va&#x301;k vaekharii shabdhajharii sha&#x301;stravya&#x301;khya&#x301;nakaoshalam;<br>Vaedus&#x301;yam&#x301; vidus&#x301;am&#x301; tadvat bhuktaye na tu muktaye.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..24"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Simply by playing on words and thereby confusing people, a section of so-called learned pandits may derive intellectual pleasure, their intellectual thirst may be quenched, but the human heart remains unsatisfied. These intellectuals, steeped in intellectual vanity, may get temporary satisfaction, but they can never attain salvation.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->However, Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is quite different. He attracts all beings to Himself by playing His flute. For Him no one is downtrodden, no one is fallen, no one is neglected. All are equal to Him; His call is meant for all. The sound of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s flute has been resonating throughout eternity. One who contemplates Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a can immediately hear this sound (as those of you who practise spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; may have realized). But if people&#146;s minds become engrossed in the mundane world and remain oblivious of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, they will be deaf to that divine sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->I have already said<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> that this world is a relative truth: jagadapi satyama&#x301;peks&#x301;ikam [&ldquo;the universe is also truth, but relative&rdquo;]. The entity which leads the jiivas away from Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a bha&#x301;va is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; leads the jiivas away from Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a first of all through the force of viks&#x301;epa shakti. Viks&#x301;epa shakti misguides jiivas by making them believe that this world is everything; that nothing exists beyond what is seen. A second force is a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. Viks&#x301;epa shakti no doubt draws the jiivas away from Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but it cannot keep them completely forgetful of Him. A&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti, however, places a veil of ignorance over people&#146;s eyes<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  so that they cannot see Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a clearly. Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; draws the jiivas towards crudity with the help of Her twin forces of viks&#x301;epa and a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has another aspect which leads the jiivas towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, towards Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Even if people remain steeped in the darkness of ignorance due to the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; they will suddenly come to their senses when the music from the flute of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a falls upon their ears and touches the cores of their hearts. People say to themselves, &ldquo;What am I doing? This is not the way to live. These transient objects can never bring me lasting satisfaction because nothing in this world is permanent.&rdquo; Suddenly this idea strikes: nothing in this world is permanent.<!-- /block --></p>

After sambit has been awakened, consciousness has been awakened, understanding has been awakened, one cannot remain away from Parama Purus&#x301;a. &ldquo;Let me go to the source of that sweet flute sound,&rdquo; the devotees say. &ldquo;I must go there, for that is my real place.&rdquo; With one-pointed determination and the sweetness of madhura bha&#x301;va they advance towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, towards Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, goaded by the hla&#x301;dinii shakti of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. So Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a has nothing to do with the Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da, with the Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; which is mithya&#x301; svabha&#x301;va [unreal by nature]. To Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Prakrti has two aspects: Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; helps spiritual aspirants, and Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; distracts them from the spiritual path. Are they two completely separate entities? No, they are not. When the same Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; misguides sa&#x301;dhakas, She is called Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and when She inspires them to move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, She is called Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. In relation to Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, there is no difference between the roles of Vrajagopa&#x301;la and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;diis say Brahma satyam [&ldquo;Brahma alone is real&rdquo;]. Before analysing this part of their proposition, we should know what the two terms Brahma and satyam really mean.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The word Brahma is derived from the word brhat. Brhat means &ldquo;vast&rdquo; &ndash; so big that the entity cannot be measured. (It can be said that something is &ldquo;this big&rdquo;, but it cannot be said that something is &ldquo;this vast&rdquo;.) Brahma may also be derived from another word, brm&#x301;han&#x301;. Brm&#x301;han&#x301; has two meanings: the first is &ldquo;to make others great&rdquo;; the second is &ldquo;to make others hear, see or understand something very, very big or great&rdquo;. So if derived from brm&#x301;han&#x301;, Brahma means the Entity who has the capacity to make others as great as He is. The one who is brhat is Brahma, and the one who makes others great is Brahma. (You must be very careful in following this analysis. I am mentioning a very important point.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Brahma Derived from Brhat<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->To indicate vastness there are two Sanskrit words &ndash; visha&#x301;la and vira&#x301;t&#x301;a. When something is very big but comes within the scope of measurement, we call it visha&#x301;la; and when it is beyond measurement it is called vira&#x301;t&#x301;a. (The Bengali word bar&#x301;a [big] came from the word brhat.) Does not the term brhat [a superlative, closely related to vira&#x301;t&#x301;a] imply, directly or indirectly, that all other entities are smaller? If there is an &ldquo;eldest brother&rdquo; in a certain family, it necessarily implies that there are younger brothers &ndash; maybe two, three, four or more. If there were only one brother, we would simply say &ldquo;brother&rdquo;, not &ldquo;eldest brother&rdquo;. Similarly, when we say Brahma &ndash; that is, &ldquo;the greatest entity&rdquo;, the &ldquo;vastest entity&rdquo;, the &ldquo;entity defying measurement&rdquo; &ndash; then that necessarily implies the existence of many small or very small entities. According to Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da, only Brahma is real, everything else is unreal, non-existent. If we say other entities are non-existent, then how can He be Brahma, the Greatest Entity! If we say that there are no other entities besides Brahma, then the term Brahma becomes meaningless. This is a fundamental mistake.<!-- /block --></p>

The question of making something great can only arise when there is something small to be made great. Either He will make that other entity equal to Himself or He will make it greater than Himself. He will decide to do whatever He likes, but still there must be something small to be made great. If there is no one apart from Him, then the second part of the proposition &ndash; brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d Brahma &ndash; becomes meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->One meaning of the word satyam is rtam [&ldquo;stating the fact as it is&rdquo;]. Satyam is also defined Parahita&#x301;rtham&#x301; va&#x301;unmanaso yatha&#x301;rthatvam&#x301; satyam &ndash; &ldquo;The use of speech and thought for the welfare of others is known as satya.&rdquo; But if we say Brahma satyam&#x301; jagat mithya&#x301;, that the &ldquo;world is false&rdquo; and the jiivas are non-existent, then whose welfare can you promote? Parahita&#x301;rtham [&ldquo;For the welfare of others&rdquo;]: If, as according to Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da, there is no such thing as para [other entities], then the existence of satyam [which is for others] remains in jeopardy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Satya Meaning Aparin&#x301;a&#x301;mii<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->A second interpretation of satya is aparin&#x301;a&#x301;mii, &ldquo;that which undergoes no metamorphosis&rdquo;. If we want to categorize something as unchangeable, then we must admit the concept of change, and we must say that all other entities undergo metamorphosis, while Brahma alone remains unchanged. So in order to call Him unchangeable, we must admit the existence of other entities which are subject to change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->It is only by means of the characteristic of change that we can distinguish Him  from other entities. When we deny the very existence of other entities as the Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;diis do in saying jaganmithya&#x301;, then His unchangeability is also mithya&#x301; [false]. If the relative existence of jiiva and jagat is not accepted, then the existence of Brahma is called into question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->What a suicidal argument this is! It is surely an intellectual extravaganza, rather, a foolish intellectual extravaganza!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..14"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Satyam as Rtam<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The third thing about satyam is that it is [sometimes] synonymous with rtam, which means &ldquo;stating the fact as it is&rdquo;. The sha&#x301;stra which is based on satya [satya in this sense] is called itikatha&#x301; (history). (It is not called itiha&#x301;sa. Itiha&#x301;sa has a different meaning.) Thus a chronological record of events &ndash; as something occurs, so it is written &ndash; is satyam. Using this definition of satyam, if someone then claims that there is only Brahma and no one else, then how can any events occur? For there is no one and nothing except Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..16"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->As&#x301;t&#x301;akula&#x301;cala&#x301;h saptasamudra&#x301;h Brahma purandarah<br>dinakararudra&#x301;h;<br>Na tvam&#x301; na&#x301;ham&#x301; na&#x301;yam&#x301; lokah vyarthah kimartham&#x301; kriyate shokah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The eight mountains, the seven seas, the vast nebulae, the Creator Brahma, the sun, Rudra &ndash; none of these exist in reality. Neither you nor I exist. Then why should you weep for these things?&rdquo; This is how Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da propounds its philosophical ideas. But in the absence of existence, how can events take place? Events invariably presuppose clash and cohesion between so many things. If one moves this bolster from one side to another there are two entities: the bolster and the person who moves it. The action of displacement occurs. But if there is nothing other than Brahma, then no event can take place. Events presuppose acting agents, things and connecting verbs. Since nothing takes place, there is no question of recording chronological events; there is no person to record the events, no pen, no paper, no history, no historian. So when there are no events to be recorded &ndash; since satya is a record of events &ndash; then it stands to reason that there is no satya either. So how can we accept Brahma satyam? How can we say that Brahma is satyam when satya itself is non-existent? It is another fundamental mistake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->If we accept that Brahma is the composite of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti, and Purus&#x301;a is satyam while Prakrti is instrumental in the creation of countless entities[, a sound philosophy can be built.] Aghat&#x301;anaghat&#x301;anapatiiyasii &ndash; &ldquo;Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has been creating numerous names and forms in this universe with Her dexterous touch.&rdquo; Brahma is the composite of Purus&#x301;a and Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; creates countless things. Let us illustrate this by using a piece of paper. It has two sides. If one side represents Purus&#x301;a, then the other side represents Prakrti or Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Purus&#x301;a cannot be separated from Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, just as one side of a piece of paper cannot be separated from the other. If one side of the paper is removed, then the other side can no longer exist. Similarly, Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are inseparably connected. Let us take another example, milk. Milk is inseparable from its whiteness. If the whiteness is removed, then the milk is no longer milk. Entities which cannot exist without each other are said to be avina&#x301;bha&#x301;vii with each other. If we remove one side of a piece of paper, the other side also disappears.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are avina&#x301;bha&#x301;vii. Purus&#x301;atattva remains as the fundamental substance, as well as the witnessing entity, while Prakrtitattva is responsible for creating the countless number of entities. Tvameko dvitvama&#x301;pannah Shivashaktivibha&#x301;gasah &ndash; &ldquo;You are one, called Brahma or Parama Purus&#x301;a. Your one side is Purus&#x301;a, or Citishakti, and the other is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, or Prakrti.&rdquo; Essentially, He is one, like a sheet of paper. If such a Brahma is accepted, a sound philosophy can be built around It which will be easily acceptable to learned people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The Brahma of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da, however, is different. Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da contends that one aspect of Brahma, Purus&#x301;a, is satyam [real], and the other side is mithya&#x301; svabha&#x301;va [unreal]. Can one imagine a sheet of paper with only one side? Hence, this whole philosophy is hypocritical. It is nothing but the practice of self-deception. Moreover, it is self-humiliating &ndash; those of discerning intellect will easily discover its obvious defects. They are sure to see that it is nothing but a play on words, merely philosophical rigmarole. Suppose a mother asks, &ldquo;Who is in the kitchen?&rdquo; and her child replies, &ldquo;No, I didn&#146;t eat the biscuits!&rdquo; From the answer itself, we know that the child has definitely eaten the biscuits.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Now, according to the Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;diis, if Brahma is Purus&#x301;atattva, then the other side of the paper is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, who is giving shape to the an infinite variety of forms. If Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is the Creative Principle, then where does She get Her materials from? If you want to make pancakes, you require flour, milk, baking powder, etc. You cannot suddenly produce a pancake out of nothing. So how does Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; create this world? She collects her materials for Her numerous objects &ndash; hills, mountains, water, etc. &ndash; from the vast Purus&#x301;adeha [body of Purus&#x301;a], just as a potter collects clay from the earth and produces a variety of pots, pitchers, etc. In the same way, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; uses the body of Purus&#x301;a as Her basic building material and from it creates Her innumerable entities. It follows that this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, who has the capacity to utilize the Cognitive Faculty as the fundamental substance of the creation, is no ordinary entity. She has tremendous power. How can that Entity, who possesses enormous power, who can create this vast world out of the Purus&#x301;adeha, be unreal? She cannot be mithya&#x301; svabha&#x301;va [unreal by nature]. Rather, She is pracan&#x301;d&#x301;a svabha&#x301;va [having a strong personality by nature]. Her presence is felt by all. Thus advaetava&#x301;da, while trying to downplay Her importance by branding Her as mithya&#x301; svabha&#x301;va, shows itself to be an untenable philosophy. The idea itself is absurd.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Regarding Purus&#x301;a, Vedanta and Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da claim that He is merely a witnessing Entity. But how can His witness-ship be accepted philosophically? The one who remains as the witness of the created world is described as Sagun&#x301;a Brahma [Qualified Brahma]. If, however, we call this world mithya&#x301;, having no existence in reality, then what is there to witness? It is the witness-ship of nothing. In other words, He continues to witness that expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a that actually does not exist. The idea is fantastic. If this is true, then He is Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma [Non-Qualified Brahma]. He has the capacity to witness, but in the absence of anything to witness, His witness-ship becomes suspended. To accept an entity whose very existence is in jeopardy is finally untenable.<!-- /block --></p>

He is the Ta&#x301;raka Brahma aspect of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He is the nuclear point from which Parama Purus&#x301;a witnesses the entire universe.

He is in the role of active witness-ship (but according to advaetava&#x301;da is witnessing nothing!). If he happens to detect someone putting too much semolina in the rasagolla&#x301;s, he immediately takes the guilty party to task. If someone puts too much ground chilli in the vegetables, he takes the guilty party to task. If the vegetables get a little burnt, he says, &ldquo;Oh, people can&#146;t eat this. Quick &ndash; pour a lot of water onto them, and add fifteen or twenty betel leaves. That will reduce the burnt effect.&rdquo; Though not doing anything specific, his is the active witness-ship.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->My beloved Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a has been playing His flute and calling people to Himself since the dawn of time. The created beings of the universe are revolving around Him. Because they are constantly moving, their balance is maintained, otherwise they would fall apart. The planets move around the sun, and thus they maintain their balance. The moment they stop revolving, they will disintegrate. Similarly, every microcosm is moving, dancing around my beloved Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. In His ocean of blissful bha&#x301;va [devotional sentiment born out of psycho-spiritual parallelism], in His eternal flow of infinite sweetness, He is making others dance in joy and bliss, filling their minds with divine ecstasy. This is His ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;, His divine sport of joy. Raso vae sah [&ldquo;He is an eternal flow of bliss&rdquo;]. Remaining in the middle of the ocean of bliss, He maintains the balance of the universe. No one is detached from His Cosmological order, no one feels isolated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Everyone knows that Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a exists to take care of those who have no one of their own. He is amidst all; He does not neglect me, He does not neglect anyone. I exist because He exists, that&#146;s why He is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. One of the meanings of the root verb krs&#x301; is &ldquo;He exists, that&#146;s why I exist.&rdquo; The word krs&#x301;n&#x301;a also has the same meaning. And like the head of the family in the marriage pavilion, He is an  impartial witness who not only sees, but oversees, everything. (Remember, &ldquo;to see&rdquo; is also a verb.) So the impersonal Nirgun&#x301;a Purus&#x301;a of Uttara Miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301; may have His existence in the intellectual world of visionary idealists, but not in the practical world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->My beloved Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is drawing everyone to Himself, making others move or dance around Him in His ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;. Not only that, it is He who sustains the very existence of everything. Hence to move towards Him, to rush headlong towards Him, is the dharma [predominant characteristic] of the jiivas. This is the only dharma of the jiivas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->This being so, you might, of course, raise a question about your material needs. If your basic physical needs are not fulfilled, you cannot move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. So you make necessary arrangements for your food and clothes, build a well-knit society, try to provide people with the five essential needs &ndash; food, clothes, shelter, education and medical treatment. But why? So that you can create a congenial atmosphere to move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a in a better way, in a nicer way. If your food is not provided for, you will not be able to concentrate your entire mind on Parama Purus&#x301;a; part of your mind will flow towards your stomach. Food is the top priority and should be arranged first to prevent the mind from running towards the stomach. So human beings should be provided the basic necessities of life so that the mind, freed from the worries of mundane problems, can rush towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is the beauty of the sweetness of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a; this is His ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->But this is not all. I said a little while ago that the head of the family at a marriage does not witness passively, but actively. That is, if someone makes a mistake, he immediately intervenes: he points out the mistake, chastises the person at fault, rectifies the mistake and takes the offender lovingly on his lap &ndash; all of this is his duty. So when Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a attracts all by His divine flute music, what does it signify? It means He calls the jiivas, saying: &ldquo;O my loving children, come to Me, come to Me, one and all, and live with Me in joy throughout eternity in this Cosmological order. The world of jiivas is not absolute satya, but relative satya. From that relative world, come to Me. This is what you and I both desire. This is what will give us both bliss.&rdquo; This is the final word of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->We have discussed today only one part, that is, Brahma satyam, of the shloka of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da. Unfortunately, the proponents of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da philosophy could not grasp the significance of the word satyam. If at all they understood anything about it, then they deliberately misguided the common people. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is sweetness as only sweetness can be. He lies beyond all these misconceived and confused assertions.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Of all the doctrines centred around Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is considered to be the most important. Let us see how far it is possible to analyse Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a from the viewpoint of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da or Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The life of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was intensely practical, whereas Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is an impractical, visionary philosophy that floats in the air. Many take delight in moving in this world of fantasy, the world of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, and losing all contact with the world of reality. Although the role played by Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a extended throughout the three spheres of existence, His sweetness was felt most in the spiritual sphere. Yet even so, when I analysed Him in the light of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da suffered an ignoble defeat. How then will it be possible to judge Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi in such a light? Though it is an extremely difficult thing, still I must make the attempt, but the question is, how? One idea comes to mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The Vivekacud&#x301;a&#x301;man&#x301;i and the Mohamudgaraka<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->People generally consider the two books Vivekacud&#x301;a&#x301;man&#x301;i and Mohamudgaraka to be something related to practical life, or to the materialization of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da in the quinquelemental realm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, as we have already observed, was an intensely practical man. He worked hard not only to promote the spiritual elevation and psychic welfare of human beings, but also to satisfy their needs for food, clothing, education, medical care and accommodation. He tried to bring all rational people, kings as well as commoners, together under one banner for the establishment of dharmara&#x301;jya, the rule of morality, so that all could live in peace and prosperity. How can we judge the life and personality of such an intensely practical man in the light of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da? It is like trying to measure milk with a tape measure. Of course there are things that can be measured with a tape measure, but how can we measure liquids in that way? And how can we measure Parama Purus&#x301;a with the tape measure of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da? Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi represents the universal existence of Parama Purus&#x301;a; He is the Sarvabhaoma Satta&#x301; [Supreme All-Pervasive Entity].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You know that the word bhu&#x301;mi [the root of sarvabhaoma] is synonymous with vasu. Vasu or bhu&#x301;mi means a land which people can inhabit without any difficulty. And where people live their mundane existence is this quinquelemental world. And who is the Entity who makes suitable arrangements for human beings and other jiivas in this quinquelemental world? It is Parama Purus&#x301;a who does, so He is surely the Bhaomika of the physical world. [And sarva means &ldquo;all&rdquo;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->You all know that in ancient and medieval Bengal, the landlords used the surname Bhaomika.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.14.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#14.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In modern Bengali it is Bhuniya. They are both derived from the word bhu&#x301;mi. Parama Purus&#x301;a is called the Bhaomika of the quinquelemental world because it is He who holds the key to the solution of all mundane problems.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There is another world, the psychic world, the psychic bhu&#x301;mi, which lies beyond this mundane world. It is a world of innumerable feelings, emotions, sentiments, etc. From where do people draw their inspiration for these things? From Parama Purus&#x301;a, certainly. So Parama Purus&#x301;a is not only the Bhaomika of the physical world, He is the Bhaomika, the Lord, of the psychic world as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Beyond the physical and psychic spheres lies the spiritual sphere. A person, whatever may be his or her degree of spiritual elevation, possesses an a&#x301;tmika satta&#x301; [unit consciousness] which shines out like a diamond in a heap of coal. But where does the effulgence of that a&#x301;tmika satta&#x301; come from? Certainly from Parama Purus&#x301;a, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. So He is Lord, or Bhaomika, of the spiritual realm as well. His existence is tribhaomika.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->If Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is the tape measure, how will it measure that Parama Purus&#x301;a who is the Lord of the three realms?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Still, we have to try to measure Him in the light of the so-called practical interpretations of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da. They say:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[Father, mother, brother and sister are non-existent, so where is the relationship between the ka&#x301;ya (body) and the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a (vital energy)?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Who is one&#146;s father, who is one&#146;s mother, who is one&#146;s brother, and who is one&#146;s sister in this world? No one exists.&rdquo; Look, human beings come into this world and attend to so many duties. Among so many fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, you will come across some who spend their whole lives maintaining their younger brothers and sisters. There are others who spend their lives caring for their ailing parents. Many people look upon human beings as God Himself and throw themselves into the service of humanity abandoning their families and personal comforts. Defying all obstacles &ndash; the dense forests, the towering mountains, the stormy oceans &ndash; they travel throughout the world promoting the welfare of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->It is the sense of duty that causes one person to renounce everything; and it is the sense of duty that inspires another person to readily accept the burden of caring for his or her family. It is the sense of duty that makes a person great. Of all bonds, the bond of duty is the strongest, and the bond of moha [blind attachment or infatuation] is the worst. Humanity will have to break the bonds of moha and increase the bonds of duty willingly and consciously. This is the law. So if we say that human beings, our friends and relations, have no existence, are all Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and as such unreal, then whom shall we serve? If you tell a teacher that all his or her students are unreal, then why should he or she devote six hours a day to teaching them? Even to take care of one&#146;s family goes against the doctrine of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da &ndash; as does the life of renunciation, cutting off all relations with the worldly family in order to serve the world &ndash; because the family does not exist, nor does the world. If one sincerely accepts Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, then the only thing to do is to adopt the Pi-pu-phi-shu policy,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.14.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#14.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> that is, remain inert and do nothing at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Then the question arises whether or not adherents of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da should eat. I suggest that they should not eat, because the rice, dal, rasagolla&#x301; and ra&#x301;jabhoga that they will eat are also Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. I will go one step further and say that they should not live either, for in order to live one must breathe in and breathe out, and air is also Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, so they should stop that breathing in and out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->It is said, ka&#x301;ya pra&#x301;n&#x301;e na sambandha vrtha&#x301; ka&#x301; parivedana&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.14.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#14.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Ka&#x301;ya means &ldquo;that which is collected from different sources&rdquo;. Our human body is composed of water, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, iron, a little gold, minute quantities of silver, and a considerable amount of calcium. As our body is a collection of various elements coming from various sources, it is known as ka&#x301;ya in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->When the world itself is non-existent, then how can there be any carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc? They must also be non-existent. The fundamental tenet of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is that your body has no existence and thus you have no connection with the rest of the world, for human beings are connected to the rest of the world through their bodies. How  can there be any practical application of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da without the existence of the physical body? There cannot be. Moreover, as I have already said, the Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dins should give up food, since they have no body. Thus it follows that the practical application of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da is impossible; it is a mere fantasy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Our next point of discussion is pra&#x301;n&#x301;a. In Sanskrit, when pra&#x301;n&#x301;a is used in plural form, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h, it means &ldquo;vital energies&rdquo; or &ldquo;life&rdquo;, and when used in the singular form, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a simply means &ldquo;energy&rdquo;. The Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dins do not explain this point clearly, nor is it necessary, because vital energy is the transmuted form of different physical energies. They assert that the physical body has no relationship with the various forms of physical energy. A sensible person may raise a point here. When the physical body itself is non-existent, then the question of it having any connection with the external world does not arise. Then is it not redundant to use the term pra&#x301;n&#x301;a? &ndash; for pra&#x301;n&#x301;a does not exist either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Obviously, in the absence of energy, its acoustic root ra does not exist either. In ancient times, a section of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dins would never utter the sound ra because there was no such thing as energy; they would say it was all Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. For instance, they would pronounce &ldquo;Ra&#x301;macandra&rdquo; as &ldquo;A&#x301;macandra&rdquo;. However, the days of such crazy notions are long gone. The human beings of today have made enormous intellectual progress. They will no longer accept any illogical or irrational proposition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->According to the previous shloka, the human body and its vital energy have no relationship. If that were so, how could that gentleman who advances such peculiar ideas operate his vocal cords? The vocal cords operate with the help of vital energy. A healthy person can speak clearly; a sick person will mumble some words in a feeble voice due to the shortage of vital energy. What does common sense suggest? It suggests that people have both life and a physical body. Nothing is permanent in this phenomenal world, neither the body nor the vital energy, but at this moment they do exist. &ldquo;Do not be concerned about anything in the world. Do not bother unnecessarily as to how human beings will progress or how collective development can be brought about. All these do not actually exist,&rdquo; is the practical application of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301; tava ka&#x301;nta&#x301; kaste putrah sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ro&#146;yamatiivavicitrah [&ldquo;Who is your wife? Who is your son? The world is very strange.&rdquo;]. Kasya tvam&#x301; va&#x301; kutah a&#x301;ya&#x301;tah [&ldquo;To whom do you belong? Where do you come from?&rdquo;]. You should think only this, that nothing really exists. You should think only about where one has come from and to whom one belongs. But when nothing really exists, questions about one&#146;s origins do not arise. Even the questions do not exist. When no one really exists, then you also do not exist, so where will any questions come from? The entire philosophical discussion becomes meaningless. This is a kind of nihilism that limits the scope of human expression. It is something that people must carefully avoid. They should remember Shiva&#146;s statement in this regard, Lokavya&#x301;mohaka&#x301;rakah, which means that such people create disease in the human mind by their high-sounding words. One must keep aloof from such things.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->It is said, &ldquo;Human life is fleeting, just like the momentary pause of a drop of water on a lotus leaf before it slips to the ground. Thus, the most important thing in human life is satsaun&#x32D;ga [keeping good company], even for a short time, because satsaun&#x32D;ga is the boat which will ferry human beings across the ocean of bhava [the unrequited sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which cause rebirth].&rdquo; I must ask, when no one exists then how can good people exist? How can the ocean of bhava exist, much less the boat? Only if the physical world, the ocean and the boat exist can satsaun&#x32D;ga be compared to a boat. If one denies the existence of any of them, how can one make analogies with them? Thus, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da has bound itself up in a net of self-contradiction. It has become the cause of its own demise.<!-- /block --></p>

He was an embodiment of tremendous karma shakti [energy for action]. He was determined to destroy whatever was harmful and undesirable for humanity by application of His indomitable strength and commanding force, and at the same time facilitate the growth of all that was good and helpful. Those of noble intentions who are weak and lack the ability to provide for themselves should be supported and cared for by the society as a whole. This was the theme of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s life.<!-- /block --></p>

Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi took birth at a critical juncture in the history of human society, towards the end of the Vedic age, when exploitation had reached its zenith, with opportunists finding ample scope to prey on human society. At such a moment in history could He afford to teach people that all was Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;? That their fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters did not really exist? Rather, He expected people to sympathize with the poor and the miserable and help to alleviate their suffering.<!-- /block --></p>

This nihilistic philosophy has made the people of India and Southeast Asia averse to reality and has been the cause of untold misery in their lives. The life of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was the antithesis of this nihilism. He advised people, &ldquo;Move collectively; look after the welfare of all; develop yourselves in the physical, psychic, and spiritual planes while maintaining proper adjustment among them; follow the dictum Varttama&#x301;nes&#x301;u vartteta [&lsquo;Live in the present&rsquo;], meaning that while you go on solving all your mundane problems collectively, you should direct your minds towards subtler spheres.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

For this, dharmara&#x301;jya [the rule of morality] must be established, and that is why Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi devoted His entire time and energy to establish it.<!-- /block --></p>

Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s message is, &ldquo;Do all your mundane duties with utmost sincerity, but keep your mind constantly engaged in the thought of Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; Why &ldquo;momentary&rdquo; only, why just for a moment? To make significant progress you must remain in the company of Parama Purus&#x301;a not just for a fleeting moment, but constantly, round the clock.

A third said, phi (short for phire, &ldquo;turning over&rdquo;).  And the fourth said, shu (&ldquo;lie down&rdquo;).

<a name="15..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Last Sunday we discussed how Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi appears from the viewpoint of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da. The propounders of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da, especially Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, stress one thing in particular &ndash; that the difference between any two objects is upa&#x301;dhigata, or qualitative (this is accepted by all). But the very next moment they hasten to add that this upa&#x301;dhi [special quality] is not real, that it only exists in people&#146;s imaginations. If we accept this contention, then we presuppose the existence of the one who does the imagining. Logically, we cannot accept that nothing is imagining &ndash; there must be something doing the imagining &ndash; and thus the existence of the imaginer has to be accepted. Now, what does this person imagine? He or she imagines upa&#x301;dhi. And what is that upa&#x301;dhi? &ldquo;Nothing, for it does not exist!&rdquo; they say. But then they hasten to add, &ldquo;Well, it&#146;s something which exists in the imagination.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is upa&#x301;dhi? In Sanskrit, upa&#x301;dhi refers to a special quality, whereas an ordinary quality or title is termed padavii. For example, there is a certain gentleman, Mr. Shriika&#x301;nta Cat&#x301;t&#x301;opa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya. Shriika&#x301;nta is his first name; Cat&#x301;t&#x301;opa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya is his surname. &ldquo;Cat&#x301;t&#x301;opa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya&rdquo; does not indicate any special quality but means an Upa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya Brahman scholar of Ca&#x301;tuti village (situated in the Rarh area of Bengal, west of the Bhagirathi River). If the same gentleman utilizes his scholarly qualities for the benefit of humanity, he will use the word &ldquo;Bhat&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya&rdquo; as his upa&#x301;dhi. Bhat&#x301;t&#x301;a means a Sanskrit scholar; a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya means a person who utilizes his or her intellect for the benefit of others. So Shriika&#x301;nta Cat&#x301;t&#x301;opa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya will write his name as Shriika&#x301;nta Bhat&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya; that is, he will use his upa&#x301;dhi, not his padavii. If asked by someone, he will reply, &ldquo;My padavii is Cat&#x301;t&#x301;opa&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya, but my upa&#x301;dhi is Bhat&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

O human beings composed of the five fundamental factors, remember this.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->What is the difference between the jiivas and Parama Purus&#x301;a? The difference lies in upa&#x301;dhi. If we say that the difference is only upa&#x301;dhi sam&#x301;kra&#x301;nta [qualitative], then I must accept that they both have the same padavii, or common quality, and that the difference lies only in upa&#x301;dhi. Indirectly, it is accepted that the qualities which exist to a limited extent in the jiivas exist in Parama Purus&#x301;a to the fullest possible extent. On this point, there is no difference of opinion. It is accepted that the jiivas and Parama Purus&#x301;a possess the same qualities in different degrees, but that Parama Purus&#x301;a possesses a special quality. If I believe in this proposition, then I must also admit the existence of the jiivas. If we then say that the jiivas do not have this special quality, and only Parama Purus&#x301;a has it, then there remain four factors: (1) jiiva, (2) Shiva [Consciousness], (3) common quality and (4) special upa&#x301;dhi [quality] of Shiva. Then where does advaetava&#x301;da stand? It is not advaetava&#x301;da or non-dualism, it is caturaun&#x32D;gava&#x301;da or quadrupleism! If one accepts the existence of these four factors and still dances to the tune of advaetava&#x301;da, it will be as if one is doing one thing, saying something else, and thinking something completely different. This is surely hypocrisy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The contradictions do not end here. The propounders of advaetava&#x301;da go one step further and say that this upa&#x301;dhi belongs not only to Shiva, or Parama Purus&#x301;a, but also to the jiivas to a lesser degree. And how does the upa&#x301;dhi of the jiivas work? They claim that due to the upa&#x301;dhi of Parama Purus&#x301;a, the quinquelemental factors &ndash; the perceptible world of solid, liquid, luminous, aerial and ethereal &ndash; have emerged, and that due to the upa&#x301;dhi of the jiivas, jiivasya ka&#x301;ryyam&#x301; shrn&#x301;u pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;am [&ldquo;O human beings composed of the five fundamental factors, remember this&rdquo;] &ndash; this physical body of five fundamental factors, having eyes, ears, nose, intelligence, personality, joy, sorrow, etc., has been created. But they also say, Na vastavah kashcid upadhiresah [&ldquo;In reality upa&#x301;dhi of any sort does not exist&rdquo;], and thereby make everything even more confusing. After saying so much about upa&#x301;dhi, they finally say that there is no upa&#x301;dhi! So you can fully understand what a great hypocrisy it is!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The people of those days did not think deeply about anything. They used to take things very easily so it was not difficult to get away with all these self-contradictory ideas.

Take away these differentiating marks, and it will be difficult to distinguish between the two.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Here they outline people&#146;s duties. I cannot understand how they can prescribe the dos and don&#146;ts of those whose very existence they have already denied. However, it is mentioned that there is a qualitative difference between the jiivas and Parama Purus&#x301;a: Samyaunnira&#x301;sena Parah na jiivah. They argue that if the jiivas and Parama Purus&#x301;a are divested of their respective special qualities, then they will become one. The one who cuts grass with a scythe is a grass-cutter and the one who plays a drum is a drummer. If you remove the drum from the drummer and the scythe from the grass-cutter, then according to the advaetava&#x301;diis, the two will become one. I must contradict this by saying that they will not become one, but will still keep their separate identities. At best we can say that the drummer is no longer a drummer, but an ordinary person, and the grass-cutter is no longer a grass-cutter, but an ordinary person as well. But their separate identities are not lost. The only difference is that each has lost his upa&#x301;dhi, the drum or the scythe. So how can we accept the argument that when the upa&#x301;dhis are removed from Parama Purus&#x301;a and the jiivas, they become one? Furthermore, the most important thing is that they have already said that there is no upa&#x301;dhi. When upa&#x301;dhi itself is non-existent, then there is no question of removing it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->For many centuries people have been exploiting the gullibility of the masses through this sort of intellectual extravaganza. This has harmed the Indian people enormously. The followers of advaetava&#x301;da learned how to deceive themselves. The worst crime is self-deception. One should never encourage any dogma or self-deception. Cheating others is a heinous crime, and if you do that society will certainly criticize you. If you deceive yourself, however, no one will criticize you, no one will know of it, but ultimately you will certainly suffer irreparable damage.<!-- /block --></p>

In this shloka it is mentioned that if we give a kingdom (an upa&#x301;dhi) to one person we will call him a king; and if we give a club (another upa&#x301;dhi) to another person, we will call him a fighter. If we remove the kingdom from the king, and the club from the fighter, they are no longer a king and a fighter, but they are not one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->If we analyse Parthasa&#x301;rathi in the light of this upa&#x301;dhiva&#x301;da, what do we find? Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi exhorts people: &ldquo;Take up arms against injustice, against adharma, with courage and determination.&rdquo; Whom does He exhort? He exhorts those people in the world who have both padavii and upa&#x301;dhi. Here upa&#x301;dhi means being human. This is how the individual identity of a human being has been accepted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So, this upa&#x301;dhiva&#x301;da cannot stand before Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. He gave recognition to the uneducated and persecuted masses &ndash; those who had been neglected and humiliated for many centuries. And for their emancipation, He united the various kings of India and waged war against crime and injustice. Moreover, He also inspired others to participate in the struggle against adharma. His entire life was dedicated to this cause, and this cause alone. He entrusted the charge of His kingdom to His brother, Balarama, and His wife, Satyabha&#x301;ma, and travelled the length and breadth of the then India to awaken socio-spiritual consciousness and arouse an anti-persecution sentiment. Thus Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was poles apart from the eternal conflict between upa&#x301;dhiva&#x301;da and anupa&#x301;dhitva. Upa&#x301;dhiva&#x301;da is alien to Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. He exhorts people not only to wage war against injustice and adharma, but also teaches them how to live in peace and prosperity, and how to make progress in spiritual life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Human existence is tri-stratumic. Only when there is a happy adjustment amongst the three strata can human beings tread the path of spirituality. In the absence of a proper adjustment, everything disintegrates and falls into ruin. It may be that many good people who became sannya&#x301;siis [renunciants] did so initially for the good of humanity, but that later their minds changed when they had to confront the stark reality of hunger. At first perhaps they had thought that they would knock at only five houses for alms, and follow ma&#x301;dhukarii vrtti,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> but they found that they could not subsist in that way. As a result they may have decided to try ten houses, then fifteen, and so on. Their greed instinct increased, and little by little they became caught in the python noose of all sorts of sin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The rule is that if an honest person leading an honest life solves the mundane problems of procuring the basic necessities of life while moving towards the divine goal, he or she will never become downfallen. But all too often people remain enslaved to their stomachs and creature comforts. And if the social order is defective, even good people go astray and meet their demise. But Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi wanted to create a society based on dharma, or in His language, dharmara&#x301;jya, a moralistic social order. He wanted to bring about progress in the physical, psychic and spiritual spheres. Upa&#x301;dhiva&#x301;da completely denied the material side of life. Had they attempted to bring about the psychic well-being of people, it would have been better than nothing, for if people could have found some mental happiness, even on an empty stomach, then physical deprivation would not have been so hard to bear.<!-- /block --></p>

Forest elephants live on dry grass, yet they do not lose their strength. The sages live on roots and fruits, yet they remain hale and hearty.

In upa&#x301;dhiva&#x301;da, however, psychic satisfaction has not been given any place, because the psychic world of ideas, feelings and thoughts has been denied. Even the forces of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; which operate in the individual are denied. Thus ultimately only a theoretical Brahma remains who has no relationship whatsoever with the jiivas. This sort of dangerous doctrine has acted upon the minds of the Indian people for the past 1300 years, bringing them to the brink of disaster.<!-- /block --></p>

He wanted to establish dharmara&#x301;jya for the physical and psychic well-being of humanity. Here psychic well-being means absolute freedom from dogma. The weaknesses and imperfections which have been infecting people&#146;s minds for so long, now lie like a dead weight upon the mind, crippling its capacity for free and independent thought. As a result, a sort of psychic vacuum has been created. This state of affairs has lasted for centuries.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The influence of dogma on the human mind is peculiar. A patient may know that a certain medicine will cure his or her disease, yet will pray and make offerings to a certain deity. This is only due to a fear complex created by dogma. Or suppose an epidemic has broken out. As a rule, people should be very cautious in this situation. It is common sense that the food from the house of one affected by the epidemic should not be sent to anyone else&#146;s house. However, a pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [act of worship] is often performed in the patient&#146;s house, and the prasa&#x301;da [offerings] is distributed to all the other houses in the neighbourhood. This is how the epidemic spreads!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Or, why are there so many god and goddesses? People know that they are all nonsense, yet they cannot think of going beyond the pale of dogma which lies like a dead weight on their minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In order to free human beings from this senseless attachment to the past born out of dogma, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi said, Klaevyam&#x301; ma&#x301;smagam Pa&#x301;rtha &ndash; &ldquo;O Pa&#x301;rtha [Arjuna], never encourage this sort of dogma, this weakness, this psychic inertness.

Therefore Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s existence was diametrically opposed to Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da, a clear antithesis to upa&#x301;dhiva&#x301;da. No relationship between them ever existed in the past, nor does exist in the present. Suffering humanity should accept Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi as their ideal. They should not be expected to accept the visionary idealism of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, or the fantasies of upa&#x301;dhiva&#x301;da, or any philosophical rigmarole. These things have no practical value in human life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There is very little difference, a limited difference, between matter and Consciousness. At some particular stages, at some special stages or strata of crudification of the mental body arising from Parama Purus&#x301;a, matter comes into being. Thereafter, as a result of clash and cohesion within the material structure, citta [mind-stuff], subtle mind, etc., emerge. Later, due to the attraction of the Great and increasing subtilization, there arise jiivas, ranging from undeveloped to developed. In the modern world, humans are surely the most evolved creatures &ndash; that is, the creatures with the highest level of consciousness. On other planets also, there are creatures like human beings. Not only on other planets [of this solar system], but on other celestial bodies, there may be creatures like human beings, in some cases slightly more developed, in some cases slightly less developed. Whoever comes in the process of evolution, goes &ndash; Yah agacchati sah gacchati.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Human beings emerged on this earth about one million years ago. Perhaps some of you have seen the fossils of primitive human beings a few hundred thousand years old.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.16.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#16.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In outward appearance those primitive humans were not exactly the same as modern people; there was some difference. The humans of today have undergone a little change. Humans will remain on this planet for a little while longer, and they will undergo further change. On other planets and stars as well, the bodies of human-like beings have evolved in accordance with the particular amounts and ratios of the five fundamental factors in those places. Those amounts and ratios will not remain the same as they are now, either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The intellectual expression depends to a great extent on the physical structure. If the head, that is, the cranium, is small, it cannot accommodate much intellect, because the brain in which the intellect resides must in turn be a little bigger. In primitive times, the dinosaurs, the brontosaurs, and the kaktesiya&#x301;s had huge bodies but tiny brains. Some of you have seen the fossils of these animals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Let me tell you a little story. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar of Bengal had a comparatively large head, which was the object of many a joke. Some people used to say appreciatively, &ldquo;Without such a large head, how could one possess such a tremendous intellect?&rdquo; Thus the more people advance, the more the body undergoes change. The greater the physical evolution, the more complex the physical structure becomes. The structure must necessarily become complex, because the body and mind are the vehicles of various thoughts and expressions of thoughts. A mind that wants to think of many things requires a developed brain, and a developed cranium (for the brain to reside in). Not only that, one also requires a nervous system capable of carrying the different thought-currents of the brain to different parts of the body. And besides the nervous system, there should be glands capable of thinking in a new way within a congenial structure. The presence of glands implies the secretion of hormones and that in turn presupposes the presence of various chemical substances in the body. Thus the human structure must become progressively more complex. Of all the structures of living beings on this planet, the human body is the most complex, for it has to act as the vehicle for a complex mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Nothing in this world is stationary; humans also do not remain stationary. This applies not only to our own planet, but to other celestial bodies as well. Everything will have to advance along the path of movement. Caraeveti, caraeveti [&ldquo;March ahead, march ahead&rdquo;] is the one watchword on the path of movement. No one has come to stay permanently in this world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There are those who preach dogmas and say that whatever such-and-such maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a said in such-and-such year must not be changed. Whatever that person said a thousand years ago, or five thousand years ago, is the direct word of God, and that must prevail. No deviation is tolerated by them. These preachers of dogma are trying to impose their irrational and outdated doctrines on enlightened people, and thereby thwart the intellectual progress of humanity. However, their sinister attempts are bound to be frustrated. Perhaps dogma will succeed in landing some blows on the human mind, but ultimately those attempts will boomerang on them with redoubled energy and vigour, causing those dogmas not only to bend, but to break into pieces. Humanity has been advancing and will keep advancing in the future. Gradually the glandular structure will undergo further development, the hormone system will become more complex, the cranium will undergo changes in size, and so on. Through this natural process the human species will eventually become extinct on this planet and on others as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Whoever comes must also go. This is the inexorable law. The extinction of human beings from this planet should by no means leave anyone frustrated. The victorious humans who came to this planet long ago will move to other planets, towards a greater glory, a greater victory, a far greater enlightenment.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The lower glands of the human body with their controlling points are controlled by the higher glands and their respective controlling points. So if the pituitary gland is well-developed, the lower glands will be equally well-developed and well-regulated. The pineal gland is the primary controller of all the other glands. The human body possesses fifty main glands, each having its own impact on the psychic sphere. Every gland works both internally and externally as well as in ten directions. 50 x 2 x 10 = 1000. That is why the pineal gland, being the controller of one thousand vrttis [propensities], is called the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.16.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#16.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The controlling point of human sentimentality is the unit consciousness, the a&#x301;tma&#x301;, and all unit consciousnesses in this universe are controlled by the Supreme Consciousness from this pineal gland. The human body is a yantra [machine] &ndash; the hands, feet, etc., constitute the crude physical machine, while the various thought-waves are psychic machines. The glands are also psychic machines. All these are controlled by the pineal gland, and Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Supreme Controller of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The Foundation of the Controllers<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->And what foundation do these controllers stand upon? Certainly not the Maha&#x301;shu&#x301;nya. Neither the small comets and meteors nor the huge stars and nebulae are without a foundation, or shelter; everything has a shelter of its own. Life also requires a shelter, a base. Shelterlessness means total annihilation, but there is no such thing as total annihilation in the universe. There is evolution and there is metamorphosis, but no annihilation. For example, when you see a two-year-old baby after eight years, you find that the personality of the baby has died. But is it really dead? No, through evolution it has been transformed into the personality of a ten-year-old child. In this way, things evolve with the changes in time, space and person. So there cannot be nor is there any entity without a shelter. If there is any such entity, it means it is dead. As there is no such thing as total annihilation in this world, it follows that everything and everyone has a shelter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The human pineal gland, which is the seat of the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; [unit soul], can be described as the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the jiivadeha [microcosmic body]. The entity who controls all the created beings from the universal nucleus and around whom all the jiiva&#x301;tma&#146;s dance is none other than Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Himself. Is that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the microcosmic body the same Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the Macrocosmic body? Or is it some other entity connected with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and revolving around the Macrocosmic Nucleus? Actually, the unit consciousness seated in the pineal gland of the microcosm is beyond any doubt a creation of the Macrocosm. But since it revolves around the Macrocosmic Nucleus, it must feel some attraction to it. Without attraction, it would have dissociated from the nucleus and disintegrated. Through this process of movement human beings, and for that matter all jiivas [along with the controlling structures in their bodies], attain their respective shelters. The cessation of movement would mean loss of shelter and consequent disintegration, otherwise described in the sacred Vedas as mahatii vinas&#x301;t&#x301;i [total annilhilation]. A person who is moving away from Parama Purus&#x301;a is heading towards total annihilation, towards mahatii vinas&#x301;t&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>

The closer you move towards the Cosmic Nucleus through love, the greater you will become. Your whole being will be illumined with excellence, sweetness, and refined intellect; and thus moving, you will one day merge with Parama Purus&#x301;a.

The difference lies in the fact that in Vishis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da, the world has not been discarded as Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and Parama Purus&#x301;a has been accepted as the nucleus of the universe.

<a name="16..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->I wish to avoid philosophical intricacies and will only discuss the important ideas.

He is complete in all respects. He is full of all rasas [flows] &ndash; full of sweetness, full of valour. Sometimes He is bitter and sometimes He is sweet. Sometimes, just to save you from danger, He will fight or encourage others to fight. According to Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;uva&#x301;da, this Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;u sometimes kills His enemies with His club, and sometimes forms a cakravyuha [encircling military formation] to trap them and return them to the right path; that is, he kills wrongdoers in order to give them a fresh start. But remember, His purpose is not the total annihilation of anyone. He is the very embodiment of softness, yet sends out His clarion call in a thundering voice. He is the one with the conch.

That part of Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;uva&#x301;da which likens Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;u to a round mass of fire, from which the innumerable entities emerge, protected and inspired by Him, is acceptable.

<a name="17..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There are many people who dislike hero-worship, and then again, there are many people who only say that they dislike it, although they actually do like it. It is an ingrained human trait that generally people do not have sufficient courage to undertake those tasks that require courage. But if someone takes the lead courageously, then others will cooperate. When a brave person comes forward, other people become brave due to his or her example. This is also an ingrained human trait. That is why whenever a righteous person undertakes a noble cause, honest people willingly extend their unstinting cooperation to him or her. Hero-worship of this sort is quite natural. If anyone opposes this natural thing, it should be understood that he or she suffers from a fear complex and criticizes hero-worship just to hide it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Hero-worship does not necessarily mean, however, that whatever a great person does should be blindly supported. As previously said, when a virtuous person courageously undertakes a noble cause, it is but natural that other people will extend their support. It is a natural human trait.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->We see in Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi an expression of [the qualities that elicit] that trait in a powerful way. He was a true representative of the hopes and aspirations of good people, that is, of people devoted to the Lord. Who is that entity who fulfils the hopes and aspirations of devoted people, of righteous and virtuous people (the hopes and aspirations of virtuous people generally are virtuous and good)? It is Parama Purus&#x301;a who does so. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi stole the hearts and minds of people in the past and continues to do so today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In my last discourse I was discussing Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;uva&#x301;da. I said that if the sparks coming out of the original fire merge again in their source it is not a matter of sorrow but a matter of joy. But if the sparks lose themselves forever in the yawning chasms of darkness, there cannot be any greater sorrow. This getting lost forever is termed pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha [total annihilation] in Sanskrit. They are lost forever and cannot return to the original source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s teachings there is no mention whatsoever of this pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. Even regarding the most sinful people He said, Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; vina&#x301;sha&#x301;ya ca dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m [&ldquo;(I have come) for the protection of the virtuous and the destruction of the wicked&rdquo;]. Here He talks of vina&#x301;sha [destruction], not pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. What is the meaning of vina&#x301;sha? It means a vishis&#x301;t&#x301;a [special] form of na&#x301;sha. And na&#x301;sha means change of form from an undeveloped form to a more developed one. In this process something is apparently destroyed, but actually is metamorphosed into something better. For example, the ugly silkworm, when it leaves its cocoon, is metamorphosed into a beautiful butterfly. The silkworm has not met its total annihilation but has simply undergone a change for the better. Vina&#x301;sha&#x301;ya ca dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m&#x301; [&ldquo;for the destruction of the wicked&rdquo;]. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi never looked upon anyone as His enemy or as an object of hatred, not even the most wicked people. However, if people were antisocial, if they harmed others and became a cause of immense terror, He destroyed them. Why does this destruction occur? Not to send them to eternal darkness but to destroy the Ravana<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in them, so that they could acquire a better human form.<!-- /block --></p>

First I will explain what the term sa&#x301;dhu really means. In popular Indian usage, sa&#x301;dhu means those persons who smear themselves with white ashes, keep locks of matted hair on their heads and wear white turbans and white clothes. The leader of a group of such sa&#x301;dhus is called a moha&#x301;nta. Those who may or may not use coloured ashes (white, red, crimson, etc.), who wear either red or saffron turbans and clothes and who suffix their names with a&#x301;nanda [bliss], are known as sannya&#x301;sins [renunciants]. Sa&#x301;dhus on the other hand usually use the word da&#x301;sa [servant] together with their first name, such as Sumera Da&#x301;sa, Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na Da&#x301;sa, Ra&#x301;ma Da&#x301;sa, etc. Their Indian or international leader is known as maha&#x301;man&#x301;d&#x301;aleshvara, whereas the head of a small monastery in known as mat&#x301;ha&#x301;dhiisha. So these are the two broad classifications &ndash; sa&#x301;dhu and sannya&#x301;sii. This classification is based upon outward appearance, external criteria.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What is the inner truth? The word sannya&#x301;sii is derived sat + nya&#x301;s + suffix nini, first case ending, singular number. Sannya&#x301;sii means one who, out of noble intentions and benevolent outlook, has sacrificed his or her everything for the highest goal in life, Parama Purus&#x301;a. The word sa&#x301;dhu can be interpreted in two ways, but in both cases the meaning is the same. The first interpretation is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Ja&#x301;tasya hi jagati jantavah sa&#x301;dhujiivita&#x301;h;<br>Ye punarn&#x301;eha ja&#x301;yante shes&#x301;a&#x301;h jat&#x301;haragardabha&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[The lives of those human beings who are sa&#x301;dhu (upright), and who are not born again, I call successful. The lives of the rest are no better than those of donkeys.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It is a fact that not all human beings are righteous. Even though one possesses a human framework, one&#146;s demeanour, conduct and thought processes may be worse than those of an animal. Hence it is said that a person who has lived his or her life honestly, who has not harmed others to further his or her own interests, and has worked for the welfare of others in every way, is a sa&#x301;dhu. He or she is not required to be reborn on this earth. He or she becomes one with Parama Purus&#x301;a after death, and the separate identity is lost in Parama Purus&#x301;a. In the Bengali literature of 1200 years ago it is mentioned, Je je ujuba&#x301;t&#x301;e gela&#x301; ana&#x301;bat&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; bhaela&#x301; soi. That is, &ldquo;One who has followed the straight path of the sus&#x301;umna&#x301; canal<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> upwards does not return.&rdquo; He or she becomes one with Parama Purus&#x301;a, losing his or her separate existence. To come down to a lower level of consciousness, it is necessary to maintain a separate existence. Just because one has a human form and just because one besmears one&#146;s body with ashes, wears white and uses the name Da&#x301;sa, it does not mean that one is a sa&#x301;dhu. Shiva made a pointed comment regarding such people: &ldquo;Yes, these people no doubt have human bodies, but in their thoughts and behaviour they are not sa&#x301;dhu, not honest. Though I accept their mothers as humans, they themselves are donkeys, donkeys born out of human wombs.&rdquo; A true sa&#x301;dhu is a real spiritualist, a spiritually-evolved person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->You may wonder why Shiva has used such strong language. Being as vehemently opposed to injustice as Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was, Shiva was the prototype of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. When one has to speak or fight against injustice, or take administrative action against it, one must not betray any weakness. One must denounce it in the strongest language, because only strong words can strike the right chord in the heart of a sinful person. This is the proper interpretation of sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Yes, Shiva was very stern in this regard. Those who preach meaningless, irrational dogmas and thereby enormously harm society, who crudify the human intellect, who do not leave any scope to think of anything other than mundane problems, who throttle the very freedom of thought, Shiva called Lokavya&#x301;mohaka&#x301;rakah. That is, &ldquo;They infect society with a form of mental disease.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The second interpretation of sa&#x301;dhu is:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->These are the interpretations of sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;na&#x301;m [&ldquo;for the protection of sa&#x301;dhus&rdquo;]. Some so-called moralists declare, &ldquo;I don&#146;t do any wrong, so I&#146;m a moralist. I do good to others, so I&#146;m surely a sa&#x301;dhu.&rdquo; To this I will reply that they are not sa&#x301;dhus. Only that person who lives in constant God-awareness deserves to be called a sa&#x301;dhu, a spirituo-moralist.  One who is not constantly absorbed in the thought of God cannot lead a moral life for any length of time &ndash; his or her morality may collapse at any moment. Perhaps one can resist the temptation to take a bribe of ten thousand rupees, but cannot resist the temptation of a million rupees. But not only will a person who is an ardent devotee of the Lord resist the temptation of a million rupees; if you offer that person the emperorship of the universe, the person will say, &ldquo;No, the total worth of all this is far, far less than that of the Lord. I am not prepared to accept all these worthless things in exchange for Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->You now understand that by merely smearing ashes on one&#146;s body one does not qualify to be a sa&#x301;dhu. In fact, one should keep such sa&#x301;dhus at arm&#146;s length, because if they cover their bodies with ashes to hide the filth deep within themselves, it means that a lot of such filth must have accumulated. One must be wary of them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Tra&#x301;n&#x301;a means temporary relief from distress. Suppose there has been a great calamity such as a flood or famine which has inflicted immense suffering on the victims. The measures you take to alleviate the suffering of those in distress are called tra&#x301;n&#x301;a vyavastha&#x301; [relief activities]. For instance, you may visit an afflicted area and distribute ten thousand maunds [about forty thousand kilos] of flour among the people. You have done very commendable tra&#x301;n&#x301;a, but how long will that flour last? Ten or twenty years? No, your stock will be exhausted within a week and again the necessity to start a relief operations will arise. This is tra&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a gave a permanent assurance to righteous people that He would protect them.

<a name="17..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of yuga [sandhi]? Between any two epochs there is a transitional period. For instance, in history there was the Elizabethan Age, there was the Victorian Age, etc. One epoch is followed by another, in the psychic world as well as in the physical world. Suppose a society is moving in a particular direction with a certain philosophy: suddenly it receives a jolt from somewhere and stops, not knowing which way to go. Confused, it begins moving again in another direction. The transitional point between the two flows is called yuga sandhi. And each one of the particular flows of a society is known as an &ldquo;epoch&rdquo; in English, yuga in Sanskrit. One particular epoch ends and a new one follows. One set of ideas and values ends and a new set begins. At the transitional point, human beings become confused: they lose the ability to discriminate between dharma and adharma, what they should and what they should not do. At that moment, the advent of a great personality becomes an imperative necessity. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi came only to teach people what dharma is and what adharma is, what to do and what not to do, and which path would bring the highest fulfilment in their lives. He arrived at the right time, the transitional period in history; so He said, Sambhava&#x301;mi yuge yuge [&ldquo;I incarnate Myself from age to age&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>

So Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;u cannot be compared with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is the very symbol of infinite life-force. He wants to take all with Him. He is the nearest and dearest of all. No one is insignificant, no one is negligible. He belongs to one and all.

Before we begin to analyse the topic at some length, one should form a very clear idea of what dvaetava&#x301;da is. This analysis should cover the entire period of history, from the prehistoric dawn to the historic age, and should include the science of Sanskrit phonetics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Language develops as a result of adjustment between mental vibrations and the external vibrations of the manifested world. Changes occur in the external conditions of the world, but mental vibrations do not undergo much change.

<a name="18..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Take for example the colour red. The colour is there in the external world.

<a name="18..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->All vibrations, all kinds of dance, produce sound. One sees the colour red in the external world. When that colour comes and strikes the eyes of a person of a particular area, of a particular natural environment, its vibration strikes the optical nerve, and thence the impact of the vibration falls on the ma&#x301;nasadeha [mental body]; and the mind then vibrates &ndash; but not only according to the ocular vibration, rather according to the sound vibration as well. When the mind dances on seeing the colour red, a sound vibration arises in the mind &ndash; t&#x301;ak, t&#x301;ak, t&#x301;ak, t&#x301;ak.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> That is why we say t&#x301;akt&#x301;ake la&#x301;l [scarlet red] in Bengali. Similarly, on seeing a white object, the mental sound vibration dhab, dhab, dhab occurs. Hence the Bengali expression dhabdhabe sa&#x301;da&#x301; [sparkling white].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->From that dhab sound, that acoustic expression of the inner mind, a root verb came into being in Sanskrit, and from that root dhava, with the addition of the verb la&#x301; and the suffix d&#x301;a, the word dhavala [white] was formed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In pure Hindi, dhavala has become dhaola&#x301;; in Bengali, dhala&#x301;; and in Oriya, dhar&#x301;a&#x301;. This is the way in which words are formed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When the mind moves in one direction, flowing towards a particular point, then the numerical concept regarding that point is termed eka [one]. Eka is common to all people, literate or illiterate, white or black. When all the ideas in the mind flow in a particular line and culminate at a particular point, then the numerical expression concerning that particular point is &ldquo;one&rdquo;. In the very ancient Sanskrit of the Vedic age a finger was also called eka; two fingers were called dvi [two]. In old Latin it is dui, in later Latin tui, from which the English word &ldquo;twin&rdquo; has come. In the Austric language group there was no such word as &ldquo;one&rdquo; or &ldquo;two&rdquo;. To demonstrate &ldquo;one&rdquo; they used to show one finger, and &ldquo;two&rdquo; would be two fingers; to indicate &ldquo;five&rdquo; they would show the whole hand. (The Persian equivalent of &ldquo;five&rdquo; is painj. The land where five rivers flow is &ldquo;Pain&#x32D;ja&#x301;b&rdquo; [Punjab]. The hand is called pain&#x32D;ja&#x301; because it has five fingers.) To demonstrate &ldquo;ten&rdquo; in the Austric languages the people used to show two hands; in the case of &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo;, two hands and a foot; and in the case of &ldquo;twenty&rdquo;, two hands and two feet. The ancient Austric word for the human body was kur, so the number represented by the human body possessing two hands and two feet became kuri, from which the modern Bengali word kur&#x301;i is derived. Even today in some systems of counting, &ldquo;twenty&rdquo; is the highest number. That is why people say ek kur&#x301;i [&ldquo;one twenty&rdquo;], du kur&#x301;i [&ldquo;two twenties&rdquo;], tin kur&#x301;i [&ldquo;three twenties&rdquo;], and so on, when bargaining in the market.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the primary stage of civilization, people were only a little conscious of themselves and totally unconscious about other things. Later, when language emerged, when old Sanskrit and old Latin were widespread, people began to understand more about their existence. They realized, &ldquo;I exist, and there must be a Creator, the Creator of all the things around me in the universe, who must also be watching me.&rdquo; These were the ideas that dawned upon the human mind. The primitive people thought, &ldquo;There exists one &lsquo;I&rsquo;, and there also exists one entity who is guiding all entities. So there are two&rdquo; &ndash; whether &ldquo;two fingers&rdquo; or dui or dvi or dua, etc. The notion that there are two entities was termed &ldquo;dualism&rdquo; in Latin, dvaetava&#x301;da in Sanskrit. There may or may not be more entities, but there are certainly two &ndash; I and my Lord. In the initial stage of philosophy only dualism existed. Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy, which I have already discussed, is also dualism, because it is based on the notion that there is one Prakrti and many purus&#x301;as. This is the main contention of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. So Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya is also dualism. But in this school Purus&#x301;a is not established in His full authority. It makes little difference whether He exists or not. But anyway, Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya was covered fairly well earlier.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now let us see how the world is viewed in the light of dvaetava&#x301;da. All unit beings realize that they exist. This does not require much effort: even an illiterate person is aware that he or she exists. If you ask a rustic fellow, &ldquo;Hello, how are you?&rdquo; he will reply &ldquo;I am fine, thank you.&rdquo; That is, he knows that he exists. No one needs to be taught this. Everyone takes it for granted that they exist. If a great scholar of Vishuddha Advaetava&#x301;da attempts to explain to the same fellow that he does not exist, the rustic will most probably reply, &ldquo;What nonsense! You&#146;re talking to me and yet telling me that I don&#146;t exist? Then who are you talking to?&rdquo; Confusing ideas like this were propounded for many centuries. In the initial stage of philosophy people believed that there existed only the unit beings and their Lord. They could not understand the intricacies of philosophical queries. Philosophy had not yet come into being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As far as human history can say, Maharshi Kapila was the propounder of the world&#146;s first school of philosophy, Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy. As a result he was known as a&#x301;dividva&#x301;n [the first scholar]. The people of that age did not possess an intellect subtle enough to probe deeply into things. Thus it would not be proper to find fault with them or condemn them in harsh language. They simply started moving towards Parama Purus&#x301;a without possessing any philosophical knowledge about Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The extent of their belief was that one Entity is the cause of the universe and the one overseeing its smooth unfoldment. Their inner feeling was, &ldquo;I must move towards the Master, the Supreme Cause, who remains behind the curtain directing the entire performance. Whether I understand more than this or not makes no difference.&rdquo; Dualistic philosophy is based on this inner understanding. No one has yet cared to analyse dualism in detail. The general tendency of dualism is to take it for granted that there are two entities, the devotee and the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo; concept is recognized by dualistic philosophy also. Therein it is said that the existential point of one&#146;s jiiva bha&#x301;va [microcosmic bearing], that is, one&#146;s &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness concentrated at a particular point, is Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; bha&#x301;va. And the main nucleus of the vast entity who is guiding the universe is also a point. This point (the Supreme Controlling Nucleus) is the Abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a of the first point (the unit being), and the first point (the unit being) is the is&#x301;t&#x301;a of this point (the Supreme Controlling Nucleus). Is&#x301;t&#x301;a and Abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a mean almost the same thing; abhi means &ldquo;all-pervasive&rdquo;, therefore the Abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a is the all-pervasive Is&#x301;t&#x301;a [Goal].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18..14"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->[Hari resides in both land and water. He is the wind and the fire. He exists in the stars, the planets and the sun. The three worlds are permeated by Him.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->When one conceives one&#146;s is&#x301;t&#x301;a in this way, it is then called one&#146;s A&#x301;bhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a. The microcosm, in the form of a point, moves towards the nuclear point of Parama Purus&#x301;a, with or without philosophical understanding of what it is doing. Where does this movement terminate? And what does it mean to say that the microcosm is a point? A point, as we know, has position but no magnitude. Unit beings have an individual existence or &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. &ldquo;I am well-read, fabulously rich, and enjoy name, fame and prestige. I buy people with one hand and sell them with the other.&rdquo; This is how people brag and boast about themselves. But their vain words merely revolve around a point having position but no magnitude, just like the point at the end of a pencil. Parama Purus&#x301;a, however, is abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a, all-pervasive, self-illuminating. Whatever we can imagine and whatever we cannot imagine is Parama Purus&#x301;a. But the universal nucleus which controls the omnipresence of Parama Purus&#x301;a is also a point having position but no magnitude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The jiiva bha&#x301;va, when reduced to a point, is called Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. That is, Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; represents the existential feeling of the microcosm. The microcosmic nucleus moves towards the Macrocosmic Nucleus not through knowledge or action, but through devotion. So why do people bother to cultivate knowledge or action? They do so to make their devotion more intense, not for any other reason. People do not eat pickles to fill the stomach, but only to whet their appetite so that they can enjoy their food more. Similarly, devotees cultivate knowledge and action not for their physical growth, but to acquire more strength to move along the path of devotion with greater acceleration. This movement towards Parama Purus&#x301;a is devotion, and the attainment is also devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->People advance towards Parama Purus&#x301;a by virtue of their devotion &ndash; the microcosmic point advances towards the nuclear point of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The closer it gets, the more it realizes the proximity of the Macrocosmic Nucleus and the more change occurs in the nature of the point. Suppose a drop of water is advancing towards the sun. The more it advances, the more it gets converted into vapour, and when it attains the closest proximity to the sun, it becomes simply a round ball of fire. Or still better to take the case of a piece of iron. When it is quite close to the sun it loses its solidity and is converted into molten iron. When it moves even closer, it changes from molten iron into vapourized iron, gaseous iron. And when it reaches its closest proximity to the sun it becomes one with the sun, turning into a round ball of fire. Its identity separate from the sun can no longer be found even if one beats one&#146;s head against the wall trying.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Thus in the process of movement the more the microcosmic point advances towards the Macrocosmic point, the more it imbibes the qualities of the Macrocosm. In the beginning the microcosmic point possess only microcosmic qualities. It is only a sa&#x301;dhaka, only a Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. One who does a&#x301;ra&#x301;dhana&#x301; or constant Cosmic ideation is called &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;. The more a sa&#x301;dhaka advances, the more his or her qualities change. When in the process one comes into close proximity with the Macrocosmic nucleus,  one loses one&#146;s original qualities and acquires the qualities of the object of ideation. Ma&#x301;dhava Ma&#x301;dhava anukhana sunri Sundarii Ma&#x301;dhava bhelii [&ldquo;Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; (Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;) while constantly remembering Ma&#x301;dhava (Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;) became Ma&#x301;dhava Himself&rdquo;]. Vidyapati says that while thinking of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; was so radically changed inwardly that her entire mind become transformed into Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. When the microcosmic point comes in close proximity to the Macrocosmic nucleus there can no longer remain two points &ndash; they merge into one. The jiiva merges with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Thus ultimately there can be no duality &ndash; it simply cannot survive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There are many who argue, &ldquo;I exist and my Lord also exists. I don&#146;t want to merge with my Lord, but prefer to remain near Him and enjoy His bliss.&rdquo; They say,<!-- /block --></p>

I will feel waves of joy on listening to stories about Him.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Dualists make a serious and dangerous mistake. If one remains close to Him for a long time, one&#146;s individual existence is bound to be lost &ndash; the unit being will become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a whether it likes it or not. When you have a strong desire to eat sugar, your mind becomes associated with the sugar. You are so determined to enjoy the sweet taste that if someone speaks to you, you do not reply. You are not even concerned about the colour of the sugar: your mind is focused only on eating it. As all your psychic energy and psychic propensities rush towards a single entity, you succeed in tasting it. Even then, two entities are present &ndash; yourself and the taste of sugar. But when you swallow it there are no longer two entities &ndash; the two become one. Similarly, when one moves towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, accepting Him as one&#146;s sugar, one loses one&#146;s existence and becomes one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->1 + 1 = 2. This is the first stage. 1 + 1 = 1. This is the second stage. 1 + 1 = &ldquo;What? I do not know.&rdquo; This is the final stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Some devotees are dualists out of ignorance and say, &ldquo;O Lord, You are sandalwood and I am water.&rdquo; (Unless sandalwood is put into water it does not give off a strong scent.) It is a wonderful image. The jiiva bha&#x301;va is concentrated in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra, and Shiva or Parama Purus&#x301;a resides in the controlling point of the pineal gland. Now if we compare Parama Purus&#x301;a to a condensed form of sandalwood paste and the jiiva bha&#x301;va at the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra to water, then the more the water flows towards the sandalwood through the sus&#x301;umna&#x301; canal, the more it imbibes the qualities of the sandalwood, thereby losing its original characteristics. When in this process it reaches the controlling point of the pineal gland it completely loses its original characteristics and assumes those of the sandalwood. Then there remains only one entity: the sandalwood. The water is absorbed into the sandalwood and lost forever. When, in the process of making itself more pure and holy than the sandalwood, it comes close to the sandalwood, first you will see that it will become like the sandalwood. Then, when it comes still closer, you will see that it has become simply sandalwood. Then you will see that it and the sandalwood have become one. Similarly, when the jiiva bha&#x301;va approaches close to the Lord, it is no longer &ldquo;You exist, O Lord, and I also exist,&rdquo; but &ldquo;You exist, O Lord, only You exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Thus in the final stage of spiritual elevation dualism cannot survive. Even if someone says that he or she loves to eat sugar, still dualism cannot survive. That is why one should never think, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is so vast and I am only an ordinary human being.&rdquo; This is almost blasphemy. A drop of water in the ocean is small, no doubt, but it resides within the depths of the mighty ocean. Similarly, a human being may be but an ordinary mortal, but he or she has the capacity to become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. When one draws close to Parama Purus&#x301;a, one merges in Him whether one likes it or not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is that sort of nucleus, attracting all to Himself. He casts a loving smile at His devotees and says, &ldquo;Come to Me, don&#146;t stay away. Why are you hiding? Come, come to Me.&rdquo; The more jiivas advance towards Him, the more they feel the greatness of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and the more their lives and minds become enveloped by His greatness. When sa&#x301;dhakas reach the saha&#x301;sra&#x301;ra cakra, this close association is converted into absorption, and they are no longer able to maintain their separate existence. In this universe Parama Purus&#x301;a is one, not two. When the jiivas come to Him they cannot remain many, but become one. That is why those who are true devotees, the genuine yogis, the real practitioners of yoga, are bound in love and fellowship to one another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->I also trust and believe that whatever Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi wanted to do and whatever Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a desired, sa&#x301;dhakas will certainly accomplish in close collaboration with Him. You will bring about a radical change in the social order so that each individual can find ample scope for physical, mental and spiritual evolution. Remove the sorrow and suffering of exploited humanity; wipe the tears from their eyes. Build an ideal human society based on dharma. Let this be the sole mission of your life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Now let us analyse whether the actions and observations of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king, have any relation to dvaetava&#x301;da. In my previous discourse I thoroughly analysed the concept of dvaetava&#x301;da. Generally there are three ways to ascertain the views of great personalities: first, by what they said; secondly, by what they did, even though they may not have said anything; and thirdly, even though they may not have said or done anything, by what they did not say &ndash; one way or the other &ndash; on a particular issue. In analysing Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of the dvaetava&#x301;da, we should first find out what he has said in this regard. He once said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->According to Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, the highest dharma in human life is to take shelter in the Supreme. In Sanskrit there are many near synonyms for the verb cal (to move): car, at&#x301;, vraja, etc. Calati means &ldquo;to move in a natural way&rdquo;; carati means &ldquo;to move while eating&rdquo;; at&#x301;ati means &ldquo;to travel while learning something&rdquo; (paryat&#x301;aka, derived from the prefix pari + the root verb at&#x301;, means &ldquo;a world traveller who moves from place to place in search of knowledge&rdquo;). The verb vrajati means &ldquo;to move while enjoying spiritual bliss&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Here Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says Sarvadharma&#x301;n parityajya [&ldquo;Set aside all other dharmas&rdquo;]. What is the meaning of dharma? It means &ldquo;property&rdquo; or &ldquo;characteristic&rdquo;. Jiivas maintain their existence through the expression of their inner characteristics in different spheres of creation. Every object in the universe has its own inherent characteristic: the characteristic of water is to make things wet, and that of fire is to burn. Centring around this fundamental characteristic, there are many secondary characteristics. For example, fire burns, but it does not burn the entirety of an object in the same way. It may burn one part of an object thoroughly and another part only partially. These different stages of burning are the secondary characteristics of the primary characteristic of fire, to burn. Water also has a number of secondary characteristics, and the collection of all these secondary characteristics is known as its dharma. To illustrate, when people eat, they do not mix all their food together and gulp it down voraciously, but follow a system of eating. For example, they may first eat bitter items, then semi-bitter ones, then sour ones, and finally sweet things. Sweets come at the end. The entire action of taking different items of food is called eating.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->All dharmas have upadharmas [secondary characteristics]. Human life is no exception. For example, to provide for your family you require some sort of employment &ndash; be it agriculture, trading or business &ndash; you have to keep the house clean, feed everyone, and so on. These are the secondary characteristics included within the fundamental human dharma. What normally happens in human life? People get caught up in the secondary characteristics. For instance, when eating delicious food people often say &ldquo;How good it tastes! But if it only had a bit more spice in it, then it would taste even better.&rdquo; Being engrossed in the secondary dharma, people all too easily deviate from their main dharma. In ancient India, the usual custom was to offer a part of one&#146;s meal to God before eating it. The spirit was, &ldquo;May I remember You with every bit of food.&rdquo; In Ananda Marga there is a system of applying guru mantra before commencing any action. The psycho-philosophy behind guru mantra is to transform the secondary dharma into the primary dharma at the psychic level. If this were not done then one&#146;s secondary dharma would predominate. Much precious time is wasted by those who follow their secondary dharmas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a exhorted the people unambiguously: &ldquo;Give up secondary dharmas and accept Me as your supreme goal. Do not let your mind be diverted to those countless secondary dharmas, but concentrate it on the fundamental primary dharma. Only then will every moment of your life be properly utilized.&rdquo; Now, what is this primary dharma? Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi declared, Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja [&ldquo;take shelter in Me alone&rdquo;]. Earlier I said that vraja means to move with Cosmic ideation in a state of bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The movement of human beings in this universe is not movement for movement&#146;s sake, but is comparable to a vraja parikrama&#x301; [joyous pilgrimage]. No one moves even one step without any purpose. What does vraja parikrama&#x301; signify? We all know that just as the historical Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a lived in the Vrindavana of this world, our spiritual Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a lives in the Vrindavana of our heart. He is the nucleus around which individuals move. That is why Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja. Do not run after name, power, position or wealth. Try to become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->I have already said that when the jiiva tattva or Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; tattva comes within Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s closest proximity, two separate entities cannot remain &ndash; they will fuse and become one. Then what is the meaning of ekam [one]? When all the propensities of your psychic body coincide at one point, then those pointed propensities are called ekam. Whenever we talk of something in terms of ekam it implies that all propensities have become one-pointed. &ldquo;1&rdquo; is a numeral &ndash; the first, the greatest and the smallest numeral. It is the smallest because there is no numeral smaller than &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The only thing smaller than one is zero, but that is something which has no existence. And it is the greatest numeral, because when One is accepted as the goal of life, it becomes the most significant numeral for all human existence. In the absence of primary dharma, all secondary dharmas such as eating, drinking, walking and talking are meaningless &ndash; they have no real existence. Similarly, a zero without a preceding digit has no value. But when &ldquo;1&rdquo; precedes zero the latter acquires some significance. When zero joins with &ldquo;1&rdquo; it becomes ten. In the same way, when you first follow your fundamental dharma and then carry out your worldly duties, upadharmas, accordingly life carries some value. If the main dharma, that is, the supreme One, is forgotten, then no amount of worldly duty can make one&#146;s life glorious. When One (1) is absent, then the addition of any number of zeros carries no value.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In the couplet the name of Rama is symbolized by the number one and the microcosmic endeavour is symbolized by zero.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->So when we add a zero to &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the value is increased ten times, although zero has no value of its own; it only acquires a certain value when it exists beside the numeral &ldquo;1&rdquo;. Therefore Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja &ndash; &ldquo;Know Me as the Supreme One and seek shelter in Me.&rdquo; When the microcosmic point merges with the Macrocosmic point, then two entities no longer exist &ndash; there is only one entity. From Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s statement we understand that He is not a dualist in essence. He wants to accept all as His own, to absorb all in Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Why does he say vraja and not cala or gaccha [near synonyms]? Because when you move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, you move in joy. As this movement of yours is a blissful one, it is called vraja parikrama&#x301;. &ldquo;When you are totally absorbed in the Supreme while discharging your worldly duties, you will surely come to Me. When your life revolves around the Supreme, your every action will shine with divine effulgence.&rdquo; Thus said Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to His disciples.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The second part of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s statement, aham&#x301; tva&#x301;m&#x301; sarvapa&#x301;pebhyo moks&#x301;ayis&#x301;ya&#x301;mi ma&#x301;shucah [&ldquo;I will save you from all sin, have no fear about that&rdquo;], is much clearer and more direct. How should we distinguish between pun&#x301;ya [virtue] and pa&#x301;pa [vice]? Pa&#x301;pa has been used in the Sanskrit shloka. Pa&#x301;pa means &ldquo;to do that which should not be done&rdquo;. For instance, stealing is pa&#x301;pa, telling lies is pa&#x301;pa. In addition to pa&#x301;pa, there is another word &ndash; pratyava&#x301;ya. Pratyava&#x301;ya means &ldquo;not to do what should be done&rdquo;. For instance, parents should educate their children. If they do not, they are said to have committed pratyava&#x301;ya. In some countries, parents are responsible for arranging the marriage of their daughters who are of suitable age . If they do not, they are said to have committed pratyava&#x301;ya. In common parlance, pa&#x301;pa means both pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya. The common word pa&#x301;taka [sin] thus has two branches &ndash; pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->We should remember one more thing here. Microcosms, as they move through various kinds of physical and psycho-physical clash on the path of pratisain&#x32D;cara, are assailed by pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya. This leaves an imprint on their minds. This imprint is not the mind&#146;s true nature but merely an external covering. If one chews betel, then one&#146;s lips become reddish temporarily, but when washes one&#146;s lips afterwards the red colour disappears. Similarly, when human beings fall into pa&#x301;pa or pratyava&#x301;ya through their bad actions or their inaction, an impression is left upon their minds. But later, when they draw close to Parama Purus&#x301;a by virtue of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, that impression of pa&#x301;pa or pratyava&#x301;ya disappears.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Some people think that since they have become so sinful, there is no hope for them in the future. A great devotee of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Subuddhi Roy, thought that he had committed many sins in his life.

Go deep into your mind.&rdquo; Even though the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; may be assailed by bad deeds, its original nature is never distorted; it only gets a little soiled, a bit covered. In that state the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; is called pa&#x301;popahata caetanya [consciousness assailed by sin]. And when influenced by good deeds, it is called pun&#x301;yopahata caetanya [consciousness affected by virtue]. Actually the words pa&#x301;pa&#x301;tma&#x301; and pun&#x301;ya&#x301;tma&#x301; [soul affected by sin or by virtue] are both incorrect. The soul never commits a sin, it never becomes sinful, nor does it ever become virtuous. It remains deathless and undecaying in its original state. But it does receive an impression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->What is this impression like? Suppose you place a large red rose in front of a clear mirror. If you look at the mirror, what do you see? A red rose. From a distance, one may say that the mirror is red, but is it actually so? No, the mirror is not red, but only appears to be red, coloured by the reflection of the red rose. In the same way, the human soul is also apparently coloured by virtue or vice. Whenever the soul comes in contact with any action, any psychic thought-wave, or any mental feeling, it is apparently affected, but not actually affected, just as the mirror is not actually coloured red. This is how this pa&#x301;popahata caetanya and pun&#x301;yopahata caetanya are created, due to the effect of sinful or virtuous deeds and thoughts.<!-- /block --></p>

The colours of worldly deeds, good or bad, cannot affect Parama Purus&#x301;a. In Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s proximity there remains only His reflection. When reflected images, merge into the original substance the images cease to exist. Likewise, when the reflected images of jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;s merge with Parama Purus&#x301;a, there remains only one, only Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is why He says, &ldquo;Accept Me alone, not My reflections, and I will liberate you from all sins. Do not worry.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

It is the statement of an advaetava&#x301;di [non-dualist] who admits the relative existence of the jiivas in the initial stage, and in the final stage assimilates them into His vast Cosmic body. This great assurance given by Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi to the jiivas is invaluable: something beyond human description. Herein lies the greatest charm, the greatest attraction, of the personality of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. It is totally pointless to analyse Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi in the light of dvaetava&#x301;da. He was never a dvaetava&#x301;dii.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="20..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da (dualistic non-dualism) first there is dvaeta and then there is advaeta. (The words are conjoined according to the principle of supsupeti sama&#x301;sa in Sanskrit grammar.) That is, what was dualism in the initial stage is transformed into non-dualism at a later stage. This being so, I will discuss how Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;as activities and behaviour are consistent with or different from dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da. Because in this regard, what He did in the practical field is far more significant than what He said.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->According to dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da, in the initial stage jiivas are different from Parama Purus&#x301;a, thinking themselves to be separate entities (and in fact they are); but in the final stage, by virtue of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the irresistible attraction of the Great, and the unconditional grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, they come into close proximity with Parama Purus&#x301;a and become one with Him. In the beginning they were two, but in the end they become one. When sugar and sand are mixed together they still maintain their separate identities; they are said to be united but not unified. But when sugar and water are mixed together they become syrup, thus losing their separate identities. In this case they have not been united but unified: two entities have been fused into one. In dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da, the jiiva and Parama Purus&#x301;a become one after unification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Some people may raise the question whether this unification is like that of sugar and sand or like that of sugar and water. It is a pertinent question, and although a complicated one philosophically, can be answered in a simple way. The original propounders of this doctrine did not advance any easy analogy like the one of sugar and water and sugar and sand. Had they done so it would have landed them in great difficulty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is a certain doctrine which contends that the merger of jiiva and Parama Purus&#x301;a is like a mixture of sugar and sand; for they become one but not exactly the same. This sort of philosophical doctrine is known as acintya bheda&#x301;bhedava&#x301;da. According to its propounders, it is beyond human comprehension to know what sort of unification takes place. Other doctrines claim that the two become completely unified just like sugar and water. We can call these two analogies as sharkara&#x301;-ba&#x301;luka [sugar and sand] and sharkara&#x301;-jalam [sugar and water]. Sometimes very complex ideas can be easily understood with the help of simple analogies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The concept of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a involves the question of dualism in the beginning and non-dualism in the end. Is merger in Him like sugar and sand or like sugar and water? Actually, before asking this question a much more significant question should be asked: if jiivas are dualists in the beginning and non-dualists in the end, where did they originate from? Some people say that Parama Purus&#x301;a picked up a handful of dust and scattered it around, and thus the world was created. I am not at all persuaded by this simplistic metaphysical proposition. My question to them is: Where did Parama Purus&#x301;a acquire that handful of dust? In dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da the question of the jiivas&#146; origin remains unanswered. This is one of its basic flaws.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;sato vidyate bha&#x301;vo na&#x301;bha&#x301;vo vidyate satah &ndash; &ldquo;Something cannot come out of nothing. Again, something or other comes out of something: that is, something comes out of something and nothing comes out of nothing.&rdquo; The jiiva is an entity and, as I have said earlier, an entity whose existence cannot be altogether denied. No matter how much we deny the existence of the world, we cannot make it non-existent. Jagadapi satyam a&#x301;peks&#x301;ikam &ndash; &ldquo;The world is a relative truth,&rdquo; and thus your physical body which exists in this relative world is also a relative truth. To exist in this relative world one requires food, clothing, shelter, education, medical treatment and other necessities of life. One cannot completely ignore these basic necessities. Ironically, those exponents of philosophy who have declared that this world is mere illusion or Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; have constructed various temples and monasteries in different parts of India. If the world is nothing but Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; then where is the necessity of all these temples and monasteries? There are clear contradictions between what such people preach and what they practise. Intelligent people, honest people, would never say anything self-contradictory. So the fundamental mistake of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da is that it is mysteriously silent about the origin of the jiivas. Ramprasad, a famous mystic poet of Bengal, has given a beautiful answer to this question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Prasa&#x301;d bale &ndash; ya&#x301; chili bha&#x301;i ta&#x301;i habi re nidenka&#x301;le;<br>Yeman jaler vimba jalei uday, jal haye se misha&#x301;y jale.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..8"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[Prasad says that you will be the same in the end as you were in the beginning. Just as a water bubble arises from water and the next moment dissolves back into the water, similarly the jiiva comes out of Parama Purus&#x301;a and ultimately returns to Parama Purus&#x301;a.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This is a deep philosophical idea expressed in very simple and lucid language. It is interesting to note that although the propounders of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da do not mention where the jiivas come from, they do inform us that they merge into Parama Purus&#x301;a. I cannot understand why they avoid the question of the origin of the jiivas. I am in favour of saying things in clear, concise and conclusive terms. Frankly speaking, I dislike this sort of hush-hush mentality. It implies that there are some defects somewhere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->One thing more has to be said in this regard. Although the jiivas are apparently small entities, they are part of the Infinite and as such have an element of infinity within. Their expressions and movements are not strictly limited to their physical existence. Regarding the divine nature of the jiivas, Rabindranath Tagore has said in one of his poems:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;mi ye ru&#x301;per padme karechi aru&#x301;p madhu pa&#x301;n,<br>Duhkher vaks&#x301;er ma&#x301;jhe a&#x301;nander peyechi sandha&#x301;n.<br>Ananta maner va&#x301;n&#x301;ii shunechi antare<br>Dekhechi jyotir path shu&#x301;nyamay a&#x301;ndhar&#x301; pra&#x301;ntare,<br>Nahi a&#x301;mi vidhir brhat pariha&#x301;s<br>Asiim aeshvarya diye racita mahat sarvana&#x301;sh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[From the lotus of beauteous forms I have drunk the nectar of<br>the formless,<br>In the depths of misery I have discovered infinite bliss.<br>I have listened to the message of the infinite silence,<br>I have seen the path of effulgence in the dark endless void.<br>Although a mere microcosm I am not just a joke of Providence<br>Surrounded by limitless Macrocosmic wealth, yet ending in the<br>Great Annihilation.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It is not proper to remain silent about the source of this endless microcosmic expression. Neither is it proper to remain ambiguous about the jiivas&#146; final destination. One cannot escape these realities by resorting to philosophical rigmarole. It would be a great blunder to underestimate the immense potential lying latent within the jiivas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->I have already said that to say that all jiivas have come out of nothing is incorrect, as something cannot come out of nothing, nor indeed can nothing come out of something. Something which exists will continue to exist, though undergoing metamorphosis. Similarly, that which  does not really exist can never have an expression. All of you feel that you are carrying some life-force in you, the warmth of life. You feel that you have a mind, and so many feelings and sentiments, hopes and aspirations, pains and pleasures &ndash; so many susceptibilities and sensibilities. If someone denies this, will you accept it? Certainly not. These are not burdens, but the bliss of joyful living. You are voluntarily carrying these burdens because they give you joy. It is a major point and it is left unanswered in dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da. The value of humanity goes unrecognized in this philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Next comes the question of advaeta. Advaeta is the logical conclusion of dvaeta. The entity which has been flowing from the infinite void to the infinite void can never terminate in a state of crudity. It is bound to merge in Parama Purus&#x301;a, the embodiment of bliss &ndash; there can be no other imaginable destination. Thus the jiiva and Shiva cannot maintain their separate existences, as sugar and sand do, but will become unified like sugar and water. An ordinary jiiva can become extraordinary by virtue of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, karma [selfless action], intellect and benevolence. When such highly-evolved individuals merge with Parama Purus&#x301;a, they render the Macrocosmic existence even more meaningful and significant. A small drop of the essence of the screw-pine flower can add scent to a hundred drops of water. The absorption of these evolved jiivas into Parama Purus&#x301;a adds to the charm of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus the unification of the jiiva with Parama Purus&#x301;a is not like that of sugar and sand, but sugar and water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now, let us analyse the life and personality of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in His infancy. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was born in Kansa&#146;s prison on a night shaken with heavy rains and fearsome thunderclaps, signifying the providential decree that the forces of wickedness represented by Kansa would be struck down. It was a part of the divine strategy to eliminate the tyrannical Kansa. How else could one account for the fact that one of Kansa&#146;s intelligence agents opened the jail gates? And that the people of Gokula fell asleep, thus facilitating the safe escape of the baby Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? At least some people should have remained awake &ndash; but in that case, the historic exchange of children would not have taken place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->These small incidents in the life of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a are the precursors of a major event that was yet to come. Why did the child Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a kill Putana? She was a member of the intelligence department. Female employees of the intelligence branch were called vis&#x301;a kanya&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.20.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#20.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> because they were required to carry a ring containing a small amount of poison. If caught by the enemy, they were supposed to commit suicide, as there was a strong possibility that they might divulge many secrets under torture. Putana was one such female intelligence agent employed by Kansa, king of Mathura. Vakasura and Aghasura were both gahapurus&#x301;as, male agents. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had no intention to go to Vakasura and Aghasura  and kill them; His humanitarian feelings forbade this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Putana had only become Kansa&#146;s intelligence agent as a means of livelihood. She certainly did not adopt this profession out of love for Kansa! Aghasura and Vakasura as well had only adopted this profession as a means of livelihood. Rulers change as do the allegiances of the intelligence people. People who had sung songs of praise for one king could be later found criticizing the same king and eulogizing the new one. Obviously they had no ideology of their own. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not plan to go to them and kill them, but He was obliged to strike back in self-defense when they made an attempt on His life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->He could easily have killed Pu&#x301;tana&#x301; Ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.20.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#20.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> with his dagger or strangled her, but He did not. Putana attempted to suckle Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a after applying poison to her breast, but Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a bit her breast sharply, and the poison got into her bloodstream, and she died. Even while killing her, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a showed great human consideration. Killing her was a last resort &ndash; had he sucked milk from her breast, He would have swallowed the poison, so He bit her instead in self-defense. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a showed equal consideration before killing Vakasura and Aghasura. All these events in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s life indicate that He was a great humanist. They also show that in the initial stage He recognized dvaetava&#x301;da to some extent.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.20.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#20.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Jiivas emerge from Parama Purus&#x301;a, and eventually return to His supreme beatific stance. Putana, Vakasura and Aghasura also emerged from Parama Purus&#x301;a in the same way. They were also dvaeta jiivas [dualistic beings]. Had they [as dualistic beings] practised sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, they would certainly have merged with Parama Purus&#x301;a, but instead they took a different path, the negative path &ndash; they wanted to destroy the very nucleus of the universe, Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the greatest treasure of humanity. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had to kill them as a last resort. He did not kill them for the sake of killing, but to counteract their evil tendency to destroy human solidarity. He was a fiery personality of human civilization, of human society. If people move too close to a fire without wearing adequate protection, they burn to ashes. That was the fate of those three. Had He looked upon them as mere dualistic beings, from a dualistic perspective, then He would have kept them away, but that He did not do. He did not want to treat any human being as a mere dualist would have.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->At a later stage of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s life, we notice that His devotees were not well-versed in classical lore, did not have a deep knowledge of Sanskrit, and did not possess high academic qualifications. However, they had one rare quality &ndash; their dvaeta satta&#x301; [dualistic existence], the dualism that originates from Parama Purus&#x301;a. After coming in contact with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a they started to move towards advaeta; they were moving towards oneness with Him. Let us see whether their merger with Him was like a mixture of sugar and sand or sugar and water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->What does practical experience suggest? Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had identified Himself with them to such an extent that it was almost impossible to distinguish Him from them. Yet He was the nucleus, the central figure, the fiery personality, the kaosthubhaman&#x301;i [the jewel of jewels], having its place of honour at the centre of the ornament. How does this spirit of dualism survive? It survives as long as there remains more than one mental object. If you take the entire universe as your object and not any finite mundane thing, you will become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a in that very instant. However, if you accept something small as your object, then individuality asserts itself and you feel that you are Tom, Dick or Harry. It is due to mental objects that bondage occurs in the human mind, and it these bondages which create the feeling of dualism and keep the individual separated from Parama Purus&#x301;a. Mental objects vary from person to person &ndash; one&#146;s mental object may be very expansive, leading him or her towards Parama Purus&#x301;a; another&#146;s may be very limiting, taking him or her away from Parama Purus&#x301;a. The person whose mental object is so vast that he or she says, &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, only You exist. You are my everything; I have nothing of my own,&rdquo; attains oneness with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Any object which creates bondage in the mind has its own particular colour. In those early days people used silver coins. While thinking of those silver coins, their minds would be coloured silver. Today, people&#146;s minds are coloured by the thought of paper currency. When someone thinks of an iron safe, one&#146;s mental object becomes the iron safe. When someone goes to the bank to deposit money, the bank&#146;s signboard becomes his or her mental object. Suppose a person has a hundred thousand rupees of black money and thinks, &ldquo;What shall I do with this black money? I know, I&#146;ll bury it for some time and then invest it in a business.&rdquo; All such things become a person&#146;s mental objects, one by one. The mind always takes something as its object, each object having its specific colour. The significance of the Dol Liila&#x301;, the Spring Festival, is to surrender all one&#146;s mental colour to Parama Purus&#x301;a, and thus free oneself from the bondage of colour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a gave due recognition to this process, saying, &ldquo;Give your mental colours to Me and become one with Me.&rdquo; What does this mean? Does this merger resemble a mixture of sugar and sand or of sugar and water? Certainly, it was like a mixture of sugar and water. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a demonstrated in His personal life that if one takes a dualistic attitude and enormously harms the collective interest, something has to be done to counteract it. Annihilation is not the goal here, but to extract the poison from the snake&#146;s fangs. Moreover it is a fact that no matter how sinful or wicked one might be, if one surrenders one&#146;s mental colour, be it black, yellow, red, etc., to Parama Purus&#x301;a by saying Tava dravyam&#x301; Govinda Tubhyameva samarpaye, Parama Purus&#x301;a immediately accepts the offering. At this point one becomes free from the bondage of colour and merges in one&#146;s true self. This is the highest stage of advaeta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->People find it difficult to correlate the thoughts and actions of Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a with the dualistic portion of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da. Jiivas have come out of the Supreme Cognitive Faculty. That Cognitive Faculty is none other than Parama Purus&#x301;a or Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, for Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is none other than Ta&#x301;raka Brahma Himself. He makes it abundantly clear that in the final stage of unification, existence becomes as sweet as sugar and water, not unpleasant or distasteful like a mixture of sugar and sand. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not want to see an unhappy ending such as that. Thus in analysing Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da philosophy, we can say that Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a did not want things to turn out like that.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi can be analysed from two points of view &ndash; the point of view of what He said, and the point of view of what He did. What He said is mentioned in the Giita&#x301;. Here I shall analyse what He did. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi gathered around Him a good number of righteous people, and together they strove tirelessly to promote human welfare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The fundamental idea of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da philosophy is that in the beginning there are two entities, while in the end there is only one. Initially the presence of two entities is admitted &ndash;  Jiiva ca tasya Iishvara, &ldquo;the sa&#x301;dhaka and the Supreme Object of his or her ideation&rdquo;. The duality of jiiva and Iishvara ends when the sa&#x301;dhaka and his or her object of ideation become one, when the devotee and the Lord are fused into one. I have already mentioned this many times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;dhakas move towards the goal &ndash; the Supreme Entity &ndash; along a difficult path strewn with thorns. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; means to carry on an endless fight against the opposing forces and ideas that thwart the spiritual progress of an individual. When sa&#x301;dhakas succeed in removing all obstacles in this process of fight they (the devotees) and the Lord finally become one. This is the spiritual path, the path of spiritual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Some devotees employ all their energy to impatiently entreat Parama Purus&#x301;a, &ldquo;O Lord, be gracious. Come to me.&rdquo; Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; implies that the devotees move towards their Lord. It may also happen that devotees address Parama Purus&#x301;a with all their psychic feeling concentrated on one point while sitting in one place. In this way, too, they can become one with the Lord. In order to become established in the state of non-dualism, devotees must practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Devotees draw Parama Purus&#x301;a towards themselves with all their sincerity, emotion and sentiment focused on Him. This way of drawing Parama Purus&#x301;a to oneself is known as bhakti ma&#x301;rga [the path of devotion].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Kiirtana<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is an integral part of bhakti ma&#x301;rga. During kiirtana devotees entreat Him, &ldquo;Come, O Lord, come to me. Come and sit amongst us, your devotees. We will love You and sing kiirtana for You; we will adore You with all the warmth of our hearts.&rdquo; This is the philosophical side of devotion. But the fundamental point is that the devotee will have to merge in the Lord. Initially it is dvaeta, because in the beginning there are two entities, the devotee and the Lord, but ultimately, when they become one, it is advaeta. That is why it is called dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da. As long as the devotees remain in the darkness of ignorance there is duality, but when their existence becomes illumined by the effulgence of divine knowledge by virtue of karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and bhakti sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, they are said to be in the state of non-dualism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a demonstrated in His own life how to become a righteous person. One must not retreat. Sometimes, as a matter of strategy, one may have to take two or three steps backwards, but in the end it may be as good as taking a hundred steps forward.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Let us take an example. Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, repeatedly attacked Mathura. To protect Mathura from his furious assaults, the capital was moved to Dwaraka. To reach Dwaraka one had to pass through the desert, and that was not possible for Jara&#x301;sandha. In this case, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a adopted the policy of strategic retreat, but in fact He was taking a hundred steps forward. It was the best way to counteract the antisocial forces of Jarasandha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This is how Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi demonstrated how to become righteous in one&#146;s personal and practical life, how to take up arms against sinful and wicked people, and how to work pragmatically. The one who constantly ideates on Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, keeping Him enshrined in the temple of his or her heart, and rushes towards Him, realizes Parama Purus&#x301;a through His grace and becomes one with Him. This is the theoretical side.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In His personal life Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi identified Himself with those who were intelligent, spiritually steady, and eager to promote the cause of human welfare. He talked with them and inspired them to a more sublime life. In this way He attracted people towards Himself in the spiritual sphere. Every human being has accepted Him as their own. As a result He remains enthroned to this day in the hearts of people, despite the long interval since His advent, just like an emerald in a jewel box. In His practical life He inspired those who came in His contact, drew them to Him, showed them the path to salvation and told them in unambiguous terms that the world was created by His Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. It shows that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is the be-all and end-all of human beings. He said, &ldquo;I am the Creator of this world. Everything has emanated from Me.&rdquo; Tantra has expressed this idea in a clear and lucid fashion:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Mayyeva sakalam&#x301; ja&#x301;tam&#x301; mayi sarvam&#x301; pratis&#x301;t&#x301;hitam;<br>Mayi sarvam&#x301; layam&#x301; ya&#x301;ti tad Brahma&#x301;dvayamasmyaham.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..11"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->[Everything is born out of Me, everything is maintained in Me; Everything finally merges in Me; I am that Brahma &ndash; One without a second. ]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..12"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Everything has come out of Me, everything is being maintained in Me and in the end everything will return to Me.&rdquo; Dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da philosophy has accepted the existence of two entities in the first stage, and thus microcosms have not been given proper recognition. Dvaeta means the existence of two entities &ndash; jiiva and Iishvara, the microcosm and the Macrocosm &ndash; but it does not explain where the jiivas originally came from. It cannot be logically accepted that the jiivas spring out of nothingness. Thus the final portion of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da is acceptable, but not its beginning. Logically something which does not contain a beginning cannot possess an end. That is why it is utterly futile to try to analyse Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the light of dvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da philosophy. He is far above it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When people experience joy or move in the flow of joy, that spirit of joyful movement is called vraja. And what is gopa&#x301;la? There are so many ta&#x301;nma&#x301;trika [inferential] expressions, and the apparent controller of all these inferential expressions is the human mind. Suppose you hear something: it is an expression related to the sound tanma&#x301;tra; suppose you touch something &ndash; touch is another tanma&#x301;tra; you see something or you think something &ndash; these are all tanma&#x301;tras. The apparent controller of all these inferential expressions is your mind. But there is another entity hidden behind your mind, not in front of your mind, but behind your mind. For instance, when you watch a puppet show, you feel delighted to see how the puppets move their hands and feet, but you do not see the person who manages the beautiful show by pulling the strings from behind. Similarly, we notice the inferential expressions of microcosms &ndash; we come to know how one person sings melodious songs, how another dances beautiful rhythmic dances, how another delivers wonderful discourses, etc. But we cannot see the entity who pulls the strings from behind and runs the show. And the funniest thing is this: the speaker, the singer, the dancer thinks that he or she is the agent, the doer, and takes the entire credit for the performance. People do not care to think of the entity that pulls the strings from behind, or if they are even more foolish, they think that others see them alone, not the entity who pulls the strings from behind, so the credit should come to them. There are people who think in this way. However, you move and dance under His control. He makes you dance from behind.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The perspective or background against which all the inferential expressions, as well as the expressions of sensory and motor organs, are perceived, is termed go in Sanskrit. And the entity that controls that go from behind is called gopa&#x301;la. So who is &ldquo;Vrajagopa&#x301;la&rdquo;? Vrajagopa&#x301;la is that Entity who takes people forward through joy, amidst various expressions of bliss. He is Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->He attracts people from a great distance to Himself and He draws them near amidst great joy. The microcosm advances towards Parama Purus&#x301;a dancing and laughing all the way. This is the style of Vrajagopa&#x301;la, this is the essential characteristic of Vrajagopa&#x301;la. While drawing unit entities towards Himself He adopts various blissful spiritual forms. Sometimes He deeply loves His devotees; sometimes He lightly scolds His devotees and then deeply loves them; sometimes He provokes interest and excites curiosity in their minds; and sometimes He infuses fear complexes in their minds. He saturates the devotees&#146; minds with different rasas [flows] and brings them nearer to Himself &ndash; that is, He attracts jiivas not through one rasa but through many rasas, because this universe is a flow of endless vibrations, and each vibration is being transformed into perpetually new forms. The troughs and crests of two vibrations may be similar but never identical, and for that reason no two entities are identical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Vrajagopa&#x301;la, who has been guiding jiivas amidst a&#x301;nandam, is the Supreme Desideratum, the summum bonum of human life. There is nothing to know or realize except Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. People try to express various ideas, but while trying to express their ideas regarding Vrajagopa&#x301;la they feel their utter incompetence. Great minds have observed, Tula&#x301; va&#x301; upama&#x301; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asya na&#x301;sti [&ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a has no comparison, no parallel&rdquo;]. Many rs&#x301;is [sages] tried to liken Him to other entities but utterly failed. When they got tired out, they said, &ldquo;There is no other entity with whom we can compare Him. His love for jiivas is unmatched. His bha&#x301;va is unparalleled. His intuition is incomparable; the depth of His knowledge has no parallel; His far-sightedness is also unparalleled. There is nothing which can be likened to Him. Oh yes, there is one thing which can be compared with Him and that is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a alone is His own comparison.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Our proposed topic of discussion is bhaktitattva. What is the cult of devotion? Each and every object in this universe is attracted to other objects. There is a mutual relationship between a very large star, a planet, or a satellite, and a small meteor or even a stone. One attracts the other and because of this mutual attraction, balance is maintained in the universe. If anyone in a weak moment thinks, &ldquo;I am a useless entity, my existence is meaningless&rdquo; &ndash; if a tiny ant thinks that its existence is of no value or if a hundred-year-old person thinks that his or her physical existence is of no value whatsoever and that as such it matters little whether he or she survives or passes away, then that person is thoroughly mistaken. Everyone&#146;s physical existence is equally valuable. The main question is how one&#146;s existence can be best utilized. There is nothing in this universe which is totally valueless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There is mutual attraction everywhere. A tiny ant attracts a large entity, and the large entity attracts the tiny ant. When in a sentimental flow of devotion a person thinks, &ldquo;I am attracting the vast universe, including Parama Purus&#x301;a, and I am also being attracted,&rdquo; this conscious feeling of mutual attraction is termed bhakti in psychological parlance. Whether literate or illiterate, young or old, one endowed with this element of devotion is said to have had a successful career, for the highest fulfilment of microcosmic existence lies in the very capacity of attracting the Great. The greatest Entity is attracting you with a mighty force. You are also attracting the greatest Entity with your limited force &ndash; you are not inferior to anyone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->You know the story of the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. During construction of a bridge, the big monkeys carried large stones while the small squirrels brought only tiny grains of sand. Is there any difference between the carrying of tiny grains of sand by the squirrels on the one hand and the carrying of a whole mountain by Hanuma&#x301;n on the other? Both are equally valuable. You may be a small entity like a squirrel, but your existence is in no way insignificant, because you have got a consummate sentimental attraction. This is a nice explanation of the cult of devotion &ndash; the best psychological explanation of devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now, my Vrajagopa&#x301;la attracts the whole universe in various ways through His inscrutable gestures, His smiles and the music of His flute &ndash; that is, through the charming sweetness of sound, touch, taste, smell and form. If someone really loves Him, he or she is bound to say, &ldquo;Ah, how nicely He speaks, how sweet is His language.&rdquo; If anyone comes in actual contact with Him, he or she says, &ldquo;How soft is His body, I have never experienced such softness.&rdquo; If anyone appreciates His physical handsomeness, he or she says, &ldquo;I have never seen such incomparable physical charm; how sweet is His smile.&rdquo; If anyone ever appreciates His blissful nature, he or she says, &ldquo;How blissful all His expressions are, it&#146;s difficult to say which expression is most charming.&rdquo; And smell? The universe is full of His scent. That&#146;s why I say that there is no second entity that is so beautiful, so pleasingly soft as my Vrajagopa&#x301;la. No other entity charms us, permeates our being so consummately, as my Vrajagopa&#x301;la. Hence if any Entity really deserves my wholehearted love and devotion, it is my Vrajagopa&#x301;la. No other entity can aspire to this most exalted position.<!-- /block --></p>

And the people actually move. Suppose we ask someone something and we then get an answer. This is a simple question. It ends here. Pariprashna is not such a question. When we ask something, receive an answer, work accordingly and finally get the result, that question is known as pariprashna.<!-- /block --></p>

Va&#x301;k usually means tongue, but here va&#x301;k represents all the sensory and motor organs and their expressions. That is, each and every action performed by the indriyas [organs] will have to be identified with the citta, and this has to be done through assimilation by means of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, because all the sensory organs are sheltered in the citta and the expressions of the sensory organs are inseparably connected with the citta. That is, citta is the reflecting plate. If you merge the expression of your vocal cords with your citta, then you will be able to do the work of the vocal cords directly with the help of your citta. Suppose someone is moving. You can forcibly stop his or her movement. Someone is speaking. You can forcibly suspend his or her speech. But it can be still better done by applying your concentrated citta after you have merged the capacity of your indriyas into citta. When their capacities are suspended the power gained is called stambhana. There are many psychic processes like this. Suppose a man is speaking very glibly. Suddenly you stop his vocal power. He will make an inarticulate sound like &ldquo;Ah &ndash; ah &ndash; ah&rdquo; and then his vocal cords will cease to function. These are not great powers, rather they are very common things, they can be done easily. You are merging the capacity of your indriyas into the capacity of your citta.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Tadyaccheccha&#x301;nta a&#x301;tmani &ndash; &ldquo;this existential &lsquo;I&rsquo; feeling should be merged into Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Entity.&rdquo; This is the progression of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In the same way, one must proceed through effect and cause and thus arrive at the final essence. The procedure is to discover the reflecting plate through the reflecting entity. The pariprashna about Parama Purus&#x301;a is exactly like this. A comes from B, where does B come from? &ndash; this is how one moves internally. Maharshi Kanada in ancient times invented his own theory and helped us to a great extent. According to him, Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;va&#x301;t ka&#x301;ryya&#x301;bha&#x301;vah &ndash; &ldquo;the effect cannot exist without its cause.&rdquo; So by proceeding through effect and cause, one ultimately arrives at the Supreme Cause.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Vrajagopa&#x301;la attracts all towards Himself &ndash; all entities in the physical, psychic and causal spheres. This proves that He wants each and everyone to come to Him. It further proves that He loves all. That is, He loves a person without bothering to find out whether the person is spotlessly clean or blemished, whether he or she is learned or a fool. Had Vrajagopa&#x301;la done that, He certainly would not have attracted everyone. The fact is that He attracts all and loves all without discrimination. This clearly indicates that Vrajagopa&#x301;la is the very life and soul of human beings, the life of their lives. Even those who do not know Vrajagopa&#x301;la still know in the heart of their hearts that He is the life of their lives. Those who criticize Vrajagopa&#x301;la know inside themselves that they are criticizing their nearest relation. The entity who draws all unto Himself cannot but be the nucleus of the universe. No other entity has the capacity to attract all. As far as other entities are concerned you may get some affection from them or maybe a little scolding, but you cannot get real love and affection. You may have noticed that others may love you in prosperity, but they will not spare time for you when adversity strikes. So there is no one besides Him who remains covert in the deepest core of one&#146;s heart, like a locket on a golden necklace. He is the nucleus of everything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->We find, then, that in the light of pariprashna He is the central figure in the universe &ndash; the nucleus. Then what is the nature of microcosmic existence according to pariprashna? Yacchedva&#x301;unmanasii pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a. One can easily understand that the activities of the human indriyas are being watched by that Supreme Nucleus, for it is said in the scriptures:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Iiks&#x301;ye shrn&#x301;omi jighra&#x301;mi sva&#x301;daya&#x301;mi sprsha&#x301;myaham;<br>Iti bha&#x301;sate sarvam&#x301; nrtyasha&#x301;la&#x301;stha diipavat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..16"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->[I see, I hear, I smell, I taste, I touch. Everything is witnessed by Him, who is like the light in a dance theatre.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->But what is the nature of the existence of the jiivas? The shloka begins with the description of the jiivas&#146; expressions, but it does not mention anything about the nature of the jiivas&#146; existence. Is it that the jiivas sprang up like something out of nothing? Should we believe that there was nothing in the beginning and suddenly jiivas came into being? No, that is not acceptable. Something cannot come out of nothing. No existing thing can ever spring from non-existence. Then what is the justification for the existence of the jiivas? We admit that Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is attracting all. He is the Universal Nucleus, the quintessence of the human heart and sensibilities. We understand logically that Vrajagopa&#x301;la is the final shelter of the jiivas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Nivedaya&#x301;mi ca&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; tvam&#x301; gatih Parameshvara &ndash; &ldquo;I hereby surrender my all, my pain and pleasure, every particle of my existence, unto You. I give You my everything. I surrender my whole being unto You.&rdquo; It is true that &ldquo;I&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;You&rdquo;, but where did this &ldquo;I&rdquo; come from? The question remains as unanswered as before. Again there is a need for pariprashna. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Supreme Nucleus which is the final destination of all jiivas. He can attract everything to Himself with His centripetal motion and again reject everything with His centrifugal motion. Someone may say that the jiiva and Parama Purus&#x301;a were separate entities and thus there was dualism in the beginning. Later they merged with Parama Purus&#x301;a and became non-dualistic. This much is logically acceptable, but the question is, where did those jiivas come from who were separate from Parama Purus&#x301;a? The answer lies in the fact that He can attract each and everything in the universe with His centripetal motion &ndash; just a sweet little smile on His part will bring people rushing towards Him &ndash; and similarly, He can eject any part of His vast Cosmic body in a sporting way. The One in whom one finds the Supreme positive power must also be endowed with the Supreme negative power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Pariprashna then, teaches that the jiivas indeed proceed from dvaeta to advaeta, but that dualistic nature of the jiivas, and their emergence on this earth, is due to the fact that they have come out of Parama Purus&#x301;a in the centrifugal movement of His creation. We come therefore to the final conclusion that the jiivas are initially non-dualistic in nature. It is only in the middle stage that they are dualistic in nature. Later they find their shelter in the heart of Vrajagopa&#x301;la and return to their non-dualistic character. Thus according to pariprashna the real philosophical stance should be advaetadvaeta&#x301;dvaetava&#x301;da, that is, non-dualistic dualistic non-dualism. That is, non-dualistic in the beginning, residing in the heart of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Parama Purus&#x301;a was One, but He desired to become many in a sportive mood. Eko&#146;ham&#x301; bahusya&#x301;m &ndash; &ldquo;I was One but I became many.&rdquo; Later, after playing with all, He finally called them unto Him, saying, &ldquo;My children, return to Me. The day is over, it is evening. Return home.&rdquo; Not only is Vrajagopa&#x301;la the quintessence of all human sensibilities and the nucleus of the human mind, but His heart is the last and final shelter of all the jiivas of this universe.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject of discourse is Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi in the light of bhaktitattva [the essence of devotion]. Devotion can be explained in various ways: from a psychological point of view, from a philosophical point of view, etc. The fundamental psychology behind bhakti, which I once discussed at Anandanagar, is this: when a person looks upon the awesome greatness of any great entity, his or her own qualities become suspended. He or she develops a special attitude towards that great entity, and that attitude is known as devotion. (This is the primary interpretation of devotion. It has other interpretations as well. When a jiiva attracts an entity other than itself and is attracted by that entity, that spirit of mutual attraction is known as devotion or bhakti.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When an individual&#146;s psychic feelings get suspended at the sight of the greatness of an entity, then the individual attitude towards that great entity is devotion. Initially it is known as sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya&#x301; bhakti [natural devotion]. This sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya bhakti is present even in many undeveloped creatures. Suppose you look upon the vast Himalayan range. When you gaze at the sky-kissing peaks, your mind becomes overwhelmed and you exclaim, &ldquo;Oh, how vast are these mountains!&rdquo; You develop a feeling of reverence for the Himalayas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In ancient times, whenever people looked upon anything very great, whether crude, subtle or causal, they began to worship it out of a feeling of reverence. If people worship many things then the mind will naturally flow in many directions; rather the mind should be made to flow towards the greatest of the great entities. That Entity alone should be the object of bhakti. Regarding Parama Purus&#x301;a, it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Tamiishvara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; paramam&#x301; Maheshvaram&#x301; tam&#x301; devata&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; paramain&#x32D;ca Daevatam;<br>Patim&#x301; patiina&#x301;m&#x301; paramam&#x301; parasta&#x301;d vida&#x301;ma devam&#x301; bhuvaneshamiid&#x301;yam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..5"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[He is Maheshvara of all the iishvaras (Controller of the controllers); He is the God of all gods.

<a name="24..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In one person we might discover great intellect; in another person we might find great courage; and in a third, photographic memory. People are bound to revere those with great intellect. Similarly, one who has a wonderful memory is also sure to command respect from others. If one is very kind or has constructive genius, he or she will also enjoy people&#146;s reverence. Such are the people who command reverence from society. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is the One who commands reverence from even the revered ones. That is, they admit: &ldquo;We know nothing. We only think upon Parama Purus&#x301;a and work by His grace.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now what do we find in Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi? He knows the inner secrets of all. He knows what and when everything happened not only during the period of the Kuruks&#x301;etra war, not only ten to fifteen years before &ndash; He also knows what happened ten thousand years earlier and all that has happened during the past untold millions of years.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Whatever has been said so briefly in the Giita&#x301; has been elaborated upon in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata. He who possesses such vast knowledge is sure to be the master of intellect. No one knows as much as He knows. Thus, from that viewpoint, He is bound to command the maximum reverence from the people. According to the touchstone of bhaktitattva, He is pure gold. In exactly the same way, He is revered for His vigour and spiritedness. He also exhorted the Pandavas to establish themselves in vigour and spiritedness. When necessary He severely admonished them, saying Klaevyam&#x301; ma&#x301;sma gama Pa&#x301;rtha &ndash; &ldquo;Do not give in to helplessness.&rdquo; Endowed with superb intellect, memory and knowledge, He knew when, where and how He was to convey what was needed. Not only in memory and intellect, but in all other forms of human expression as well, He is impeccable, unparalleled. Ekameva&#x301;dvitiiyam [&ldquo;He is One and without a second&rdquo;]. Therefore whom but Him will people revere?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Tamiishvara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; paramam&#x301; Maheshvaram. When people notice iishvaratva [the power of control] in others, they begin to revere such personalities, and such personalities possessing iishvaratva revere Parama Purus&#x301;a as &ldquo;Maheshvara&rdquo;. My beloved Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is Maheshvara to all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now, who is Iishvara? One in whom all the aeshvaryas [occult powers] are manifest is called Iishvara. They are chiefly eight in number &ndash; an&#x301;ima&#x301;, mahima&#x301;, laghima&#x301;, pra&#x301;pti, iishitva, vashitva, praka&#x301;mya and antarya&#x301;mitva. The eight aeshvaryas are clearly manifested in Parama Purus&#x301;a. It is not erroneous, therefore, to identify Pa&#x301;rthasarathi with Parama Purus&#x301;a. I am bound to admit that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was Ta&#x301;raka Brahma and as such He commands universal reverence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><b>An&#x301;ima&#x301;</b>: An&#x301;ima&#x301; means the ability to become very small. Parama Purus&#x301;a is a vast Entity, but He lies covert in the deepest recesses of the mind, in the innermost regions of the human heart, and in the controlling point of human sentimentality. You cannot do or think anything secretly. Whenever you think of something, that thought is carried by your nerve cells to your ectoplasmic body, where a sympathetic vibration is created. This is the process of thinking. He is seated in your mind. Every thought is witnessed by Him. He is the master of your mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->An&#x301;u means very small. An&#x301;ima&#x301; means the capacity to become very small. That is, He remains in your mind in the form of the smallest possible particle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Suppose you start thinking about how you would like to prepare some pa&#x301;t&#x301;isa&#x301;pt&#x301;a&#x301; [a fine cake] and serve it to a loved one. Your desire sets in motion a particular psychic process. If there is a wave of desire in your mind to serve pa&#x301;t&#x301;isa&#x301;pt&#x301;a&#x301; to that loved one, that very wave has an object, a physico-psychic object. As you move around, every wave of your inner desire is directed towards making this one dish. (The whole matter is interesting, but a little complicated.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->If, moreover, the person whom you want to feed is also there in your mind, obviously he or she will see that pa&#x301;t&#x301;isa&#x301;pt&#x301;a&#x301; with every rise and fall of your psychic waves, and he or she will develop a desire to eat it. So on the one hand, you have mentally created that desire on his or her part, and on the other hand, with each trough and each crest of your mental wave you have prepared some pa&#x301;t&#x301;isa&#x301;pt&#x301;a&#x301;, meaning that in one second you have mentally created at least a million pieces of pa&#x301;t&#x301;isa&#x301;pt&#x301;a&#x301;. Naturally the creation of millions of pa&#x301;t&#x301;isa&#x301;pt&#x301;a&#x301;s in your mental arena will linger for several days. That is, in the process of action and reaction, it will produce a lasting impression on the nerve cells, and three or four days later you are likely to say to the members of your family: &ldquo;We haven&#146;t had any pa&#x301;t&#x301;isa&#x301;pt&#x301;a&#x301; for a long time, one of these days we should make some.&rdquo; That is why it is said: Ya&#x301;drshii bha&#x301;vana&#x301; yasya siddhirbhavati ta&#x301;drshii &ndash; &ldquo;As you think, so you become.&rdquo; Whether you prepare the food or not, you develop an intense desire to eat it. So it is not proper to cherish such desires. If you do think about it, you should think about it just for a second, not more than that. If the desire persists, you will be assailed afterwards by its reaction. For instance, if someone thinks of thieves for a considerable length of time, the idea of stealing may creep into the mind, so these types of undesirable thought should always be discouraged. Whenever any thought arises in the mind, it should be immediately channelled towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. You should say: &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, Thy will be done,&rdquo; for His an&#x301;ima&#x301; lies covert in your mind. Just as sugar in syrup is undeniably mixed with every water particle, similarly His an&#x301;ima&#x301; is also pervasively associated with your thought processes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><b>Mahima&#x301;</b>: Mahima&#x301; means vastness. The entire microcosmic world is sheltered within the Macrocosmic mind. If the unit is a drop of water, then the Cosmic mind is the ocean. Every rise and fall of your sentimental waves takes place within Him, within His vast oceanic mind. You cannot think of anything outside of Him. You are surrounded by Him in all directions &ndash; east, west, north, south, north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west, above and below. How will you go outside of Him? You cannot. So long as you are not aware of the fact that you are surrounded by Him in all directions, you may think occasionally that He may not know what you are secretly thinking or doing. But once you have understood the fact, you can no longer turn back, because it is too late. Rabindranath Tagore said, perhaps in regard to the state of those who do not realize that they are forever encircled in ten directions by Parama Purus&#x301;a:<!-- /block --></p>

When people grow a little older, say twenty-five or thirty years, they start to behave more seriously and conduct themselves with dignity before their juniors. For example, they laugh on a ration basis. That is, they do not laugh as much as they really should, lest their juniors think less of them. They try to make themselves grave unnecessarily. In their hearts they are not serious but they pretend to be serious. In fact they are not so grave. What about Parama Purus&#x301;a? He prefers to remain as light as a small child. He does not pretend to be serious, for He who carries the entire weight of the universe has no reason to increase His load.<!-- /block --></p>

He provides these things either directly, or indirectly through other jiivas. He teaches human beings to move in a certain way so that their needs might be easily fulfilled. If they do not act according to His counsel their needs will not be fulfilled. If the people, however, sincerely follow the path laid down by Him, all their needs will be met and their bondages removed. This is His fourth aeshvarya.<!-- /block --></p>

He ruled His empire with an iron hand. He ruled over the virtuous and made them more virtuous. He ruled the wicked and brought them back to the path of virtue. There was not the slightest slackness in His endeavours. It follows that He was established in iishitva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><b>Vashitva</b>: Vashitva means to keep everything under control.

So everything has to be regulated and controlled. This is otherwise known as parama vashiika&#x301;ra siddhi.

Yet if He wishes Mr. So-and-so to be rid of his chest pain, all the atoms, molecules, ectoplasmic particles, etc., immediately become busy to give practical shape to His desire, and the disease gets cured. This is praka&#x301;mya. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi certainly had this praka&#x301;mya. We can easily cite many stories from the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata to illustrate this.

The entity which remains in the mind smaller than an atom and witnesses all psychic phenomena may also be called antarya&#x301;mitva. On the practical side, however, there is some difference. Antarya&#x301;mitva means to enter into one&#146;s being and know everything inside the body and mind. It is not enough to know the inner workings of the mind alone. It is also necessary to enter into each limb of the body and know what is what. For instance, suppose a person suffers from some psychic ailments. Someone may be weighed down with the cares and anxieties of life. Only to enter the mind and know all this will not suffice. The entity who wants to bring about the well-being of all will have to know every secret people hold. Then and then alone will he or she be able to do the maximum good for them.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Regarding Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi I will say this &ndash; human beings have no capacity to judge Him, for in order to judge One who possesses the eight aeshvaryas, infallible wisdom is required. He is the Lord of the eight aeshvaryas. Only one who possesses the eight aeshvaryas in a greater degree than Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi has the right to judge Him. No human being is capable of this. He is beyond human judgement, beyond the scope of human intellect. Instead of trying to attain Him through intellect one should try to attain Him by complete surrender. That is the only path. There is no other way.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Pariprashna. Pari is a Sanskrit prefix. It means &ldquo;well&rdquo;, or &ldquo;in a nice way&rdquo;. Hence pariprashna means those questions which when answered can lead to the all-round welfare of human beings. And one should bear in mind that the first and foremost factor for all-round welfare is spiritual elevation. If a person is spiritually elevated, not only does that individual benefit, but the whole society derives benefit from that spiritually-evolved person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->If we want to analyse Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi from the viewpoint of pariprashna, then two main questions arise. The first is, &ldquo;Is Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Bhagava&#x301;n [God]?&rdquo; And the second is, &ldquo;If He is Bhagava&#x301;n, then what is His actual status?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Is Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Bhagava&#x301;n?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Let us analyse the scriptural interpretation of the term bhagava&#x301;n. The word bhaga plus the Sanskrit suffix matup becomes bhagavata, and bhagava&#x301;n when declined in the first case, singular number. From the spiritual point of view, the word bhaga has two meanings &ndash; the first &ldquo;spiritual effulgence&rdquo; and the second, a combination of six qualities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The bha of bhagava&#x301;n signifies bheti bha&#x301;sayate loka&#x301;n &ndash; &ldquo;one who illumines all the lokas by one&#146;s own aura&rdquo; &ndash; by the excellence of infinite vitality, wisdom and greatness. Bha represents all these superhuman qualities. Bha is an acoustic root having immense attribution. Human beings owe their radiance to Him alone. The earth receives its light from the sun, the sun receives its light from the stars, and the stars receive their light from Parama Purus&#x301;a alone. Tasya bha&#x301;sa&#x301; sarvamidam&#x301; vibha&#x301;ti &ndash; &ldquo;Everyone is radiant with His light.&rdquo; Where does human intellect originate from? It emanates from Him. People learn by reading books or by hearing and understanding discourses. These faculties of hearing, reading and understanding are not human creations. They are the gentle rise and fall of the waves flowing in the vast body of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Jiivas have nothing of their own. Everything they receive is from Him alone. They get food from Him and they get air from Him. Everything is a gift from Him. Thus bha is an adequate description of His immense attribution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Next is ga. Itya&#x301;gacchatyajasram&#x301; gacchati yasmin ima&#x301; praja&#x301; a&#x301;gacchati yasma&#x301;t &ndash; &ldquo;the Entity to whom all microcosms return&rdquo;. Gacchati means &ldquo;goes&rdquo;, yasmin means &ldquo;to whom&rdquo; and a&#x301;gacchati yasma&#x301;t means &ldquo;from whom all jiivas originate&rdquo;. Countless are the creations which issue forth from Him and return back to Him. So bha and ga together make the word bhaga.<!-- /block --></p>

It is because when Parama Purus&#x301;a brings about social welfare by speaking truthfully and unambiguously and performing many good deeds, good people, common people, derive the benefit and speak highly of His deeds. They are full of praise for Him. They love Him and they revere Him.<!-- /block --></p>

Interestingly, a clear polarization emerges in the minds of people. Two unmistakable lines are drawn; two opposing camps are formed &ndash; the Kaoravas and the Pandavas.

When people plunge headlong into the field of action with all the rajas [mutative force] at their disposal, and backed by this stored-up energy take to karma yoga, that is, when they take up the challenge with all the inherent force and vigour of their personality, we say that sha and ra are well-blended in them. So sha + ra = shra. The word is in the feminine gender, so it becomes shrii when suffixed by uniis&#x301;. Shrii means the power of attraction &ndash; a unique combination of mutative lustre and inner vitality. All human beings covet this rare quality, shrii, so even those who are devoid of shrii like to prefix their names with shrii. This is a very old custom in India.

Suppose there are four sub-divisions in the Hooghly District [in West Bengal, India]. This is knowledge. It is not altogether useless. Such knowledge is called apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [worldly or ordinary knowledge]. It may be of some help in the physical sphere, but in the higher psychic planes it becomes useless. In the psycho-spiritual sphere, as well as the spiritual sphere, it is useless. This is apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. It comes from its terrestrial source and is thrown back once again. It is like banana skins which someone picks up from the road and throws in the dustbin. But jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na as a bhaga does not imply apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na at all, for apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na cannot elevate human beings to higher spheres. Here jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [self-knowledge], because para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, when associated with social service, can associate with apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, but apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na cannot under any circumstances associate with parajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na if it wants to maintain its separate identity. Apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na as mere apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na remains confined to the mundane sphere, whereas para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na elevates human beings to the spiritual sphere and at the same time serves as an invaluable aid to apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Here jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, that is, spiritual jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, which is actually para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. One who has acquired para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na will automatically develop apara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. He or she need not take the trouble to read voluminous books.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->You know what happened at the time of Jayadratha&#146;s death.

Everyone thought that the sun had already set. Those who were devotees, not philosophers, commented that Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a had covered the sun with His Sudarshana Cakra [His special discus]. Now you can imagine that it is impossible to cover the sun with a discus. Is it possible to cover the sun with a dinner plate? When you observe a dinner plate close up, it seems to be about this large. But if you could see the sun close up, how big it would appear! If the dinner plate were placed near the sun, it would be a mere speck. No, the discus could never cover the sun! Though the devotees claim that it did, I take this as a mere story. But then the question arises how the sun was in fact covered. The answer is that Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a willed it so. He had mastery over praka&#x301;mya siddhi, one of the eight occult powers. He willed the sun to be covered by clouds, and so it happened. The sun was covered by clouds, and people thought that the sun had gone down. Soon Arjuna was able to keep his promise and kill Jayadratha. To perform such a miraculous feat by going against the natural order cannot be accomplished by even a first-grade bhagava&#x301;n, not to speak of a second- or third-grade one. Only Parama Purus&#x301;a can do this. This is only one story. Dozens of similar stories can be found in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata.<!-- /block --></p>

Again we say, &ldquo;How lustrous is the baby! There is nothing as beautiful as this little baby.&rdquo; Or we may say, &ldquo;How intelligent this man is! He is like Veda Vyasa [the sage who compiled the Vedas].&rdquo; By comparison, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was by far the most intelligent personality in existence. He had no parallel in intellect or wisdom.

Nandana means &ldquo;one who gives joy to others and gets joy from others&rdquo; &ndash; both to give a&#x301;nandam [bliss, joy] and to get a&#x301;nandam &ndash; whereas the verb gop in Sanskrit means only &ldquo;to give a&#x301;nandam&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Gopa&#x301;yate yah sah gopah &ndash; That is, &ldquo;One whose only mission in life is to give joy to Parama Purus&#x301;a is a gopa.&rdquo; (Here gopa [literally, &ldquo;cowherd&rdquo;] does not mean one who rears cattle. It means one who is a source of joy to Parama Purus&#x301;a.) However, the word nandana has a different meaning. It refers to one who gives a&#x301;nandam to Parama Purus&#x301;a and at the same time gets a&#x301;nandam from Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This is closely related to ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti. High-grade devotion is divided into two categories: ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; and ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301;. The ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakta says, &ldquo;Why do I love the Lord, my Vrajagopa&#x301;la, my Parama Purus&#x301;a? Because my love for Him gives Him joy and from this I get joy.&rdquo; This is ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti. Ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; is somewhat different from ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301;. The ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakta says: &ldquo;I love Parama Purus&#x301;a because I want to give Him a&#x301;nandam. I don&#146;t care whether or not I get a&#x301;nandam. My only desire is to give Him joy through my love. I shall perform, even at the cost of profuse sweat and difficulty, only those noble deeds which will give Him joy.

<a name="26..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The excellence of aesthetic science lies in the fact that one derives joy from the manifold expressions of Parama Purus&#x301;a. From the aesthetic point of view, there is no entity but Parama Purus&#x301;a. &ldquo;He is my personal property. I have never come across any other entity that can compare with my Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; No other category of bhakta thinks or talks in such a way about Parama Purus&#x301;a. &ldquo;That is why I love Him from the core of my heart. It is not enough that I get joy by loving Him. I should act in such a way that He also gets joy.&rdquo; Both approaches coincide in the science of aesthetics. If we go even deeper, to the very root, we find that whatever we observe in this universe &ndash; animals, birds, trees, plants, land, water, hills, mountains, sun, moon, stars and so many other things that we love in numerous ways &ndash; all are but the limited expressions of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Human beings become overjoyed receiving the limited expressions of joy from Him. They look at the world, with its profusion of changing forms, and become fascinated by them. When this feeling deepens and becomes permanent, it turns into love. Suppose I see something. The vibration radiating from that object produces a sympathetic vibration in the mind. I begins to feel that I should assimilate that vibration, that I should accept it as my own. This is what is known as attraction. When people subjectivize that attraction in the psychic arena, it is called love. What is attraction in the beginning turns into love when it becomes permanent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When we grow very close to something in this world, our initial attraction turns into love. We see the various expressions of Parama Purus&#x301;a. We like everything. We like the flower, we like its fragrance, we like the green field in the rainy season, we like the lofty Himalayan peaks. And if our minds remain in contact with these congenial vibrations for a long time, then because our mind returns again and again to its object, to these congenial vibrations, our &ldquo;like&rdquo; turns into love, and is eventually turned into a permanent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a has been manifesting Himself in numerous non-integral forms, and He Himself has become the object of adoration for the jiivas. One who closely observes and tries to understand His expressions comes to love Him. One has no recourse but to love that Entity whose love for the jiivas is being expressed in an infinite variety of forms. A person who treats these limited expressions of Parama Purus&#x301;a as mere mundane objects of enjoyment will never know real love in his or her life. Though one find oneself amidst an unbroken flow of Cosmic bliss, the heart becomes as parched as desert sand. One who cannot love Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot love the world either. Life becomes filled with frustration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->My Vrajagopa&#x301;la is the embodiment of love, and His varied expressions are the different objects of admiration.

As one proceeds a little further, He becomes an object of love, and in the end, He becomes an object of such intense divine love that one cannot bear separation for even a moment. A person who has true love for Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot live without Him, just as a fish cannot live without water. If someone tells a devotee at that stage, &ldquo;Look here, your Parama Purus&#x301;a is no ideal personality; He is a butter thief; He heartlessly deserts His companions and goes away across the river to Mathura,&rdquo; even then nothing will dissuade the devotee from loving Him. Rather the devotee will reply, &ldquo;Once I have given Him my love I will never withdraw it. Love for God is something irrevocable.&rdquo; The Vedas say:<!-- /block --></p>

This joy is the aesthetic enjoyment of the supra-aesthetic Entity. Devotees argue that Parama Purus&#x301;a was alone, and it was monotonous for Him. If there are people gathered together then Parama Purus&#x301;a gets the opportunity to scold them, love them, etc. This pleases Him. If necessary He will tell someone, &ldquo;You&#146;re hungry. You should go and eat.&rdquo; To another He will say, &ldquo;Look, don&#146;t overeat, it will ruin your health.&rdquo; This is how the world came into being. When Parama Purus&#x301;a was all alone, He was obviously unhappy. He was One and became many, and began to joyfully sport with His creation.<!-- /block --></p>

How painful it must have been to remain in this terrible loneliness. It was no joke for Him to suffer horrible loneliness. When left alone in an empty house anyone would become extremely restless for company. My Parama Purus&#x301;a was in such a condition. He had the capacity to see and hear everything, to administer over all, to play with all, to love and scold all, but since there was no other entity, He was deprived of this happiness. Just to rid Himself of this oppressive loneliness He thought to Himself, &ldquo;I will become many.&rdquo; And He became many, for He has one rare occult power: praka&#x301;mya. That is, everything takes shape as per His desire. He wanted to become many and He became many. In this way His divine sport has been going on eternally. Thus it has been said, A&#x301;nanda&#x301;ddhyeva khalvima&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni ja&#x301;yante [&ldquo;Out of bliss all beings were born&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>

Even a hundred-year-old man or woman does not want to die. They may say that they do want to die, but actually they do not. People do not want to part from the countless objects of love that surround them. But one whose superficial attraction has given way to true love understands that these objects are perishable in nature. Those who think that if they can maintain a permanent relationship with the Infinite, maintain permanent love for the Infinite, that will be far more blissful, avoid developing any blind attachment to things of the world. A&#x301;nandam&#x301; prayantyabhisam&#x301;vishanti &ndash; &ldquo;in the final stage, when one merges one&#146;s identity into Parama Purus&#x301;a, one attains the state of Supreme Beatitude.&rdquo; That is, gacchati yasmin a&#x301;gacchati yasma&#x301;t [&ldquo;to whom everything goes and from whom everything comes&rdquo;] &ndash; jiivas want to merge with that a&#x301;nandasvarupa [embodiment of bliss] Parama Purus&#x301;a as their final shelter, their final terminus, their supreme terminus; because nowhere else will jiivas find that a&#x301;nandam. My Vrajagopa&#x301;la, my Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, is that embodiment of bliss. This has already been proven.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Even ordinary people perceive Him as an object of love through finite expression, and this is aestheticism. When a person does some sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, he or she experiences some pleasant vibrations through the medium of the five tanma&#x301;tras &ndash; sound, touch, taste, form and smell. In the initial stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, when the mind becomes a bit concentrated, one experiences a sweet and very appealing fragrance. Sometimes it is the fragrance of a lotus and sometimes of an unknown flower. The smell tanma&#x301;tra is the crudest of the five, but like the other tanma&#x301;tras, it also emanates from the Supreme Nucleus of the universal body of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus we see that when someone makes some spiritual progress, one realizes Parama Purus&#x301;a through this gandha [smell] tanma&#x301;tra. So from the aesthetic point of view, He is aesthetic aroma. Much poetry and literature can be written centring around this aroma, for it is something supra-physical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Next comes the rasa [taste] tanma&#x301;tra. This tanma&#x301;tra is subtler than the previous one. Rasa means &ldquo;flow&rdquo;. Parama Purus&#x301;a has created an endless network of waves from the Cosmic Nucleus according to His own sweet will. Each of these waves is either an animate or inanimate expression. Suppose you throw a stone into a pond. Ripple upon ripple flows over the surface of the water &ndash; not only one wave, but countless waves, flow in countless directions. Each of these waves is a deva,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> but the fundament upon which these waves have been created is called rasa. Rasa suffixed by snik becomes rasika. Parama Purus&#x301;a is called Rasika, that is, One who has been creating waves in the ocean of rasa. The divine sport of these innumerable waves is called the ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;. Ordinary people do not comprehend the hidden significance of the ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;. From the beginning to the end of existence, Parama Purus&#x301;a, my Vrajagopa&#x301;la, has been conducting this eternal ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;, and every human being, willingly or unwillingly, will have to dance in harmony with the rise and fall of these waves. If someone refuses to dance, his or her legs will be compelled to move. This is His inexorable law. Parama Purus&#x301;a is raso vae sah [an eternal flow of bliss]. This rhythmic Cosmic flow with its crests and troughs is taking place in the vast universal body of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Overwhelmed by the perception of this vast Cosmic form, the source of objects of love for human beings, a Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava poet has portrayed the universe in verse: Kiva&#x301; d&#x301;halad&#x301;hala ka&#x301;nca&#x301; aunger la&#x301;van&#x301;i avanii bahiya&#x301; ya&#x301;y [&ldquo;nothing but the graceful motion of the sublime body of Parama Purus&#x301;a, the rise and fall of His Cosmic form&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Next comes the ru&#x301;pa [form] tanma&#x301;tra.

If one looks at the limited expressions of the Supreme Entity from the aesthetic standpoint, one sees that Parama Purus&#x301;a appears bound up in finitude, and whenever we endeavour to attain Him through these finite forms, we find that He eludes our grasp. The devotees call this His game of hide and seek. It seems as if He is motionless, within our easy reach, but the moment we reach for Him we discover that He has slipped away. The devotees call it Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s game of hide-and-seek, His divine sport. A mystic poet has written: Thira bijuri a&#x301;ha&#x301; mari mari nayan bhula&#x301;lo mor.<!-- /block --></p>

But while physical lightning flashes momentarily and then vanishes, He is undying brilliance like lightning that never fades. When we observe this undying brilliance, we discover that the subject is within the scope of aesthetic science. His brilliance dazzles my eyes so much that I can no longer see. A poet has said: Ru&#x301;pa nirakhiya&#x301; nayana bhulila cinite na&#x301;rinu ke [&ldquo;I have beheld the unfathomable beauty of that Entity.

As a result aesthetic science suffers a mortal blow.<!-- /block --></p>

Behind whatever is created, behind whatever is being emanated from that Supreme Nucleus, there is sound. When He moves there is a sound created, though you may or may not hear it. It is the flute of my Vrajagopa&#x301;la. The music of His flute pervades the whole creation. It has diffused throughout the five fundamental factors &ndash; solid, liquid, luminous, aerial and ethereal. The human body is also composed of these five factors, and even within this human body sound has been vibrating without a pause since time immemorial. The sound of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s flute is called the pran&#x301;ava, the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra or the Causal Matrix &ndash; on&#x32D;m. Its supreme manifestation is the sound on&#x32D;m.

This pran&#x301;ava is a transcendental entity. One who realizes this gets all his or her desires fulfilled. Why does this occur? It is due to the fact that his or her pinnacled intellect merges with the Macrocosmic intellect of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the lord of the occult power praka&#x301;mya. Thus the devotee gets whatever he or she so desires by the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, but one must first be a genuine devotee. All the occult powers of Vrajagopa&#x301;la, all His aesthetic expressions are laid out in a systematic fashion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Now it so happens that human beings do not usually attain Him on the first attempt, although they try. But fortunately He appears to His devotees in an unexpected way, and ultimately they realize Him gradually, step by step, though they may not realize Him in the way that they would like. Since He possesses countless tanma&#x301;trika vibrations or aesthetic expressions, He may sometimes appear in one form and sometimes in another. Devotees of the highest order think, &ldquo;If it pleases Parama Purus&#x301;a to appear in different forms at different times, let Him do so. Why should we create obstructions to His joy?&rdquo; Of course a bhakta, if he or she so desires, can hold on to a particular form for some time. When a bhakta begins to analyse Him, he or she finds that He is unique in gandha tanma&#x301;tra. He is extraordinary in rasa tanma&#x301;tra. He is unparalleled in ru&#x301;pa tanma&#x301;tra and He is exquisitely sweet in the softness of sparsha tanma&#x301;tra.

<a name="27..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You all know the meaning of nandana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. It implies getting joy and also giving joy to others. We should analyse the psychology operating behind aesthetic science, because when we see that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was totally engaged in a ceaseless fight against crime and injustice, we have to wonder, what scope was there in Him for aesthetic science? To understand, we must look into the psychology behind the cult of aesthetics. The human mind is progressively unfolding according to its inherent propensities. When it finds something that produces anuku&#x301;lavedaniiyam [congenial mental feelings], it is called sukha [happiness], and when pratiku&#x301;lavedaniiyam [uncongenial mental feelings], it is called duhkha [sorrow]. The human mind moves in a particular flow according to its inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. If it finds congenial vibrations in all directions, vibrations with greater wavelengths than its own, then its own mental vibrations of lesser wavelength become straightened, attaining greater wavelengths. This is anuku&#x301;lavedaniiyam, and the vedana&#x301; (in Bengali vedana&#x301; means &ldquo;pain&rdquo;, but in Sanskrit it means anubhu&#x301;ti [feeling]) that arises in an environment of longer waves is termed sukha; where the vedana&#x301; is uncongenial, it is known as klesha [affliction] or duhkha. The wavelengths of uncongenial vibrations are shorter than those of the congenial vibrations. Aesthetic science implies that psychic waves coming in contact with vibrations of greater frequency attain a greater wavelength, and we may say, Anuku&#x301;lavedaniiyam&#x301; sukham [&ldquo;A congenial mental feeling is called happiness&rdquo;]. If the reverse occurs, we say, Pratiku&#x301;lavedaniiyam&#x301; duhkham [&ldquo;An uncongenial mental feeling is called sorrow&rdquo;]. In aesthetic science there is no scope for sorrow; and when the vibrations of happiness become straightened, it leads to a&#x301;nandam; happiness is transformed into bliss. When this undulating movement is directed towards a&#x301;nandam and the waves get straightened, it falls within the scope and jurisdiction of aesthetic science. When the waves become totally free from curvature, when they become fully and finally straightened, this falls within the scope of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [supra-aesthetic science]. One attains the state of a&#x301;nandam, the highest state of human existence. What was the role of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi? He fought and fought relentlessly against wrongdoing and injustice, so that jiivas might enjoy happiness. Criminals and wicked persons, by their evil acts, were adding to the sorrows and miseries of the people, adding to their pratiku&#x301;lavedaniiyam. Thus it is clear that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, through His noble deeds, increased the anuku&#x301;lavedaniiyam of the jiivas. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi annihilated the wicked and sinful persons and thus rid society of antisocial elements. When, consequently, jiivas came in touch with vibrations of greater wavelength, they obviously found it easier to move towards a&#x301;nandam. They were inspired to move in their natural flow of life. Just as Vrajagopa&#x301;la attracted microcosms towards a&#x301;nandam through the medium of sound, touch, taste, smell and form, through His graceful dances and the sweet melodies of His flute, likewise, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi attracted them towards the beauty and joy of collective life by giving them a foretaste of what it would be like. Judged from the aesthetic standpoint, what Vrajagopa&#x301;la was able to do in one way, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi performed in a different way. In fact, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi should be considered the propounder of aesthetic science, for the essential theme of this aesthetic science found its consummation in the life and action of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Vrajagopa&#x301;la and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi both fall within the scope of aesthetic science. Vrajagopa&#x301;la represents all that is soft and sweet, tender and delicate in the universe. He is the living embodiment of an infinite softness, a divine sweetness. Vrajagopa&#x301;la&#146;s sweetness manifests itself in a very tender and delicate manner. Vrajagopa&#x301;la readily appeals to the human mind and sensibilities, whereas Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi represents the entire sentimentality of the universe through the expression of His Cosmic energy or ojas [psychic lustre]. What Vrajagopa&#x301;la has accomplished through His characteristic softness, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi has done through the radiation of His Cosmic energy. A vast quantity of Cosmic energy descended from the Cosmic hub and was diffused throughout all particles of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It radiated in all directions, promoting the all-round well-being of humanity. This, in short, is my Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Vrajagopa&#x301;la and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi have equal importance in this aesthetic science. The advent of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi was no ordinary physical phenomenon. This advent was a descent from the vibhu shakti [Macrocosmic energy] of the Supreme Entity. The Cosmic energy of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi descended from that point which is the supreme source of all Cosmic vibrations. It inundated the entire universe and continues to do so today. Thus:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Dyotate kriid&#x301;ate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divi;<br>Tasma&#x301;t deva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..6"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[The vibrational manifestations emanating from the Supreme Nucleus are known as devata&#x301;s, and these devata&#x301;s address that Supreme Nucleus as Deva. He with His powers vibrates the entire universe, makes the entire universe dance; and He by dint of His occult and supra-occult powers brings everything back onto His lap.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s sweetness is the sweetness of unlimited energy, the sweetness of the lofty Himalayas, the sweetness of thundering clouds. His sweetness spreads throughout collective life. Vrajagopa&#x301;la belongs to individuals as much as to the collective body. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi likewise belongs as much to individuals as to the collective body, but the basic difference is that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi paid more attention to the collective interest. Parama Purus&#x301;a remains associated with His creation through ota yoga and prota yoga. He is connected with each individual separately through His ota yoga, and with all collectively through His prota yoga. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is more inclined towards ota yoga than prota yoga, while Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is more inclined towards prota yoga than ota yoga. For Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi says, &ldquo;If I can promote the welfare of the collective body, then the individual interest will also be served, for individuals are included in the collective body.&rdquo; For example, if I supply an entire country with food, then there remains no need to supply each individual separately, because they are all included in the total population of the country. Due to this sweetness coming from Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, jiivas derive collective joy through aesthetic science more from Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, whereas they derive individual joy through aesthetic science more from Vrajagopa&#x301;la.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Six Spokes of the Social Cycle<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It would be good to mention one point here: that a comprehensive heroic advent of Parama Purus&#x301;a in the form of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma took place in Lord Shiva. But the six factors which guide society, which make it vibrate in bliss and dance in bliss when its different entities realize the fullness of existence in every fibre of their existence, are the s&#x301;ad&#x301;ara&#x301;h sama&#x301;ja cakra [six spokes of the social cycle]. [The six are: spiritual practice, spiritual ideology, social outlook, socio-economic theory, scripture and preceptor.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In Lord Shiva all six factors were brightly conspicuous. That was surely the case with Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a also. That is why they were considered Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, they were considered Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti. But of these factors, which do we find most clearly manifest in Shiva? Shiva gave a systematic sha&#x301;stra [scripture], and thereby thrust humanity one step forward on the path to aesthetic science. Where there is a well-codified and systematic scripture, the people are able to derive joy at every step by adhering to its precepts. For instance, suppose I move my hands at random or move my legs and head without any rhyme or reason. Clearly, this cannot be called dance. At best we can call it folk dance, but never classical dance, for in classical dance there are specific rules, special mudra&#x301;s [gestures], and certain rhythms. Hence there is an ineluctable need for sha&#x301;stra. One can derive a&#x301;nandam only when one strictly adheres to those prescribed rules. Simple random movement of the arms and legs is not dance. Likewise, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and bhajana [devotional songs] also presuppose certain systematic injunctions. Otherwise, they may prove harmful. Society needs such scripture in every sphere of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Sha&#x301;sana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah sha&#x301;strah parikiirtitah [&ldquo;That which liberates through discipline is called sha&#x301;stra, scripture&rdquo;]. &ldquo;Do this. Don&#146;t do that. This is good. That is bad&rdquo; &ndash; that which teaches these dos and don&#146;ts is known as sha&#x301;stra. Etymologically, the word sha&#x301;stra is derived from the root verb sha&#x301;s plus trae plus d&#x301;a. What we notice most prominently in Shiva is that He introduced the kind of scripture that provided the impetus to move people along the path of aesthetic science, and thus did enormous good to humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->But this was not all. He also taught the cult of aesthetics. &ldquo;Cult&rdquo; means the practical processes. For example, He first explained to Maharshi Bharata the theoretical aspects of dance, and then proceeded to teach the practical aspects. He taught him how to dance systematically. For example, one should dance dhin in this way, dhae in that way and ta&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in still another way. That is, He taught both the theoretical and practical sides. If the theoretical side advanced the cause of aesthetic science one hundred per cent, the knowledge of the practical aspects advanced the cause five hundred per cent. He taught both.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Along with this, He fulfilled one more condition of the s&#x301;ad&#x301;ara&#x301;h sama&#x301;ja cakra &ndash; &ldquo;preceptor&rdquo;. As the original preceptor, He took on the entire responsibility of teaching the different branches of science. He said, &ldquo;Well, I will teach these sciences. They may praise Me or blame Me as they like, it will in no way affect Me.&rdquo; He moved ahead in His own characteristic style in order to strengthen the six essential factors, and thereby advance the cause of the aesthetic science both directly and indirectly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, in His time, created a great social consciousness. He told the people: &ldquo;You are social beings. One cannot live in isolation. When you feel thirsty, you can&#146;t manufacture a spade, dig a well, and draw water yourself. One person will make a spade, another will add the wooden handle, and another will dig the well &ndash; this is how we work collectively. This is the way for human beings to live. In all spheres of human existence, in the aesthetic sphere as well, humanity should live collectively. You should live in unison. You should vibrate together to the same music. You should move in a common psychic flow. You should fight collectively against your common enemies. Unitedly you should face all problems, mundane and supra-mundane. In a word, you must reflect the spirit of harmonious collective living in conformity with the spirit of the Vedic mantra Sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&#x301; sam&#x301;vadadhvam.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In order to achieve these ends, what did Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi do? Those who stand against the natural movement of human life, those who impede the natural growth of human beings, should be uncompromisingly annihilated. Their annihilation is good both for themselves and for society. After their annihilation they will get new scope to live and develop in a different environment; and the rest of society, released from their clutches, will breathe a sigh of relief. The greatest contribution of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was the arousal of social consciousness, and this social consciousness, instead of restricting aesthetic science to a few individuals, facilitated its dissemination among the people at large. Not only did He play His music alone, He inspired others to play along with Him. Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was able to fulfil His mission by playing His flute. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi&#146;s stringing of the bow added a new chapter in Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s struggle against evil and injustice. This new dimension not only sweetened aesthetic science, it expanded its scope also. There is joy indeed in launching a struggle against injustice, and that joy is part and parcel of aesthetic science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->We notice that whenever people stand before a towering personality they become overwhelmed, awestruck. But the greatness of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is beyond all measure. His greatness is full of sweetness from beginning to end. Furthermore, that sweetness was born out of soft sentimentality. That I will bring relief to all &ndash; this very thought is something very noble, very sweet. For this very reason He brought social consciousness to people at large. Without arousing social consciousness, it is next to impossible to bring about social welfare. It may not be possible to bring about social welfare through constructive programmes and through the struggle against injustice alone; social consciousness is indispensable for the permanent existence of aesthetic science. When people contemplate the great Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, their shorter thought-waves, which depend upon crude objects such as name, fame, money, etc., attain a longer wavelength, become straightened, due to the process of Cosmic ideation. This vast Entity is infinite and integral, and the insignificant unit entities remain in bondage due to their obsession with meaningless thoughts of mundane objects such as name, fame, wealth, etc. Those things are mere ripples in the ocean of the Cosmic Entity. When those insignificant entities come in contact with the Great, they no longer remain insignificant, but become great themselves. This very urge to attain the Great frees the mind from the bondage of relativity. No matter what stratum of life you find yourself in, if you love the Great, if you try to move towards That, your insignificance will expand into greatness. If, on the other hand, you adopt the reverse approach; if, that is, you say, &ldquo;I am so insignificant. Let me first remove my smallness, then I will proceed towards the Great,&rdquo; this is a huge psychological blunder. In the correct approach, one does not think at all whether one is big or small. One only thinks, &ldquo;I must love that great Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; The moment you think this way, the narrowness of your mind will vanish and yield to greatness. This is the proper psychological approach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->There are people who come to me and say, &ldquo;I am a great sinner, I am a hopeless sinner.&rdquo; I feel unhappy and gently rebuke them. I tell them &ldquo;Look here, if you continue to think that you are a sinner, that very thought will make you a confirmed sinner.&rdquo; I cannot support this. It is defective. Rather you should go to the temple and say &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, I love You. I want to move towards You. I want to be one with You.&rdquo; If someone thinks that he or she is a sinner, then that person&#146;s mind is diverted from Parama Purus&#x301;a towards His own ego. So it follows that if one thinks of the great Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, one becomes great like Him, for Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati &ndash; &ldquo;One who thinks of Parama Purus&#x301;a becomes Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; In this process of mental expansion due to constant ideation on Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, the psychic waves attain a greater wavelength, that is, one is following the path of aesthetic science. He or she begins to love every expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He or she says:<!-- /block --></p>

For you are endless and your expressions are also endless. If I learn how to love You, I will be able to love You in endless ways. My life will become effervescent with the sweet rhythms of the infinite. My life will attain its highest fulfilment.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->This very urge on the part of jiivas to become one with the Cosmos is what is called mysticism. Mysticism is a never-ending endeavour to find a link between the finite and the Infinite. Human endeavour is limitless, endless, so it follows that when people think of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi and His infinite, endless qualities, they become lost. He is the most precious treasure of aesthetic science. The moment one thinks of His excellence, the moment one thinks of the sweetness of His divine existence, one becomes totally lost.<!-- /block --></p>

It shows that Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Himself has developed the science of aesthetics. What can we say of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi in the light of aesthetic science, for He is its creator. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is the final destination of all human beings. All are advancing towards Him, and, while advancing towards Him, they establish some sort of relationship with Him. That relationship is internal. It is purely personal. One may love Him as a mother loves her son, a wife her husband, a servant his master or as friends love one another. This relationship exists with both Vrajagopa&#x301;la and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, but since Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is such an overpowering personality, usually people establish one of three types of relationship with Him: that of a wife, a servant or a friend. I have already told you that Arjuna was a friend of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; sakhya bha&#x301;va. The interesting thing, though, is that this friendly relationship cannot endure till the end. Either it is converted into da&#x301;sya bha&#x301;va [the feeling of being a servant], or madhura bha&#x301;va [the feeling of being a lover]. That very outlook that is instrumental in determining a particular type of relationship with Parama Purus&#x301;a, depending upon one&#146;s inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, is called mysticism. As I have already explained, mysticism is a never-ending endeavour to find a link between finite and Infinite. Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi made it crystal-clear:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I have already discussed the role of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a at some length. So far I have analysed the dual roles of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and showed how they existed side by side and radiated charming sweetness to His ardent devotees. But at the end of our analysis we blissfully discover that the topic pertains to mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [supra-aesthetic stance] &ndash; the supreme stance in human life &ndash; the highest and most blissful cult. The main point here is that someone is attracting, but then the crucial point is: who is that attracting Entity? The question whether it is Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a or Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is utterly irrelevant. It is sufficient to know that an Entity is there which is attracting, powerfully attracting, and that that attracting agent is Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. That is why I prefer to use only the word &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; not &ldquo;Vrajagopa&#x301;la&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->I have already said that nandana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [aesthetic science] proceeds along the systaltic wave movements of trough and crest. The quintessence of aesthetic science is to get joy and give joy. When the wavy movement at a certain stage of its progress is turned into linear movement, that is, the movement becomes straightened, then that is no longer aesthetic science, it becomes converted into supra-aesthetic science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is this supra-aesthetic science? Whenever sound, touch, form, smell or taste comes within the scope of someone&#146;s personal inferences, and if that is anuku&#x301;lavedaniiyam, that is, agreeably pleasant to the mind and nerves, that person will try to attract that thing. If the object is mobile he or she will draw the object, but if it is static he himself will go to the object. One feels attraction for the lofty peaks of the Himalayas. How? Through ru&#x301;pa tanma&#x301;tra. It is impossible to attract the Himalayas, because they are static, not mobile. But human beings are jaun&#x32D;gama [dynamic]. Jaun&#x32D;gama means that which moves, that which is dynamic. That is why humanity reaches out to the Himalayas, to come in contact with the entitative form of the mountains. The point here is this: the Himalayas do not attract people, it is people who want the Himalayas. People want to attract the mountains to themselves, but since this is impossible, they rush to the Himalayas. This is all aesthetic science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Suppose you see something and take a fancy to it. &ldquo;Ah, how fine it is!&rdquo; you will exclaim in joy. Suppose you listen to a nice piece of music and deeply enjoy it. Your friend may be sitting nearby, but you will surely say, &ldquo;Wait a bit, please. Let me listen to the music a little longer.&rdquo; Here you derive a&#x301;nanda [joy] from the music; it is similar when you give joy to others. Suppose there is a singer who is also a little hungry. He or she may decide to go on singing just to give the audience more enjoyment. This is the scope and extent of aesthetic science. But supra-aesthetic science is different from this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Humanity no doubt has some access to this science due to the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, but this science pertains exclusively to Parama Purus&#x301;a, to my beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Here Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a means both Vrajagopa&#x301;la and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi. Thus far, there were two different roles of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. I moved and danced with both, but now they are merged into One. Supra-aesthetic science implies drawing the microcosms closer to Himself through inferential and other ectoplasmic attractions, or by attracting others to Himself through His irresistible charms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Supreme Progenitor of this universe. He has been creating, maintaining and destroying this universe through sain&#x32D;cara and pratisain&#x32D;cara. Now during the phase of pratisain&#x32D;cara He attracts everyone and everything towards Himself. This work of attraction may be done in various ways. Some may be drawn up by rope, some may be drawn up by the forces of love. Some can be attracted by sweet words of love and affection, while others can be captivated only by feelings of internal love. My beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a draws jiivas to Himself only by internal thoughts of love. This is pratisain&#x32D;cara. In this process of pratisain&#x32D;cara, the vast multitude of microcosms evolve. How do they evolve? They evolve because Parama Purus&#x301;a loves them, and the force of His intense love draws them towards Himself. If someone says, &ldquo;No, I won&#146;t go.&rdquo; that will not do. He or she shall have to go, there is no other option.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, Parama Purus&#x301;a has been ever attracting all towards Himself. The difference between nandana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is very vast indeed. Parama Purus&#x301;a is always attracting the microcosms. Although some are reluctant to respond to His call of love, even then they will have to come. This is the speciality of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->All the entities of this universe are mutually attracting all other entities. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is attracting all entities by dint of His love for all, by dint of His personal relationship with all. So Parama Purus&#x301;a alone is the presiding Entity of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, and not any other entity. When jiivas feel this attraction in the heart of their hearts, they think it is an excellent idea to draw all human beings to His charming sweetness by their loving hearts, and then guide them along the path of supreme beatitude, the path of all-round perfection, just as Parama Purus&#x301;a attracts all by the radiance of His unbounded love and affection. So those who love the Supreme, those who are genuine devotees of Parama Purus&#x301;a, are bound to love all and attract them to the path of supreme blessedness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Basically Parama Purus&#x301;a is the focal point, the pivotal point, of supra-aesthetic science. Jiivas, no doubt, have the power of attraction, but their attraction is not as irresistible as the supra-aesthetic attraction. Jiivas try to attract but their power of attraction is not all-pervasive. This is the crux of supra-aesthetic science. Parama Purus&#x301;a is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The word krs&#x301;n&#x301;a means one who attracts all, who draws all towards Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Attraction through Tanma&#x301;tras<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The question is, how does He attract the jiivas? The only means of attraction available to the microcosms is the ta&#x301;nma&#x301;trika sources. Microcosms are acquainted with the world through these tanma&#x301;tras. Similarly they come in close contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a through the tanma&#x301;tras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In this connection one thing more has to be said. As far as your relationship with Parama Purus&#x301;a is concerned, that ta&#x301;nma&#x301;trika realization or inferential bondage is not of the physical world, it is of the ectoplasmic world. That attraction is also there in the ectoplasmic body. When we look at the external world we stand and stare and simply marvel at the beautiful manifestations of the Lord. Similarly in our minds we can also enjoy beautiful expressions of the Lord &ndash; that is, the inferential bliss that emanates from Parama Purus&#x301;a. Tanma&#x301;tras emanate from both worlds, but physical tanma&#x301;tras emanate from the physical world, not the psychic world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>Gandha tanma&#x301;tra</b>: How do we receive the very subtle molecular expressions of this phenomenal world, this quinquelemental world, which is otherwise known as gandha tanma&#x301;tra [smell inference]? The smell that emanates from crude objects when they are pulverized is obviously crude. Depending upon the degree of subtlety or crudity, we can distinguish between sweet-scented and foul-smelling things. The subtler the smell, the sweeter it is. And when this sweet smell is there but we fail to locate the physical source of its emanation, that smell is called surabhi [aroma]. The source of its emanation is beyond the range of the sense organs. Whenever a person is deeply absorbed in the thought of Parama Purus&#x301;a, he or she gets this aroma. Obviously, each and every spiritual aspirant is entitled to get this aroma. That is, when the aspirant enjoys this ectoplasmic aroma due to a good deal of mental concentration, he or she gets the same sort of aroma in the external world as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a attracts the aspirant through the emanation of aroma. He does not draw the jiivas by rope, but through the waves of aroma. He binds you and draws you nearer to Himself. Your mind gives up all other objects and rushes headlong towards the Lord. The aspirant deeply enjoys the blissful aroma and exclaims in joy, &ldquo;How sweet, how blissful this aroma is! But where does it come from? I can&#146;t locate its source.&rdquo; This is how the Supreme Lord of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is drawing you to Himself, through the gandha tanma&#x301;tra. You too are running towards Him. You cannot but run that way because you are helpless in this regard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><b>Rasa tanma&#x301;tra</b>: Next is rasa tanma&#x301;tra [taste inference]. On deeper analysis we find that every object of this universe is sweet. Sweetness, not harshness, is the reality. Parama Purus&#x301;a no doubt deals many blows to the microcosms, but that is just to facilitate their progress. Judged from a materialistic perspective, every blow is apparently harsh, but actually it is not harsh, it is soft. He is concerned for your well-being, that is why He resorts to that apparently crude technique. Ultimately, that method, that way, will prove beneficial to you. Rabindranath Tagore wrote in one of his poems: Ei karecha bha&#x301;la nit&#x301;hur he Ei karecha bha&#x301;la [&ldquo;You have rightly served, O cruel Lord. You have rightly served&rdquo;]. This is all for the good of the jiivas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->You should bear in mind that everything of this ectoplasmic world is sweet, nothing is sour, nothing is bitter. Even any bitter expression of the Lord is meant for the good of jiivas and for that reason it is also sweet in the end. Tumi komale kat&#x301;hore madhure tinakte pu&#x301;rn&#x301;a [&ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is full, absolutely full, of softness, as well as harshness; sweetness as well as bitterness&rdquo;]. Hence He attracts jiivas through His characteristic sweetness, through the divine flow of His sweetness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->As already said, one of the many bha&#x301;vas is madhura bha&#x301;va. Madhura bha&#x301;va is a very exalted bha&#x301;va, for this bha&#x301;va fills the mind with sweetness and bliss and leads the aspirant to the closest proximity of the Lord. To a person who is predominantly a devotee of the Lord, everything tastes sweet, there is nothing bitter in the creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He is attracting you through the ectoplasmic world, binding you through the bonds of love. You cannot sever the bonds of love. It is said in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava philosophy:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Pasharite ca&#x301;y man pa&#x301;shara&#x301; na&#x301; ya&#x301;y go,<br>Kii kari go, kii habe upa&#x301;y?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..19"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The mind wants to forget Him, but cannot. Now, what is the way out?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Sometimes a person is inclined to think, &ldquo;No, I won&#146;t go to Him &ndash; He will scold me, He will punish me; I won&#146;t go near Him.&rdquo; Even then, he or she has to go. The mind may be reluctant to go, the legs may refuse to go, but even then one will have to move, to reach Him. One cannot remain away from Him. Rather, one has to rush along towards Him, because there is that inseparable bond, the inferential bondage of the Cosmic flow. For He is Mohana [One Who Attracts]. He is Manamohana [One Who Attracts the Mind]. He is Vishvamohana [One Who Attracts the Universe].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><b>Ru&#x301;pa tanma&#x301;tra</b>: Through ru&#x301;pa tanma&#x301;tra [form inference], He is attracting the microcosms. No one believes that something has come out of nothing. Similarly, no one believes that something will someday become nothing; it is unbelievable. Something will remain something, although it will go through the process of metamorphosis. Again, the question of nothing changing its form does not arise at all. So nothing will remain nothing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->This universe of Parama Purus&#x301;a has been moving along the path of pratisain&#x32D;cara. The more it advances on the path of pratisain&#x32D;cara, the sweeter is its expression, because it comes nearer to the nucleus of the Cosmic body. Birds and animals are more beautiful than bricks, stones or wood, and human beings are more sublime than birds and animals. The human mind is full of tenderness, softness, sweetness and other qualities of the divine flow. No other creature is as sublime as human beings, because no heart other than the human heart has such subtle sentimentality. The human heart is sweet because its sentimentality is sweet. And as the human heart is sweet, the human mind is also sweet. However bad a person may be, when he or she remains in his or her permanent composure, he or she remains a sweet and sublime personality. That is why the inner expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a in the human ectoplasmic world is decidedly more sublime than His manifestation in the outer world. For He is drawing human beings, attracting them in their ectoplasmic world. He says, &ldquo;Come along, come to Me. You will have to come.&rdquo; Humanity cannot but respond to His irresistible call.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><b>Sparsha tanma&#x301;tra</b>: We cannot remain separated from Him. He is attracting through sparsha tanma&#x301;tra [touch inference]. As an Entity, Parama Purus&#x301;a is as sweet as He is soft. People experience His softness in the deepest cavity of their hearts and in the controlling point of human sentimentality. There is no scope for harshness there. When one thinks of another entity, he or she thinks with the softness of the heart, not with harshness. For instance, suppose a little girl does not go to school. Her mother, in displeasure, bursts out, &ldquo;Blast you &ndash; neglecting your studies. You naughty child! If you don&#146;t change your ways, you&#146;ll go to hell.&rdquo; Later on she has second thoughts about her words, she realizes her mistake. She tells herself, &ldquo;It wasn&#146;t proper to chastise my little child that way. Supposing she didn&#146;t go to school, what of it? I wished her death. O God, I beseech You, don&#146;t take her life. They were only words from my mouth, O Lord. I didn&#146;t really mean them.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The subterranean Cosmic flow operating in the human heart is always soft, never harsh, and there my Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and my Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi are one. This is the flow of sparsha tanma&#x301;tra in human beings. This is how Parama Purus&#x301;a is attracting people in the world of touch inferences. He does not allow people to be harsh, He wants them to remain soft. Outwardly, these soft-minded people will have to assume a harsh composure against the wicked. This is the way of the world. By nature you are not hard-hearted. There are people whom we call cruel because of their hard-heartedness. But if those very wicked persons go deeper into their beings, they will no longer remain wicked or hard-hearted. Mostly it is just that they take a superficial view of life. Had they gone deep into their minds, had they tried to realize Parama Purus&#x301;a with their sentimentality, they would certainly have felt the presence of the undercurrents of His softness. The difficulty with them is that they never go deep into their sentimentality and hence they have a tendency towards hard-heartedness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><b>Shabda tanma&#x301;tra</b>: Next comes shabda tanma&#x301;tra. Parama Purus&#x301;a is drawing the microcosms through the sound inference. The very existential feeling of jiivas lies covert in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra [the lowest psycho-spiritual plexus in the human body], and the very urge to speak gradually takes the actual form of expression through successive stages of language formation &ndash; para&#x301;, pashyanti, madhyama&#x301;, dyotama&#x301;na&#x301;, vaekharii and shrutigocara&#x301; &ndash; and finally gives rise to audible language through successive waves. When people enter the core of the world of sounds, they experience their existential feeling, along with the shabda tanma&#x301;tras, through different stages of realization: sa&#x301;lokya, sa&#x301;miipya, sa&#x301;yujya, sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya, sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi and kaevalya.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.28.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#28.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> That is, as long as the sound inferences are there, sound is very evident to them, and in the subtlest stage of shabda tanma&#x301;tra they get Parama Purus&#x301;a in the form of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. The sa&#x301;dhaka advances on the spiritual path while realizing Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma [&ldquo;Brahma is of the same nature as pran&#x301;ava&rdquo;]. But at the last stage of realization, a sa&#x301;dhaka discovers that there is no sound, because if there is no curvature, there cannot be any sound. When waves get straightened, all sounds stop &ndash; only an all-pervading silence prevails. When sound is transcended, the spiritual aspirant enjoys unbounded spiritual bliss due to perfect psycho-spiritual parallelism. This shabda tanma&#x301;tra leads human beings towards the state of communion between jiiva bha&#x301;va and Shiva bha&#x301;va. That is why Parama Purus&#x301;a has been attracting the microcosms through all the inferential perceptions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Many people come to me and say, &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;, we are sinful persons, what will befall us?&rdquo; Frankly speaking, I don&#146;t feel happy at all when I hear these words. Parama Purus&#x301;a loves saints and sinners alike. He attracts all through madhura bha&#x301;va [sweetness], not kat&#x301;hor  bha&#x301;va [harshness] &ndash; that is, through all kinds of inferential vibrations. So, why should anyone worry about his or her future? This has no proper justification. Parama Purus&#x301;a takes care of all such worries. He is always lovingly calling people very, very close to Himself through the tanma&#x301;tras. This is the central theme of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. That is, human beings are always moving, not in the Vrindavana of the physical world, but in the Vrindavana of the world of bha&#x301;va. When Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was in the Vrindavana of the physical world, there were both the physical Vrindavana and the spiritual Vrindavana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Today, for all His devotees, and even for His non-devotees, there is very much spiritual Vrindavana. And Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is always there, for He said, Vrnda&#x301;vanam&#x301; parityajya pa&#x301;damekam&#x301; na gaccha&#x301;mi [&ldquo;I won&#146;t go anywhere, not even one step, from Vrindavana&rdquo;]. This is not the terrestrial Vrindavana, but the Vrindavana of the devotee&#146;s heart. In this Vrindavana, both the devotee and the Lord are there. They are playing the game of hide and seek &ndash; now He attracts the devotee, now He hides Himself. When the devotee rushes to Him, he or she discovers that the One who was attracting from behind the scenes was actually close at hand; and so he or she attains Him.<!-- /block --></p>

Both are attracting devotees by bonds of love. This is the inner spirit of mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. When devotees feel the presence of Parama Purus&#x301;a in the Vrindavana of sentimentality and rush towards Him with all the sweetness of their hearts, then there is no difference between Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, between Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the king and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the cowherd boy; Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the yogis and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the philosophers, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the naraliila&#x301; [sport of playing a human role] and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a of the Prabhuliila&#x301; [sport of playing a divine role]. They all merge into one. The liila&#x301;nanda [sportive manifestation] aspect of Parama Purus&#x301;a is suspended into the nitya&#x301;nanda [eternal] aspect of Parama Purus&#146;a. That exalted state of realization &ndash; the highest attainment for a bhakta &ndash;  is also the supreme achievement for a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii [person of knowledge] and also for a karmii [person of action].<!-- /block --></p>

When devotees come in close proximity to this Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, then all expressions of Parama Purus&#x301;a are suspended into one supreme existence.

<a name="29..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->These two shlokas are the verbal expression of the particular devotional feeling that the jiivas realize on the eve of their total merger into the Cosmic flow, having arrived step by step at the pinnacle of devotion. This appendix is intended to explain the underlying import of these two shlokas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Vrinda&#x301;vana. The presence of Vrajagopa&#x301;la in Vrindavana is a symbolic expression of the Cosmic presence in the spiritual stratum. Normally that presence remains beyond the psychic periphery of unit beings. Vrindavana in this case does not represent the physical Vrindavana. It represents human sentimentality, the sweetest recesses of the human heart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The subtlest, the most delicate, portion of the human mind is the controlling point of human cordiality. When the human mind is focused on that particular point, it starts to experience the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;aliila&#x301; [Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s pastimes with His devotees]. The human heart, which is Vrindavana, is the nucleus of all the warmth and sweetness of the human mind. Human beings are always eager to rush towards the mohanatattva [supreme attractive force] which lies covert in the inner Vrindavana. Parama Purus&#x301;a also enhances the degree of spiritual attraction and increases the jiivas&#146; desire to rush towards Him. Due to this intense spiritual attraction the mind refuses to entertain any other psychic object. One may try in vain to persuade the mind to desist from thinking of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but even then the mind will think of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and nothing else. Human beings at that stage lose their ordinary propensities and cling to their spiritual object alone. Thus microcosmic bearing is turned into Macrocosmic bearing.<!-- /block --></p>

The one who has realized this Entity is really bha&#x301;gyaba&#x301;n [fortunate]. He or she listens to the divine music of the magic flute and is transported in joy. Therefore a mystic poet has said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="29..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->At that stage all the discriminating tendencies of spiritual aspirants are obliterated, the intellect ceases to function, and Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the naraliila&#x301; of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the physical Vrindavana, even the dust of Vraja [Vrajaren&#x301;u], all become fused into one. Strangely enough, in the human mind where innumerable thought-waves rise and fall, there remains only one thought, the thought of Vrindavana. Naraliila&#x301;. Let us come to naraliila&#x301;. The question arises, if Parama Purus&#x301;a, or Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, constantly remains in the inner Vrindavana of the human heart, then what is the necessity of His assuming human form in order to come in contact with microcosms. Why this naraliila&#x301; &ndash; the taking of human form by Parama Purus&#x301;a to fulfil His divine mission? Parama Purus&#x301;a has two manifestative aspects &ndash; nitya&#x301;nanda bha&#x301;va [Parama Purus&#x301;a in His original and impersonal form], and liila&#x301;nanda bha&#x301;va [ Parama Purus&#x301;a in His operational expression]. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a came to earth in the form of Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti for the restoration and dissemination of devotion and spiritual bha&#x301;va. To highly-evolved spiritual aspirants, the naraliila&#x301; of Parama Purus&#x301;a is as sweet as His Prabhuliila&#x301;, or nitya&#x301;nanda bha&#x301;va. So the devotee who has established perfect parallelism with the Cosmic flow of Parama Purus&#x301;a is bound to sing the glories of naraliila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Govardhana cetanashiila&#x301;. &ldquo;Govardhana&rdquo; in common parlance refers to the Govardhana Mountain where Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a played His divine sport. However, the subtle significance is this: Go means the indriyas, and vardhana means &ldquo;nourishment&rdquo;. So govardhana means &ldquo;that which sustains and develops the indriyas&rdquo;. And cetanashiila&#x301; means &ldquo;living stone&rdquo; [a stone which expands in volume over time]. Due to the desire of my beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the indriyas and microcosmic minds develop like a cetanashiila&#x301;. When the entire capacity of the indriyas is pinnacled, the indriyas  become suspended in the mind, and the mind becomes suspended in Parama Purus&#x301;a. To the extent that the indriyas are not developed, people think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is as inaccessible as a jewel lying at the bottom of the ocean, as the stars in the sky. Conversely, when the indriyas are developed, one feels that He is no longer inaccessible. Hence jaya Govardhana cetanashiila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Shrii Yamuna&#x301;. Just as there is a Yamuna River in the physical sphere, in the subtle psychic sphere also there is a certain flow which leads microcosms towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. It was by the Yamuna that Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a used to move, playing His divine sport. To the devotees the Yamuna remains a hallowed memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Vrajaren&#x301;u. &ldquo;Vraja&rdquo; ordinarily means the land of Mathura where Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a played His unique and historical role, and ren&#x301;u means dust particles. Vraja in the philosophical sense implies movement while getting joy. When spiritual aspirants move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, it does not denote physical movement but psychic movement. This movement in the world of bha&#x301;va is called vraja parikrama&#x301; [circumambulation in the psycho-spiritual sphere]. This vraja parikrama&#x301; is a sacred act. Just as in the naraliila&#x301; of my beloved Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a every dust particle of Vraja became sacred due to the holy visits of countless devotees, so the bha&#x301;varen&#x301;u of the paths of the psycho-spiritual world, trodden by countless sa&#x301;dhakas, is equally sacred. Hence the heart of the devotee sings jaya to Vrajaren&#x301;u.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Kuin&#x32D;javana. In ordinary parlance, kuin&#x32D;javana means an arbour, a small place surrounded by foliage. In the spiritual sphere, kuin&#x32D;javana implies a very secret cavity in the human heart from where Parama Purus&#x301;a sends out His irresistible divine call to His numerous devotees. This kuin&#x32D;javana is the favourite haunt of Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. If it had not been for kuin&#x32D;javana, from where would He have sent out His divine call?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->[Gopika&#x301;ven&#x301;u. Ven&#x301;u means &ldquo;bamboo flute&rdquo;, and gopika&#x301;ven&#x301;u means &ldquo;a flute which emits melodious notes regaling the hearts of devotees&rdquo;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Hence gopika&#x301;ven&#x301;u and kuin&#x32D;javana are equally dear to devotees. When the jiivas are about to merge their microcosmic existence in the Macrocosmic existence, they become confused. They remain in ecstasy while thinking about physical things such as Govardhana, cetanashiila&#x301;, Shrii Yamuna&#x301;, Vrajaren&#x301;u, kuin&#x32D;javana and gopika&#x301;ven&#x301;u. They make no differentiation between things of the mundane and spiritual worlds. They sing the glories of naraliila&#x301; at one moment, and at the next moment they sing the glories of Parama Purus&#x301;a, or Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. However, the mental balance is tipped in favour of Parama Purus&#x301;a, Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Finally arrives the long-awaited aparoks&#x301;a anubhu&#x301;ti [direct realization]. In that auspicious moment the sa&#x301;dhaka fully comprehends the hidden import of the supreme stance and cries out in joy, &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, I couldn&#146;t realize You until now. But now I understand that You are that very Gopa&#x301;lapa&#x301;laka, Shishupa&#x301;lapa&#x301;laka.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Here gopa&#x301;la means the jiiva&#x301;tman. That is, gopa&#x301;la means the forces of light. Go, as I have already said, means indriya, and gopa&#x301;la means the reflecting plate of the indriyas, that is, the jiiva&#x301;tman. Parama Purus&#x301;a is &ldquo;Gopa&#x301;lapa&#x301;la&rdquo; [pa&#x301;la means &ldquo;protector&rdquo;] because He is the lord of all jiiva&#x301;tmas.<!-- /block --></p>

So Parama Purus&#x301;a is also &ldquo;Shishupa&#x301;lapa&#x301;la&rdquo; because He does not annihilate those forces, but instead creates a congenial environment for their evolution to higher stages of existence. It implies that just as the Lord protects the virtuous in a positive way, He also protects the wicked in another way which is proper for them. He is the protector of both sinners and saints. Hence I salute that Shriikrs&#x301;n&#x301;acandram, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram [Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a the Beautiful], the repository of endless virtues.
