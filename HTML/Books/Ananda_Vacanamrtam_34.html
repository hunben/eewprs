<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam (&ldquo;Blissful Discourses&rdquo;) series assembles all the known General Darshan discourses given by Ma&#x301;rga Guru Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti. General Darshan (GD) pravacanas, or discourses, were those given to Ananda Marga members, often as a part of the daily routine, in whatever locality Ma&#x301;rga Guru happened to be staying in at the time. Normally briefer and lighter in tone (though no less profound in their fundamental meanings) than the discourses given on the formal occasions of Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (DMC), these pravacanas were sometimes delivered in a very intimate way to relatively small groups of Margis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam series was begun in 1978 with the GD discourses given by the author at that time; it then kept pace with the GD discourses that the author gave over the subsequent six years. Starting with Part 23, the series has included GD pravacanas given before 1978. Starting with that part, the series has comprised discourses recovered from old tapes, old magazines, and typed or handwritten notes. The present Part 34 comprises exclusively material from old tapes, and comprises the last remaining known General Darshans that were given in English and that have been recovered in the form of still-audible tapes (or in the form of magazine articles or notes). It is still possible, however, that further unpublished English General Darshans will yet come to light.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The present A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam includes two of Ma&#x301;rga Guru&#146;s pravacanas that lacked indication of date or place, but are thought, from their proximity to other material on the tapes, to be from his overseas tours in 1979. &ldquo;Plus and Minus Make It Zero&rdquo; is thought to be from Timmern, and &ldquo;He Thinks and We Perceive&rdquo; from Reykjavik. &ldquo;To Save Humanity&rdquo; was given in Frankfurt, and &ldquo;Be Free From All Complexes&rdquo; in Caracas, on the second of those tours.<!-- /block --></p>

In the case of A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 34, tapes are in existence for all the discourses.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Many readers are concerned that the author&#146;s discourses, as published, should adhere as closely as possible to the precise wording the author used in speaking. For this reason, in the case of discourses given originally in English, the editors have not altered pronouns and other terms which the author in his lifetime considered &ldquo;common-gender&rdquo; words. As the author once said, &ldquo;You know, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is not only masculine gender, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is common gender also. &lsquo;Man is mortal&rsquo; &ndash; here &lsquo;man&rsquo; means both male and female.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The author was a natural advocate of women&#146;s rights and on at least one occasion indicated that &ldquo;lopsided justice&rdquo; in language should be eliminated at some future date. In keeping with this guideline and with present-day trends, it is our policy in the case of translated discourses (where the published wording will necessarily be that of the translators) to use gender-neutral language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions.

And after acquiring the elementary knowledge &ndash; you know, in jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na there are two classes, two varieties. One is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, another is vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam and vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam. Knowledge regarding mundane entities &ndash; engineering science, medical science, art, architecture, literature &ndash; these are all mundane knowledge, worldly knowledge. Such knowledge is called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam. And knowledge regarding spiritual science is called vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now, after acquiring knowledge, one is to do accordingly. One is to do something practical. That doing something practical is karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. So after jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam, after knowing what to do, how to do, the sa&#x301;dhaka, the spiritual aspirant, is to do accordingly. This doing is karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And the resultant of the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and the karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is bhakti. So bhakti is not a sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, bhakti is not a practice. It is the resultant of two practices &ndash; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So in the basic stage, in the primordial stage, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam has a certain value for a sa&#x301;dhaka, for a spiritual aspirant.

<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Just now I said that bhakti is the resultant of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam and karma.

It is possible because bhakti is the resultant of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. That child did jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in his past life.

But bhaktireva gariiyasii &ndash; &ldquo;bhakti is the best,&rdquo; because it is the final, it is the subtlest factor. That&#146;s why the sa&#x301;dhaka says: Moks&#x301;aka&#x301;ran&#x301;asamagrya&#x301;m&#x301; bhaktireva gariiyasii. You sa&#x301;dhakas, you must remember this factor, you must remember this point. Here, all your karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and all your jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; are finally to become pinnacled factors, pinnacled into bhakti sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Without bhakti, one cannot come in contact with the Lord. And you must remember that bhakti is not a sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, it is not a practice; it is the resultant of two practices, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam and karma.

The cult that liberates the spiritual aspirant by helping him in expanding his mind and spirit is Tantra, &ldquo;liberation through expansion&rdquo;. Unless and until the mind becomes great, one cannot get liberation, one cannot attain spiritual salvation. That&#146;s why the spiritual cult is called Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>

The depraving forces, debasing forces, become very active, and the sa&#x301;dhaka is to enlarge his mind and spirit by fighting at each and every step, each and every stage of life. In his mind there will be those two belligerent forces; that is, the spiritual force and the debasing material force will start fighting amongst each other in the mind.

It is for the brave, it is for courageous people. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;samara. And this cult is the cult of Tantra. He who wants to keep himself away from fight is unknowingly committing suicide, mental and spiritual suicide. Each and every man should be ready for fight &ndash; fight in the mental stratum, fight in the family stratum, fight in each and every stratum of life. This is Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>

Here we see regarding your indriyas, that is, the motor and sensory organs, that this world is the object and they are the subjects. But when the relationship between the indriyas and the citta [objective mind, mind-stuff] is concerned, the indriyas are the objects and the citta is the subject. And when the relationship of citta and<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the ego, or aham, is concerned, the citta is the object, and the aham is the subject. Now in the case of aham and mahat (aham means doer &ldquo;I&rdquo; and mahat means pure &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;), the aham is the object and the mahat &ndash; &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; &ldquo;I exist,&rdquo; aham asmi &ndash; is the subject. And in case of this pure &ldquo;I&rdquo; and the a&#x301;tman [soul], this &ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I exist,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am&rdquo; &ndash; is the object and the a&#x301;tman is the subject.<!-- /block --></p>

In every being there is an &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I am Narayanaswami, I belong to Salem, I exist.&rdquo; So this &ldquo;I&rdquo;, this &ldquo;I-exist&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo;, is the mahat. And you know &ndash; you know &ndash; that there is a feeling of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; in you. And I know that there is a feeling of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; in me. This &ldquo;I know&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I know&rdquo; &ndash; is the a&#x301;tman. The &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I know&rdquo; is the a&#x301;tman, and the &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; is the mahat, the mahattattva, the pure mental &ldquo;I&rdquo;, the supreme mental &ldquo;I&rdquo;, the subtlest part of the mind. But &ldquo;I know I exist&rdquo; &ndash; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; of &ldquo;I know&rdquo; &ndash; is the a&#x301;tman. It is not mind, it is the knower of mind, knower of &ndash; what? The feeling that &ldquo;I exist.&rdquo; So the a&#x301;tman is the subject within your structure, within your existence. Within the realm of the microcosm, the a&#x301;tman is the subject, and all other objects are either its direct object or its indirect objects.<!-- /block --></p>

Because He is the supreme &ndash; in Sanskrit &ldquo;supreme&rdquo; is parama &ndash; He is known as Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. He is the Supreme Subject.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->I said: &ldquo;What is cult?&rdquo; It is subjective approach, that is, your movement is towards that Supreme Subject, not towards bookish knowledge. Not to aggrandize yourself, but to goad yourself unto the path of beatitude, towards the Supreme Subject. Hence the approach of cult is a subjective approach. Yours is a subjective approach. But while moving towards the Supreme Subject, while moving towards the Terminus of your life, while moving towards the culminating point of your life, you have to pass through the world of objectivities. You are born; the things of this physical earth are all objectivities; but your march is towards the Supreme Subjectivity. So in you there must be an equilibrium, a balance, an equipoise, between subjective approach and objective adjustment. You must pass through this world of objects keeping a close contact and a balance<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> with this objective world; you must not ignore this world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->You must not neglect this world, you must not cheat yourself by saying that everything is illusory, it is nothing. No, it is not nothing, it is something. When you are speaking these words with the help of physical energy, then that physical energy is also nothing, and when you say, &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; then that &ldquo;It is nothing&rdquo; is also nothing. Because you are speaking with the help of energy. But energy is nothing, vocal cord is nothing, sound is nothing, so your utterance is also nothing. So a sa&#x301;dhaka must not cheat himself by saying this. A sa&#x301;dhaka must not engage in a self-cheating business. His should be a clear-cut approach, a subjective approach through objective adjustment. So this is the supreme path. It is the proper path. It is <i>the</i> path. You have got nothing to do with the intellectual extravaganza of so-called logicians and philosophers.<!-- /block --></p>

A sa&#x301;dhaka is to strengthen his vidya&#x301;, his centripetal force, in his movement towards the nave of this Cosmological order, towards the nucleus of this Cosmological order &ndash; because of the fact that this Cosmological nucleus is the nucleus of all other nuclei of the universe.

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->And the idea functioning behind a&#x301;sakti, that is, desire for something limited, something finite, is called ka&#x301;ma. And when the mind is withdrawn from all those physical and intellectual objectivities and guided towards that supreme non-causal spiritual entity, then that flow, rather, that mental propulsion, is called bhakti, or devotion. The mentality is called bhakti, and the idea functioning behind it is called prema. So there is hardly any difference between prema and devotion. In the practical field, I say that both salvation and devotion are causal entities. They are not non-causal. They are created within the scope of physicality and intellectuality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now, how to attain bhakti, how to withdraw the mind from baser propensities and drive it towards the subtlest entity, the abhiis&#x301;t&#x301;a? The simplest formula is &ldquo;action minus jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam [knowledge] is equal to devotion&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;karma minus jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam is equal to bhakti.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Suppose a man has rendered five hundred degrees of social service, selfless service, to society. Now in his stock of karma there is five hundred degrees. Now subtract jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam. Suppose he is an illiterate fellow, he knows nothing, so his stock of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam will be zero. Five hundred minus zero is equal to [the resultant] devotion. He earned five hundred degrees of devotion. And that&#146;s why you will find that in the case of less-educated people, devotion is developed very quickly. And the so-called intellectuals suffer from the ailment of their intellectuality. They suffer from a sort of mental ailment, mental disease. They think &ldquo;I know this, I know that, I know this, I know that.&rdquo; But they know nothing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Once I said that if a man thinks that he is a master of geography, and in that case I ask him &ldquo;O gentleman, can you say how many bricks there are in this town of Bangalore?&rdquo; he won&#146;t be able to give a satisfactory reply. But this question comes within the scope of geography.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, suppose a man is an MA in twenty subjects and his stock of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam is four hundred degrees. But he rendered five hundred degrees of selfless social service to society. In that case his balance of bhakti will be five hundred minus four hundred, equal to one hundred. So in this case jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam is nothing but a liability. And if he wants to acquire five hundred degrees of bhakti, just like that illiterate fellow, what will he have to do? He will have to render nine hundred degrees of social service. Nine hundred minus four hundred is equal to five hundred. So for the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis &ndash; I won&#146;t discourage jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam, although I am not a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii, but I will ask the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii to render more selfless service to society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So this is bhakti. Now, bhakti is withdrawing the mind from crude objectivities. And the psychological principle for attaining salvation is also that &ndash; it is withdrawing the mind and guiding it unto the Supreme Self. So fundamentally there is no difference.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now you know, in the case of bhakti there are so many types, so many varieties. You know there are so-called bhaktis and there are actual bhaktis. Among so-called bhaktis, you know, there are three varieties  &ndash; static bhakti, mutative bhakti and sentient bhakti, sentient devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What is static devotion? You say: &ldquo;O Lord, O Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, Mr. X is my enemy. Please kill him.&rdquo; [laughter] It will not be possible for a man to get Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a by this type of bhakti. Why? His longing was to kill Mr. X and not to get Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. So Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a may or may not grant his request, may or may not kill Mr. X, but because his desire was not to get Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, it is sure that he won&#146;t get Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

Pran&#x301;ava should be his dhanu [bow].&rdquo; What is pran&#x301;ava? It is a Sanskrit word &ndash;  pra prefix, nu root verb, al suffix &ndash; pran&#x301;ava. &ldquo;That which helps you in reaching a particular place  is pran&#x301;ava.&rdquo; That very thing, that very incantation, that helps you in reaching your goal, reaching the final, the culminating, point of all human destinies, is pran&#x301;ava. For a sa&#x301;dhaka, his personal incantation, his own Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra, is pran&#x301;ava, and in a general sense this word pran&#x301;ava is used for on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra also. Because this on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, the sound on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, emanates from the Supreme Nucleus of this Cosmological order; and so the sa&#x301;dhaka, the man who comes in contact with that divine sound, certainly reaches the goal, the source of the sound. He who comes in contact with the Ganges is sure to come in contact with Gaun&#x32D;gottarii from where the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; starts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Pran&#x301;ava. Another name of pran&#x301;ava is on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. It is a combination of three sounds &ndash; the first one is a, the second one is u, and the third one is ma. A-u-ma. A is the acoustic root of creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Whenever something is done, that action is represented by a certain sound, colour and several other inferences. You are laughing &ndash; the sound ha&#x301;-ha&#x301;-ha&#x301;-ha&#x301; is created. Now, that vibration ha&#x301;-ha&#x301;-ha&#x301;-ha&#x301; is the acoustic root of your action of laughing. Do you follow? You are walking &ndash; the sound khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301; is created. This sound khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301; is the acoustic root of your action of walking. So &ldquo;acoustic root&rdquo; means actional, functional representative of the vibration. So when the Macrocosm, when the Macrocosmic Self, creates something, certainly during the phase of creation a certain sound is created. He creates, He creates in His mind, and because He is creating, vibrations are also created. When you create an action, and vibrations are created, certainly sounds are also created. And the sound of creation, the sound created during His phase of creation, during the phase when He creates the universe, is the sound a. Just as ha&#x301;-ha&#x301;-ha&#x301;-ha&#x301; is the acoustic root of laughing, similarly a, the first letter a, is the acoustic root of creating. So when the Supreme Father creates this universe, the sound a is created.<!-- /block --></p>

A. A is the first vowel and first letter. Now I think you have understood why a is the first letter and why not ka or i? But a babe of primary school will not understand these things. If, when he first comes in contact with a in his life, he asks his teacher why a is the first letter, then it will be very difficult to make him understand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Then after creation, what will be His second action, what will be the second phase in this realm of creation? To maintain, to preserve, to nourish, to serve the created beings. After creation, after the birth of the child, what is the duty of the mother? To feed the babe. So to maintain is the second phase of creation. Now, the acoustic root of this action of maintaining, action of serving, action of preserving, is u. A then u.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And after that, the last phase is destruction. The last phase of this Cosmological order is destruction.

The last varga [phonetic group] is pa-pha-ba-bha-ma. Ma is the last letter of the vargiiya varn&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301;. After that is antahstha varn&#x301;a [semi-vowel letters], ya-ra-la-va.

<a name="8..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->A plus u. As per the Sanskrit sandhi [transition] rule, a plus u becomes o. So a plus u and ma become on&#x32D;m.

<a name="9..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->And the third meaning is &ldquo;the Cosmic Operative Principle&rdquo;. Ayana means &ldquo;shelter&rdquo;. So Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a means &ldquo;shelter of the Cosmic Operative Principle&rdquo;. That Operative Principle may be in the basic state, may be in the primordial state, may be in the vibrational state, but He is the shelter of that Operative Principle. He is the ayana of Na&#x301;ra &ndash; Na&#x301;rasya ayana ityarthe Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. The Cosmic Cognitive Principle is the Transcendent Entity, and the Cosmic Operative Principle is His innate principle. The Cosmic Operative Principle is not a transcendental entity, it is an innate principle. So the Cosmic Transcendental Entity is the Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a &ndash; &ldquo;the shelter of Prakrti, shelter of the Operative Principle&rdquo;. Hence He is called Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Another popular name is &ldquo;Ma&#x301;dhava&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ma&#x301;dhava&rdquo; also means Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. The word ma&#x301; has two meanings. One meaning of ma&#x301; is indriya &ndash; [motor or] sensory organ. Another meaning of ma&#x301; is &ldquo;the Operative Principle&rdquo;. And dhava means &ldquo;controller&rdquo;, dhava means &ldquo;owner&rdquo;, dhava means &ldquo;husband&rdquo;. So &ldquo;Ma&#x301;dhava&rdquo; means &ldquo;the Controller of the Cosmic Operative Principle&rdquo;. So &ldquo;Ma&#x301;dhava&rdquo; and Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a have got the same meaning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Another popular name is Iishvara. One meaning of Iishvara is &ldquo;Controller&rdquo; &ndash; He who controls all the functional business of the universe is Iishvara. Another meaning of Iishvara is &ldquo;He who has got aeshvarya&rdquo;. Aeshvarya means certain occult powers. He who has developed certain occult powers is Iishvara. And another meaning of Iishvara is Kleshakarmavipa&#x301;ka&#x301;sha&#x301;yaerapara&#x301;mrs&#x301;t&#x301;ah Purus&#x301;avishes&#x301;a Iishvarah &ndash;  &ldquo;He who remains unassailed by worldly pains and sufferings, by actions, and who remains unaffected by unserved sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, by reactive momenta, is Iishvara.&rdquo; And vipa&#x301;ka&#x301;sha&#x301;yaeh &ndash; &ldquo;and who requires no shelter, who is not to be ensconced in any other shelter&rdquo;, is Iishvara.<!-- /block --></p>

Bhagava&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>

He who is the maker of the system, He who is the maker of the constitution, and He who is the first follower of that constitution, is sva&#x301;dha&#x301;.

<a name="9..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; ma&#x301;rga, spiritual aspirants are called Brahma sa&#x301;dhaka. Why is this word Brahma sa&#x301;dhaka used for spiritual aspirants? Although the Cosmic Consciousness, that is, the Cognitive Principle, is the object of ideation of all spiritual aspirants, still a sa&#x301;dhaka is called a Brahma sa&#x301;dhaka. Spiritual aspirants are called Brahma sa&#x301;dhakas &ndash; why? Brahma is the collective name of the Cosmic Cognitive Principle and the Cosmic Operative Principle. Although the Cognitive Principle is the object of ideation, a spiritual aspirant cannot keep himself away from, aloof from, worldly business, because his physical structure is a part of this quinquelemental world. He cannot remain away from this observable universe. His mental structure is also an expression of the Macropsychic conation. So he will have to come in contact with physicality. But while coming in contact with physicality, certainly for some time he will have to accept physical objects as his object of ideation; and if any physical object is taken as an object of ideation, what will happen? He will dart himself away from the nave of the universe. This darting away from the nave of the universe means negative introversion. A sa&#x301;dhaka, a spiritual aspirant, cannot do this. So while coming in contact with any object of this quinquelemental world, he will have to ascribe Brahma-hood to those objects. This ascription of Brahma-hood saves him from downfall.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Human longings are trilateral [physical, mental and spiritual], so he will have to come in contact with physical objects, and he will have to ascribe Brahma-hood to those physical objects. And those physical objects are not a creation of the Cognitive Principle or of the Operative Principle, but a creation of both of them. Both of them have jointly created this universe. So while ascribing Brahma-hood, he will have to think of Prakrti also. That&#146;s why a spiritual aspirant is not called Purus&#x301;a sa&#x301;dhaka or Prakrti sa&#x301;dhaka; He is called Brahma sa&#x301;dhaka. And as you are all spiritual aspirants, I would like you to be Brahma sa&#x301;dhakas, and your life<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.9.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#9.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> should be a proper adjustment amongst your physical longings, your intellectual longings, and your spiritual longings.

The root verb ram plus the suffix ghain&#x32D; makes the word &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma&rdquo; means &ldquo;source of enjoyment&rdquo;. The object from which yogis get pleasure is Ra&#x301;ma &ndash; Ra&#x301;mante yoginah yasmin. Here &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; means &ldquo;supramundane beatitude&rdquo;, &ldquo;supramundane blessedness&rdquo;. This is the meaning of the word &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ma&rdquo;.

<a name="10..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The next word is Shiva. Shiva also means &ldquo;Consciousness&rdquo;. In ancient times, about 6500 years ago, there was a great, great yogi in India named Shiva, or Sada&#x301;shiva. He always maintained His spiritual unison with the Supreme Cognitive Principle, with the Supreme Self. And His unison with the Supreme Self was never interrupted by any worldly vibrations. It was without any break, without any pause. And that&#146;s why other yogis accepted Him as their object of adoration, and He became &ldquo;Maha&#x301;yogi&rdquo;. So in late Sanskrit, the word Shiva was also used in the sense of &ldquo;Cosmic Consciousness&rdquo;, in the sense of &ldquo;Cosmic blessedness&rdquo;, in the sense of the eternal ocean of existence. So Shiva also means the Cosmic Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>

So these spokes, these vibrations, these innumerable vibrations, are called deva. Deva means &ldquo;divine vibration&rdquo;; deva means &ldquo;divine effulgence&rdquo;. And &ldquo;Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo; means &ldquo;Supreme Deva&rdquo;; that is, this hub, this hub of the wheel, this nave of the wheel, this nucleus of this Cosmological order, is Maha&#x301;deva.

<a name="11..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In ancient times there were two recognized stages in the process of initiation. The first one was Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;, that is, initiation as per the Vaedik [Vedic] school of thought, and the second one was Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;, that is, initiation as per Tantra. The most important mantra in Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; was the &ldquo;Ga&#x301;yattrii Mantra&rdquo;. The spirit of Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; was to pray to God to get the proper path, the path of bliss; and the spirit of Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; was to move along that path. In the first phase the aspirant requested God to show the path, and in the second phase the sa&#x301;dhaka had to move along that path.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.11.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#11.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And this &ldquo;Ga&#x301;yattrii Mantra&rdquo; was the most important mantra in Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now, what&#146;s the meaning of ga&#x301;yattrii? It is a common error to say that that mantra is the &ldquo;Ga&#x301;yattrii Mantra&rdquo;; because ga&#x301;yattrii is not the name of a mantra, it is the name of a chanda. In the Vedas, there are seven recognized chandas, that is, seven recognized rhythms. Those rhythms are ga&#x301;yattrii, us&#x301;n&#x301;iik, tris&#x301;t&#x301;up, anus&#x301;t&#x301;up, jagati, brhatii and paunkti. So ga&#x301;yattrii is a chanda, ga&#x301;yattrii is a rhythm, and not a mantra. And this particular mantra of Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; was composed in ga&#x301;yattrii chanda. The speciality, the special feature, of ga&#x301;yattrii chanda is that it requires twenty-[four] syllables. To compose a poem it requires a chanda, and there should be three lines with eight syllables in each line &ndash; three times eight, twenty-four syllables. For each and every mantra of the Vedas, there are three requisite factors, three essentialities. These three essentialities are chanda, a rs&#x301;i, and a devata&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Chanda means the rhythm in which that mantra will be composed. Here in the case of this particular mantra, the chanda is ga&#x301;yattrii. Ga&#x301;yantam&#x301; ta&#x301;rayet yastu &ndash; &ldquo;By chanting which one can get the path of liberation&rdquo; is ga&#x301;yattrii. Ga&#x301;yat (gae dha&#x301;tu [root verb] + shatr) + trae dha&#x301;tu + d&#x301;a + uniip = ga&#x301;yattrii. Do you follow? Here the chanda is ga&#x301;yattrii, then the next requisite factor is a devata&#x301;, and finally a rs&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The devata&#x301; is a particular word which has been used for a god, and according to that word<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.11.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#11.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the mantra is to be made. In this particular mantra, God has been addressed by the word &ldquo;Savita&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; Tat Savitur varen&#x301;yam. &ldquo;Savita&#x301;&rdquo;. Hence the<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.11.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#11.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  official name of this mantra is the &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo;.

<a name="11..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And the third important factor is a rs&#x301;i. Rs&#x301;i means he who composed that mantra.

Sanskrit is written in various scripts of different portions of India.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.11.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#11.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Sanskrit has no script of its own.

Manana&#x301;t &ndash; &ldquo;by chanting internally&rdquo; &ndash; ta&#x301;rayet yastu &ndash; &ldquo;that which liberates&rdquo; &ndash; is man-tra.

A is the acoustic root of the action of creation &ndash; do you follow? Wherever there is an action, there is some vibration, and wherever there is vibration there is sound.

<a name="12..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Svadeham. Sva means &ldquo;one&#146;s&rdquo;; deha means &ldquo;body&rdquo;. In Sanskrit there are several terms for &ldquo;body&rdquo; &ndash; deham, shariiram, ka&#x301;yam, tanu &ndash; there are so many words. But their meanings are not the same. Tanu &ndash; the root verb tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;; tanu means &ldquo;the wonted expansionist&rdquo;; to expand is its wont, to expand is its characteristic. That is, the body of a babe, the body of a man below thirty-nine years of age, is called tanu. Because up to the age of thirty-nine, the body goes on increasing either internally or externally. And after thirty-nine decay starts, waning starts. So the name for the body after thirty-nine is shariira. To become shiirn&#x301;a is its svabha&#x301;va [nature]. To wane is its svabha&#x301;va. Hence the body of a man after thirty-nine years of age is called shariiram. Shariiram means &ldquo;[that which is] decaying&rdquo;, &ldquo;[that which is] waning&rdquo;. Another word is ka&#x301;yam. The root verb is ci, and the suffix is [ghain&#x32D;]. Ci means &ldquo;to select&rdquo;, &ldquo;to choose&rdquo;, &ldquo;to pluck&rdquo;. Now, in this body there is oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, gold, iron, mercury, and so many factors and so many elements. So this body is an assemblage of so many items. Hence it is called ka&#x301;yam. Ka&#x301;yam means &ldquo;assemblage&rdquo;. And here in this shloka the word deha has been used. Here the root verb is dih. In Sanskrit dih means &ldquo;to adorn&rdquo;, &ldquo;to decorate&rdquo;. So deha means &ldquo;the object that one wants to keep decorated&rdquo;, which is one&#146;s object of adoration. An ugly-looking man also tries to keep his body well-decorated, thus it is  called deha. A man has got maximum attachment for his deha &ndash; not for tanu or shariiram or ka&#x301;yam, but for deha. So here the word deha has been used by the rs&#x301;i, and not shariiram or ka&#x301;yam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Svadeham aran&#x301;im&#x301; krtva&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;The spiritual aspirant should use his deha as aran&#x301;i.&rdquo; What is aran&#x301;i? Aran&#x301;i means &ldquo;wood used as fuel&rdquo;. In ancient times there were no matches. They had to create fire by friction. Now, the main piece of wood was called aran&#x301;i, and the smaller one used for rubbing was called uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. So here the spiritual aspirant should use his deha, the main object of his attachment, as aran&#x301;i, and pran&#x301;ava, that is, his Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra [mantra leading one to the Supreme Goal], as uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. Do you follow? That is, his physical body, his deha, should be in constant touch with his Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra.<!-- /block --></p>

Now what is its inner import? What is the import? The human body has a particular rhythm; each and every human body has its peculiar rhythm. And that rhythm is a creation of the person&#146;s reactive momenta. So that rhythm separates him from all other objects of this universe. The reactive momenta of two persons are not the same. So the entitative rhythm of a particular man is purely his. And, just now I said, the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra is to be used as uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. The Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra has a particular acoustic rhythm. Each and every mantra has its own acoustic rhythm. So the entitative rhythm of the spiritual aspirant must be in constant touch with the incantative rhythm of his Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra. That is, a sa&#x301;dhaka, a spiritual aspirant, should always try to make an adjustment between his entitative rhythm and incantative rhythm. And when that adjustment is established he attains the supreme trance of qualified absorption. And this is his goal. Svadeham aran&#x301;im&#x301; krtva&#x301; pran&#x301;avam&#x301; ca uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;im&#x301;. Why should the pran&#x301;ava be used as uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i? That has now been clearly explained. And after that what will happen? Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nanirmathana&#x301;bhya&#x301;sat pa&#x301;sham dahati pan&#x301;d&#x301;itah [&ldquo;A pandit breaks the fetters by churning knowledge (to separate the spiritual from the mundane)&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nanirmathana. Actually the word jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means &ldquo;subjectivization of external objectivities&rdquo;. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam &ndash; the actual import of the term jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam is &ldquo;subjectivization of external physicalities, of external objectives&rdquo;. Now here the rs&#x301;i [sage, author of the shloka, or couplet] prescribes jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam nirmathanam. Nirmathana means &ldquo;to churn&rdquo;. We get butter by churning curd. Now in this jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam there are so many objects &ndash; there is name, there is fame, there is money, there is landed property, there are so many items. Now by churning this jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam the spiritual aspirant separates a&#x301;tman, the mu&#x301;lavastu [basic substance], from the impurities, from the mundane impurities. That is, by churning jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam you are to separate the spirit from the impurities. And that&#146;s why nirmathanam is required. And this nirmathanam is being done by &ndash; what? By this ghars&#x301;anakriya&#x301; [rubbing] of aran&#x301;i and uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i.

So as a result of this friction what happens? Certainly spiritual fire is created, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;gni is created; and what will that sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;gni do? All the impurities of the mind will cease to exist, will be destroyed; and he who does these things is a pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita.<!-- /block --></p>

Pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;knowing the hub of this Cosmological order&rdquo;. And he who has acquired pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; is a pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita.

And the sound ra is the acoustic root of energy. Sha plus ra is equal to shra. In the feminine it becomes shrii. The sha represents the mutative principle, and ra represents energy; and shrii means &ldquo;activating charm&rdquo;, &ldquo;charm that activates&rdquo;.

But you know, the external mundanity always tries to deprave a sa&#x301;dhaka, so he will have to fight a ceaseless battle against these depraving factors.

He should remember that he may be a sinner, but still he is the child of that Parama Purus&#x301;a; Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot hate him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->You know, once there was an altercation between a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii and a bhakta. The bhakta asked the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii: &ldquo;You jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii, can you say what my Parama Purus&#x301;a, what my Lord, cannot do?&rdquo; And the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii was in a fix to say what the Lord cannot do. So the bhakta gave a reply. He said: &ldquo;My Lord, my Parama Purus&#x301;a, My Supreme Father, cannot do two things. One is, He cannot create another Parama Purus&#x301;a. [laughter] He cannot create another Parama Purus&#x301;a like Him. It is His first defect. [laughter] The first disqualification is, He cannot create another Parama Purus&#x301;a. And the second disqualification is, He cannot hate anybody. Even if so desired by Him &ndash; suppose He desires to hate a particular man &ndash; no, He hasn&#146;t got the capacity to hate others, He cannot hate others. These are the two disqualifications, defects, of Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->You know, it is the human wont that whenever two or three persons assemble, what do they naturally do?

So what will an intelligent man do? He will do &ndash; what? Utilize that time. You know, people say: &ldquo;An idle mind is the devil&#146;s workshop.&rdquo; So intelligent people will utilize their time in kiirtaniiyah sada&#x301; Harih [&ldquo;always do kiirtana to the Lord&rdquo;]. Whenever they will get any spare time, they will do the kiirtana of Hari.<!-- /block --></p>

Why should I give You my sins?&rdquo; He won&#146;t allow; he won&#146;t give the permission. So Hari is to steal his sins secretly. That&#146;s why He is the Supreme Stealer also.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->But in the case of developed animals and humans, all is not only inborn; some things are imposed. And not only imposed, there are some things developed by themselves. In them, that is, in developed animals and in humans, there are both genius and technician. But in the case of undeveloped animals, there is nothing like a genius or technician.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You know, genius is an inborn faculty. And what is a technician? &ldquo;Technician&rdquo; means that an ordinary faculty is developed to an extraordinary degree of efficiency. This can be done by developed creatures and humans. Tamed dogs, tamed monkeys, may do many a thing, because although animals, they are developed animals. But genius you will hardly find in any developed animal. You will find it only in humans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now when a man gets the chance to enjoy physico-psychic pleasures, he does not find any interest in physical pleasures, because physical pleasure is not only crude in quality, but also of very temporary nature. It lasts for a short span. On the psychic level, man is the dominating living being. He does something new, he wants to do something new, to get more psychic pleasures; and he invents so many things, and engages himself in psychic pursuits. These things cannot be done by [undeveloped] animals or even by other developed creatures. And here lies the speciality of human beings. But I will not say that it is the speciality of human beings, because in psychic spheres the pleasure you get is nothing but a sort of positive projection of your mind. It creates nothing concrete, nothing lasting. And whenever this sort of positive projection takes place, there comes another projection, a negative projection, just to bring the mind back to normalcy. That is, the psychic pleasure that you get is counteracted or neutralized by a negative projection &ndash; by the pain you get due to a negative projection. Plus and minus make it zero. So I said there cannot be any development or any progress in physical or psychic spheres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now in the case of psycho-spiritual approach, what happens? Human approach towards spiritual affairs means fighting against the limitations of time, space and person. So it is the best wont of human beings. And here lies the difference between man and animal. Even the developed animals cannot do it. Now in the course of this psycho-spiritual advancement, when the particular aspirant crosses the silver line of demarcation between relativity and absolute, he goes beyond the touch of all mundane bondages. And that is the final destination, and that is the desideratum, of all human beings. And this approach of humans is called <i>Bha&#x301;gavata dharma</i>. It is the proper dharma, it is the actual dharma. All other ideas are based on isms and dogmas. They can function within the scope of three relativities &ndash; temporal, personal and spatial factors. The man who is intelligent should from his very childhood move along this path of psycho-spirituality. The sooner a man starts or moves along this path of psycho-spirituality, the better it is. He is the blessed one.<!-- /block --></p>

And that&#146;s why everything in this universe of ours is moving. Nothing is fixed, nothing is stationary; everthing will have to move. And why will everything have to move? Because whatever we see, and whatever we think, and whatever comes within the scope of our inferences, are moving within the Cosmic Mind, are moving within the mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He thinks and we perceive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->All inferences are emanated from the Cosmic Mind, from the mind of the Supreme Father. You are dancing, you will be dancing; but these dances you are dancing within the mind of your Supreme Father. You are dancing within the mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a. You are dancing in His mind; your dances are creating a special type of vibration within His mind; it gives Him pleasure. You are doing good work; your good work creates a special type of  vibration in His mind; it gives Him pleasure. Whatever good thing you do, it gives Him pleasure. Whatever good thoughts you encourage or you relish, give Him pleasure. That is, whatever good you do, you do to please Him, to satisfy Him. And if by your action He is satisfied, that satisfaction of His satisfies you also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now here everything moves. Nobody can remain stationary; even the polestar is not stationary. Our sun is not stationary; it moves in the Cosmos along with this planetary world. There are so many stars, so many suns &ndash; stars like suns &ndash; so many nebula; they are all moving. Nobody is immobile, nobody is fixed. Your body moves, your sentiments, your instincts connected with your body, move. Your mind moves. Everything moves. This movement of yours is different from the movement of other animals, other created beings, because the speciality of human beings is that they get pleasure in subtler movements. And these subtle movements, or subtler movements, are special wonts of human beings. You get less pleasure from a crude object than from a subtle object. You get more pleasure in a subtle object. Crude dance cannot give you as much pleasure as classical dance can. Because human movement, human tendencies, are towards the subtle, the subtler and the subtlest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Each and every living being is guided by certain instincts. Plants have instincts, animals also have instincts, but human instincts are fewer in number than human psychic propensities. That is, in the case of humans, propensities are stronger than instincts; and here lies the fundamental difference between an animal and a man.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In quest of subtler objects, man felt, man realized, that the subtlest of this universe from which all waves, all expressions, emanate, is my Supreme Goal.

So a spiritual aspirant must always remember that his goal is not something physical or something psychic.

<a name="18..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Wise people say that in the past there have been so many crises in human society. Crisis is quite natural for something moving. Wherever there is movement, there is struggle &ndash; struggle against the inertia of the earth. In the past, there have been crises in the course of movement, crises in different branches of civilization, crises in the realm of education, and so on. But nowadays, the entire human society is facing the crisis of civilization as a whole, and particularly a crisis in the field of existence. Human society is now to decide whether to live or to die. If this mud-slinging and intolerance are encouraged, humanity has no future &ndash; the future is dark, the future is sealed forever. But you know, I am not a pessimist. I am always an optimist. And I want all my sons and daughters to be optimists. And I want them to struggle against this death signal of humanity, and come out successful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->And I am sure that you boys and you girls must be optimists; and it is your duty to save humanity. And I hope you will be able to save humanity, because, just like me, you are also optimistic. You should know that great, or good, people are few in number, they are not many. They do not come within the scope of millions or billions. They are always few in number. And these few, they are the torchbearers of human society, they are the pioneers, they are the vanguards of human society. So it is your duty to save humanity. And those who are unable to shoulder their own bags and baggages &ndash; their responsibilities are to be shouldered by you. You should remember that the life of a spiritual aspirant is a mission. One&#146;s entire life is a mission, one&#146;s entire existence is a mission. And your mission is &ndash; what? To save humanity from this crisis. I hope you will be successful. And I not only hope, I am sure that you will be successful.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Last night I said something regarding different movements of humans in different strata of life, different arenas of life. Now, there is an eternal question regarding success in life. Some people do so many things but come out unsuccessful, and some people do something for a short while and get crowned with success. What is the inner secret? Why does one become successful and one not?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You know, Lord Shiva was the first propounder of the yoga cult. I will not say &ldquo;yoga philosophy&#8230;&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.19.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#19.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Lord Shiva said that a man must not labour under any sort of complex &ndash; that is, a man, a spiritual aspirant, must be free from all complexes; he must have neither superiority complex, nor inferiority complex, nor fear complex, nor defeatist complex. That is, the mind should be completely balanced.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Actually, the question was placed before Lord Shiva by Pa&#x301;rvatii. Pa&#x301;rvatii was the spouse of Shiva, wife of Shiva. Pa&#x301;rvatii&#146;s question was: &ldquo;What are the secrets of success?&rdquo; And Lord Shiva said that there are seven secrets.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->He said: &ldquo;The first secret is Phalis&#x301;yatiiti vishva&#x301;sah siddherprathama laks&#x301;an&#x301;am&rdquo; &ndash; that is, &ldquo;In the aspirant, in the spiritual aspirant, there must be this firm determination that &lsquo;I must be successful in my mission.&rsquo;&rdquo; This firm determination is the first factor, first item, first requisite factor for success. If a man is doing something but has not got the firmness of determination &ndash; if within his mind there is a question &ldquo;whether I will be successful &ndash; if I am not successful&rdquo; &ndash; this kind of thing &ndash; then he will never be successful. There must be firm determination that &ldquo;I must be successful.&rdquo; This is the first requisite factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Do you follow? Even those who do not understand English are understanding a little bit. Mm. [laughter]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And the second thing is: dvitiiyam&#x301; shraddhaya&#x301; yuktam&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;one must have respect for one&#146;s goal, one must have respect for one&#146;s path.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And the third thing: trtiiyam&#x301; gurupu&#x301;janam &ndash; &ldquo;one must have reverence for the guru.&rdquo; I need not explain this item, because my subject is here that one must be free from all complexes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Caturtho samata&#x301;bha&#x301;vo. The fourth factor is that the aspirant must have a balanced mind. This is the item now under discussion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Pain&#x32D;camendriyanigrahah. The fifth is, one must have self-restraint. Eating too much, sleeping too much, drinking too much &ndash; these weaknesses will not help the aspirant. One must have a balanced life. One must have self-restraint.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->And s&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hain&#x32D;ca pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ro &ndash; &ldquo;one must take balanced food, that is, not too much nor too little.&rdquo; It should be substantial; it should be sentient, or at least mutative in nature for family persons. It must not be of static nature. It should be balanced food, because the cells of your body are created from the food. The food that you take creates the cells of your body. And your mind is a collective mind of the minds of so many cells, so if you take static food, non-sentient food, your mind will also be of that nature. Your mind will get depraved, degenerated; so you should take proper and balanced food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->This was the advice of Lord Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So one of His pieces of advice was &ndash; what? Caturtho samata&#x301;bha&#x301;vo &ndash; that is, &ldquo;You must have a balanced mind.&rdquo; Now what is a balanced mind? The human mind has got two special wonts, two main goals, two main duties: one is to think and the other is to remember. The two duties of the human mind &ndash; one, to think, and the other, to remember &ndash; to keep in memory. Two things. Now, what is proper memory and what is proper thinking? If the thinking is proper and if the memory is proper, then I will say that the man is free from all complexes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now these two attributes, to think and to remember, are closely related to each other. What we see or what we perceive from the external objective world is reflected in the mind. This reflection comes first from the nerve fibres and secondly into the nerve cells; a sort of reflection is created in the mental plate. And when the reflection is created, we feel the existence of that external object. &ldquo;Feel&rdquo; means we see, we hear, we get the taste. This is thinking. And the second portion of thinking occurs when those waves, those sympathetic waves of the human mind, get refracted on the mental plate. They are stored-up thoughts. Those stored-up thoughts may be termed as memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now when you are suffering from a superiority complex, you think that you are a better person and others are worse persons; as a result of which you are unable to accept the external waves in proper style. So your thinking gets polluted, gets distorted, as a result of which the refracted portion, that is, the memory, also gets distorted, becomes defective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->So you must not have any superiority complex. You should remember that you are not superior to anybody else. All are children of the same Supreme Father, all are progeny of the same Supreme Progenitor. Nobody is superior to anybody.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The second complex: Sometimes you may think that &ldquo;I am an ordinary man, and that man is so big, so learned, such a big scholar &ndash; so rich, and I&#146;m poor&rdquo; &ndash; like this. If you think like this, what will happen? There will not be proper expression of your mind, there will not be proper emanations of your thought-waves; as a result of which the thought will become distorted and the refracted thought, that is, the memory portion, will become defective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Similarly, the fear complex: Sometimes people suffer from a fear complex. The psychological side of the fear complex is as follows: Due to the presence of something stronger, or due to the presence of something which is imaginarily stronger, not actually stronger, what happens? Mental flows are blocked, are choked. They cannot find the proper avenue of expression; as a result of which thoughts also get polluted. There cannot be free thinking. A man suffering from a fear complex cannot think properly. And if the thought is defective, the memory will also be defective. So you must never suffer from any sort of fear complex.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Why should you suffer from a fear complex or an inferiority complex, when the Supreme Father is your father, when you all are the children of the same Father; why should you suffer from any inferiority complex or any fear complex, when the Supreme Father is with you? You are not weak. You are very strong, because the Almighty Father, the omnipotent Supreme Father, is with you to help you &ndash; so you must not encourage the psychology of weakness, or an inferiority complex or a fear complex. He is with you, always He is with you to help you. You are never alone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->And sometimes there is a defeatist complex. &ldquo;Oh, I am defeated in this world,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I am defeated in this struggle for existence.&rdquo; Such a sentiment, such a psychology, sometimes goads a man to commit suicide even. &ldquo;I am defeated, I am defeated in the struggle for existence.&rdquo; You must not encourage this type of psychology. When your father is the Supreme Father, your father is the most powerful entity in the entire universe, why should you think that you have been defeated in the struggle for existence? No, a bright future awaits you. Your future is glorious, your future is luminous, your future is effulgent.<!-- /block --></p>

So when a man thinks, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner, O Lord, I am a sinner, O Lord, I am a sinner,&rdquo; then actually he will become a sinner. So such a psychology is fundamentally defective. You must never think that you are a sinner. You should think: &ldquo;It may be a fact that I was a sinner in the past, but from this very moment I am on the lap of the Almighty Father; I cannot be a sinner, I am not a sinner.

He will clean your clothes and take you on his lap: &ldquo;O my son, your clothes have become muddy, but you are my son. Come here, come here,  sit on My lap.

<a name="23..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->You are a spiritual aspirant. &ldquo;You are to develop the spirit of brave tolerance, just like a tree; and the spirit of modesty, more than that of a blade of grass.&rdquo; And you know, in this universe there are so many people who do not get any respect from others &ndash; the downtrodden, half-fed, half-naked humanity. &ldquo;You are to pay respect to those downtrodden people.&rdquo; You are to elevate their standard, their socio-economico-cultural standard. If you do not pay respect to them, how can you serve them? You are serving the downtrodden people by ascribing Godhood to them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And the last but not of least importance [in the shloka] is that the mind cannot remain vacant, the mind cannot remain jobless. You are to engage the mind, and the object of your mind, that is, your psychic pabulum, should be either something psychic, or something psycho-spiritual, or something purely of spiritual nature. It must not be psycho-physical or pure physical. I said just now, the mind cannot remain vacant. Whenever there is no important job to do, do not waste your time in idle thinking, because idle thinking means mental deterioration, mental degradation, psychic degeneration. So utilize each and every moment of your life in doing something good, in thinking something good. When you are not physically doing something good, then mentally do something good. And the best mental work, the best mental engagement, is kiirtaniiyah sada&#x301; harih &ndash; &ldquo;Do the kiirtana of Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit, one name of Parama Purus&#x301;a is Hari. Hari means &ldquo;who steals&rdquo;, &ldquo;who takes away all your sin without your knowledge&rdquo;. In Sanskrit, the root verb hr means &ldquo;to steal&rdquo;. Now the relationship between the Lord and His devotee is very sweet, and extremely, purely, personal. Parama Purus&#x301;a loves His devotee, and the devotee also loves His Lord. Now the accumulated mountain of sin attached to the devotee is unbearable for the Lord. He wants to remove that mountain of sin from His devotees. He may say: &ldquo;Oh, devotee, give your sins to Me.&rdquo; The devotee will say: &ldquo;No, Lord, I am ready to give You everything, I am ready to give You my soul, my spirit, everything, but how can I give my sins to You? I cannot.&rdquo; But Parama Purus&#x301;a loves His devotee, so without the knowledge of the devotee, He takes away his sin. Now to take something from a man without his knowledge is stealing. So Parama Purus&#x301;a steals &ndash; that is, He takes away sin from His devotee. And that&#146;s why He is called Hari. Hari means &ldquo;He who steals&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So kiirtaniiyah sada&#x301; harih &ndash; that is, you are not to engage your mind in any psycho-physical or physical pabulum.
