<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->On the 8th of September, 1985, the author, and founder of Ananda Marga, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, began an extraordinary series of Sunday lectures in Bengali that would eventually fill a total of twenty-six volumes over the next five years. The title he gave to this series was <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I>, which translates into English as &ldquo;A Collection of Words&rdquo;. As the title suggests, each discourse consists of a discussion of a certain number of words from the Bengali language, beginning, in the first discourse, with the first letter of the Bengali alphabet, <I>a</I>, <I></I>and continuing on alphabetically. What results, then, is neither an encyclopaedia, nor a dictionary, but something unique in the fields of scholarship and literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ostensibly, <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> is a series devoted to the linguistics and philology of the Bengali language, but in reality it is much more than that. The author uses the platform of the word as a point of departure to take the reader on a journey through all the varied landscapes of human knowledge &ndash; history, geography, medicine, science, art, religion, philosophy, etc. &ndash; and in the process adds the indelible stamp of his own unique wisdom, enriching our experience with new ideas and enabling us to see our human heritage in a way we have never been able to before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Like most great authors, he is a consummate storyteller, using a seemingly inexhaustible supply of anecdotes, personal experiences and stories to capture the reader&#146;s interest and lead him or her effortlessly through the garden of human knowledge. Along the way the author refines and develops a language that is the world&#146;s fifth most widely spoken and the closest living language to its great classical ancestor, Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The English versions of <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> <I>Part 1</I> and <I>Part 2,</I> the first two books of this series, were published in 1996. The English <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> <I>Part 3</I> was published in 1999. Thereafter the publication of this important series could not immediately be continued for various reasons, but requests for further parts of the series kept pouring in from our readers. We have therefore decided to publish several of the remaining parts of <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> each year in order to complete the series within a reasonable period of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As mentioned earlier, the author of this series has touched on a vast number of subjects of human knowledge. Therefore in this book we have provided an index of words and subjects at the end to help researchers and the general reader.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Weighing the feedback of our readers and all other considerations, we decided to print Parts 4 and 5 of <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> in one volume and to use a bigger and more conventional book size than had been used previously for the <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> series. Henceforward, the various parts of the series will all be published in this manner.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the translators have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo;  Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Many readers are concerned that the author&#146;s discourses, as published, should adhere as closely as possible to the precise wording the author used in speaking. For this reason, in the case of discourses given originally in English, the editors do not alter pronouns and other terms which the author in his life time considered &ldquo;common-gender&rdquo; words. As the author once said, &ldquo;You know, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is not only masculine gender, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is common gender also. &lsquo;Man is mortal&rsquo; &ndash; here &lsquo;man&rsquo; means both male and female.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The author was a natural advocate of women&#146;s rights and on at least one occasion indicated that &ldquo;lopsided justice&rdquo; in language should be eliminated at some future date. In keeping with his guideline and with present-day trends, it is our policy in the case of translated discourses (where the published wording will necessarily be that of the translators) to use gender-neutral language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The author was of the strong opinion that the Bengali alphabet should provide for a distinction between two slightly-different sounds, which he called &ldquo;initial-<I>la</I>&rdquo; and &ldquo;end-<I>lra</I>&rdquo;. To make possible this distinction, he proposed that the initial-<I>la</I> should be represented by an existing alphabetical character (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B2;</span>), while for the end-<I>lra</I> there should be a new character (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B2;&#x09BC;</span>) formed by adding a dot below the initial-<I>la</I> character. In the roman system invented by the author, the two sounds are rendered by <I>la</I> and <I>lra</I> respectively. Though in the original Bengali <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> series the new character has been used wherever the <I>lra</I> sound occurs, in these English translations we have avoided using <I>lra</I> each time that the sound occurs (so that words familiar to speakers of Bengali should not be unrecognizable to them), and we provide instead, especially for the benefit of researchers, a list of all words in each book which should be read with the end-<I>lra</I> sound. For this book the words are as follows:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus <I>ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra</I> can be read, &ldquo;the root <I>tr</I> prefixed by <I>ava</I> and suffixed by <I>ghain&#x32D;</I> becomes <I>avata&#x301;ra</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->This book is the result of the assistance and the support lent by many persons in various ways. Their sincere efforts are helping us develop an ever more professional system of work, so that the immense contribution of Shrii P.R. Sarkar can be presented in the best possible manner. Some esteemed readers, or better to say, lovers, of Shrii P.R. Sarkar&#146;s books have come forward to make arrangement for the continuous publication of his books over the coming years; thanks to them, progress is being made in building up a committed and dependable sales network. Any interested person can come forward to participate in this effort.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Ideally every new book translation undergoes initially a draft by the main translator, then &ldquo;first editing&rdquo;, then &ldquo;second editing&rdquo;, then final verification. Other important functions include coordination of the different steps, and the development and management of a sales network. Some of those who have contributed to these efforts: Dr. Mohit Ray, retired professor of English, translated all seven discourses of <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> <I>Part 4</I>, and the first editing of those discourses was done by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Priyashiva&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta. Ga&#x301;yattrii Ghista and Ta&#x301;raka Ghista did the second editing of those discourses. Dr. Visvanath Chatterjee, retired professor of English, translated all seven discourses of <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> <I>Part 5</I>, and the first editing of those discourses was done by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Priyashiva&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta. Deva&#x301;shiis&#x301;a did the second editing and first verification of those discourses.

<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The root verb <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is used with several different meanings, for example, &ldquo;to walk a crooked [<I>kut&#x301;ila</I>] path&rdquo;, &ldquo;to make somebody walk a <I></I>crooked path&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be dishonest&rdquo;, &ldquo;to make somebody dishonest&rdquo;, &ldquo;to walk on the path of <I>adharma</I> [unrighteousness]&rdquo;, &ldquo;to make somebody walk on the path of <I>adharma</I>&rdquo;, <I></I>&ldquo;to strike&rdquo;, &ldquo;to create obstructions in the path of honesty&rdquo;, &ldquo;to cut into pieces&rdquo;, &ldquo;to build a wall of obstacles&rdquo;, &ldquo;to peck or to nibble&rdquo;. There are also different etymological meanings based on these usages. The colloquial usages of the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> are as follows: <ol> <li>Tree. The roots of a tree move in a crooked way; they advance in a zigzag manner. The branches and offshoots of a tree also move on a tangled and crooked path; they hardly ever move in a straight path. Thus <I>kut&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;tree&rdquo;. Generally <I>kut&#x301;a</I> refers to a large tree. It was customary to use the spelling <I>ku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> in the case of poisonous trees, but even if it is spelled with a short <I>u</I>, it cannot be considered incorrect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><p>When the word <I>ka&#x301;laku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> is used for a poisonous tree, then it is understood that its poison is very strong. In that case <I>ku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> must be spelled with <I>u&#x301;</I>. In addition to poisonous trees, the word <I>ka&#x301;laku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> is also used to refer to any kind of poisonous plant. There is an amusing observation in this regard. Many people playfully call tobacco (<I>ta&#x301;ma&#x301;ka</I>) <I>ta&#x301;maku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> [ta&#x301;mraku&#x301;t&#x301;a]<I></I>, but this is merely in jest. There is no original Sanskrit word for tobacco since tobacco was introduced into this country from abroad during the Mughal era. At that time it was not given a Sanskrit name, as was the case with guava (<I>perukam, biijapu&#x301;rakam</I>), chilli (<I>kat&#x301;ubiijam</I>), papaya (<I>amrtaphalam</I> &ndash; the Bengali word <I>pen&#x32D;pe</I> is derived from the English word &ldquo;papaya&rdquo; as is the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali word <I>pipha&#x301;</I>) and so on, all of which came from outside India. The actual meaning of the word <I>ta&#x301;mraku&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;copper mountain&rdquo;, not tobacco. The scholars of earlier times used to say in jest:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><p>That is, tobacco is indeed great. If somebody offers someone tobacco with reverence, then with each puff of tobacco the person takes, the donor receives a benefit equal to that derived from the <I>Ashvamedha Yajin&#x32D;a</I> [Horse Sacrifice].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li>The pot used for drinking water is known as <I>kakubha</I>. If the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is used then it means a water pot that is somewhat bent or curved (<I>vakra&#x301;yita</I>: The verbal root <I>vak</I> means to move in a tortuous or twisted manner; from this comes the words <I>vakra</I> [bent or crooked], <I>vaka</I> [stork], etc). You must have noticed that the upper portion of a glass is not exactly the same as the lower portion. In a small pitcher (<I>ghat&#x301;i</I>) the upper part or the brim is curved in such a way that water can be easily drunk without touching the lips. So glasses, <I>ghat&#x301;is</I> and other water-pots, which have been specifically designed for conveniently drinking water, are known as <I>kut&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><p>In ancient times the hard shells of ripe coconuts were also used for drinking water. So <I>kut&#x301;a</I> also means the shell of the ripe coconut. If a coconut shell is broken into two pieces, the pieces are also called <I>ma&#x301;la&#x301;</I>. Many people use this coconut <I>ma&#x301;la&#x301;</I> for storing kitchen spices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><li>Some people also use the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> to mean <I>kun&#x32D;jo</I> [a pitcher with a long and narrow neck]. No one drinks water directly from a <I>kun&#x32D;jo</I>, even if they avoid touching it with their lips. But it is true that in old Sanskrit, in a few rare cases the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> was used to mean <I>kun&#x32D;jo</I>. Without taking into consideration whether that usage was proper or not, the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> can be used to mean <I>kun&#x32D;jo</I> by virtue of the specific grammatical rule <I>nipa&#x301;tana siddha.</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;. Whether a mountain rises straight upward or diagonally, its surface is not smooth; it has innumerable rough spots, pits and ditches, caverns and cavities. For this reason a mountain is called <I>kut&#x301;a</I>. If <I>ku&#x301;ta&#x301;</I> is written with a long <I>u&#x301;</I> when referring to a mountain, then <I></I>this does not refer to the entire mountain but rather only to its summit and adjacent areas. Grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a (<I>grdhraku&#x301;t&#x301;a &gt; gidhdhaud&#x301;a &gt; gidhdhaur&#x301;a &gt; gidhaor&#x301;a</I>)<I></I>, Annaku&#x301;t&#x301;a (mountain of rice), Amaraku&#x301;t&#x301;a <I></I>(many people erroneously say <I>amarakot&#x301;a</I>)<I></I>, Ku&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;shila&#x301; (some people erroneously say <I>kot&#x301;ashila&#x301;</I>), Ku&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;sura (demon of the mountain &ndash; many people erroneously say <I>kot&#x301;a&#x301;sura</I>), Cit&#x301;raku&#x301;t&#x301;a, etc., are all preferably spelled with <I>ku&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><p><I>Kut&#x301;a</I> does not only mean large mountains. It also refers to all its diminutive forms such as hills, knolls, mounds and hillocks.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><li>You may be familiar with <I>hastakut&#x301;ika&#x301;</I>. The words <I>hastakut&#x301;aka</I> and <I>hastakut&#x301;ika&#x301;</I> were generally used for big and small hammers respectively. You must have seen a big hammer at a smithy and a small hammer at a goldsmith&#146;s shop. In Bhojpuri a big hammer is called <I>hathaor&#x301;a&#x301;</I> and a small one <I>hathaor&#x301;ii</I>. This big hammer or <I>hathaor&#x301;a&#x301;</I> is also called <I>kut&#x301;a</I>. <I>Kut&#x301;apis&#x301;t&#x301;a kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha</I> means &ldquo;a cauldron that has been pounded with a hammer&rdquo;. Generally cauldrons <I>(kar&#x301;a&#x301;)</I> are of two types: hammered cauldrons and cast cauldrons. Cast cauldrons do not last long; moreover, they crack if they are exposed to sudden changes in temperature. But hammered or wrought cauldrons are quite durable. So housewives prefer wrought cauldrons even though they are a little more expensive. It is this wrought cauldron that is called <I>kut&#x301;apis&#x301;t&#x301;a kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha</I> in proper Bengali. The proper name for a cauldron used for cooking is <I>kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha</I> (<I>kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha&#x301; &gt;kad&#x301;a&#x301;ha &gt;kar&#x301;a&#x301;ha &gt;kar&#x301;a&#x301;i &gt;kar&#x301;a&#x301;)</I>. However, when there is a <I>kar&#x301;a&#x301;</I> [hardened skin] on someone&#146;s foot, the proper word for it is not <I>kat&#x301;a&#x301;ha</I> but rather <I>karn&#x301;ika&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><li>Have you ever seen a <I>kella&#x301;</I> or a <I>durga</I> [fort]? The word <I>kella&#x301;</I> or <I>kii-la&#x301;h</I> is of Persian origin. The word <I>durga</I> is <I>tatsama<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I>. The etymological meaning of <I>durga</I> is &ldquo;a place difficult to reach&rdquo;, one which requires a great deal of struggle in order to go there, for which one has to expend a lot of energy to reach. A fort is generally built in places where people cannot easily approach; for instance, on the summit of a hill, land guarded by a river, or on an uninhabited island. The outer walls of a fort are built so that they are difficult for an enemy to attack. Its stronghold is built so that from behind its cover the fort commander&#146;s men can fight off the aggressor. If the fort is situated on a level plain, then trenches are dug around it and filled with water. Those of you who have seen the Monghyr fort have seen its trenches. The river Ain&#x32D;jana&#x301; at Goa&#x301;r&#x301;i-Krishnanagar was such a trench. At that time the Khar&#x301;e was a surging river, so its waters were used to supply the Ain&#x32D;jana&#x301;. I believe the Kaun&#x32D;kana&#x301; canal (Nadia) was also dug for use as a trench. Since no fort was simple or straightforward, and because in ancient times when choosing sites for their construction, preference was given to hills and mountains, one of the meanings of <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;fort&rdquo;. In ancient Sanskrit both the spellings <I>durga</I> and <I>du&#x301;rga</I> were in vogue.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><p>In ancient India there used to be a temple or mosque adjacent to a fort. In the Puranic era some people used to keep a <I>durga&#x301; ba&#x301;r&#x301;ii</I> [house of Durga&#x301;] or a <I>durga&#x301;</I> <I>mandir</I> [temple of Durga&#x301;] inside a fort in honour of the goddess Durga&#x301;, the presiding deity of a <I>durga</I>. The eight-armed mythical goddess Durga&#x301; was considered to be the goddess of weapons. The concept of a ten-armed Durga&#x301; came later on. The ten-armed Durga&#x301; was first introduced in Bengal at Taherpur in the district of Rajshahi in Barendrabhu&#x301;mi [North Bengal]. The king of that region, Kam&#x301;sana&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a Roy, was the first to worship Durga&#x301; on Bengali soil, for which he spent seven lakhs of rupees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><li>Often a palace was attached to a fort. These palaces were also known as <I>kut&#x301;a</I> or <I>kut&#x301;apra&#x301;sa&#x301;da</I>. In English the word was &ldquo;castle&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><li>Often people who assemble for a bad purpose consolidate their forces in certain places. People assembled for a good purpose also consolidate their forces in different places for a particular course of action. Such a place where a person or persons consolidate their forces is called <I>gha&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;i</I>.The word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is used for this <I>gha&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;i</I> [camp]. A camp of robbers can also be described as a robbers&#146; <I>kut&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><p>In this respect, you should have a clear idea of the distinction between the words <I>gha&#x301;ti and gha&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;i</I>. <I>Gha&#x301;n&#x32D;t&#x301;i</I> means &ldquo;centre of power&rdquo; and <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;i</I> means &ldquo;valley&rdquo; (not an <I>avava&#x301;hika&#x301;</I> or basin). Some of you may know that in the area known as Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, especially western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, there is often a mountainous or hilly valley or <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;i</I> on the way from one prosperous region to another. Robbers would often attack in these <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;is</I>. The kings of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h used to employ a particular kind of officer to save innocent people from the hands of these <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;i</I> robbers. They were called <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;wa&#x301;ls</I>. I knew a gentleman who had the surname Sengupta. When asked for the name of his father, he used to give the word Gha&#x301;t&#x301;wa&#x301;l as his surname. When questioned further, he explained that his forefathers had worked for generations as <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;wa&#x301;ls</I> in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, so they used the surname Gha&#x301;t&#x301;wa&#x301;l. The word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> cannot be used for <I></I>this <I>gha&#x301;t&#x301;i</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of the word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is house or residence. The word <I>kut&#x301;i</I> can be used for a small house. Even though the meaning of the word <I>kut&#x301;ira</I> is nearly identical, the word <I>kut&#x301;ira</I> is chiefly used for an earthen house or also a bamboo and thatched house. It is not necessary to use the word <I>parn&#x301;akut&#x301;ira</I> for this because <I>kut&#x301;ira</I> itself means <I>parn&#x301;asha&#x301;la&#x301;</I> [a hut thatched with tree leaves]. (<I>Shrii Ra&#x301;ma, Laks&#x301;man&#x301;a Janaker ba&#x301;la&#x301;/ Basati karen nirma&#x301;iya&#x301; parn&#x301;asha&#x301;la&#x301;</I> &ndash; <I></I>&ldquo;Shrii Ra&#x301;ma, Laks&#x301;man&#x301;a, and the daughter of Janaka live here having constructed a <I>parn&#x301;asha&#x301;la&#x301;</I>.&rdquo;) However, <I>kut&#x301;t&#x301;ii</I> or <I>kut&#x301;t&#x301;ira</I> does not mean &ldquo;house&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;hill&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><li>Now, the tool you commonly use to cut stone, this <I>ga&#x301;in&#x32D;iti</I> [pickaxe], is it completely straight? Is it just like a crowbar from top to bottom? No, a pickaxe is not straight; it is bent. One end is bent and tapers downward while the other end is also bent and widens outward, and the tip is pointed. The pickaxe was used in coal mines in earlier times before the scientific means of cutting coal was introduced. The pickaxe is still used to cut stone or stony soil. One of the meanings of <I>kut&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;pickaxe&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><li>I am sure you know that if a third thing is placed between two other things then it is called &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo;. In English the spelling is &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; but the pronunciation is not &ldquo;sand-wich&rdquo;; it should be &ldquo;sandich&rdquo;. For example, Greenwich is written &ldquo;Green-wich&rdquo; but it is pronounced &ldquo;Greenich&rdquo;. If you put some <I>ghugni</I> [an Indian food preparation] made of raw gram between two slices of bread then we call it a sandwich or <I>kut&#x301;a&#x301;nna</I>. If a person or an object gets caught and flattened between two other objects,then it is said that he has been sandwiched between them (in colloquial Bengali we say that he has been <I>chin&#x32D;r&#x301;echyapt&#x301;a&#x301;</I>, that is, flattened like <I>chin&#x32D;r&#x301;e</I>, or a grain of flattened rice. The word <I>kut&#x301;a</I> can be used for this also). So you see, the proper Bengali for &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; is <I>kut&#x301;a&#x301;nna</I>, and that which is sandwiched is called <I>kut&#x301;a</I>. Bear in mind that the English word for <I>ya&#x301;dugarii</I> (the feminine form of <I>ya&#x301;dugara</I>), &ldquo;witch&rdquo;, is not pronounced &ldquo;ich&rdquo; but &ldquo;wich&rdquo;. Only if the word &ldquo;wich&rdquo; is the latter part of a word is it pronounced &ldquo;ich.&rdquo; A gentleman known to me, Mr. Pund&#x301;arika&#x301;ks&#x301;a Poundfoolish, once translated &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; as <I>ba&#x301;luka&#x301;-da&#x301;kinii</I> (sand-witch). Stay away from such kinds of translations!<!-- /block --></p>

However the connection was through Hebrew and Greek. The bull used to die in this fight. In ancient Greece, when a criminal was sentenced to capital punishment, he was pushed in the lion&#146;s cage with a weapon. After fighting for some time the convicted man would generally be killed in the battle, and this scene may have delighted the spectators. The purpose of this sport was for the man to be killed by the lion. However the purpose of sending a man into a large arena to fight a bull was to see who emerged victorious. Generally the bull died because if it became obvious that the bull was going to win, then the spectators would kill the bull.<!-- /block --></p>

Perhaps it still exists to some extent. In this fight a male buffalo was tied and there was a man in the arena. If the man was injured in the fight then the people used to kill the buffalo. Although the fighting was heroic in nature, it was also somewhat repulsive. At any rate, when this bullfighting was between bulls, then in many instances the horn of the defeated bull used to break and the bull lost a great deal of blood from its head. This bull with a broken horn is also called <I>kut&#x301;a</I>. These bullfights stopped after the cow became recognized as a deity, although not completely.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph --><li>The word <I>prata&#x301;raka</I> means &ldquo;one who cheats&rdquo;. To cheat means to first generate faith and then to inflict injury. If fish food is sprinkled in a pond while angling then the fish may think that the visitor is providing food; he is my friend. So they approach. Then at that point if someone fits a fishhook with food, and the fish takes the food with unhesitating confidence, and then if it is reeled in with the hook piercing its mouth and is killed, that would certainly be the deed of a cheat.<!-- /block --></p>

So since ancient times people have condemned both catching fish with a fishhook and the fowler&#146;s way of catching birds. No honest man should do it. It is not cheating when fish are caught with a net. For this reason the fisherman&#146;s profession was not considered as despicable as the fowler&#146;s, because they do not kill innocent creatures by making them swallow bait. Under no circumstance can harming a person or a creature after winning their confidence by tempting them with food be considered the deed of an honest person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph --><p>Many years ago I used to hear about a class of people who would cheat others by promising them that their gold would be doubled. Generally they used to visit the women when the men were out and tell them that they could double their gold with their magical power. If the women did not trust them they were welcome to put them to the test. These housewives would test them by first giving them a small gold ring or an earring or any similar trinket and asking them to double it. These fellows used to keep a stock of light ornaments. They would ask the women to shut their eyes and the women would shut their eyes. Then they would add rings or earrings from their stash and show to the women that their ring or earring was doubled. Once the women were firmly convinced after seeing these feats they would bring out their gold ornaments, place them before the cheats and ask them to double them. Again the women were asked to keep their eyes shut. Then they would tie the ornaments into a small bundle and made good their escape. They were swindlers. They used to realize their own selfish ends after gaining the confidence of the common people. One word for such &ldquo;confidence men&rdquo; is <I>kut&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

We were great friends. We used to look forward to seeing each other during holidays and vacations. We would meet in Jamalpur by the reservoir, or near the field, or on one bench or another. Sujit was greatly interested in Bengali literature, particularly in the field of Bengali literature&#146;s speciality, its portrayal of society. I was more inclined towards astrology and was completely uninitiated in literary matters, an unknown traveler in that realm. Even though Bengali was my mother tongue, I could only speak it; I had never approached its literary shores. The little education I had was in English.

<a name="4..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph --><p>We arrived at the bus stand.

<a name="4..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph --><p>It was quite some time later when we reached the outskirts of Ghusur&#x301;i after crossing a large portion of the city of Howrah. The city of Howrah is high in some places, low in others, replete with factories and neighborhoods of gentle, civilized folk. Howrah has been an industrial town since its very inception. There was a time when there was a factory here at every turn. It is difficult to find another such industrial town anywhere in the world, although at present Ludhiana and Batala of the Punjab can boast of a similar glory. This is quite good, no doubt, but Howrah should not lose its distinction. Both government and private agencies derive a very good income from this industrial town, although in general we can say that the city is neglected. Only a very small fraction of what is spent for the improvement of Kolkata is spent on Howrah. Moreover, the sacrifices that Howrah has made for the improvement of Kolkata are indisputable. Kolkata is like a golden lamp with a slender wick made of fine cotton and clarified butter for fuel, while Howrah is like the lamp-stand that bears it on its head. It seems to bear the black stain from the lamp&#146;s burnt oil. Will no one pay any attention to Howrah? The British did not neglect the town in this way when they founded it in an area of marshy wetlands [<I>ha&#x301;or&#x301;</I>] after draining the water and filling in the holes and ditches. A botanical garden was developed here as well as one of India&#146;s oldest engineering colleges. The Shalimar gardens were fashioned in imitation of the Shalimar gardens of Kashmir.

They were quite erudite. The British selected Howrah, as a developing area of Bengal, to be the residence of the representative from Bhutan.

We reached Ghusur&#x301;i and arrived at Sujit&#146;s house some seven or eight minutes after getting down at the bus-stand.

As many wise and learned people say, human history does not recognize the word &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; has no lasting value in the lexicon of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph --><p>It was Monday. A telegram arrived from Ghusur&#x301;i from Sunanda informing me that Sujit was seriously ill; it would be good if I could go there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph --><p>It was a shock to my mind. Sujit was my childhood friend, my playmate, my study companion and a distant relation as well. It is hard to imagine how much he loved me.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph --><p>I decided to leave the next day. Towards the end of the night I dreamed that Sujit was telling me: &ldquo;You gave me your word that you would come to Ghusur&#x301;i whenever you had a chance. So many days have passed but you haven&#146;t come. What sort of promise is that? You must have received today&#146;s telegram. This time you must certainly come.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph --><p>Then I woke up. It was three o&#146;clock in the morning.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph --><p>In those days, in order to travel from Dinajpur to Sealdah, one had to first travel to Parvatipura on metre gauge [track] and then take the broad gauge from Parvatipura (Siliguri &ndash; Sealdah route) to Kolkata. I started from Dinajpur on Tuesday and reached Sealdah early Wednesday morning. After finishing a few urgent tasks during the day, I bought some fruits and other suitable food for Sujit, and by the time I reached Howrah it was already evening. When I arrived, I heard that due to some temporary trouble the buses were not running to Ghusur&#x301;i, though efforts were being made to resume the bus service. After some time I heard that an understanding had been reached and the buses were running again. I could hear the sound: &ldquo;Ghus-sur&#x301;ii-ii-ii, Ghus-sur&#x301;ii-ii-ii, going to Ghus-sur&#x301;ii-ii-ii?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph --><p>I boarded the bus thinking of Sujit. He must have been very seriously ill, otherwise Sunanda would never have sent the telegram. When he was in college he once contracted bronchitis and afterwards his health was somewhat affected, but he scrupulously observed the rules of health and hygiene. For this reason he was hardly ever sick, and when he was he would always fight it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph --><p>We were passing through the city of Howrah. I could see the changes that had taken place there. As the population had grown, so had the number of houses, as well as the number of vehicles. It was the last bus of the day and it was late at night by the time I reached Ghusur&#x301;i, after nine, a solitary hour. When I reached &ndash; <I>A&#x301;jike dua&#x301;r ruddha bhavane bhavane</I> [&ldquo;Doors are shut in house after house today&rdquo;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph --><p>Only a few passengers got down with me from the bus. I found myself in that half-urban, half-rural Ghusur&#x301;i during the dark fortnight of the moon. Although Ghusur&#x301;i was then moving fast towards urbanity, it still clearly showed its rural chracteristics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph --><p>The passengers who got down all went their separate ways and I found myself alone. It had been a long time since I had been there, so I wasn&#146;t sure of the way to Sujit&#146;s house. I stood there for some time thinking which way to go when suddenly Sujit showed up in person panting.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;You are ill!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Why did you come?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;After a hard day&#146;s work,&rdquo; Sujit replied, &ldquo;Sudhii fell asleep sitting on the bench, so I did not want to wake him. I felt sorry for him. He&#146;s been under a lot of stress the past couple of days. How can a young college boy bear up under such pressure? Sunanda wanted to come but I didn&#146;t let her because even though Ghusur&#x301;i is on the edge of becoming a true township, it&#146;s still rural at heart. After nine everything is completely still, the solitude of silence. Here the women don&#146;t go outside after nightfall. So I forbade Sunanda to come and I came myself with the help of a stick.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;You have done yourself a grave injustice,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;Anyway, keep the stick in one hand and let me hold the other.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph --><p>In this way I started for Sujit&#146;s house holding his hand. From the little I could make out in the darkness, I could see that most of the ponds and pits had been filled up. There were hardly any bamboo groves to be seen, just one or two in the distance. But one could still hear the droning of crickets in Ghusur&#x301;i as evening fell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph --><p>I told Sujit, &ldquo;One can hear the sound of crickets here.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;They have been consulting the almanac,&rdquo; Sujit said, &ldquo;to determine which day they will leave Ghusur&#x301;i for good.

<a name="4..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;You never did return,&rdquo; Sujit continued, &ldquo;since you left the last time. Tell me, why have you been living incognito?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;You have also been incognito,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;You didn&#146;t write a single letter. Thankfully, Sunanda sent a telegram. That&#146;s why I&#146;ve come. You are more guilty of living incognito than I am.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph --><p>Sujit smiled sadly and said, &ldquo;Yes, you are right. I have been living incognito. There is no proper adjective, good or bad, that can be used to describe or signify this living incognito. The only thing that can be said about this living incognito is that it is natural. This happens in a man&#146;s life; it has to happen. What I would like, then, is that you should also keep in touch with those who are living incognito in the same way that you do with those who are not.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph --><p>While we were walking I realized that we were approaching Sujit&#146;s house. Yes, there was that neatly decorated house and the lovely, colorful garden.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;Let us have some fun,&rdquo; Sujit said. &ldquo;You ring the doorbell and I&#146;ll stay back a little and hide. Sunanda will be surprised to see you. It will be great fun.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph --><p>I rang the doorbell. From outside I could hear that inside the house everything was silent. After I had rung the doorbell for quite some time, Sunanda finally opened the door. When she recognized me, she burst into tears and then collapsed on the ground in front of me. After a few moments Sudhii came running up. When Sunanda told him who I was, he looked at me and then he also burst out crying.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph --><p>I looked behind me only to find that Sujit was not there where he was supposed to be. Perhaps he had moved back a little, a little further away, to a more distant hiding place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph --><p>It was from Sudhii that I learned that Sujit had died the previous Monday at three in the morning.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph --><li>The Aryans entered India in stages. During the first stage they reached the land of the seven rivers, or Saptasindhu<I></I>, being the Sind and with it six other rivers: the Shatadru or Shataluj or Sutlez (that which flows in a hundred streams); the Bipa&#x301;sha&#x301; or Bias (that which moves in a zigzag manner or which makes things wet while moving around. The Aryans in the Vedic language of that time used the word <I>bipa&#x301;sha&#x301;</I> in neuter gender. For this reason they never gave the name Bipa&#x301;sha&#x301; to either their sons or their daughters); the Ira&#x301;vatii or Ravii (that which contains much <I>ira&#x301;</I> or water); the Candrabha&#x301;ga&#x301; or Cenab (the combined form of the two rivers, Candra and Bha&#x301;ga&#x301;); and the Vitasta&#x301; or Jhelum (one whose width is noteworthy). Along with the land of the seven rivers they also colonized the kingdom of Shivi. There is a controversy regarding the location of the kingdom of Shivi, but as far as I can tell, the kingdom of Shivi is the ancient name of what we presently call Sindh (<I>U&#x301;s&#x301;iinara na&#x301;mah ra&#x301;ja&#x301; shivi ra&#x301;jya deshe &ndash;</I> &ldquo;the king is called Us&#x301;iinara in the kingdom of Shivi&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph --><p>In the next stage of <I>Sindhu</I>-<I>Saoviira</I>, the Aryans reached Haritdha&#x301;nya <I>(Haritdha&#x301;nya &gt; Hariaha&#x301;nna</I> &gt; <I>Hariha&#x301;na&#x301;</I> &gt; <I>Hariya&#x301;na&#x301;</I>). In the following stage they reached Brahma&#x301;vartta and Brahmars&#x301;idesha (the confluence of the rivers Ganges and Yamuna rivers, also known as Praya&#x301;g). During the age of the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I>, a large part of Brahma&#x301;varta was known as the kingdom of Shu&#x301;rasena with its capital at Mathura; its king was Kam&#x301;sa and afterwards Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The Shu&#x301;rasena Kayasthas are called Mathura&#x301; Kayasthas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph --><p>In the subsequent stage they reached the kingdom of Ka&#x301;shii. When they attempted to proceed from Ka&#x301;shii towards Magadha and Videha they faced great resistance. They even declared Magadha to be a non-Vedic or non-Aryan land. Upon conquering Videha after great struggle, they performed the <I>trihotriiya</I> sacrifice (a ritual sacrifice performed by three sacrificial priests; generally a sacrifice is performed by one) and named it the Trihotriiya land or Tirhut (the name Mithila is almost contemporary with Videha). After somehow conquering Mithila and Magadha, they proceeded towards Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and there they met with insurmountable opposition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph --><p>This conflict between Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and the Aryan civilization kept Bengal beyond the ambit of A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta until the end. Bengal belongs neither to A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta nor to the Deccan. Even though the Bengali language is one of the luminaries of Sanskrit and Aryan language group, the Dravidian influence is predominant in the physical composition of the Bengali race. This proves that the Aryans could not settle here permanently; the physical composition of Bengalis reflects a far greater Austric-Dravidian influence than Aryan influence. There is also considerable Mongolian influence, especially in North, East and Southeast Bengal. The Dravidian influence is extremely strong in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h (thus, according to anthropology, Bengalis are Austrico-Mongolo-Negroid). Not only did the Aryans meet with resistance at the borders of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, it is rumored that at Barjyabhu&#x301;mi (Birbhum) when they saw the Aryans, the [local indigenous] population unleashed their pet dogs and wolves (<I>vrkavya&#x301;ghra</I>) against them. So the Aryans used to say that the land of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had to be abandoned <I>(Barjjyaniiya)</I>, that is, it is <I>Bajjyabhu&#x301;mi</I>. Regarding Bengal it was said: &ldquo;We do not understand what the people of that land say in their chirping bird language.&rdquo; In later times many <I>sma&#x301;rtas</I> [scholars of social scriptures] made an injunction that, except for the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sa&#x301;gara pilgrimage, if anyone came to Bengal, then they would be considered to have committed a sin both of commission and omission. They used to arrive by boat during the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sa&#x301;gara pilgrimage, take their bath and return again by water without ever touching the soil of Bengal; thus they avoided the crime of touching the land.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph --><p>Just as the Aryans met with resistance to the east in Bengal, similarly in the south they came up against the insurmountable summits of the Satpura and Vindhya Mountains. Since the Vindhya Mountains were so difficult to cross, the following areas remained out of the Aryan reach: the southern areas of Maharastra that lie across the Vindhya Mountains (Vidarbha is part of A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta but Ma&#x301;ra&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; and Koun&#x32D;kan&#x301;a are part of the Deccan), Triliun&#x32D;gabhu&#x301;mi (Telengana or Andhra), Karna&#x301;t&#x301;akdesh (or the land of Kannada), Gomantaka (Goa), Dra&#x301;mila (Tamil Nadu), Kerala and the southern part of Orissa (Utkala: the northwestern part of Orissa, which was known as Koshala or south Koshla, however, was regarded as a part of A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta, and that is why even today there still remains a significant cultural and psychological gap between Koshala and Utkala). For similar reasons, the Pathans and Mughals also failed to significantly extend their dominion over this area. It is said that Maharishi Agastya was the first to cross the Vindhya Mountains along with his followers and extend the Aryan influence into the south. From that time onwards, the area south of the Vindhyas came to be known as Da&#x301;ks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;tya or <I>Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;patha</I> or <I>Da&#x301;ks&#x301;in&#x301;a</I> (the word Deccan is derived from the word <I>da&#x301;ks&#x301;in&#x301;a</I>).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph --><p>According to a story in the Puranas, Maharshi Agastya had to use diplomacy [<I>kut&#x301;abuddhi</I>] when he entered the Deccan. The Vindhya Mountains were very high peaks. The Aryans were not able to cross to the other side. So they said to Agastya: &ldquo;Nobody is your equal in diplomacy. Please find some way to destroy the height of the Vindhya Mountains.&rdquo; Maharshi proceeded south. When the Vindhyas saw Maharshi Agastya approaching, they bowed down their head in his honour. Agastya said: &ldquo;Bless you. I am headed south. Unless and until I return, you should remain in the same state of salutation, that is, with your head bowed.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph --><p>The Maharshi proceeded south and never returned. The Vindhyas remained with their heads bowed and the Aryans were able to easily enter the south. Because of this fame for diplomacy [<I>kuta&#x301;budhi</I>], Maharshi Agastya became famous as <I>kut&#x301;amuni</I> or <I>kut&#x301;ars&#x301;i</I>. So you see, one meaning of <I>kut&#x301;amuni</I>, <I>kut&#x301;ars&#x301;i</I> or <I>kut&#x301;aja</I> is Maharshi Agastya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph --><p>This word <I>agastya</I> is also found in Hebrew and Latin as &ldquo;Augustine.&rdquo; The name of the month of August is also derived from the word <I>agastya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph --><li>In the Dva&#x301;para era, the versatile Dronacarya was well known for his diplomacy in addition to his famed mastery of the art of weaponry and different scriptures. It is said that he concealed certain parts of this knowledge of weaponry and scriptures from his disciples but taught them to Arjuna. Supposedly he taught Arjuna diplomacy as well. The sages, saints and learned philosophers never considered diplomacy to be a good thing. It was their firm opinion that it led to the degradation of humanity and the decay of spirituality. In their opinion, just as a thief is caught by a thief, an exorcist is killed by a ghost, a snake charmer dies of snake-bite, similarly a practitioner of diplomacy is destroyed by diplomacy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph --><p>This is what happened in the case of Dronacarya. His son&#146;s name was Ashvaththama, and Ashvaththama was also the name of an elephant killed in the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> war. Dronacarya was informed of the death of Ashvaththama, the elephant, when Yudhisthira proclaimed <I>ashvaththa&#x301;ma&#x301; hatah</I> [Ashvaththama is dead]. When he said <I>iti gaja</I> [the elephant] in a soft voice, the drums and tom-toms were loud enough that Dronacarya could not hear that portion. He thought that it was his son, Ashvaththama, who was dead. He became so upset on the battlefield that he was killed in the battle. According to a Puranic story, Ashvaththama was blessed with the boon of immortality (like Hanuman), thus Ashvaththama did not die nor can he [ever]. In olden times some people used to consider Ashvaththama a virtuous person [<I>pun&#x301;yashloka</I>]. In later times people used to consider Vaedehii instead of Ashvaththama as virtuous:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph --><p>Dronacarya had great affection for Ashvaththama, not only because he was his own son but also because Ashvaththama was revered and considered virtuous by many.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph --><p>Thus the death of Dronacarya resulted from his hearing, through a diplomatic stratagem, the bad news of Ashvaththama&#146;s death.

For this reason, people in ancient times used to steer clear of the Kayasthas in diplomatic conflict; rather they maintained good relations with them. In the post-Buddhist era the Kayastha rulers stood beside the Brahmins for the purpose of establishing traditional orthodox religion in Bengal. As a result traditional orthodox religion may have been established but the long-term reaction in the life of the people of Bengal was not good.

You can recognize Kayasthas when you see them. Even if they differ somewhat in appearance, they are also Bengalis. There is a vast difference in appearance between the Brahmins of Maharastra and the Ma&#x301;ra&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;s. By comparison, the difference between the Kayasthas and non-Kayasthas of Bengal is negligible. It often goes unperceived. Moreover, it cannot be denied that there has been racial intermingling.</p>

It is a forest tree belonging to a completely different species; its leaves also are completely different. There are only a few species of white sandalwood. Of these, the Sri Lankan and Indonesian species are the dominant species. The sandalwood that grows in India, especially in Karnataka and adjacent areas, is mostly the Sri Lankan species. It differs from the Indonesian species in that it is relatively more fragrant. Generally it is a little shorter than that of the Indonesian species. During its infancy the roots of this sandalwood are weak, so it cannot draw fluids from the deeper recesses of the earth&#146;s water table. That is why it should be planted near another tree that can easily draw up this deep-lying water towards the roots of the sandalwood and help it to take in water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><p>Generally the swallow wort [<I>Calotropis gigantia</I>], tamarind and cactus are planted as auxiliary plants.

Apart from South India, the area most suitable for it is the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h region of Bengal, that is, the areas of Purulia, Birbhum and Bankura, where it can grow easily. The tree begins emitting its scent when it reaches about twenty years of age. It takes longer for trees belonging to the Indonesian species to begin producing scent.

Red sandalwood can grow very easily in Assam, Bengal and Orissa. Red sandalwood trees grow fast and are larger than white sandalwood. In most cases where there is a red sandalwood tree near a white sandalwood tree, it is found that the white sandalwood tree dies under the dominance of the red sandalwood tree. The red sandalwood tree has indomitable vitality. However, red sandalwood has hardly any utility value compared to white sandalwood. Followers of orthodox religion generally use red sandalwood for worship of the goddess Kali and for sun worship. At one time the use of red sandalwood was widely prevalent among the <I>Sha&#x301;kadviipii</I> Brahmans. Today it is no longer so. Black sandalwood is a sub-species of white sandalwood.

This part of Howrah District is very fertile. It has been densely populated since ancient times. When Howrah fell within the jurisdiction of Burdwan it was the pride of Bengal. Afterwards, when it came within Hooghly District, it was regarded as one of the prosperous areas of Hooghly District. Later on, when Hooghly District was divided and Howrah District was formed, this area remained within Howrah District. Partially without industry, partially industrialized, it was the jewel of the region, shedding its lustre on the whole of Bengal through its scholarship, industriousness and erudition. There was a time when the vast Sarasvatii River used to flow through this area. The Sarasvatii River came out of the main branch of the Bhagiirathii River at Triven&#x301;i in Hooghly District&#146;s Mogra Thana. It came out from the right side of the Bhagiirathii. The Yamuna River came from the exact opposite direction, that is, from the left side of the Bhagiirathii through the Chakda and Haringhata Thanas of what was then Nadia District, the adjoining region. This confluence of the rivers Ganges, Yamuna and Sarasvatii Rivers is renowned as the <I>Triven&#x301;itiirtha</I> [holy confluence of three rivers] or the <I>Mukta</I> [liberated] <I>Triven&#x301;ii</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph --><p>From there the Sarasvatii flowed through the fertile, verdant grasslands and grain fields of Hooghly District until it reached Howrah District. There it used to flow past the meadows of Kendua&#x301; on its right side. What we call nowadays the Kendua&#x301; meadows was a vast lake in prehistoric times. The lake gradually filled up and turned into the Kendua&#x301; marshlands or Kendua&#x301; meadows. Up until a hundred years ago the rice and paddy crops never failed in the Kendua&#x301; marshlands. Rice and rice paddy used to be exported from the port of Amta by ship to foreign lands along the Damodara River. Those days are gone. Nowadays the Damodara is almost dried up. Its water is not even knee-deep now, so the plying of ships is out of the question.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph --><p>After moving a little to the south it joined the Bhagiirathii near Andul.

<a name="5..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph --><p>Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; was situated close to the Sarasvatii River in those days. Although a large part of the external trade of Bengal at that time was carried out from the Port de Baun&#x32D;ga&#x301;la&#x301; (Cattagram) and the Port de Grandi (Saptagram), Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; also was a busy port. Merchants belonging to the Sa&#x301;ha&#x301;, Ta&#x301;mbuli, Gandhaban&#x301;ika and Suvarn&#x301;aban&#x301;ika communities were the principle contributors to the growth of its wealth. Brahmans and Kayasthas brought the glow of scholarship, and the skilful peasants of the Ma&#x301;his&#x301;ya and Sadgope communities produced golden harvests. The heroism of the Kaivarta fishing community became famous far and wide. They were respected in the society as &ldquo;Bara&rdquo; [a surname], the best, and were primarily responsible for the formation of the navy of independent Bengal. This area was also home at that time to a shipbuilding factory where indigenous methods were used. That industry perished during British rule. The expert carpenters and Kaivarta fishermen of this place built those ships. The merchants of this area also set out to sea after loading their goods on those ships.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph --><p>Today things have changed. Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; or Sarasvatii has moved on, the Sarasvatii has dried up, and the wealth of Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; has been transferred to other places. There are three chief reasons for this. The first reason is the changing of course and subsequent drying-up of the Sarasvatii. The second reason is the decline of rural industries. The third reason is the loss of economic balance and equilibrium owing to defects in education and the social system. In general, in order to build a strong economy in a certain area thirty to forty percent of the population of that area &ndash; neither more nor less &ndash; should be dependent directly on agriculture. If it is less then agriculture is neglected; conversely, if it is more, then there will be a heavy strain on agriculture. That is exactly what has happened in this Ma&#x301;ju-Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; region. What to speak of Ma&#x301;ju-Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, the same thing has happened throughout Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, throughout Bengal, throughout India, and even in China and the whole of the Southeast Asia. To combat this problem a new social and economic evaluation is necessary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph --><p>Just as agriculture should be built up on an advanced scientific foundation, industry should also be organized in perfect adjustment with agriculture. The percentage of the population depending directly on agriculture should not exceed forty percent. Where rural industries have been destroyed, a major part of the population once engaged in that sector is now moving towards agriculture. Just as the percentage of people depending directly on agriculture should be thirty to forty percent for balanced economic development, about twenty percent of the people should depend on agro-industries, twenty percent on agrico-industries, ten percent on general trade and commerce, and ten percent on intellectual or white collar jobs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph --><p>Because village industries have been ruined, those who depended on those industries have turned to agriculture. The percentage of merchants has not increased much; rather the opportunities for further growth have decreased.

<a name="5..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph --><p>The sons of farmers, after receiving a little education, are no longer willing to labour in the fields. They want to become Babus [title of a Hindu gentleman]; they consider farm work to be menial labour. As a consequence there is a dearth of educated youths in agriculture on the one hand, and on the other an increasing number of people from other vocations turning towards agriculture. In the rural areas the percentage of the population depending primarily on agriculture has gone up to seventy or eighty percent. What an unbearable situation! So just as social and economic life in other parts of Bengal has been turned upside down, Ma&#x301;ju-Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; is no exception. This Ma&#x301;ju-Ma&#x301;kar&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; region was Howrah District&#146;s greatest potential for economic development but that hope has been shattered. Today the city of Howrah is neglected, so it is not capable of supplying vital energy to rural Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph --><p>Non-agricultural industry (such as steel plants, brass industry, metal industry, oil refineries, salt industry and non-plant based pharmaceuticals) refers to those industries that are neither direct agrico-industries (such as the production of pick-axes, spades and tractors) nor industries that are directly dependent on agriculture, that is, agro-industries (such as jute mills, cloth factories, flour mills, paper mills and plant-based medicines). The percentage of people engaged in non-agricultural industry should be formed by reducing the percentage of people depending directly on agriculture, reducing the percentage of people depending on agrico-industries and reducing the percentage of people engaged in agro-industries. The percentage of people engaged in non-agricultural industries should be kept within twenty to thirty of the total population. If the percentage is less than twenty percent, the country is said to be industrially undeveloped and the per capita income of the people cannot be very high. The standard of living also cannot be very high because the purchasing capacity of the people remains very limited. Due to the reduced capacity for purchasing consumer goods, the import index remains lower than the export index or the area has to remain a satellite of a developed country. As a consequence, the balance of power in the world is jeopardized and the possibility of war is always around the corner.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph --><p>If the percentage of people engaged in non-agricultural industry is kept between twenty and thirty percent of the population, then it creates a state of balance, a balanced socio-economic system. If the percentage goes beyond thirty percent it becomes an industrially developed area. The more the percentage rises beyond thirty percent, the more the area goes from industrially developed to industrially over-developed. In order to procure agricultural produce the industrially over-developed countries try to convert agriculturally predominant regions into their satellites. They feel the need to keep these industrially undeveloped countries under their control in order to serve as a market for their finished goods. If they do not obtain markets for their industrially produced consumer goods, they will have to suffer from economic recessions and growing unemployment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph --><p>In this regard, there is no difference between communist and non-communist countries. All of them are equally aggressive in their approach. They are desperately searching for the wish-fulfilling cow, which they want to keep tied to their door, feeding it the minimum amount of fodder. Is it any wonder there are so many wars and conflicts in the world, so much war psychosis and sabre-rattling! Efforts must be made so that each and every country of the world can enjoy a balanced state in both agriculture and industry; otherwise the socio-economic balance of the world is bound to be destroyed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph --><p>The negative consequences of over-industrialization result in the deterioration of the personal, social and political health; due to the gradual psychic degeneration of both individuals and the collective, a kind of psychic epidemic may become rampant any moment which can endanger or jeopardize every expression of life.

<a name="5..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph --><p>Where the industrial system (whether it is agro-industry, agrico-industry or non-agricultural industry) depends on outside labourers, the situation becomes precarious. The speed of psychic degeneration accelerates. Such a region will suffer from a chronic scarcity of food. The possibility of expanding the markets for their consumer goods will be gradually become curtailed. As an example, we can look at Howrah, Hooghly, 24-Parganas and Burdwan. Since the labourers there are outsiders, the local people will never see good days. However developed or over-developed these areas might become, they will have to endure the ill effects of over-industrialization without being able to enjoy any of the benefits of industrialization. This sort of scenario can be seen daily in Howrah District. Moreover there are still many such areas in India where ninety percent of the population consists of farmers. There is no industry whatsoever in those areas. They are completely surplus labour areas. A balanced socio-economic structure will have neither surplus labour nor deficit labour. It cannot be permitted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph --><p>The agricultural system should be built up similar to the industrial system; that is, the prices of agricultural produce should be determined by considering basic factors like agricultural income, expenses and necessities.

<a name="5..121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;I&#146;ll tell you one small incident. Our sahib, this <I>ana&#x301;ha&#x301;rii</I> magistrate, is a skinflint, downright niggardly. But when it comes to himself he is quite generous. Recently he ordered an expensive imported shirt with a French silk collar from Paris, the capital of France. He even attended the office wearing this shirt once or twice but over the shirt he wore an ordinary, cheap coat. You may remember that there was a cyclone some days back which hit the southwest coast of Bengal. On the radio they said that there was a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal, or some such thing. There was a heavy rainstorm in the city that day. Everyone was completely drenched on their way to court. What could the magistrates do? They took off their coats and shirts and sat in the courtroom in their undershirts. The ordinary employees took off their shirts and brightened the room by sitting in their chairs bare-chested, like the roly-poly god Gan&#x301;esha. I sat there with my torn undershirt on. The cool breeze was coming in through a hole in the undershirt; actually it wasn&#146;t an unpleasant feeling. Our sahib, however, was unwilling to take off his coat. I could see that underneath the coat he was wearing the same expensive French silk shirt with its dazzling collar. The sahib&#146;s coat was completely drenched.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;I told him, &#x301;Sahib, please give me your coat. I&#146;ll get it dried. It will be dry before we return home. Don&#146;t you see that the sun is shining outside?&#146;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;The sahib was reluctant to take off his coat. There was a secret desire in my mind that I would make my human life blessed by fixing my greedy eyes again and again on his French silk shirt. Our luck was never going to favour us with such a shirt. Nor did I entertain such a dream. But the sahib was still reluctant to take off his coat. &#x301;Sir, please take off your coat,&#146; I told him, &#x301;your body will be wet and you will fall ill.&#146; Good or bad, the sahib said nothing.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;The other magistrates have taken off their coats and shirts and are in their undershirts,&#146; I told him, &#x301;but you can continue to wear your shirt. However, it would not be wise to continue wearing that wet coat.&#146;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;Even then the sahib said nothing.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;Then I took the initiative and started unbuttoning his coat. This time the sahib had no more objections. There were a few newspaper reporters around. Had the sahib objected, they might have published in the newspapers that there was an uproar and a scuffle in the court, a tussle between the bench clerk and the <I>ana&#x301;ha&#x301;rii</I> magistrate.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;As there was no hindrance from the sahib, I took off his coat. But can you believe it! The collar of the sahib&#146;s French silk shirt was fine, so were the buttonholes, but the back of the shirt was missing. Nor did it have a front or any sleeves. The sahib had bought a torn shirt from some second-hand shop and worn it inside his coat to show off in front of us. He had told us that his paternal aunt&#146;s son&#146;s paternal uncle&#146;s daughter&#146;s niece&#146;s husband&#146;s paternal aunt&#146;s son had paid a French tailor five thousand rupees to make the shirt and then had sent it here by air.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..129"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=129 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;I was flabbergasted. The sahib ran off to his personal chamber and bolted the door behind him. He did not come out until court was over for the day. The court orderly, Bigan Singh, recited a little ditty, <I>uparme phit&#x301;pha&#x301;t&#x301; niice moka&#x301;ma&#x301;gha&#x301;t&#x301;</I> [spick and span on the surface, a dirty wharf below]. From then on the court employees were afraid to recite the ditty they had learned from Bigan within earshot of the Sahib, but whenever they saw us they repeated it &ndash; <I>uparme phit&#x301;pha&#x301;t&#x301; niice moka&#x301;ma&#x301;gha&#x301;t&#x301;</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The verbal root <I>kus&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;to extract&rdquo;, &ldquo;to prepare an essence&rdquo;. For example, to draw honey from a honeycomb, to extract honey by squeezing the wax, to extract honey from flowers, to extract floral nectar from flowers, to prepare a floral essence, to extract medicinal material from green papaya and green spinach &ndash; all are functions of the verbal root <I>kus&#x301;</I>. The verbal root <I>kus&#x301;</I> also means, &ldquo;to make a hole in the ground&rdquo;. <I>Kuks&#x301;a</I> is derived from the verbal root <I>kus&#x301;</I> and the suffix <I>sa</I>. The etymological meaning of <I>kuks&#x301;a</I> is, &ldquo;that in which a void or vacuum is created after extracting something&rdquo;. If the abdomen is compressed, then the abdominal air moves. In colloquial usage, the hollow or void that appears in the upper part of the abdomen is called <I>kuks&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><I>Kus&#x301; +ksi = kuks&#x301;i</I>. Usually the suffix <I>i</I> is used both in an affectionate sense and in a general sense; the suffix <I>ki</I> is used in a general sense and to denote result. And the suffix <I>ksi</I> is used in several specific senses. In ancient times certain scholars did not like to use the suffix <I>ksi</I> but other eminent scholars retained it because of its specific uses. You can also retain it since its use does not cause any serious complications. Etymologically <I>kuks&#x301;i</I> refers to that void or nothingness that cannot be seen or discerned from the outside. The suffix <I>ksi</I> has been used here because it has this special connotation. Colloquially <I>kuks&#x301;i</I> means &ldquo;that void created inside the stomach due to hunger or any other reason&rdquo;. Suppose a crocodile is hungry. A <I>kuks&#x301;i</I> or void has been created inside its stomach. In this situation, if it eats a goat, then that <I>kuks&#x301;i</I> will no longer exist. We say that a crocodile has devoured (<I>kuks&#x301;igata</I>) a goat. Generally, if the second part of a compound word ends with the suffix <I>kta</I> or <I>lyut&#x301;</I> then <I>ii</I> is inserted at the end of the preceding part. For instance, <I>bhasma</I> + <I>bhu&#x301;ta</I> = <I>bhasmiibhu&#x301;ta</I> [reduced to ashes]. Here the word <I>bhu&#x301;ta</I> ends with the suffix <I>kta</I>, so <I>ii</I> is inserted at the end of the word <I>bhasma</I>. In other words, the compound word becomes <I>bhasmiibhu&#x301;ta</I>. Similarly, <I>sarala + krta = saraliikrta</I> [simplification], <I>nava + karan&#x301;a = naviikaran&#x301;a</I> [renovation], <I>khand&#x301;a + bhavana = khand&#x301;iibhavana</I> [balkanization]. There is an <I>i</I> in the word <I>kuks&#x301;i</I>, so <I>kuks&#x301;i + gata</I> will not be <I>kuks&#x301;iigata</I> but rather <I>kuks&#x301;igata</I>; the <I>i</I> remains.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><I>Kun&#x301;ati</I> is formed by adding <I>ti</I> in the present tense to the verbal root <I>kun&#x301;</I>. In this case the meaning of the root verb <I>kun&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;to emit sounds intermittently&rdquo;, &ldquo;to eat while making occasional sounds&rdquo;, &ldquo;to move something around&rdquo;. These are the etymological meanings of the word <I>kun&#x301;</I>. The colloquial meaning of the word <I>kun&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;one who moves around in the midst of many others&rdquo;. The Bengali word <I>ekun&#x301;a</I> is derived from this word <I>kun&#x301;</I>. The word <I>ekun&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;accumulation&rdquo; or &ldquo;cumulative figure&rdquo;. If the present tense <I>ti</I> is added to the root <I>kun&#x301;</I> to form <I>kun&#x301;ayati</I>, <I></I>then it means &ldquo;to converse about some important matter&rdquo; or &ldquo;to give advice&rdquo;. If five people sit and discuss an important matter, then we can call their conversation <I>kun&#x301;a</I>; we can also use the word <I>kun&#x301;acarca&#x301;</I>. If a lawyer gives someone advice, we can also call it <I>kun&#x301;ayati</I>. In this sense <I>kun&#x301; + kan = kun&#x301;aka</I>; the word means &ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; or &ldquo;adviser in an important matter&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In dysentery the pain that is sometimes present around the navel area is called <I>kun&#x301;an</I>.

By this you can understand that the expression <I>pet&#x301; kun&#x301;an</I> is not native Bengali; it is a Sanskrit <I>tatsama</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

The word <I>kun&#x301;ika&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;that with which non-liquid items (e.g., rice and pulse) are measured&rdquo;, what we call <I>kun&#x301;ke</I> in the spoken language.<!-- /block --></p>

Its second meaning is &ldquo;one who uses a blunt weapon&rdquo;. Another meaning is &ldquo;handicapped&rdquo;, e.g., one who is without fingers, one whose fingers are crooked, a lame person, one who has a hare-lip (<I>ganna&#x301; ka&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>), etc.<!-- /block --></p>

The bad scent from the leaves of the herb <I>ga&#x301;n&#x32D;da&#x301;l (Paederia foetida)</I> is not <I>kun&#x301;apa</I> because that is its natural scent <I>&ndash;</I> that scent does not come from anything rotten. In masculine gender the word <I>kun&#x301;apa</I>, that is, <I>kun&#x301;apah</I> (declined like the word <I>nara</I>), means &ldquo;the carcass of any animal&rdquo;, &ldquo;an unclaimed human corpse&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><li>The other meaning of <I>kun&#x301;apa</I> is &ldquo;a kind of bird resembling a myna&rdquo; or a <I>sha&#x301;likha</I> [house-myna]<I></I>. However it is not as quarrelsome as a <I>sha&#x301;likha</I>; it lives in groups. It cannot speak like a myna but if it is properly trained it can speak a little. In certain rural areas of Bengal this bird is called a half<I>-</I>myna <I>or</I> half-<I>sha&#x301;likha (guye myna&#x301;</I> or <I>guye sha&#x301;likha)</I>.

The verbal root <I>tan</I> means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. The word <I>tanu</I> is used etymologically to mean &ldquo;that which increases&rdquo; or &ldquo;that whose nature is to increase&rdquo;.

In tropical countries the human body after the age of thirty-nine should be called <I>shariira</I>, that whose nature is to become thin or emaciated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In colloquial usage <I>kutanu</I> means: <ol> <li>An ugly or distorted or mutilated body, or that person who has such a body.<!-- /block --></p>

The ugly mental body of a person, or the person who possesses that mental body, is called <I>kutanu</I>. In other words <I>kutanu</I> means &ldquo;sinful mind&rdquo;. The word <I>kutanu</I> in this sense is in many cases relative. The mother-in-law is good to everyone. She is especially good to her daughter, but to her daughter-in-law she is a quarrelsome shrew with a fish-knife in her hand. The daughter-in-law also is very good to everyone. The people in the neighborhood all praise her. But her mother-in-law is the mote in her eye, what in Hindi we call <I>a&#x301;n&#x32D;kh kii kirkiri</I>. Both of them are good, so they distance themselves from one another, arrange separate stoves, cook in separate kitchens, measure their rice with separate measuring cups from separate earthen jars and set them on their stoves.

Let me live a worldly life for at least another twenty years more. Let me see my great-grandson be born and then I will think about going to Kashii. I am not going to give up my house keys so easily.&rdquo; In this case the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law are <I>kutanu</I> for each other.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><li><I>Kutapa</I> also refers to one&#146;s daughter&#146;s son, that is, grandson (<I>daohitra</I> or <I>napta&#x301;</I>). <I>Daohitra</I> means <I>duhita&#x301;</I> &#146;s <I></I>[daughter&#146;s] son. The word <I>daohitra</I> has been in use since ancient times. In Sindhi and Punjabi, two languages of West India, containing a large number of words derived from Vedic Sanskrit, the daughter&#146;s son is called <I>dohatara</I> or <I>dohatara&#x301;</I>, derived from the word <I>daohitra</I>. In the remaining parts of North India the daughter&#146;s son is called <I>na&#x301;ti</I>, coming from <I>napta&#x301;</I>. The etymological meaning of the word <I>napta&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;one who prevents downfall&rdquo;, that is, in the absence of the son (<I>puttra</I>: <I></I>one who saves a person from hell is known as <I>put</I>, so two <I>t</I>&#146;s must be retained in the spelling of <I>puttra</I>), the grandson or <I>daohitra</I> was considered eligible to perform the funeral rites. In the present matriarchal and quasi-matriarchal family systems, the daughter&#146;s son is also eligible to perform the funeral rites. One who saves one&#146;s maternal grandfather from downfall by performing the funeral rites is <I>napta&#x301;</I>. Since in ancient times barbers used to help in the performance of funeral rites, one of the words for &ldquo;barber&rdquo; is also <I>napta&#x301;</I>. The word <I>na&#x301;pita</I> [barber] in spoken Bengali comes from <I>napta&#x301;</I>. The words <I>napta&#x301;</I> and <I>na&#x301;pita</I> have almost identical meanings. In modern Bengali the son&#146;s son is also called <I>na&#x301;ti</I>. However the <I>tadbhava</I> word [Sanskrit-derived <I></I>descendant] for &ldquo;son&#146;s son,&rdquo; <I></I>that is, <I>paottra</I>, (<I>paottra &gt; paotta &gt; pota&#x301;: potha&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;scrotum&rdquo;) is <I>pota&#x301;</I>. In North India the word <I>pota&#x301;</I> is used. So one meaning of <I>kutapa</I> is <I>daohitra</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph --><li>The third meaning of <I>kutapa</I> is &ldquo;receding period of time&rdquo;. When it is nine o&#146;clock and somebody asks you what time it is, you reply, &ldquo;It is nine o&#146;clock.&rdquo; By the time you utter the last sound &ldquo;ock&rdquo; it is already a few moments past nine, that is, at that moment nine is already in the past. Similarly, by the time a bell announcing nine o&#146;clock rings for the ninth time, it is certainly a few seconds past nine. That is why the convention in earlier times was that when announcing a particular hour, an additional eight seconds were allowed for the announcement period, that is, here a period of eight seconds would be added to nine as additional time. This additional time was called <I>kutapa</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><p>According to the great sage Maharshi Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da, the first propounder of the atomic theory, instead of fixing only eight seconds for this, the time that is actually spent on the announcement, or expected to be spent, should be regarded as <I>kutapa</I>. This period of time can be less than eight seconds, exactly eight seconds or even a little more. Even though Maharshi Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da&#146;s assertion is logical, it would not be proper to allow an indefinite period of time to indicate a particular hour. So it would be best to continue observing the tradition of adding eight seconds.<!-- /block --></p>

Since it has comparatively more semolina, there is a hint of aristocracy in the flavour and scent of <I>pa&#x301;ntua&#x301;</I>. <I>Pa&#x301;ntua&#x301;</I> should have some syrup inside, but it will not be dripping wet or thoroughly soaked. <I>Pa&#x301;nii</I> means water; <I>toya</I> also means water. But both <I>pa&#x301;nii</I> and <I>toya</I> would be speechless to see the <I>pantua&#x301;</I>&#146;s syrupy water. Thus the confectioners of Bengal towards the end of the Mughal era gave it the name <I>pa&#x301;niitoya</I>. That <I>pa&#x301;niitoya</I> has today become <I>pa&#x301;ntua&#x301;</I>. So it is only natural that you have a sweet curiosity or <I>kutuka</I> to know that <I>pa&#x301;niitoya</I>!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->When the capital of Bengal was transferred from Dacca to Murshidabad towards the end of the Mughal era, the best confectioners there, by order of the Nawab, prepared a milk- curd sweet and gave it the name <I>cha&#x301;na&#x301;bar&#x301;a</I>, and by doing so gave Lalbagh a place in history. Its specialty with respect to other sweets is that it is prepared from fresh, light cow&#146;s milk curds. If it is prepared in good ghee, then it can be made very large. It is said that in olden times, a confectioner in Bahrampur prepared a <I>cha&#x301;na&#x301;bar&#x301;a&#x301;</I> which weighed almost forty kilos. If true it would be rather amazing. So you must naturally have a sweet <I>kutuka</I> to know all about <I>cha&#x301;na&#x301;bar&#x301;a&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Now if you find that the shape of the sweet is elongated, with rice powder mixed with the milk curds, but heated so that it absorbs sufficient syrup, much of which will come out if pressed, and the taste lingers in the mouth for a long time; for example, the <I>lya&#x301;m&#x301;ca&#x301;</I> of Sha&#x301;ktigar&#x301;a (many people mistakenly pronounce Burdwan&#146;s Sha&#x301;ktigar&#x301;a as Shaktigar&#x301;a), then it is only natural that you will be interested in knowing all about <I>lya&#x301;m&#x301;ca&#x301;</I> also.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->It was long ago, towards the end of British rule. One evening I went for a walk towards the hills. I was walking rather quickly. Suddenly I felt somebody walking behind me even faster. I ignored it. I did not look back.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->Then I heard someone saying several times in a loud voice: &ldquo;What a rascal, this Hiran&#x301;akashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d, Hiran&#x301;yakashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->I turned back to find a familiar face, Viru da of Monghyr, Viru Roy. But once again I turned away. I thought that perhaps Viru Roy was in a somewhat unnatural state. You can certainly guess what I mean by &ldquo;unnatural state&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Yes, your guess is correct. Have I not told you that story of Krishnagar? One night a certain inveterate drunkard who had finished off an enormous <I>kutu&#x301;</I> [bottle] fell in the gutter and was rolling around until he became senseless, exactly when no one knows. This memorable event of that night is not today a part of recorded history. Then dawn broke. The touch of the cold morning breeze and the cold water of the gutter sobered him. He opened his eyes and saw a large gathering of people around him. Someone was saying, &ldquo;Oh, the fellow is dead!&rdquo; Someone else was saying, &ldquo;He drank so heavily that he passed out.&rdquo; Yet another person was saying, &ldquo;The fellow may not be drunk at all; it might be some other malady.&rdquo; The drunkard was listening to everything, but out of shame he kept his eyes closed. Still, how long can one remain like that? One has to shake it off and get up. And so he had to open his eyes. As chance would have it, the moment he opened his eyes and looked at the crowd, he saw his son&#146;s father-in-law standing directly in front of him. Then without any embarrassment at all, he said [to son&#146;s father-in-law]: &ldquo;Brother, it is not that what you think. It is my epilepsy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, I was thinking what I was thinking about Viru Roy. Viru Roy was saying: &ldquo;What a rascal, this Hiran&#x301;akashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d, Hiran&#x301;yakashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->So, as I was saying, it was towards the end of British rule. As far as we know, in the Vedic age there was a tendency towards alcoholism. Perhaps even certain sages and saints also were also not immune to its influence. There was a great demand for bottles full of wine in the wine-seller&#146;s shop [<I>shaon&#x301;d&#x301;ika</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->]. This influence of the Vedic age continued into the pre-Buddhist period, and, it can be surmised, somewhat increased. During wartime, the king, bureaucrats and landlords of Magadha drank plenty of alcohol. Buddha reined in this behavoiur. He was concerned lest the good taste and refinements of society be washed away by alcohol addiction. Buddha spoke out against alcohol consumption. History shows that it was Buddha who directly opposed the consumption of alcohol in an outspoken manner. Buddha did not turn his attention to social reform. Had he done so, it would have been a very happy combination &ndash; <I>sone men&#x32D; sugandh</I> [adding perfume to gold]. Still, owing to the influence of Buddha&#146;s ethical doctrine there was a significant decrease in alcohol addiction, prostitution and gambling in social life. When people from other countries arrived in Sri Lanka for the first time, they were amazed to see the moral standard of the Sri Lankan Buddhist population. There was hardly any alcohol addiction, no visible prostitution and no gambling in their social life. Any rational person is forced to admit the fact that Buddha created an impetus toward morality in the psyche of the people of the world; however, it is not enough to propagate morality in the society. It also requires persons capable of tightly holding the reins of morality and keeping them under control. If there are no restraints in social life then morality flashes and disappears like lightning; it will not last. This is exactly what happened during the Buddhist era. Towards the end of that era, pollution crept into the Buddhist Tantric <I>va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</I> and <I>kula&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</I>, complete darkness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->When the Puranic religion (Brahminical religion) arose in the country, it did not make any attempt to stop the flow of alcohol. Royalty drank freely and that had an influence on their subjects. By then the Jain and Buddhist ethical doctrines had become extremely weak. There was not much heard about the impact of alcoholism among emperors during the Pathan era, but there was no effort to control alcoholic addiction in public life. The great souls who appeared in India towards the end of the Pathan era were people of the highest standard, but while none of them supported drinking, some were silent on the subject and others spoke very little about it. No one dealt a heavy blow to the consumption of alcohol. However, all of them strove to keep the society healthy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->Alcohol addiction decreased significantly in public life in ancient Bengal due to the impact of Maha&#x301;prabhu Caitanyadeva. Even today drinking in the Bengali Vais&#x301;n&#x301;ava community is not only disliked but in fact detasted. Drinking is condemned in the Muslin community on religious grounds. If any Vais&#x301;n&#x301;ava or Muslim is addicted to drinking, then he or she loses all social prestige. It is worth noting that in those places in Bengal where there is a strong Vais&#x301;n&#x301;ava or Muslim influence in social life, raw sugar is prepared from the date palm and palm tree, while in those areas where their influence is non-existence or relatively little the people prepare toddy from these palms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The first influx of western civilization into India began approximately four hundred years ago. The western social outlook and lifestyle have been both beneficial and harmful for India. No doubt the benefit has been greater. But one of the negative effects is that it has led to an increase in alcohol addiction. Since the time of the Portuguese, different types of liquor have been manufactured and imported. Alcohol has gradually spread into the different strata of social life. Many poor and middle-class families have been washed away in a flood of alcohol, burnt to ashes in the fire of alcohol.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->In pre-British India, the city police chief could take action against anyone if they were found inebriated in public, but that system went out of vogue after the Mughal period. Many Mughal emperors and kings were addicted to alcohol. Seeing them alcohol addiction increased among the upper classes. Drinking became a status symbol. This tradition continued during British rule. Rather than decreasing, alcohol addiction has increased after independence &ndash; there is no one whatsoever to curb it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->So, as I was saying, it seemed that Viru Roy was in an unnatural state. Viru Ray, I felt Viru Roy draw close to me. He was saying: &ldquo;What a rascal this Hiran&#x301;yakashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d, Hiran&#x301;yakashipu&#146;s rascal son Pella&#x301;d.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->I assumed that there was singing and dancing throughout the night in the Sahibs&#146; club. Viru Roy was the manager of that club. There must have been some dregs left in the bottom of each bottle. Viru Roy must have poured the dregs of a hundred bottles into five bottles and drunk them off. Still I asked him, &ldquo;O Viruda, who have you found for Hiran&#x301;yakashipu, and who for Pella&#x301;d? Oh I know, the sola hat on your head is Pella&#x301;d. I have been seeing for the last five years that it neither grows nor decays. Pella&#x301;d came through unscathed in any situation, whether rain or cold, in the forest or the mountains, and was always immune to any kind of decline, and your hat is just like him. If I take you to be Hiran&#x301;yakashipu, then I have to call your hat Pella&#x301;d.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;you don&#146;t know. In my house there is a real-life, flesh and blood Pella&#x301;d.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

That is why I say that this rascal is Hiran&#x301;yakashipu&#146;s son Pella&#x301;d, Hiran&#x301;yakashipu&#146;s son Pella&#x301;d.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

You know that in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h region there is normally very little water in ordinary rivers and streams. These rivers are rain-fed or fed by riverbed springs. In general, such springs generally do not normally descend from the mountains. They originate because here and there the underground water levels are high. They generate more water during the rainy season. The water pressure falls during winter. Sometimes during the summer the springs dry up due to lack of water pressure. There are quite a few of these subterranean springs in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>

According to the Puranic story, the mother of Shiva&#146;s son Karttika was Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; or Ja&#x301;hn&#x301;avii. She thrust the infant into the waves and abandoned him to the adjoining sandbank. Finding the infant crying, six stars came down from the sky and began to breastfeed him. The infant started suckling with six mouths. As a result the baby subsequently came to be known as S&#x301;ar&#x301;a&#x301;nana (S&#x301;anmukham in South India or six-mouthed). Since he suckled from the breast of the star Krttika&#x301; with his main mouth, he later came to be known as Ka&#x301;rttika (<I>krittika&#x301;</I> + <I>an&#x301;</I>) or Ka&#x301;rttikeya (<I>krttika&#x301;</I> + <I>s&#x301;in&#x32D;eya</I>). He is known in South India as Muru&#x301;gam or Ba&#x301;lasubrahman&#x301;yam also. None of the stars knew his name, so all of them addressed him as Kuma&#x301;ra. Thus he also came to be known as Kuma&#x301;ra. The word <I>ka&#x301;rttika</I> is derived from the word <I>krttika&#x301;</I>. There are two <I>ta-</I>s in <I>krttika&#x301;</I>. It cannot be spelled with one <I>ta</I>. If it is, then the word becomes <I>krtika&#x301;</I>. So we must spell <I>ka&#x301;rttika</I> with two <I>ta-</I>s as well. Similarly we must spell <I>va&#x301;rttika</I>, <I></I>derived from <I>vrtta</I>, with two <I>ta-</I>s<I></I>, for if we spell it with one <I>ta</I> it becomes <I>vrta</I>, which has a different meaning.<!-- /block --></p>

This birth name is also called <I>kumbha</I> or the <I>kumbha</I> name.<!-- /block --></p>

The colloquial meaning of <I>kumbhiira</I> is &ldquo;man-eating crocodile&rdquo; (<I>Crocodile gangelitis</I>). Among the fish-eating crocodiles, those with long snouts eat in the same way. Hence <I>kumbhiira</I> also means &ldquo;alligator&rdquo;. In North India man-eating crocodiles are called <I>magarmaccha</I>. The word is derived from the word <I>makara</I>. At one time this crocodile was found in large numbers in the Ganges, so in the Puranas the mount of the goddess Gaun&#x32D;ga is a crocodile. Thus one name of the goddess Gaun&#x32D;ga is Makarava&#x301;hinii. In Bihar, especially in the Aun&#x32D;ga region, this type of crocodile is called <I>bon&#x32D;chha&#x301;</I>. The fish-eating crocodile is also called <I>ghar&#x301;iya&#x301;l</I> in many places in Bengal and northern India. What is called <I>kumbhiira&#x301;shru</I> [crocodile tears] in proper Bengali, is called <I>ghar&#x301;iyalii a&#x301;n&#x32D;shu</I> in North India. At one time in Bengal, <I>ghar&#x301;iya&#x301;l</I> was used as an adjective for clever and skilful people.

<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Last Sunday I said something about the root verb <I>kup</I>, did I not? Different verbal forms of the root verb <I>kup</I> are used with different meanings. For instance, if <I>ti</I> is added, forming the present tense <I>kupyati</I>, it means &ldquo;to get angry&rdquo;. On rare occasions <I>kupyate</I> can also be seen in Sanskrit literature; in other words, the verbal root is used in both types of conjugation. If one says <I>kopayati</I>, it means &ldquo;that which glitters&rdquo;. Then its form becomes similar to the root verb <I>bhaks&#x301;</I> in causative form &ndash; <I>kopayayati</I> in causative form. If the verbal root <I>kup</I> changes to <I>kumpati</I> or <I>kumpayati</I>, <I>kumpayayati</I> in the causative, then it means &ldquo;to spray&rdquo;, &ldquo;to sprinkle&rdquo;, &ldquo;to remember&rdquo;, &ldquo;to retain in one&#146;s memory&rdquo;, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->People attempt to pass off cheap items by copying valuable items, that is, they want to sell cheap goods as expensive goods in the community or in the market. Greedy people want to pass off inferior metals as gold or silver. That is why all relatively cheap metals, excluding gold and silver, are called <I>kupya (kup + kyap)</I>. They want to substitute gold tinsel for gold and silver tinsel for silver. So we can call gold tinsel <I>svarn&#x301;akupya</I> and silver tinsel <I>rajatakupya</I>. In olden times those who practiced idol worship used to make clay or stone ornaments at the time they were making their icons. That is why you find ear ornaments, nose ornaments, head ornaments, hand ornaments, waist ornaments and foot ornaments alongside the icons found from olden times. You will find similar ornaments on many clay images of today. There is a story about a sahib named Dock. He told the artisans of this country in his mispronounced Bengali: &ldquo;Why are you decorating with clay ornaments? Why don&#146;t you decorate with gold or silver tinsel instead? That will make them all the more beautiful.&rdquo; From that time onwards many artisans began decorating the images with gold and silver tinsel and other such cheap things. Such types of ornamentation were named <I>d&#x301;a&#x301;k</I> decorations or the <I>d&#x301;a&#x301;k</I> ornaments after Mr. Dock.<!-- /block --></p>

The meaning of the root verb <I>rat&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;to spread certain words around&rdquo; or &ldquo;to circulate&rdquo;. <I>Rat&#x301;antii</I> means &ldquo;that woman&#146;s words which are circulated all around&rdquo; (in a eulogistic or a pejorative sense) or &ldquo;that woman who circulates words all around&rdquo; (in a eulogistic or pejorative sense). The etymological meaning of <I>kurat&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;one whose words are not proper&rdquo;, &ldquo;one whose words are uncultured&rdquo;. The colloquial meaning of <I>kurat&#x301;a</I> is &ldquo;one who sells tanned (cured) leather&rdquo; or &ldquo;one who manufactures consumer goods from tanned or cured leather&rdquo; or &ldquo;one who gets such things made and sells them&rdquo;. Most of you must be aware that, as long as the leather is on the body of the animals it is called <I>ga&#x301;tracarma</I>, in English &ldquo;skin&rdquo;. When the skin is removed from the body of a dead animal (<I>kha&#x301;l khicna&#x301;</I> in Urdu, in English &ldquo;flaying&rdquo;), then that separated skin is called &ldquo;raw leather&rdquo; or &ldquo;hide&rdquo;. When this leather is processed or tanned, then it is called cured <I>ca&#x301;mr&#x301;a</I> in Bengali, in English &ldquo;leather&rdquo;. In olden days these jobs were performed by the people who belonged to the cobbler class.

The heron [<I>vaka</I>] flower is somewhat curved. The heron&#146;s beak is also somewhat crooked, that is, the heron accomplishes its aims by bending its beak somewhat. That is why we derive the word <I>vaka</I> by adding the suffix <I>ac</I> to <I>vak</I>. That flower which is curved or bent is called <I>kuravaka</I>. However, <I>kuravaka</I> does not refer to all <I>vaka</I> flowers, only to the flower that is deep red in colour.<!-- /block --></p>

You can also use the word <I>u&#x301;rdhva-kurpara</I> if necessary.

The idea is that how can a goat be made to do this when it is difficult even for a cow? Be that as it may, <I>kuruvinda</I> refers to a kind of barley that grows even in poor soil. Its ears are long and more thorny. Its husk is somewhat puffy and much longer than it is wide. Even though this barley may not be very good or tempting as a food, it makes an excellent drink for stomach ailments.

That sound of the kettle drum could also be heard in different parts of India if one paid attention. Part of India had become a battlefield at that time with the Indian National Army crossing the border into India. We used to listen with bated breath to the Indian National Army Radio news broadcasts behind closed doors and windows. The mechanism they had in place for collecting and broadcasting the news was quite efficient. Though we had not yet received any local news of a skirmish that had taken place between the army and the public only an hour earlier a scant twenty miles from the city, we found out about it from the Indian National Army Radio broadcast from Germany. I made enquiries and came to know that the news was entirely correct. The Indian National Army had conquered the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and had, I believe, given them the names Svara&#x301;ja Dviipa [Freedom Island] and Shahiid Dviipa [Martyrs&#146; Island]. The army had also entered Manipur and hoisted the tricolour flag. The Indian National Army submarines could also be seen off the Indian coast. The situation was grave.

Occasionally for urgent work, people were undergoing great hardship by holding on to the handles of the wagons and hanging like bats in order to travel to their required destination. The suffering was extreme. Such suffering had not been seen even in the battle of Kuruks&#x301;etra, nor during the battle of Lanka, the Trojan war, nor even the First World War. Everyone is compelled to admit that Gandhijii brought a new consciousness to the public mind, whether one supported his role in India&#146;s freedom struggle or not.

If they try to keep her subjugated, they will only be throwing out the baby with the bathwater. To govern the country by driving a steamroller over the bodies of discontented people needs such an investment in manpower and wealth that the remedy will be worse than the disease. The price won&#146;t be worth it. So whether the Allies win or lose the war, imperialism has to quit India. Rather it would be fruitful for them if India was granted her freedom and some secret understanding reached with a few top leaders. In that case India would be reduced to a satellite of the affluent countries. It would supply the raw materials and then buy the finished goods from the factories of those countries. So, willingly or unwillingly, the imperialists have to leave India, and they will try for a peaceful transfer of power.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

A woman who is not <I>kulaka&#x301;</I> herself but the wife of a <I>kulaka</I> is called <I>kulakii</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><li>The word <I>kulaka</I> may also be used for the unknown creepers, shrubs, bushes and roots which have medicinal properties and which grow in mountainous regions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li>You might have occasionally seen a sort of green snake among green creeping plants. Their eyes glisten because they are green. That makes people afraid; they think that these snakes must be highly poisonous. These snakes are called <I>la&#x301;ud&#x301;aga&#x301;</I> snakes [<I>Opheodrys aestivus</I>] in certain parts of Bengal. They stare at a person from behind the leaves when they see that person approaching them. They are not easily visible at first because of their green camouflage. People run away the moment they see them. This <I>la&#x301;ud&#x301;aga&#x301;</I> snake is also called <I>kulaka</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><p>There is a controversy over whether or not this <I>la&#x301;ud&#x301;aga&#x301;</I> snake actually bites people, whether or not they are poisonous at all, and whether or not they belong to the snake suborder or the <I>kakt&#x301;esiya&#x301;s</I> order. But many people believe that they are poisonous. They are one among a number of creatures who live or keep themselves alive by camouflage. But they are not chameleons. Nor are they related in any way to the <I>kakt&#x301;asiya&#x301;s</I> [prehistoric reptiles] family creature that we call the chameleon. They are natural camouflage artists, and like other such creatures they camouflage themselves to hunt their prey or to protect themselves from hunters. Lions, giraffes, and several species of deer are also creatures that create natural camouflage. There is a variety of tame deer that survives through natural camouflage. Generally lions, giraffes, and certain types of deer and golden iguana live in larger numbers in the desert areas or in areas where the surrounding natural colours are grey or sandy. Their enemies, their hunters and their prey cannot recognize them because their colour mergeswith the colour of their surroundings. This is called&ldquo;natural camouflage&rdquo;. Creating confusion in the mind of the enemy through camouflage has been practiced since ancient times in different armies of different countries by wearing khaki dress and other such colours. The purpose was to camouflage their presence by having the colour of the army dress merge into that of their surroundings. In any case, this <I>la&#x301;ud&#x301;aga&#x301;</I> snake takes full advantage of the opportunity afforded by camouflage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><li>A proper name for &ldquo;white ant&rdquo; in Sanskrit is <I>plus&#x301;in</I> (with <I>in</I> at the end). The earthen nest or anthill of the white ant is called <I>valmiika</I>. You must be familiar with that story. When Ratna&#x301;kara sat for spiritual austerities, he remained immobile, motionless, for such a long time that the white ants built up their nest around his body. Since his body turned into an anthill, or <I>valmiika</I>, people gave him the name Maharshi Valmiiki. <I>Kulaka</I> is another name for &ldquo;anthill&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><li>As you well know, there are many species of <I>in&#x32D;dur</I> such as the mouse, the rat, the field mouse [marmot group], tree rat, etc. Some of them live in kitchens, some in storerooms, some in holes in the wall and some in tree hollows. They have many names according to their species and dwelling place: <I>in&#x32D;dur, mus&#x301;ika, a&#x301;khu, kundu</I>, and so on. The mole also has three main species in India. But they are all field moles; they live in burrows in the fields. The entrance to the burrow is towards the bottom and the burrow itself moves upward. So what happens is that during heavy rains when the field is on the point of being submerged, it is difficult for water to seep into the dwelling. If there is water at the mouth of the hole, they can easily come out and escape. Since it lives in a field, the mole&#146;s proper name is <I>vasumitra</I>. During the day the mole cannot see properly, so they mostly come out at night. Certainly you will hardly ever see a mole entering your house during the day. You see it at night.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><p>The mole&#146;s burrow is also called <I>kulaka</I>. One proper name for the mole is <I>kulakeya</I>, in the sense of &ldquo;<I>kulaka</I>-dweller&rdquo;, <I>kulakeyii</I> in feminine gender. Do you not call &ldquo;the mole&rdquo; that type of firework which runs about hither and thither during the Diipavali [light festival] just like a mole does, making a sharp hissing sound? This mole firework does not stay in a <I>kulaka</I>; it is kept in a box or in one&#146;s pocket. The mole&#146;s hole is called <I>kulaka</I>, but do you know the name of the rat&#146;s hole? It is good that you do. If you do not know, then listen well. The word is <I>kundubil</I>. <I>Kundu</I> means &ldquo;rat&rdquo;; <I>bil</I> means &ldquo;hole&rdquo; or &ldquo;opening&rdquo;. The word <I>bil</I> is used in Hindi and in a few North Indian languages to mean &ldquo;hole&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><li>If you use this word <I>kulaka</I> in neuter gender (<I>kulakam&#x301;</I>, declined in the same way as the word <I>phala</I>), it refers to a large <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> [Angled gourd; <I>Lufa acutangula Roxb</I>]. You may also use the word <I>kulaka</I> for the smaller type of <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> that grows in bunches. However, its specific name is <I>saptaputra</I> or <I>saptaputrika&#x301;</I>. The word <I>satputia&#x301;</I>, derived from <I>saptaputrika&#x301;</I>, is used in certain areas of North India for the smaller variety. The large variety is called <I>jhiun&#x32D;gii</I> in those places. This vegetable makes the mouth salivate, so it helps somewhat in eating and digestion. However, if one eats large amounts of <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> day after day, one runs the risk of contracting dysentery. <I>Jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> keeps the body cool and fresh, but it makes people more active because it increases blood circulation to some extent. <I>Jhiun&#x32D;ge-posta</I> [a type of dish made with poppy seeds] protects the body from dryness or contraction during the summer season, just as pigeon-peas do. Many knowledgeable people say that the addition of poppy seeds increases the quality and sweetness of <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I>. A high-level enquiry commission can be set up to determine the veracity of this statement! <I>Jhiun&#x32D;ges</I> from the Ranchi region are quite long and also tasty as well. The proper name for <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge-posta</I> is <I>pos&#x301;ita-kulakam&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><p>The proper Bengali word for poppy seed is <I>pos&#x301;ita</I>. Its colloquial form <I>posta</I> is derived from <I>pos&#x301;ita</I>. <I>Pos&#x301;ita</I> is spelled with <I>s&#x301;a</I>, but <I>posta</I> is spelled with <I>sa</I> because the cerebral letter <I>s&#x301;a</I> and the dental letter <I>ta</I> cannot be conjoined. So it must take <I>sa</I>. If <I>s&#x301;a</I> is retained then we have to use <I>t&#x301;a</I> instead of <I>ta</I>. In that case the word becomes <I>pos&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>, but it is not pronounced <I>pos&#x301;t&#x301;a</I> but rather <I>pus&#x301; + kta = pus&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>. The word <I>pus&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>, however, is used with a different meaning. In the months of <I>caetra</I>, <I>vaesha&#x301;kha</I> and <I>jyaes&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>, <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge-posta</I> in small quantities is good for health. <I>Jhiun&#x32D;ge</I> soup with ginger paste (known as <I>kar&#x301;ui</I> in certain places) is considered to eliminate food aversion, increase appetite and increase blood circulation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><p>The matter of water gourd crops up in connection with <I>jhiun&#x32D;ge</I>.

<a name="9..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><li>If there is more than one stanza in a poem they are collectively called <I>kulaka</I> (in neuter gender). If a song has more than one verse then they are also collectively called <I>kulaka</I>. Some people also call a stanza of a poem a <I>stavaka</I>. No, <I>stavaka</I> cannot be used in this sense. The Bengali derivative of the word <I>stavaka</I> is <I>thoka&#x301;;</I> for example, a <I>thoka&#x301;</I> [bunch] of flowers, a <I>thoka&#x301;</I> of fruits. The word <I>thoka&#x301;</I> is also used for &ldquo;bouquet&rdquo;; for instance, a bouquet of flowers may be called <I>pus&#x301;pa-stavaka</I>. The word <I>stavaka</I> can also be used in the sense of &ldquo;tier&rdquo; or &ldquo;layer&rdquo;. For instance, instead of saying, &ldquo;arranged in layers&rdquo;, one can say, &ldquo;arranged in <I>stavakas</I>&rdquo;. The word <I>tha&#x301;k</I> is also a corrupted form of <I>stavaka</I>.

The day has come for those who want to remain neutral in matters of judgment to ponder the issue carefully. I can say, without showing the slightest disrespect to the Indian leaders of those days, they not only lacked social and revolutionary consciousness but also a clear vision of a well-defined and sound economic structure. They wanted to irritate the British by swaying public opinion in various ways and then reap the harvest of Indian freedom, like cutting a crop gently with a sickle and storing it in a granary. &ldquo;Kill the snake but do not break the stick.&rdquo; Those who think that the policy of non-violence is no policy at all, that it is merely the political strategy of people with no other alternative, should remember that the mental attitude of the leaders of those days was not the result of having no other alternatives.

He wanted to capture freedom by exploiting the situation, or in plainer language, overpowering and stunning the opposition by adopting a policy of &ldquo;strike while the iron is hot&rdquo;.

The Congress chairman was called the President of the State in those days. Was this not rather ludicrous? There was no state; how could there be a state president? If there is no head then how can there be a crown on that head? The contest between Subhash Bose and Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the Congress party chairmanship was a contest of this <I>kula&#x301;latva</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph --><p>Gandhiji was a simple man. So when Subhash Bose won and Sitaramaiya was defeated in that contest, he said openly, &ldquo;Sitaramiya&#146;s defeat is my defeat<I></I>.&rdquo; <I></I>Subhash Bose never allowed this difference in <I>kula&#x301;latva</I> with Gandhiji to become personal, nor did Gandhiji. But some ambitious Congress leaders did just that. And their spewing of venom, as well as use of the chains of non-violence, at the personal level, were two of the many reasons for Subhash Bose&#146;s emigration. Those who used to call Subhash Bose a traitor or a misguided patriot based on mere superficial knowledge, without any deep understanding of politics, or being goaded by different kinds of motives, had perhaps lost sight of one fact. If Britain, France and the United States could dine together with Russia in order to protect their countries&#146; freedom, despite being poles apart in economic outlook, then what serious fault did Subhash Bose commit when he sought the help from the Axis powers (Germany, Japan and Italy) in the cause of a country having no military strength and aspiring for freedom? Actually the war was between two imperialist as well as expansionist forces. Neither of the parties was pure and holy. Whichever side Subhash Bose had joined for the cause of freedom of the country, his opponents would have certainly condemned him. Those who call the working plan or ideology of Subhash Bose &ldquo;Subhashism&rdquo; are mistaken. There is no such &ldquo;ism&rdquo; as &ldquo;Subhashism&rdquo;. Subhash Bose wanted freedom for the country and he wanted it very strongly. So he took the role of a pragmatist and an opportunist. If some have condemned him for this, then it has to be understood that they wanted success the easiest way possible without suffering any scratches themselves in their political life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph --><li>During the time of King Ballala Sena <I></I>certain Brahmans and Kayasthas of Bengal were called <I>kuliina</I> by royal decree based on certain particular qualities. Since then their descendants have enjoyed <I>kuliina</I> status irrespective of whether or not they possess those virtues. One of the important features of this system was that this special status would be maintained through daughters, that is, the parents would give their daughters in marriage to bridegrooms with the same <I>kuliina</I> status. If a daughter was given in marriage to a non<I>-kuliina</I> (i.e., <I>shrotriya</I> Brahman or <I>maolika</I> Kayastha) <I></I>then the family lineage would be adversely affected.<!-- /block --></p>

If the three lineages are not <I>kuliina</I>, but if every daughter has been married to a <I>kuliina</I>, it is called normal <I>kuliina</I> or natural <I>kuliina</I>. If a daughter marries into a non-<I>kuliina</I> family, it is called broken <I>kuliina &ndash; bhaun&#x32D;ga</I> <I>kuliina, ka&#x301;p kuliina</I> or <I>shuddha maolik</I>. If this continues for seven generations they are called <I>shrotriiya</I> or <I></I>ordinary <I>maolika</I>. If <I>shrotriiyas</I> or ordinary <I>maolikas</I> have no marital relations with <I>shrotriiyas</I> or ordinary <I>maolikas</I>, then they become known as pure <I>shrotriiyas</I> or pure <I>maolikas</I>.

In the case of Brahmans, in the absence of a royal directive if their link with their original settlement is lost, then they lose their <I>kuliina</I> status. For instance, a resident of the village Bandyoghatii in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h (the person&#146;s name was Guro Bandyopadhyaya) who started living in the Ma&#x301;saca&#x301;t&#x301;aka <I></I>area of Bhuluya&#x301;<I></I>, that is, Noakhali, lost their <I>kuliina</I> status and became <I>shrotriiya</I>, that is, their surname became Ma&#x301;sacar&#x301;aka, which became transformed into Ma&#x301;saca&#x301;t&#x301;aka/Ma&#x301;saca&#x301;r&#x301;aka/Cakravartii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph --><p>How advantageous this <I>kuliina</I> system was, it is difficult to say. But its main disadvantage was that these <I>kuliina</I>s were often forced to marry their daughters to a man with many wives in order to preserve their <I>kuliina</I> status<I></I>. Often they were compelled to marry their underage daughter to an old man with many wives. Quite often their daughter had to remain unmarried all her life. On the other side the disadvantage was that while individual <I>kuliinas</I> had many marriages (Ram Chandra Mukhopadhyaya of the village of Janai married one hundred sixty-five times), the <I>shrotriiya</I> or <I></I>non<I>-kuliina</I> men could not find brides. Many men had to remain bachelors. As a result, while on one hand the number of <I>kuliinas</I> increased by leaps and bounds, the <I>shrotriiya</I> families were on the verge of extinction. Consequently all sorts of improper behaviour was seen in society. Unmarried daughters of <I>kuliina</I> families and unmarried men from <I>shrotriiya</I> families created social problems. Finding no way out, society had to close its eyes to such improper conduct. Such a state of affairs cannot bode well for any community.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph --><p>As a result of this faulty <I>kuliina</I> system the number of Banerjees, Mukherjees and Chatterjees in the Bengali Brahman community increased like wildfire, while the number of Ma&#x301;saca&#x301;r&#x301;akas, Kusha&#x301;riis, Bat&#x301;abyals, Ka&#x301;n&#x32D;ijla&#x301;ls, Pa&#x301;kr&#x301;a&#x301;ha&#x301;shis, Pa&#x301;lodhis, Patitundis, Diirgha&#x301;un&#x32D;giis, and Gar&#x301;hgar&#x301;his, <I></I>etc<I></I>. decreased almost to the verge of extinction. The Ghoshas (<I>Dash</I> <I>Ghos&#x301;a</I>), Vasus and Mitras of the Bengali Kayasthas <I></I>increased in large numbers, while the number of pure <I>maolika</I> &ndash; Sena, Sim&#x301;ha, Deva, Dutta, Kara, Guha, Das and Palita decreased considerably.

<a name="9..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph --><p>The situation reached such a critical stage during the Pathan era in Bengal when the Nawab was Hussain Shah.

Purandar Khan held a large meeting with the <I>kuliina</I> Kayasthas and changed the <I>kuliina</I> system from a system of lineage through the daughter to a system of lineage through the eldest son. That is, a <I>kuliina</I> Kayastha would be able to give his daughter in marriage to any <I>kuliina</I> or pure <I>maolika</I> or ordinary <I>maolika</I> bridegroom. He would be able to arrange the marriage of his other sons to any such family.But the firstborn son would have to be married to a <I>kuliina</I> Kayastha. In other words, a Kayastha with the surname Ghosh would be obligated to marry their firstborn son to someone in a Basu or Mitra family, but they would be at liberty to arrange the marriage of their other sons and daughters with any family. This both preserved the <I>kuliina</I> system in the Kayastha community and also prevented the degeneration of their scholarly genius.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph --><p>The Nawab and Purandar Khan attempted to arrange such a meeting with the Brahmans as well, but they did not agree to their proposal. As a result, the <I>kuliina</I> system among the Brahmans continued to be passed on through the daughters.

Anyhow, some Brahmans and some Kayasthas continued to be called <I>kuliina</I> in accordance with the <I>kuliina</I> system introduced by Ballal Sena among the Brahmans and Kayasthas of Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><I>Kul + yat = kulya</I>. The meaning of the root verb <I>kul</I> is <I></I>&ldquo;to amass&rdquo;, &ldquo;to collect&rdquo;. The etymological meaning of the word <I>kulya</I> is &ldquo;that which has been collected&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which has taken shape after being amassed&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The colloquial meanings of <I>kulya</I> are: <ol> <li>One who has been born into a family which everyone regards with respect, which society recognizes as a good family. Here there is no connection being made with high family status <I></I>(<I>kuliina</I>) or inferior family status (<I>shrotriya</I> or <I>maolika</I>). A good family is one that displays virtue, nobility and humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><li>The second meaning of the word <I>kulya</I> is &ldquo;that person whose parents are legally married&rdquo;. Such a person will be called <I>kulya</I> irrespective of whether or not they are born into a good family in the opinion of the people. Karna of the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> had countless virtues. However his parents were not married in accordance with the accepted rules of society; he was the illegitimate son of Kunti. Because society considered him non-<I>kulya</I>, he had to suffer much humiliation. Human society should be such that no person feels humiliated for any reason whatsoever other than for crimes that they themselves have committed. Karna was not guilty of any crime by being born. Then why should he be humiliated? It was the duty of the society to free Karna from the humiliation of illegitimacy by solemnizing the legal marriage of his mother Kunti with his anonymous father Surya (there is nothing in the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> about the genealogy of this Surya)<I></I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><li>The third meaning of the word <I>kulya</I> is to elevate the society to a higher and higher level, physically, mentally and spiritually, by selecting proper brides and bridegrooms. Nowadays different kinds of birds, animals, trees, creepers, fruits, flowers and crops are being transformed into higher breeds. Different kinds of hybrid or high-yielding crops are being produced. The milk supply is being increased by developing a better breed of cow. The result of the creation of more developed species is called <I>kulya</I>. High-yielding rice can easily be called <I>kulya</I> rice. A milk cow that produces a greater quantity of milk can be called a <I>kulya</I> cow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li>These preceding usages of the word <I>kulya</I> apply not only to masculine and neuter gender but also on occasion to feminine gender as well. The meaning of the word <I>kulya</I> when used exclusively in masculine gender (<I>kulya</I> is declined like the word <I>nara</I>) is &ldquo;well-wisher&rdquo;. You certainly consider someone or another to be your well-wisher. You share with them your pain and suffering and problems when you are in trouble or danger. You feel sure that after listening to you your well-wisher will do whatever is necessary for your good. That person is a <I>kulya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><li>Whether there is any person who is <I>kulya</I> in the worldly sense or not, the Supreme Father is the well-wisher of everyone. So one meaning of <I>kulya</I> is <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><li>When in trouble or in danger, if a person wants to take the help of the law then he or she has to consult a lawyer, and in such cases he or she has to move according to the lawyer&#146;s advice. So a proper word for &ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; is also <I>kulya</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><li>If we use the word <I>kulya</I> in feminine gender, that is, if we say <I>kulya&#x301;</I> (declined like the word <I>lata&#x301;</I>), then one of its meanings is the tributary of a large river that ultimately rejoins that river. If a small river joins a large river then we call that small river a &ldquo;tributary&rdquo;, and if a small river emerges from a large river then we call the small river a &ldquo;branch&rdquo; of the main river. If a river is the branch of a large river, and a little later turns into a tributary of that same river, then it is called <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. For instance, the River Ba&#x301;da&#x301;i emerges from the Damodara and later rejoins the Damodara, so its name is Ba&#x301;da&#x301;i Kulya&#x301;<I></I>. The Ka&#x301;na&#x301; River and the Ka&#x301;na&#x301; Damodara come out of the Damodara and then rejoin it, so they are also <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. The River Kalindii, after emerging from the Mahananda, rejoins the Mahananda, so the Kalindii also is <I>kulya&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><li>You have noticed how sometimes the waters of the rainy season create potholes even in highways. It becomes difficult to negotiate those roads for quite some time after the rainy season. This pothole on the highway, created by the rain, is also called <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. Feel free to use the word <I>kulya&#x301;</I> in this sense.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><li>You know that the ways and means of navigable canals are different than those of irrigation canals. Navigable canals generally connect one flowing body of water with another flowing body of water. So a navigable canal must not only have sufficient depth, it must also have some current. Otherwise different kinds of aquatic plants, weeds and algae will adversely affect the main flow. This navigable canal is also called <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. Bear in mind that while the word <I>kha&#x301;la</I> (canal) appears to be of either native Bengali or foreign origin, actually this is not the case. <I>Kha&#x301;la</I> is a Sanskrit derivative. In Persian, Urdu and Hindustani <I>kha&#x301;la</I> means &ldquo;hide&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><li>An irrigation canal is not meant for navigation and it does not always have water. When necessary, water is released through sluice gates. Small irrigation canals are in most cases blind canals, that is, their onward flow halts after some forward progress. This irrigation canal is also called <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. To distinguish clearly navigable canals from irrigation canals, they can be called <I>nao-kulya&#x301;</I> and <I>seca-kulya&#x301;</I> respectively<I></I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><p>You know that there is a place and a railway station near Krishnanagar in Nadia District by the name Ba&#x301;dkulya&#x301;. The word is derived from <I>baddhakulya&#x301;</I>, that is, <I></I>once there was a <I>kulya&#x301;</I> there but later, when its mouth became choked, it became a blocked canal (<I>baddhakulya&#x301;</I>). <I>Ba&#x301;dhkulya&#x301;</I> is a corruption of <I>baddhakulya&#x301;. Dha</I> is an aspirate, so using its non-aspirate, the word Ba&#x301;dkulya&#x301; <I></I>can function as a Sanskrit derivative, but it cannot be spelled with <I>lla&#x301;</I> [it will be <I>lya&#x301;</I> as in Ba&#x301;dkulya].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><li>When the bed of a river or any other body of water is higher than the adjoining land, then the water of that river or body of water can flow out at any time with great force and flood the adjoining area. In such a situation, the bed of this body of water has to be dug with a dredger or something else, that is, it has to be made deeper by removing the sand and silt, or else a high embankment has to be built on its bank so that the water can never flood the adjoining land. The embankment that is built to check the flow of high rising water is called a &ldquo;dyke&rdquo; in English and certain other European languages. We may call it a <I>stara-ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dh</I> in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><p>In certain places the bed of the Damodara has already become higher than the basin of Burdwan district, and in certain places it is becoming higher. In this situation, if there is a large outflow of water from the Damodara at some point, then undoubtedly the districts of Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah will be flooded. In this situation an effective measure would be to remove sand and silt from the bed of the Damodara with a dredger and thereby make the river basin much deeper than the adjacent land. If this is not done in order to avoid the expense, then a high embankment must be raised alongside the Damodara. This is not only to save the left bank of the Damodara but also for the safety of the right bank. Otherwise floods may occur at any time in those parts of the districts of Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah which are situated on the right bank of the Damodara, especially in the subdivision of Arambagha. This special type of dam on the bank of the Damodara is also a dyke.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><p>In Holland, it is difficult to save the country from ocean flooding by deepening the ocean, so there is no choice but to construct high dykes. Having seen those dykes personally, I have often thought that this type of dyke is also necessary in certain areas of the subdivisions of Contai and Diamond Harbour in Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><p>We can also have windmills here as they do in Holland since the ocean wave-driven wind in these coastal areas is stronger than ordinary wind. It is also possible to arrange for production of cheap electricity from those windmills, as it is from the ocean flood tide. At one time these windmills played a very important role in the industrial development of Holland. If constructed they will serve the same purpose in the districts of Midnapur and 24 Paraganas as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><p>The bed of our river Ajaya has gradually become higher owing to the deposit of silt. The proportion of sand in the soil has greatly increased in certain areas in the Ajaya River basin in southern Birbhum. However, it is still possible to cultivate sandy soil crops such as winter bulbous crops and sugar cane. If there is any further delay then that opportunity may cease to exist. In that case arable land would have to be cut out by using machinery to remove the surface sand. Although that situation has not yet arisen in the southern portion of the Ajaya River in Burdwan District, its bed is higher than its own tributary, the Kunur. As a result, instead of the water of the Kunur entering the Ajaya (this entry is natural), sometimes the water of the Ajaya enters the Kunur. This is not a desirable state of affairs. This problem cannot be solved only with dykes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><p>In addition to what we understand by <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dh</I> or embankment, the word is also used in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali in the sense of a large reservoir. The terrain in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, especially western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, is uneven. Rainfall is also scarce, although the land is very good for the cultivation of pre-winter rice. But other crops do not grow well. However those areas where the land is a little yellowish are all suitable for the cultivation of mustard. Be that as it may, the scarcity of water is a permanent problem in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. For this reason, in ancient times the kings of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h used to provide for the excavation of large reservoirs. These reservoirs were not only deep, they were also capable of holding the water of the rainy season because they were surrounded by high banks. If there was a scarcity of water during the sowing of paddy or when the grain emerged, then the banks of the reservoir would be broken to irrigate the land and thus save the paddy. These large reservoirs are called <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dhs</I> in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali because they are dug primarily to store water for irrigation. Among these water reservoirs in Bengal are Dar&#x301;a&#x301;ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dha of Dumka, Ra&#x301;jba&#x301;n&#x32D;dha of Burdwan, Samudraba&#x301;n&#x32D;dha, Bhagaldighi and Ra&#x301;n&#x301;iba&#x301;n&#x32D;dha of Bankura, Sarashun&#x32D;ka&#x301; of Midnapur and Sa&#x301;hebba&#x301;n&#x32D;dh of Purulia. These <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dhs</I> should be called reservoirs in English, not embankments. Samudraba&#x301;n&#x32D;dha in Bankura District is perhaps the largest such reservoir in the world. A small river called the Amodara, a tributary of the Damodara, also emerges from this reservoir.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><p>In a river development project, the embankment that is constructed at the end of the hill-stage of a river submerges a vast area and a large quantity of water is dammed at that place. This system of storing water by blocking the mouth of a river is also called <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dh</I>, in English <I></I>&ldquo;dam&rdquo;. Apart from the dam, in the downstream part of the river, where the plain stage starts at the end of the hill stage, the embankment which is constructed at that spot by blocking the mouth of the river without flooding the adjoining land is called a &ldquo;barrage&rdquo;. This may be called <I>jalabandha</I> or <I>kabandha</I> in Bengali. So you understand that a <I>jalabandha</I> or <I>ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dh</I> or dam is constructed at the upstream portion of a river and a barrage at the beginning of the plain stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><p>Generally every river has three stages: the hill stage, plain stage and delta stage. Certain rivers of the world become extremely salty when they reach the delta stage. In that case an embankment or a dyke must be built in order to save the adjoining paddy lands from the damaging effects of the salt water. Such dykes or embankments need to be erected along certain rivers of south 24 Parganas. In former times the Rasulpur River and the downstream portion of the Suvarn&#x301;arekha&#x301; in Midnapur had this problem. It should be investigated to see whether or not that problem still exists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><li>Long, naturally occurring ditches are called <I>kandara</I> in Sanskrit. The word <I>kandara</I> generally has two meanings. One is &ldquo;deep hole&rdquo; and the other is &ldquo;interior&rdquo;. <I>Kandara</I> is called <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;dara</I> or <I>ka&#x301;ndara</I> in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali. Generally, in seasons other than the rainy season they remain dry or contain little water. They fill up with the monsoon rains and the runoff from the rivers during the monsoon. Some young and small fish are found there. These <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;daras</I> mostly have only one mouth like blind canals. <I>Ka&#x301;n&#x32D;daras</I> are mostly found in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h region, especially in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h where the terrain has rolling hills. These ditches are natural creations. A proper name for <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;dara</I> is <I>kulya&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph --><li>People excavate the ground in a straight line when laying the foundation of a building. If the ground is hard, less digging is necessary. But when the ground is soft, it has to be dug a little more. So the foundation of the building is laid by placing bricks or stones in holes dug in a straight line fashion. As long as bricks and stones are not placed in these holes they are called trenches. People of different countries dig trenches to defend themselves from air attacks during a war. <I>Kulya&#x301;</I> is also a proper word for &ldquo;trench&rdquo;. <I></I><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><li>The word <I>kulya&#x301;</I> is closely linked to medicines as well; so before elaborating on this, it is necessary to say a word or two about the relationship between human beings and medicine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><p>Not only humans but many other creatures as well are more or less familiar with medicines. However, since ancient times many non-human creatures have considered fasting or deliberate abstinence from food as their natural medicine. You will notice that dogs and certain other animals abstain from eating if they feel a little ill. You also often do not feel like eating when you feel somewhat physically out of sorts. Some contemporary physicians advise their patients, and even pressure them, to eat even when they do not have any appetite. This, however, goes against the laws of nature. It is natural for a sick creature to feel an aversion for food, unless they suffer from the disease of overeating. By not eating, certain organs of the body enjoy a temporary rest. As a result, after the fast the organs are rejuvenated and reenergized and a feeling of wellbeing returns to the physical body. So not only in the case of prehistoric humans, in the case of the prehistoric animals as well, the ancient, pure and chief medicine was fasting or voluntary abstention from food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph --><p>There is a basic distinction between voluntary abstention from food and <I>upava&#x301;sa</I>. Voluntary abstention from food (<I>sveccha&#x301;-anashana</I>) means to not take food willingly in order to keeping the body healthy (<I>an + ashana = anashana</I>). <I>Ashana</I> means &ldquo;eating&rdquo;, so <I>anashana</I> means &ldquo;not eating&rdquo;. This abstention from food certainly helps to heal disease. However, imposed abstention from food does not have the same effect because forced abstention creates a suppressed agony in the mind which upsets the mental balance and at the same time also upsets the physical balance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><p><I>Upava&#x301;sa</I> is undoubtedly a kind of voluntary abstention. However, at the same time there is to some extent a withdrawal of physical activity and a gradual directing of ones mental propensities towards closer proximity with <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a</I>. <I>Upa</I> means &ldquo;near&rdquo; and <I>va&#x301;sa</I> means &ldquo;to stay&rdquo;. Thus the etymological meaning of the word <I>upava&#x301;sa</I> is &ldquo;to remain near the Lord&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph --><p>So as I was saying, <I>upava&#x301;sa</I> not only has the benefits of voluntary abstention from food. In addition, this practice is especially helpful for maintaining mental balance, that is, <I>upava&#x301;sa</I> is a medicine for both physical as well as mental maladies. There is no doubt whatsoever that a person&#146;s mental strength is reinforced if he or she observes fast in a systematic fashion. This is a truth that has stood the test of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..29"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph --><b><p>Sunlight and air</b>: There are many healing elements in sunlight. The rays or pencils of rays of different colours in sunlight are medicines for different kinds of diseases &ndash; preventive and antidotal. Sunlight has different benefits during different hours of the day. Sun-warmed water also has different kinds of benefits. Thus sunlight has been regarded since ancient times as medicines for different bodily ailments. It is also said in the Vedas: <I>su&#x301;ryah yatha&#x301; sarvalokasya caks&#x301;uh</I> [as the sun is the eye of the entire universe]. The medicine, that is, sunlight should be taken in through the dorsal spine, not through the chest or the abdomen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph --><p>The pure air (O<SUB>3</SUB>) of a secluded place is also an excellent medicine for the physical body. This medicine in the form of air should be taken through the back of the head and the upper part of the forehead. The earth from a riverside area near a forest in which there is a small amount of sand and a large amount of soil is also an excellent medicine for the physical body. This medicine should be taken bare-bodied on a bed of earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..31"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph --><b>Water</b>: Odorless, tepid water, especially if it is sun-warmed, is an excellent medicine for the physical body. It has great healing qualities. Since ancient times, knowingly or unknowingly, human beings and different animals have also accepted water as one of their medicines. It is also said in the Vedas: <I>a&#x301;pashca vishvabhes&#x301;ajii</I> [and water is a universal medicine].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><p>However the quest for medicines on the part of human beings and animals has not been limited to fasting, sunlight, water, air and earth. Initially the medicines that human beings discovered were different trees and plants and the external use of their bark and roots. The human beings of those times used to chew them and smear or rub the diseased part with them. These ointments were the first medicines discovered by human beings. When these ointments did not work externally, it became necessary to ingest them. Humans used to take them as medicine by chewing or swallowing them. This was the second step in the use of medicines in human history.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph --><p>There were many such medicines that were only available in particular seasons, not all year round. People used to gather them in the specific season and dry them so as to preserve them. In certain places they would preserve them in the form of tablets with the help of water; in other places they would just dry them normally. This preservation of medicine in the form of tablets or pills belonged to a later stage in the use of medicines in human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph --><p>Where medicines were not effective as external ointments, it became necessary to rub them on the skin or on the nerves where they could be absorbed through the pores. People discovered these rubbing medicines somewhat later. These massage or rubbing ointments were the discovery of a later stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph --><p>Where there was any poisonous effect of the rubbing ointment, there was no recourse but to use it externally. However, people learned to use them without any poisonous effect in the form of liquid medicines by dissolving them in water or other liquid solvents.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph --><p>There are certain ointments which, if ingested in small doses, have no poisonous effect, but which may have a poisonous effect if taken in large doses. Human beings learned to use them by licking them so that they could act effectively through the nerve fibres. They used to swallow those medicines after licking them with the tongue for a long time. Because the quantity is very small there is no harmful effect; rather one gets the full benefit. Such medicines are called <I>avaleha</I> [licking] in Ayurveda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph --><p>People even discovered some medicines that develop certain special beneficial qualities when mixed with other specific substances. In other words, the same medicine when mixed with substance &ldquo;a&rdquo; became a medicine for headaches, when mixed with substance &ldquo;b&rdquo; became a medicine for diarrhea, and when mixed with substance &ldquo;c&rdquo; became a medicine for respiratory ailments. In this case, people gave the name <I>anupa&#x301;na</I> [ingredient] to the substances &ldquo;a,&rdquo; &ldquo;b&rdquo; and &ldquo;c&rdquo;. That is, by discovering that the medicinal qualities varied according to the different <I>anupa&#x301;nas</I>, people began to use them as medicines.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph --><p>Through their experience, people found that in certain diseases the patient&#146;s vitality diminishes. In these cases, the medicines are effective when they have some alcoholic properties; so they fermented them to prepare different kinds of remedies. These medicines, which are prepared through fermentation, are called medicinal <I>a&#x301;sava</I> (&ldquo;elixirs&rdquo;&ndash; <I>a&#x301;sava</I> means alcohol, for example, wine). In cases where the alcoholic properties of the medicines were necessary, but where the medicine would have a contrary effect if the negative effects of the alcohol were not removed, they altered their qualities rather than keep them in the form of <I>a&#x301;sava</I>. They gave the name &ldquo;medicinal <I>aris&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>&rdquo; to such medicines; for example, <I>dra&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301;ris&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>, <I>dasamula&#x301;ris&#x301;t&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph --><p>It was found in the case of certain medicinal herbs and plants that if they were boiled in water and their essences extracted, then their medicinal qualities were greater than in their raw state. This essence is called <I>kva&#x301;th</I>; for example, catechu <I>kva&#x301;th</I>, <I>ashvagandha&#x301;</I> <I>kva&#x301;th</I> and various others. People began to use these <I>kva&#x301;thas</I> as medicines. The <I>kva&#x301;tha</I> that is produced by boiling different medicinal herbs and plants together is generally known as <I>pa&#x301;n&#x32D;can</I> in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph --><p>Medicines that are excessively bitter or insipid, where possible, were cooked and mixed together with rice or any other principal food item, thus discovering a newer method of taking medicines<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->. In this way people started deriving medicinal benefits from neem leaves, bitter gourd, <I>pat&#x301;ol lata&#x301;</I>, <I>gandhika&#x301;</I>, and such medicines by consuming them with their principal food, such as with rice in Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph --><p>Moonlight is not a medicine like sunlight is. Rather moonlight often overwhelms the mind with a different kind of emotion. However, the qualities of medicinal herbs and plants are affected according to the difference in moonlight, that is, in accordance with the lunar day and lunar fortnight. So there are rules for removing medicinal plants from the soil, preparation of medicines and their uses in accordance with the lunar day. The medicinal qualities undergo changes during the different periods of the day, so one should use medicines with that factor in mind; at least it is better if it is done so. Those medicinal herbs and plants or those medicines whose qualities are affected according to the difference in lunar day or planetary position are called <I>kulya&#x301;</I>. So you see, this also is a meaning of the word <I>kulya&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph --><p>Not only have human beings used plant substances for medicines since ancient times, they have also prepared medicines extensively from animals. In the Ayurvedic, Vaidyaka and Unani systems of medicine, animal substances, such as the livers of different animals and partridge fat, were used extensively. Who is not familiar with the medicine prepared from the body of a goat and oil from the hornbill? Medicines used to be prepared from the livers, pancreases, etc., of different animals in the allopathic system of treatment. In recent times they have been used for insulin. Cod liver oil and shark oil are frequently used. They are used not only as oral medicines but also in injections. Medicines such as naja, cina, and apis in homeopathy are completely of animal origin. Killing an animal in order to save the life of a human being may not be a very good practice, but it can be done when there is no alternative. This is a universally accepted principle. But when medicines are prepared by killing animals, it should be done as far as possible from those animals which are the born enemies of human beings. Those who are not the born enemies of human beings but are their natural friends should not be killed.<!-- /block --></p>

People realized the value of this principle during the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> age from the poison treatment of the poisoned Bhiima. There were considerable advances in Ayurveda in poison research, especially with snake, scorpion, spider and hornet poisons. Within Ayurveda, members of the royal family of Cochin in the state of Kerala were pioneers in this. At one time there was a good deal of individual research into poison treatments. My maternal grandfather, the late Dr. U. M. Basu (allopath) conducted research into the medicinal use of scorpion poison, but he died before his research findings could be properly documented. The science of allopathy does not seem to have made much progress in these treatments, but there are endless opportunities for making progress in this respect.<!-- /block --></p>

They did not want to allow anything into their bodies through injection, so this science remained unappreciated. Nowadays it is possible to save the patient&#146;s life with injections in the case of diseases that are difficult to cure or treat, or in the case of life-threatening disease. Thankfully, modern practitioners of Ayurveda and Homeopathy, willingly or unwillingly, have accepted the use of needles and themselves use them.<!-- /block --></p>
