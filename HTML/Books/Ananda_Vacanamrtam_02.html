<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->It has been said, &ldquo;Guru krpa&#x301;hi kevalam&rdquo;. It has also been said that &ldquo;Brahmaeva gururekha na&#x301;parah&rdquo;. You know in the word &ldquo;guru&rdquo;, there are two syllables, &ldquo;gu&rdquo; and &ldquo;ru&rdquo;. &ldquo;Gu&rdquo; means &ldquo;darkness&rdquo;; darkness in spiritual life, darkness in psycho-spiritual strata. And &ldquo;ru&rdquo; means &ldquo;dispelling entity&rdquo;. &ldquo;Guru&rdquo; means the entity that dispels all sorts of darkness from your spiritual and psychic bodies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is the only guru, and nobody else can be the guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Nirgun&#x301;a has no objectivity. Hence, Nirgun&#x301;a does not keep any link with this world. So the Nirgun&#x301;a Entity, as it is, cannot be the guru. And Sagun&#x301;a is under certain bondages. So Sagun&#x301;a cannot be the guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The guru should be just like Nirgun&#x301;a, but keeping a sweet link with that expressed world. And no other entity can be the guru, can be the dispeller of darkness from your spirit and mind: &ldquo;Guru krpa&#x301;hi kevalam&rdquo; means &ldquo;Brahma krpa&#x301;hi kevalam.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->What is Krpa&#x301;? In Sam&#x301;skrta, the root verb is &ldquo;kr&rdquo;. &ldquo;Kr&rdquo; means to help one in one&#146;s progress even when one does not deserve it. So if one deserves it, that is, if one has the qualification to get oneself fully developed and fully exalted, then in that case there is no necessity of krpa&#x301;, there is no necessity of help from Ta&#x301;raka Brahma. But when one does not deserve it, when one has not got the qualification for development, and still one is helped, that sort of help is called &ldquo;krpa&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now you may say, this entire Cosmos, all the creation, everything that you see or feel, everything is His creation. Then for the sake of impartiality He should help all. That is, His krpa&#x301; should be for all. Why should there be a special case. I have said so many times that there should not be any special case. Wherever there is a special case, there is favouritism. So there should not be any special case. So there should not be any krpa&#x301; for anybody. Everybody should be treated equally. If Parama Purus&#x301;a helps somebody specially, the He is supporting partially.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now there is something to say in this connection. The philosophy says that the Supreme Entity has created everything, so He belongs to everybody, and everybody belongs to Him. But a spiritual aspirant who has developed love for Him won&#146;t accept this philosophical gospel in his personal life. He says, &ldquo;Let there be so many principles, so much logic and philosophy; I am not to be guided by those philosophical texts. I am to be guided by my own feelings&rdquo;. And what is that feeling of that spiritual aspirant who has developed love for Him? He says, &ldquo;God is mine and He belongs to me only, and to nobody else, and I belong to Him only and to nobody else. That is, my God is my personal property and I don&#146;t want to share this personal property with any second individual&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So, when such a strong sentiment of love has developed, there is certainly force in it. By dint of that force, that poor and weak man attracts Him and He cannot neglect that man. That attraction is a thousand times stronger than the gospels of philosophy. If He is attracted by such loving sentiment, then is He at fault? Certainly not. And everybody has the right to attract Him like this, Why don&#146;t you do it?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->And the second thing is that even under normal conditions He is showering His compassion on each and every particle of this universe. He is showering His compassion without distinction of caste, creed, nationality or religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->But what happens? There is a shower, a heavy shower of compassion on each and everybody, but if during that shower you hold an umbrella over your head, you won&#146;t be drenched. So is the fault that of the shower? Certainly not. The fault is with your hand and with your umbrella of vanity; and that is why you are not drenched by that compassion, by that krpa&#x301;. He is not at fault. Then what are you to do? You are to remove that umbrella of vanity from your head, and then and there you will be drenched, fully drenched, by His universal compassion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Nobody else is the guru. Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is the only guru. And the second thing &ndash; there is no alternative but to pray, but to request, but to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, to get His compassion and attract Him by dint of that loving force, that loving stamina within your heart.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I think it is my socio-spiritual responsibility, socio-spiritual duty, to say something regarding prapatti. In Sam&#x301;skrta &ldquo;pra&rdquo; - pat + ktin = prapatti. The idea, the spirit of &ldquo;prapatti&rdquo; is that whatever happens in this Universe of ours is nothing but an expression of Cosmic desire or Cosmic will. Neither can there be any volcanic eruption nor can any blade of grass move without his order. Everything is pre-ordered, pre-ordained by the Supreme Entity. Man can do nothing. Living beings cannot do anything without His support; that is, when a human desire and His desire coincide, then only does the human desire become fruitful, otherwise it is a sure failure. When the jiiva&#146;s desire coincides with the desire of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, then it is successful, otherwise not. This is the spirit, this is the central idea of the term &ldquo;prapatti&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Bhaktiva&#x301;da, that is, devotional cult, stands solely on this prapatti. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nava&#x301;da does not support prapatti and bhaktiva&#x301;da solely stands upon it. People may question the practicality of prapattiva&#x301;da or &ldquo;prapatti-ism&rdquo;. A jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii, may say, a learned scholar may say, &ldquo;When everything is being done by Him according to His desire or action or His sam&#x301;kalpa, what is the necessity of human endeavour?&rdquo; The jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii may think that this is a knotty question for a bhakta. The bhakta won&#146;t be able to give a suitable reply. But, you know, although the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis think that they are the most intelligent, they are the intelligentsia, actually bhaktas are more intelligent than jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis; and the greatest fool is the person who thinks that he is a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now, I have already said that a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii cannot even force a blade of grass to move, but the bhakta can, if he maintains a close tie with the Supreme; and there lies the excellence of a bhakta. The fact is that human ability, human capability and human efficiency are almost nil. Nothing really belongs to a human. He gets everything from the Supreme Entity. If he does not take food for three or four days continuously &ndash; or for three, four or five years &ndash; then nothing will be left of him. He will not be able to speak or move. Thus, nothing belongs to humans. A bhakta knows that what belongs to him is His, because he is His. So the first reply of the bhakta is this: &ldquo;One cannot do anything by one&#146;s own endeavour&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->All worldly knowledge and other mundane knowledge and so-called wisdom has little value. Such knowledge is known as &ldquo;pra&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya&rdquo;, that is, va&#x301;kya coming from, coming through, the media of different worldly persons, worldly expressions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In old geography books, you will find that Allahabad was the capital of Uttar Pradesh. In later books you will find that Lucknow is the capital of the same state. And it may be different in the future. So such is the condition of pra&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. It is relative and subject to change. Bhaktas take it with a grain of salt. But intellectuals constantly fights amongst themselves in the basis of their bookish knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->For a bhakta, only a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya has value. What comes from Parama Purus&#x301;a is a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. When the devotee is able to hear, feel, realize and understand the will of Parama Purus&#x301;a through having developed a relationship of love with Him, it is called a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. As devotees, you should follow only a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. You should remember that the Sixteen Points are your a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Your fundamental basis should be prapatti. &ldquo;Everything happens as per His desire and not a single blade of grass can move without His permission&rdquo;. By the Grace of, by the compassion of Parama Purus&#x301;a, you have received the a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya guidelines, and it is your duty to adhere strictly to the teachings and gospel of a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. A jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii has no future.<!-- /block --></p>

The Macro-psychic Entity is omniscient. The microcosm is not. Why not? The micropsychic entity cannot become omniscient because of its limited capacity to reflect itself on any physical or psychic objectivity. But in the case of the Macro-psychic Entity, everything comes within Its scope. There is no special endeavour, and no necessity for special effort, to know anything, because all things are within Him and all are within His ectoplasmic dispersion. A microcosm can know an object, a particular object, for a particular span of time, but not for all spans to come or all spans of the past.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Just see the pitiable condition, the miserable condition of a microcosm. Most of you do not know what happened to you one hundred years ago. Most of you do not know what your social position was two hundred years ago, though certainly you had a social position two hundred years ago. Something happened to you one hundred years ago, but you have forgotten everything. But the Macrocosm knows everything. When you come in close proximity to the Macrocosm, you will be able to know, you will be able to see, everything of the past, present and future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So, to forget or not to know the past stories of your life, say from one hundred or two hundred years back, does not increase your prestige. It is not a matter of glory for you. But you can do one thing, you can be in close touch, close proximity and love with Him and know everything, and that is the best secret. People will then say, &ldquo;That little boy, he knows a lot&rdquo;. Actually, the little boy knows nothing. He is in love with the Great, that is why he knows everything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now, everything that is known to the Macro-psychic Entity is within Its infinite structure, within Its infinite framework. Everything is within, nothing without. Everything is His internal mental projection, intra-psychic projection. That is why He knows everything and will always know everything. And for individuals, for micropsychic entities or microcosms, almost everything is external. There lies the imperfection. And what is the spiritual practice of a spiritual aspirant? His is a movement, a never-ending movement, from imperfection towards perfection, from electronic imperfection towards nuclear perfection.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Regarding Him it is said that everything is His intra-psychic projection and that the creation is a Macro-psychic conation. That is why He requires no limbs, no sensory or motor organs. Everything is realized within His mind. But in the case of the microcosm, most things are externally situated. That is why, in order to express himself, the microcosm requires motor organs, and to take knowledge and sensory perceptions he requires sensory organs. But because the Cosmic Entity requires no motor organs or sensory organs or motor nerves, He is infinite. He is a non-corporeal entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When the common point between Sagun&#x301;a and Nirgun&#x301;a, the tangential touch of Sagun&#x301;a and Nirgun&#x301;a, comes in contact with any quinquelemental body, then we say that Ta&#x301;raka Brahma has come. In that case also the Nucleus is there. That is why He is also omniscient without the help of sensory or motor organs. That is the secret and that is why it has been said regarding Him that &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

The name of one Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika goddess is &ldquo;Viin&#x301;a&#x301; Pa&#x301;n&#x301;i.&rdquo; He has no pa&#x301;n&#x301;i but touches everything. &ldquo;Pa&#x301;do&rdquo; &ndash; He has no legs but He is everywhere, He moves everywhere. At the same time He is in Patna, in Mokameh, in Samastipur and on all other planets, stars, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yavano grahiita&rdquo; &ndash; He moves without taking the help of legs and hands.

You require no extra-ocular vision. You see everything. And similarly, He hears the inner language of anything and everything without the help of His ears. Not only the external sounds, but also the sounds coming from the deepest core of each and every living entity, conveying all its urges and aspirations.<!-- /block --></p>

He knows everything that comes within the periphery of knowledge or wisdom. But there is no second entity to know Him. To know Him, one is to merge oneself in the ocean of the Macrocosm. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is the soliloquy of the Supreme? His soliloquy is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Mayyeva sakalam&#x301; ja&#x301;tam&#x301; mayi sarvam&#x301; pratis&#x301;t&#x301;hitam,<br>Mayi sarvam layam&#x301; ya&#x301;ti tadbrahma&#x301;dvyamasmyaham.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Everything cometh from Me, remaineth in Me and goeth back in Me. &ldquo;Mayyeva sakalam ja&#x301;tam&rdquo;. Everything cometh from Me. That is, He desired that something should be created in His mind, that there should be a thought-projection, internal thought projection in His mind, that He should create the universe. And the universe came into being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->He wanted it. Why did He want it? Philosophers fail to find out the reason.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Why did He think like this that He would create the universe? Who can know the motive, the intention of the Supreme as to why He did create? But He created. It is not known to the philosophers, why such an idea to create come into His mind. But as I told you a few days back, where the philosophers fail, the bhaktas, the devotees succeed. Here the philosophers fail to give the satisfactory reply to others. Not only that, they fail to get a satisfactory reply for themselves. But the devotees can, because they have got deep love, internal love, unknown love, secret love for the Supreme within the core of their hearts. They say, &ldquo;We know what the reason is: He, our Lord was alone in this universe. If you are forced to remain alone in a house, you will become almost mad, what to speak of being alone in the entire universe.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Sa va&#x301; eka tada&#x301; drs&#x301;t&#x301;a na pashyat drshyamekara&#x301;t&#x301;,<br>Me ne santamiva&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; suptashaktirasuptadrk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Our Lord was alone. He had got the potentiality to see, to hear, to smell, to speak, to do anything and everything. But because there was no second entity whom to speak to? Whom to love? Whom to tell? Whom to punish, saying, &ldquo;My boy, why have you done wrong? Don&#146;t you deserve punishment? You should be punished.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->At that time He could not punish anybody because nobody was there. As there is nothing beyond Him, nothing without, so He could not get any second object to love or to punish. I did not say &ldquo;hate&rdquo; because He does not know how to hate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->He cannot do two things. He does not know how to hate and He does not know how to create a second &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a&rdquo;. He remains a singular entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So He has to create it within His mind, within His internal projection of thought. That is why the soliloquy is &ldquo;Mayyeva sakalam&#x301; ja&#x301;tam&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Mayi sarvam&#x301; pratis&#x301;t&#x301;hitam&rdquo;. After creation, He will have to look after the creation. Who else is to do this or take this responsibility? Because there was no second guardian factor to look after the creation; so His creation had to be looked after by Him. The responsibility of looking after the creation had to be shouldered by Him and by Him only.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Mayi sarvam&#x301; layam&#x301; ya&#x301;ti&rdquo;. Everything you know is moving. The universe is a passing show, is a moving reality, a fast changing panorama. Since the thought-waves are moving, the universe is also moving, everything is moving. In Sam&#x301;skrta, the world is called &ldquo;sam&#x301;sa&#x301;ra&rdquo; (sam&#x301; &ndash; sr +ghain&#x32D;) which means moving by nature. The world is also called &ldquo;jagat&rdquo; (gam + kvip), which means moving. So, everything is moving, because thought-waves are moving. These thought-waves move in a systaltic order, in a pulsative way. After movement, where are those created beings to go? Finally, they are to merge, they are to come back to the starting-point, become the culminating point. That is why the soliloquy says &ldquo;Mayi sarvam&#x301; layam&#x301; ya&#x301;ti&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Everything cometh back to Me, there is no alternative. &ldquo;Na&#x301;nya pantha&#x301; vidyateyana&#x301;ya&rdquo;. It is the only route, the circular path known as Brahma Cakra, the Cosmological Order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tadbrahma&#x301;dvyamasmyaham&rdquo;. This is my own, these are my own. I am engaged in this duty of creating, then nourishing, retaining or maintaining and finally taking back everything within Me. This is my duty, and because of this duty, I am known as Brahma. I am the Singular Entity; there can not be two Brahmas. There can not be two Parama Purus&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I have these two imperfections. First, I can not create second Parama Purus&#x301;a. Whoever loves Me becomes one with Me. The person can not maintain his separate identity. That is why I always remain a Singular Entity. And the second thing is that as everything is created by Me, so everything is My child, everything is My progeny. That is why I can not hate anything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->I keep busy in the task of generating, maintaining and destroying and have no time to take rest.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->As you know, curry, even if it is prepared with maximum care in all other aspects, can not be treated as a palatable dish if there is want of salt in it. Similarly, all human endeavours to find out a link between the finite and the infinite fail, if there is want of devotion in them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Take the case of karma. The aspirant is a karma yogii, but all his karmas are sure to fail if there is want of devotion. A karma is glorified only when it remains associated with devotion and love for the Supreme. Otherwise, a karma becomes mechanical, and the little bit of introvertiality that one possesses in the rudimental stage disappears after a short while, and the movement becomes purely extroversive one. That is, human existence itself becomes a machine. So one can not achieve the Supreme Goal by dint of one&#146;s karma, when the said karma is not associated with devotion or love for the Supreme.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->And now let us see what happens if one is engaged in tapasya&#x301;. &ldquo;Tapasya&rdquo; means freely undergoing hardship in order to reach the goal within a short while. Now what does happen if, while doing this &ldquo;tapasya&rdquo; there is no love for the Great? Such tapasya&#x301; is nothing but a misuse of time. Tapasya&#x301; without love is a misuse of time and will have an adverse effect on the physical body and also on the psychic body and the result is definitely bad.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is yoga? &ldquo;Yogashcittavrttinirodhah&rdquo;. Yoga is suspension of all the psychic propensities. Now if, during the suspension, this period of suspension, there is love for God, then all the suspended propensities rest on the Supreme Entity. Suppose, one is a great Yogii but if there is no love for his goal, then those suspended propensities are finally converted into crude matter, that is, the subtle human existence becomes like iron, it becomes like wood, it becomes like sand. What a deterioration! What a downfall! This particular type of yoga where a yogii does not bear love for the Supreme Entity is called &ldquo;hat&#x301;ha yoga&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta. It is dangerous for the human elevation. &ldquo;Hat&#x301;ha&rdquo; comes from &ldquo;ha&rdquo; and &ldquo;t&#x301;ha&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ha&rdquo; represents &ldquo;su&#x301;rya na&#x301;dii or ida na&#x301;dii&rdquo; and is the acoustic root of physical force. &ldquo;Tha&rdquo; represents &ldquo;candra na&#x301;dii or piun&#x32D;gala&#x301; na&#x301;dii&rdquo; and is the acoustic root of the mind. So &ldquo;hat&#x301;ha&rdquo; implies forcible control of mind by physical force. In popular parlance whenever something happens very abruptly or all of a sudden we use the word &ldquo;hat&#x301;ha&#x301;t&rdquo; i.e., &ldquo;Hat&#x301;hena kurute karma.&rdquo; Obviously a practitioner of &ldquo;Hat&#x301;ha Yoga&rdquo; can not attain liberation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Suppose, a man has no devotion or love for the Supreme, but he is a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii, an intellectual. Others recognize the fact that he is a really great jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii, he knows this and he know that. But jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na without Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is like the skin of a banana. It is not the real banana, it is the skin of a banana. One will get no taste from it. His knowledge is not para&#x301;vidya&#x301;, his knowledge is apara&#x301;vidya&#x301;, that is, his relative knowledge pertains to the crude materialism. This type of crude material knowledge concerned with the crude materialism has done much harm to human society during the last one century. It has misguided the entire human society, it has converted human beings into animals. Indeed, animals also have been exploited by the propounders of these crude philosophies.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->It has been said that all knowledges &ndash; &ldquo;para&#x301;&rdquo; and &ldquo;apara&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; are just like a very big ocean of milk. Now, after churning the ocean of milk, what do you get? You get butter and buttermilk. After churning this type of ocean the butter portion has been enjoyed by the devotees and the buttermilk portion is left for the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis. Intellectuals fight amongst themselves regarding the ownership of that buttermilk portion. And finally not even that buttermilk is enjoyed by them, because it goes bad before they come to a decision as to who is to enjoy it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There are many categories of bhakti. Amongst them the main three types are ta&#x301;masii, ra&#x301;jasii and sa&#x301;ttvikii bhakti. Ta&#x301;masii bhakti means static devotion. It is not actually bhakti because the unit&#146;s desire is for his or her enemies to be destroyed. Since Parama Purus&#x301;a is not the goal, it is sure that he or she won&#146;t get Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;jasii bhakti means mutative devotion. In this form of bhakti, one wants physical property. So one may or may not, as a result of this bhakti gain prosperity, but it is sure one won&#146;t get Parama Purus&#x301;a, because Parama Purus&#x301;a is not the goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In the case of sa&#x301;ttvikii bhakti, or sentient devotion, the goal is Parama Purus&#x301;a. Sa&#x301;dhakas should aspire for Him and Him alone, and this is the Supreme Goal of all human endeavours.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today I will say something about certain cardinal attributions of Iishvara &ndash; attributions which are essential for looking upon Him as Iishvara. It is said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Kleshakarmavipa&#x301;ka&#x301;shyaerapara&#x301;mrs&#x301;t&#x301;ah purus&#x301;avishes&#x301;a Iishvarah&rdquo;. The Entity that remains unassailed, uninfluenced by the cardinal propensities such as klesha, karma, vipa&#x301;ka and a&#x301;shaya is called Iishvara. Otherwise, He may be called as Bhagava&#x301;n or we may use some other epithet for Him but not Iishvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is klesha? There are certain mental propensities. I am saying mental propensities because in this case or in certain cases it has got nothing to do with the nerve fibres or nerve cells. When the pulsations of mental feeling can not maintain parallelism with the pulsations of expressions of our nerves, then that propensity or those propensities or that controlling propensity is called klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;-vrtti or klesha. When, they maintain that parallelism it is called or they are called aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;-vrtti. Now in case of Iishvara, the question of maintaining parallelism between mental pulsations and never pulsations does not arise because everything of His Being is of an internal character. There remains no scope for maintaining any parallelism with anything else. So He is free from all klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;-vrttis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In a human being, klesha-vrtti is caused by avidya&#x301;. Avidya&#x301;, that is, the cardinal ignorance, is arranged in five stages. Those five stages are avidya&#x301;, asmita&#x301;, ra&#x301;ga, dves&#x301;a and abhinivesha. These forms of avidya&#x301; are the causes of the birth of klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;-vrtti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Avidya: &ldquo;Anityashuci-duhkha&#x301;na&#x301;tmasu nitya-shuci sukha&#x301;tmakhya&#x301;tiravidya&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When anitya, ashuci and duhkha&#x301;tma vrttis are treated as nitya, shuci and sukha&#x301;tma, it is known as avidya&#x301;. Everything in this quinquelemental universe is of a transitory nature. But when due to the influence of this avidya&#x301;, the cardinal ignorance, one thinks that everything will remain with oneself, as it is or as they are, this defective style of thinking is avidya&#x301; &ndash; that is, when he considers this transitory (anitya) world to be as permanent (nitya); impure (ashuci) to be pure (shuci); worldly pains to be bliss; and the non-spiritual, that is, the material, to be the supreme, this is avidya. These are different varieties of avidya&#x301;. It is like a dog chewing a bone. There is nothing in the bone but while chewing the dog&#146;s lips get cut and bleeding starts. The dog sucks its own blood, taking it to be the juice coming out of the bone. Even though actually the dog is getting hurt it imagines that it is licking happiness. Such things happen on account of avidya&#x301;. One regards crude, lifeless and non-living objects as having sparkling souls or spiritual idols. This is all due to avidya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Asmita&#x301; Drgdarshanashaktyoreka&#x301;tmataeva&#x301;smita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The second form of avidya&#x301; is known as asmita&#x301;. When the motor and sensory organs function, the mind witnesses. Had there been no witnessing mind, the functions of those sensory and motor organs would have remained unrecognized. Similarly whatever the mind does is recognized due to the presence of the Cognitive Faculty. Had there been no A&#x301;tman or Cognitive Faculty, all mental feelings would have remained unrecognized. But due to the same cardinal ignorance, people think that the mental functions and their witnessing counterparts are the same. This type of ignorance is known as asmita&#x301;. The function of the eye is to see but it is due to mind that eyes are able to carry on their functions. The shakti (power) through which eyes see is known as darshana. It is on account of the shakti and the mind that the function of seeing is accomplished. That is why existence of mind is also essential. In this context, mind is termed as drk-shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The function of hand is known as shilpa. But nowadays noted singers are also called kan&#x301;t&#x301;ha shilpii. No shilpa can be accomplished by vocal cord. The function of the hand is called shilpana-kriya&#x301; and that of the feet, caran&#x301;a-kriya&#x301;. The action is performed by organs but only when mind witnesses, otherwise not. Functions of organs are substantiated by mind. That is why if organs are to be termed as karma-shakti, then mind is to be termed as krt-shakti. In absence of krt-shakti, karma can not be accomplished. Because of lack of proper knowledge, people consider krt and karma to be one and the same and similarly they enmesh drk and darshana. Those who do so are ignorant. The avidya&#x301; which causes such ignorance is asmita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;ga: What is ra&#x301;ga? Due to the influence of certain external influences such as books or bad company or any kind of bad association, when one feels weakness for a certain object or moves towards that object without being guided by any reason, without any reason or rational support, the avidya that causes such stage of mind is called raga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Dves&#x301;a: The fourth stage of avidya&#x301; is dves&#x301;a. Dves&#x301;a is due to the influence of certain personal or intellectual support of some other entities. When one feels a sort of repulsion for certain objects without support of any reason or rationality that particular propensity is called dves&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Abhinivesha: &ldquo;Svarasovahi vidus&#x301;ohpi tatha&#x301; ru&#x301;s&#x301;ho&#146;bhinivesha&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The last one and the most dangerous one is abhinivesha. Even the learned persons and the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis, the scholars know that this is this and that is that &ndash; or what is what and which is which. Even knowing everything they are entrapped by certain propensities. This particular nature of weakness is called abhinivesha. Several times you would see a teacher moving his fingers as if he is using a cane. In class room he uses cane. Now there is no cane in hand but he is moving his finger in that style. A drunkard knows that drinking is a very bad practice. Even then he can not give it up. These are all examples of abhinivesha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The vrttis caused by the aforesaid five forms of avidya&#x301; are called klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;-vrtti. They are mainly prama&#x301;n&#x301;a, vikalpa, nidra&#x301;, smrti and viparyaya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Prama&#x301;n&#x301;a: &ldquo;Pratyaks&#x301;a, anuma&#x301;na a&#x301;gama prama&#x301;na&#x301;ni&rdquo;. That is, whatever one feels through one&#146;s senses is pratyaksa and whatever one feels by applying guessing-method is anuma&#x301;na. Where there is smoke one may come to the conclusion that there is fire. This is anuma&#x301;na. A&#x301;gama is a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. But sometimes one knowingly does not adhere to the dictates of the gospels of a&#x301;ptava&#x301;kya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Viparyaya: &ldquo;Viparyaya mithya&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na matadrupapratis&#x301;t&#x301;ham&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->We use several words which are actually non-existent. For example &ldquo;We stay in the heart of Patna town&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oh! That beautiful building is situated in the heart of Patna Town&rdquo;. Patna town is something material. Can it have a heart? Heart exists in living bodies. Patna is something purely non-animatic. It is something purely material having no life in it. It can not have any heart but it is said the building is situated in the heart of the town. Use of such language is viparyaya. Sometimes we use language as in the following shloka:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Mrgatrs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;mbhasiisna&#x301;tu&#x301; khapus&#x301;pakrtashekhara&#x301;;<br>Es&#x301;a bandhya&#x301; sutoja&#x301;h shashashrungadhanurdharah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->We do like this due to the ignorance, due to avidya&#x301;. These are all klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; vrttis. The meaning of the shloka is that after taking bath in the water of a mirage (the mirage, you know is in the desert &ndash; actually there is no mirage, and there is no water there) and wearing the crown made of kha pus&#x301;pa, the a&#x301;ka&#x301;sha kusum, that is, the flowers of the sky (there are no flowers in the sky) the boy whose mother is a sterile lady (a sterile lady cannot have a child), his bows and arrows are made of the horns of rabbits and hares (rabbits and hares do not have horns).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Vikalpa: &ldquo;Shabdagun&#x301;a&#x301;nupatii vastushu&#x301;nyo vikalpa&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Similarly we sometimes use vikalpa also and we misuse it. For example, you are coming from Arrah to Patna. After crossing Phulwarii Shariff you say that Patna has come. No, Patna has not come &ndash; Patna is where it was. It is you who have come near Patna. You say, &ldquo;This road goes to Varanasi&rdquo;. But the road does not go; it is you who go.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->I need not explain nidra&#x301; and smrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In klesha these are all klis&#x301;t&#x301;a vrttis. Then comes karma. Karma means change of place. The faculty that effects the change of place is called karma. Now in case of the Parama Purus&#x301;a, everything is within. So the question of change of place or change of space, that is, the effect of spatial factor, does not arise. So He is not affected by or assailed by the influence of karma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Vipa&#x301;ka means reaction, reactive momenta. Whenever there is an action there will be equal and opposite reaction provided that the three fundamental, the three rudimental factors of time, place and person, that is, temporal factor, spatial factor and personal factor remain unchanged. If there is any change in personal, spatial or temporal factor then reaction won&#146;t be equal and opposite. It may be more, it may be less. And you in case of each and every actional expression, all these three factors will change. So the reaction will never be equal and opposite. Suppose, an amount of Rs. 100 has been borrowed. At the time of repayment because of change of time factor, an interest will have to be paid along with the principal sum of Rs. 100. So the sum repaid will be something like Rs. 105 or 110. A person does something wrong and comes to Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; seeking punishment. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; will punish just according to the degree of the sin or a bit more or a bit less. Because of change in time factor the degree of punishment will not be same. This reaction is called vipa&#x301;ka in Sam&#x301;skrta. Whenever there is any action, where the action is dominating, the karma is dominating, the karma is prevailing, the karma is assailing, the karma is influencing, there must be reaction. But in case of Parama Purus&#x301;a, there is no such thing. All actions are done within Himself, within His Macro-psychic structure. So in His case, the question of being influenced by reaction does not arise. Therefore He is not affected even by vipa&#x301;ka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;shaya: A&#x301;shaya means &ldquo;containing entity&rdquo;. Each and every expression of this universe of ours, each and every entity of this universe requires some adhara i.e. container where to remain. No one can remain without an adhara. Be it an idea or an action, adhara is a must, particularly for a crude or physical body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->About 4000 years ago the name of Patna town was Kusumpur. At the time of Ashoka, it became Patliputra. Thereafter it was inundated and ravaged by the floods of Ganga and Sone rivers. Thereupon a new establishment, a new town was founded. For establishment &ldquo;Pattan&rdquo; is the word in Sam&#x301;skrta. From &ldquo;Pattan&rdquo; it became Patna and later &ldquo;Patna&rdquo;. &ldquo;Patna&rdquo; is derived from &ldquo;Pattan&rdquo; and not from &ldquo;Patliputra&rdquo; as it was too big a name.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The town of Patna has got its a&#x301;shaya in Patna district, Patna district is in Patna Division, Patna Division in Bihar State, Bihar State in India country, India country in Asia, Asia is on the planet Earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The Earth has several names in Sam&#x301;skrta viz. bhu&#x301;, bhu&#x301;mi dhara&#x301;, dharitrii, sarvam&#x301;saha&#x301;, vasumatii, gotra, ku, prthivii, prthvii, ks&#x301;ama&#x301;, avanii and mahii etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The a&#x301;shaya of this planet Earth is this solar system and that of this solar system is Parama Purus&#x301;a. But for Parama Purus&#x301;a there is no a&#x301;shaya. He requires no shelter. So He remains unassailed by the influence of shelters. That is why:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Klesha-karma-vipa&#x301;ka&#x301;shayaerapara&#x301;mrs&#x301;t&#x301;ah Purus&#x301;a Vishes&#x301;ah Iishvarah&rdquo;. The Vishes&#x301;a Purus&#x301;a, not these Jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;s but that very A&#x301;tman, that particular A&#x301;tman who remains unassailed by the influence of klesha, karma, vipa&#x301;ka, and a&#x301;shaya is known as Iishvara. In the Moghul period Kings at Delhi used to sometimes think that they were dilliishvaras &ndash; that they were Jagadiishavaras. Often they were forgetting the fact that they were neither dilliishvara nor jagadiishvara. They were ordinary souls.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Since the very dawn of civilization there is a living question regarding salvation of human beings. The supra-psychic existence which remains in close proximity to a corporal framework, and uses that very corporal framework as the only medium of its own emittances and emanations, can attain salvation. Lord Shiva said, Brahmaeva&#x301;hamiti jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva&#x301; mukto bhavati dehabhrt&#x301;. Even having a corporal structure one can attain salvation if one changes the idea of microcosm into macrocosm. The possibilities and potentialities of attaining salvation lie in the very existence of the supra-psychic being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is infinite in macrocosm is finite in microcosm, but the potentialities are the same. So what is required is to develop one&#146;s finite attributions into infinite ones through the process of mystic approach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is mysticism? Mysticism is a never-ending endeavour to find out the link between finite and infinite. And when that link is established shiva-va&#x301;kya comes true, that is, Shiva-va&#x301;kya is materialized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is Shiva-va&#x301;kya? &ldquo;Brahmaeva&#x301;hamiti jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva&#x301; mukto bhavati dehabhrt.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Brahma Vandana&#x301;, while ascribing so many attributions to Brahma, it has been said that He is Paresha. What is Paresha? Para and apara are two counterparts of each and every existence. Para and apara are two portions &ndash; two counterparts of the same entity. The seen portion, the done portion, is called apara and the subjective portion is para. Now, what you see or do with the help of your sensory, motor organs or that external object, in the first phase, is apara and your sensory and motor organs are para &ndash; the para counterpart of that apara. And in the second phase, the next interior phase, those gates or organs are apara and the mind is para. Then in the next inner phase, your mind is apara and the unit spirit is para. And in the final phase your unit spirit, your atman, is apara and He is the Supreme Para. He is the Lord of all Paras. Hence He is called &ldquo;Paresha.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So, when one withdraws one&#146;s propensities from objective world towards the subjectivity, one attains that Paresha. One becomes one with that Paresha, and there lies the secret of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So the Supreme Entity is Paresha and is also the Prabhu. &ldquo;Pra&rdquo; means &ldquo;Prakrs&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo; that is the &ldquo;best&rdquo; and &ldquo;bhu&rdquo; means &ldquo;being&rdquo;. Prabhu, therefore, means &ldquo;the best existence&rdquo;. He is Prabhu of the world.<!-- /block --></p>

It is said that He is Sarvendriya&#x301;gamay i.e. He can not be achieved by any indriya. What are the indriyas? There are five motor indriyas, five sensory indriyas and the eleventh one is the mind. So, here it has been said, &ldquo;sarvendriya&#x301;gamya&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;sarvendriya&rdquo; + &ldquo;agamya&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yaccaksusa na pashyati yena caksumsi pashyati.&rdquo; He whom eyes can not see but from whom eyes get faculty of seeing. He is Sarvendriyagamya. The indriyas can not catch Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Here you should remember that the most important point is that mind is also an indriya &ndash; eleventh indriya, and that is why in Vedas also it has been said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..12"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->That is, where all the expressions of indriyas, where all the inferences fail and where the mind too fails, that is the Supreme Subjectivity. When that mind along with indriyas is withdrawn and placed into Him, then it is the supreme stance, parama sthiti. In that stance there is no fear. &ldquo;Sarvendriya&#x301;gamya Satya&rdquo;. It is the Supreme truth, that is, where Sat is fully established, it is called &ldquo;satya&rdquo;. And what is &ldquo;sat&rdquo;? Sat means &ldquo;that undergoes no metamorphosis&rdquo;. So, in this universe of ours, that Paresha, that Sarvendriya&#x301;gamya Entity, is the only satya.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Acintya &ndash; He can not be your mental object. One day, I told you that while meditating on the Supreme you can not accept Him as your object. Because He is your subject. Everything is His object. He is the Supreme Subject. Then how, during japa and dhya&#x301;na can He be your object? He can not be your object. So what is necessary &ndash; and herein lies the charm &ndash; is that while doing japa and dhya&#x301;na, you should think that He is seeing you, you are His object. This thing you should always remember during japa and dhya&#x301;na. That is the idea. That is the spirit. So He is acintya. You are His cintya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Aks&#x301;ara&rdquo; means &ldquo;where there is no decaying or no waning&rdquo;. He is Acintya&#x301;ks&#x301;ara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Another adjective used for Him is &ldquo;Jagadbha&#x301;saka&#x301;dhiisha&rdquo;. Jagat means &ldquo;moving entities&rdquo;. Everything in this expressed world is moving. I say, it is a moving panorama. Jagadbha&#x301;saka&#x301;dhiisha - Everything in this created world glitters due to Him, that is, He is a Supreme source of all effulgences, rather He is the only source of all effulgences. We get light and energy from Apollo, from the sun, and the sun gets everything from Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->He is the Supreme Father, Supreme Source of all effulgences - Supreme Savita&#x301;.

And because all glitterances come from Him, He is in close contact with anything and everything &ndash; all important and all unimportant beings. So, if you follow those pencils of rays, if you move ahead along towards the emanating point of all the pencils of rays, you will reach the Supreme Nucleus. So what Lord Shiva said is correct, one hundred percent correct: Brahmaevaha&#x301;miti jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva mukto bhavati dehabhrt.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In this universe, both mundane and supra-mundane, or say, physical and metaphysical, we find entities of two kinds: Ks&#x301;ara and Aks&#x301;ara. Ks&#x301;ara is a metamorphosed form of the cognitive faculty created under the tethering influence of Prakrti, the Operative Principle. Hence in philosophical Sam&#x301;skrta, the Operative Principle is also known as Pradha&#x301;na because in the phase of creation it has got the primordial role. Pradha&#x301;na means &ldquo;main&rdquo;. Whatever we see in the universe, or whatever cometh within the arena of our influence is Ks&#x301;ara, that is, creation of the Operative Principle. The portion of the Cognitive Faculty which does not come within the tethering periphery of the binding faculties remains aks&#x301;ara. That is, it undergoes no change, no metamorphosis, is non-decaying, non-waning. &ldquo;Ks&#x301;aram&#x301; pradha&#x301;namamrta&#x301;ks&#x301;aram&#x301; harah&rdquo;. And that Aks&#x301;ara portion, that is, non-decaying, non-transforming, non-metamorphosing portion, is amrta or immortal. Ks&#x301;ara is mortal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is death? Death means a process of metamorphosis. Aks&#x301;ara means not undergoing the process of metamorphosis; hence it is immortal. &ldquo;Amrtaks&#x301;aram&#x301; harah&rdquo;. That is why that Aks&#x301;ara is also known as Para. Para means beyond the scope of all changes, beyond the scope of all transformations.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->This world is a divine play of Hari and Hara. It is Hari-Hara&#x301;tmaka. Hara is one who is undergoing no metamorphosis and Hari means &ldquo;Harati pa&#x301;pa&#x301;nityarthe harih&rdquo;. That is, one who steals away sins of others. People may say, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is great and He steals! What is the matter?&rdquo; As per necessity, He does engage in stealing but one without calumny or fault. He expects bhaktas to give away their sins to Him and be liberated. But when He asks bhaktas to do so, they say, &ldquo;O Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a! we can give You our minds, our bodies, our souls, our everything; but how can we give You our sins? That we can&#146;t do.&rdquo; Bhaktas love Him deeply and He loves them too. As Bhaktas won&#146;t part with their sins on request, He steals them away and that is why He is known as Hari. But in this Shloka we are concerned with the word Hara. &ldquo;Amrta&#x301;ks&#x301;arah Harah&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

Hence &ldquo;Ka&rdquo; is our first consonant and &ldquo;A&rdquo; is our first vowel because &ldquo;a&rdquo; is the root of creation. &ldquo;Ka&rdquo; is our first consonant because it is the acoustic root of this objectivated universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So one meaning of ka is that it is the acoustic root of objectivated Brahma; the second meaning of ka is that it is our first consonant and the third meaning of ka is jalam, that is, water. In Sam&#x301;skrta jala is also called ka. Along with niiram, toyam, udakam, kambalam, and pa&#x301;niiyam, ka is a synonym for jalam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Once I said that the land surrounded by ka, that is, covered by ka, is kaccha. Cha means &ldquo;surrounded by&rdquo;.

The common meaning of niraks&#x301;ara is illiterate but here niraks&#x301;ara means &ldquo;Ta&#x301;raka Brahma&rdquo; &ndash; the tangential point who has got control over both Ks&#x301;ara and Aks&#x301;ara, but not Nirgun&#x301;a because Nirgun&#x301;a has got no control over anything.

That Aks&#x301;ara can not be Mukta Purus&#x301;a. So your only object of ideation or meditation or adoration, the only subjective pabulum, should be that Niraks&#x301;ara. So here it has been said &ldquo;Tasya&#x301;bhidhya&#x301;na&#x301;t&rdquo;. You will have to do His abhidhya&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>

This is the abhidhya&#x301;na of the Niraks&#x301;ara. So many propensities are brought to a single point, and that combined propensity, the combined force of all propensities is goaded unto Him.

<a name="10..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There is a story in the Vedas. Once a vastly radiant Entity appeared before the gods, the demons and the humans who were standing together. This radiant Entity had neither any starting point nor any terminating point. At first none dared get close to Him and enquire of His identity. But slowly some of the gods gathered courage and went to know His identity. First of all, the wind-god approached the Entity and asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Instead of answering direct, the Entity asked him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the wind-god said, &ldquo;I am the mighty god of wind, I blow out everything that comes in my way.&rdquo; The radiant Entity then said, offering him a blade of grass, &ldquo;Here is a blade of grass, blow this if you can&rdquo;. The wind could even move it, howsoever hard it tried. The wind returned ashamed and chastened. Then the fire went and said by way of introducing himself, &ldquo;I am the fire. To consume every thing is my characteristic&rdquo;. The fire was asked to burn that blade of grass but he was also unsuccessful and came back with bowed head. Similarly the rain-god went and returned, having failed to make that blade of grass wet. The people thought, &ldquo;It won&#146;t work like this.&rdquo; They found out the most intelligent person amongst themselves, who was not only intellectual but also knew how to behave in different circumstances and was endowed with great tact. The people selected him as their leader and commissioned him with the task of finding out the identity of that radiant Entity. This leader approached the radiant Entity most reverentially and inquired, &ldquo;Who are you, please?&rdquo; The radiant Entity counter-questioned Him. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; The reply was, &ldquo;Just to know that I have come to you. I do not know who I am.&rdquo; Upon this the radiant Entity further asked &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; This time the reply was, &ldquo;I will try to do whatever you command me to do.&rdquo; These replies pleased the radiant Entity much and thus He disclosed His real identity;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I am the Cognitive Principle. I am within you and also without you. Because of My presence, you do everything, you feel everything, you realize everything. You are a small fraction of mind, a small drop of water in this vast ocean which I am.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Then the leader sought a message from that radiant Entity. The radiant Entity said, &ldquo;My message is &lsquo;da&rsquo;, convey it to all.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->When the leader went back having known the identity of the radiant Entity along with a message from Him, people hailed him and appointed him their permanent leader and their king.

<a name="10..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Another group said da means &ldquo;daya&#x301;m kuru&rdquo;, that is, be compassionate, because Daya&#x301; will create sweetness in your heart and your heart will slowly become all-pervasive.

<a name="10..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And the third group of people said, &ldquo;No, no, &lsquo;da&rsquo; doesn&#146;t mean damanam kuru, da doesn&#146;t mean be compassionate, da means da&#x301;nam kuru and they were known as da&#x301;nava, daetya, or asura.<!-- /block --></p>

The physical bodies of danavas are made of ap, tejas, marut and vyoma &ndash; from four factors. And those of devata&#x301;s are made of tejas, marut and vyoma and that is why their structures are not visible. The devata&#x301;s are known as &ldquo;deva yoni&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta and their bodies are made of only three factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now ekam. He remained ekam and His advice is also ekam &ndash; only one word, a singular expression, a single syllable &ndash; and that syllable is &ldquo;da&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

All are moving realities, changing phenomena, fast-moving panorama. All are of a transitory nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->But then, why do we see these varieties in this world? So many varieties, so many colours and so many matters? When the Absolute Truth is a singular Entity and the Cosmic Cognitive Faculty is One, then why this world of varieties? Why do we witness such a kaleidoscopic world?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Variety comes according to the varieties in our inferences, coming through or emanating from our motor and sensory organs. They are not giving us the proper colour, proper smell or proper attributions of the external world. We solely depend on them. And when all these inferences and objectivities come back to the unit subjectivity, that is, the unit cognition, then what happens? This unit cognition comes in contact with Supreme Cognition and feels that there is no difference between unit cognition and the Supreme Cognition. Both are made of the same entity, the same factor, the same elements; and in the entire universe there is a single element and that element is the Cognitive Faculty.<!-- /block --></p>

And not only does it not come within the scope of your ocularity but it is &ldquo;acintyaru&#x301;pam&rdquo;, that is, It does not come within the pulsations of your microcosm. That is, neither is It within the perception of your organs nor is It within the scope of mental conception.

Because when you think that He is at a long distance, He is not at a long distance but He is at a longer distance. If you think that He is not near you, He is at a long distance, then actually He is at a longer distance. If you think that He is near, then He is not only near, He is more near.

What is japa? It is internal or extro-internal or auto-suggestion. As a result of internal suggestion or extro-internal suggestion or auto-suggestion, what does happen? Not only the intro-external movement of propensities is withdrawn and goaded towards that singular Entity but also the very ectoplasmic structure of the mind gets still more powdered down and becomes one with the cognitive faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tadekam&#x301; smara&#x301;mah&rdquo;.

The ectoplasmic structure of your mind takes the shape of that external object. Now when you by your interial force recreate that thing after some time within your mind without the help of any external object then this process of re-creation is known as &ldquo;smrti&rdquo;. Suppose you saw a particular bull or a particular animal ten years ago. Now you created it again &ndash; that is, you recreate it within your mind, then the process is known as &ldquo;smrti&rdquo; &ndash; memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Asampramos&#x301;a&rdquo; means recreating of already perceived things. Now what does happen? According to your favourite propensities you unknowingly or knowingly create many external objects that satisfy your thirst regarding that particular propensity. Suppose you are fond of taking rasagolla. Now you could create rasagolla in your mind. But knowingly or unknowingly rasagolla is often created within your mind and during sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; rasagolla automatically comes in your mind and your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is disturbed. Suppose you are thinking that you will take bribe from that man. While doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, what are you doing? &ldquo;Bribe &ndash; bribe &ndash; bribe &ndash; bribe.&rdquo; Just see, your propensive propulsions are channelized towards bribe which disturb the &ldquo;smrti&rdquo; which you want to develop. Because of coolness of the mind during your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; those undesirable elements create a crowd in your mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tadekam&#x301; smara&#x301;mah&rdquo;. Here it has been said that if you are to create any object in your mind, then that Cosmic Entity alone should be created in your mind and no other object.<!-- /block --></p>

So here it is said that when you are moving, you must have some goal, must have a terminus, for all your trifarious movements. And here it is said that He is the culminating point. He is the terminating point. He is the Supreme Desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;A&#x301;lamba&rdquo; means &ldquo;physical container&rdquo; &ndash; a fundament. But mental objective is also a&#x301;lamba. In case of mental a&#x301;lamba there is a special word in Sam&#x301;skrta &ndash; &ldquo;a&#x301;bhoga&rdquo;. No entity, physical, psychic or spiritual, can maintain its existence without a fundament &ndash; a container &ndash; or without a pabulum. But in this case He requires no a&#x301;lamba &ndash; no a&#x301;bhoga. That is why He is Nira&#x301;lamba &ndash; beyond container.

What is bhava? That wee-bit portion of reactive momenta which is the cause of rebirth. Bhava is just like a dangerous ocean and that mighty ocean is insurmountable. So to surmount it you require a good, big and strong ship. &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, You are that ship and we are moving towards that ship to take its shelter in order to cross this ocean of bhava.&rdquo; And there is no other way.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Fundamentally, energy is &ldquo;one&rdquo;, but it has got several expressions. The so-called energies are interchangeable. Electrical energy may be converted into magnetic energy, magnetic energy into sound and sound into light. In common (laokika) Sam&#x301;skrta the term for light is &ldquo;agni&rdquo; and in older Sam&#x301;skrta the term is &ldquo;indra&rdquo;. In this universe Parama Purus&#x301;a started His creation and the creation stemmed out of the acoustic root &ldquo;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Energy was also created. Here energy does not mean the Operative Principle. The Operative Principle is a binding faculty only and the style of functioning of the binding faculty is called &ldquo;svabha&#x301;va&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;nature&rdquo; in English. Some people who do not have sufficient knowledge &ndash; deep knowledge of science &ndash; may say that it is all natural. But the fact is that nature is simply the style of the Operative Principle, not an independent entity. When the Operative Principle works according to a particular style, that is, as per nature, the stamina that each and every phase gets is from energy. The acoustic root of energy is &ldquo;ra&rdquo;. This shows that energy is also a sort of creation &ndash; it is also created by the Cosmic Cognitive Faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, that day I told you that whatever there is in the universe is supported by three fundamental sounds. Every thing comes from the Cosmic bliss, that is, the composure of bliss. In this composure, the balance amongst the sentient, the mutative and the static principle is maintained. When that balance gets upset the flow comes out from one of the vertices of the triangle of the forces. So certainly that force which comes out from one of the vertices is coming out from the sentient principle; that is coming out from the phase of the composure of bliss. So everything starts with the sound &ldquo;sa&rdquo; and after starting its journey from the vertex, it has to move forward and for moving forward it requires energy. It must be supported by energy. So first coming out from the sentient principle &ldquo;sa&rdquo; and it moves ahead with energy that is, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; the acoustic root of energy. And as soon as it starts movement, it acquires certain wonts, certain characteristics. The acoustic root for wonts for characteristics is &ldquo;va&rdquo;. So &ldquo;sa-ra-va&rdquo; or &ldquo;sarva&rdquo;. Everything in this universe is known as &ldquo;sarva&rdquo;. Therefore everything in this universe is known as sarva in Sam&#x301;skrta. &ldquo;Sarva ucyate&rdquo;. Because of the presence of sarva in every entity, every entity is also known as sarva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->From this sarva, the Hindi term &ldquo;sab&rdquo; and the Maithili term &ldquo;sabh&rdquo; have come but the root is &ldquo;sarva&rdquo;.

<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhu&rdquo; means &ldquo;bhuvana&rdquo;. And bhuvana means an expression which comes out with the help of those quinquelemental factors. That &ldquo;bhu&rdquo; is the recognized name of the universe in Sam&#x301;skrit. Bhu&#x301;, bhu&#x301;mi, dharitrii, sarvam&#x301;saha&#x301;, prithivii, medinii, mahii, vasumatii, and prthivii. These are the recognized names of earth in Sam&#x301;skrta. The energy remains and maintains the structural solidarity of each and every entity of this universe by taking the form of its container according to the structural solidarity of the different entities. The same energy is operating through this ceiling fan or through the bulb or other expression but do we ever see or feel it? No body can ever see any energy and no body can directly feel the presence of any energy but every body feels the presence of energy through its operation. Because of this function of the fan, we come to know that there is energy behind it. We get the light from the bulb but we never see the energy. Energy is never seen or perceived but its effects are seen, perceived or felt.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Similarly the same Cognitive Principle &ndash; that cognition, is also just like energy. There is vital energy in your body, that is why you can speak, you can move or you can think. When there shall be no expressions from your corporal structure, others will say that the man is dead and gone. Similarly the same Cognitive Faculty functioning through different entities of this universe works as the subjective counterpart of their existences. And because of this subjective expression of the Cognitive Faculty, people can perceive and conceive its existence. The existence of God is conceived but can not be perceived and can not be expressed. We see only its expressions. Similarly, we see and feel the expressions of the Cognitive Faculty.

All the reflections won&#146;t be the same. It depends on the nature of the mirror. One face becomes so many faces.

That is, the conscious gets pointed and merges with the subconscious, and again, the subconscious gets pointed and merges with the unconscious. And that unconscious, functioning without the help of nerve fibres or nerve cells, remains with the Cosmic Entity, the Cognitive Faculty, and by dhya&#x301;na brings that [un]conscious entity to merge with the Cognitive Faculty. There remains no mind, no functioning mind. That is, all the three stages of mind get suspended in the Cognitive Faculty. And that stage is called turiiya, or kevala.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Just like pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra yoga is not complete in itself. Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, you know, is a practice to control the movement of the vital energy of a particular body: Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;n yamayatyes&#x301;ah pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;mah [&ldquo;The process of controlling the va&#x301;yus, or energy flows in the body, is known as pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma&rdquo;]. It is the process by which the movement of vital energy is controlled by a spiritual aspirant. But pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma should always be associated with bindu dhya&#x301;na, that is, meditation on a particular point. If pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma is not associated with bindu dhya&#x301;na, it will affect self-restraint. Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma will make the mind restless. Similarly, pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra yoga &ndash; here the actual English term is &ldquo;withdrawal&rdquo; &ndash; should always be associated with dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The difference between dhya&#x301;na [meditation] and dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; [concentration] is that dhya&#x301;na is something stationary; that is, the object is a stationary one in the case of dhya&#x301;na. In the case of dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, the mind moves along with the object; that is, there is a dynamic force behind dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;. And dhya&#x301;na, although sentient, has no movement in it. In the sphere of &ndash; rather, in the arena of &ndash; spiritual practice, pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra has very much importance, because in the primordial phase of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, one will have to withdraw one&#146;s mind from the physicalities of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now in pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra yoga, what are you to do after withdrawing all your propensities from the objective world, from the physicalities of the world? To where are these mental propensities to be directed? If the mental propensities are withdrawn, but are not guided to some other point, what will happen? Those withdrawn mental propensities will create internal disturbance in your mind, will create disturbance in your subconscious and unconscious strata. It is dangerous. Sometimes it so happened in the past, and may happen in the future, that if a spiritual aspirant, without the guidance of a strong guru, tried or tries to practise pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra only from reading books, there would be some danger. So whenever you are withdrawing your mental propensities from different objects, you are to guide those collected propensities into some moving object, moving within the realm of your mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And what is that moving object? That moving object is your citta &ndash; your objectivated &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. The citta is moving. The citta is something moving. So these withdrawn propensities are to move towards the citta and not towards external objects. They stop moving towards external objects, but they start moving towards the internal citta. That is the thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->If the propensities are withdrawn, but not goaded towards the citta, then there will be a dangerous reaction. I think you have understood. That is why it has been said, Yacched va&#x301;un manasi pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;ah &ndash; &ldquo;What are intelligent spiritual aspirants to do? They are to goad their mental propensities to the citta.&rdquo; Here the word va&#x301;un represents the external movement of the propensities. Then manasi + pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;ah &ndash; that is, &ldquo;those withdrawn propensities are to move towards the citta.&rdquo; Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;ah va&#x301;un manasi yacchet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Tad yacched jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tmani. The citta, after consuming those withdrawn propensities, also moves. It moves within the mind, not toward any external object &ndash; not toward an external elephant, but toward the elephant created within your mind. Tad yacched jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tmani &ndash; &ldquo;and the citta, along with the withdrawn propensities, is to be guided towards the aham&#x301;tattva, the doer &lsquo;I&rsquo;, the owner &lsquo;I&rsquo; &ndash; the &lsquo;I do&rsquo; feeling that is subject to the &lsquo;I&rsquo; having a direct objectivity.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.16.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#16.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Here this doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;, although not in movement, still has the full potentiality of movement. It can move. It may move. It can partly transform itself into the done &ldquo;I&rdquo;. So it has the potentiality. So that citta, that is, the done &ldquo;I&rdquo;, is to be directed towards the doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;, the aham&#x301;tattva. Not the feeling &ldquo;I exist,&rdquo; but the feeling that the &ldquo;I&rdquo; that exists is now able to do something. This is the aham&#x301;tattva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati niyacchet. Now this jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tma&#x301;, or aham, has also got potentiality, so the mutative principle is very prominent in it. That doer or mutative principle is also a binding fetter, a tethering agency. So &ldquo;one will have to withdraw this jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tma&#x301;, this aham&#x301;tattva, into the mahattattva&rdquo; &ndash; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati niyacchet. Mahati means &ldquo;within the mahattattva&rdquo;. And what is the mahattattva? The mahattattva is the feeling &ldquo;I exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now in this pure &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling there is hardly any movement, because it is a creation of the sentient principle. But you know, although the sentient principle cannot give any specific figure, any boundary line, still it is a sort of bondage, and because there is bondage there is fight within and without. You are doing something. Is there no fight, is there no movement? Although there is no figure, there is fight, there is movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->So jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati.  [The mahattattva] is almost free from bondage, but there is still bondage. Suppose a very good man is harshly rebuking an immoral person for having insulted him. Is that unfair? No, no, it is not unfair. It is called sentient anger. Anger is static; but sometimes it may be sa&#x301;ttvika, it may be sentient. And that type of anger is sentient anger &ndash; sa&#x301;ttvika krodha in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There is a story that once upon a time somebody asked Hanuma&#x301;na, &ldquo;Hanuma&#x301;na, you are a devotee, you are a bhakta and you know that fundamentally there is no difference between Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a and Ra&#x301;ma. Then why do you always take the name of Ra&#x301;ma and never the name of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, when both are fundamentally the same&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a and Ra&#x301;ma are actually the same Entity; only their names are different. The word &ldquo;Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a&rdquo; comes from Sam&#x301;skrit. It is a compound word; na&#x301;ra + ayanan. In Sam&#x301;skrit the word &ldquo;na&#x301;ra&rdquo; has got three meanings. One meaning of na&#x301;ra is &ldquo;niira&rdquo;, &ldquo;water&rdquo;, another meaning is Parama&#x301; Prakrti and the third meaning is &ldquo;devotion&rdquo; (bhakti). Na&#x301;ra + da&#x301; + d&#x301;a = Na&#x301;rada, the distributor of bhakti. Here, in the case of Na&#x301;rada, Na&#x301;ra means devotion. And na&#x301;ra also means both &ldquo;water&rdquo; and &ldquo;Parama&#x301; Prakrti&rdquo;, that is, the Cosmic Operative Principle. And &ldquo;ayana&rdquo; means ashraya. Shiva&#x301;yana means the a&#x301;shraya of Shiva. Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yana means the a&#x301;shraya of Ra&#x301;ma: the book in which Ra&#x301;ma has been sheltered &ndash; Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yana. Ayana means a&#x301;shraya. Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a means the ayana of na&#x301;ra, the ayana of the Operative Principle, the ayana of the Parama&#x301; Prakrti. Who is the ayana, who is the shelter of Na&#x301;ra? Parama Purus&#x301;a is the shelter of Parama&#x301; Prakrti. So Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a means Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; the Cosmic Consciousness, the Cognitive Faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->And what is the meaning of Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;? One meaning is Ramante yoginah yasmin. That is, Rama is the only object that can be accepted by yogiis as their spirituo-psycho-pabulum, psycho-spiritual pabulum, psycho-spiritual food, psycho-spiritual source of bliss, psycho-spiritual source of happiness. Who is the psycho-spiritual source of happiness for yogiis? Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; the Cognitive Faculty. Hence Ra&#x301;ma&#x301; also means Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Another meaning of Ra&#x301;ma&#x301; is &ldquo;ra&#x301;ti mahiidhara Ra&#x301;mah&rdquo;. The first letter of ra&#x301;ti is ra&#x301; and the first letter of mahiidhara is ma. &ldquo;Rati mahiidharah Ramah&rdquo;: the most glittering object of the entire universe that makes others glitter. He is the most glittering entity and all other glittering entities get their glitterance from Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The moon gets its glitterance from the Earth. The Earth gets its glitterance from the sun. The sun gets its glitterance from Parama Purus&#x301;a. He is the Supreme Entity that makes others glitter. Who is that Supreme Glittering Entity?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->He is the Supreme Glittering Entity. &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ti mahiidharam&#x301;&rdquo; means that Parama Purus&#x301;a and not another entity, not a separate entity. And the third meaning of Ra&#x301;ma&#x301; is &ldquo;Ra&#x301;vanasya maran&#x301;am&#x301; Ra&#x301;mah.&rdquo; The first letter of Ra&#x301;van&#x301;asya is &ldquo;Ra&#x301;&rdquo; and the first letter of maran&#x301;am&#x301; is &ldquo;ma&rdquo;. Ra&#x301; + ma = Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;; that is, the Entity whose pressure kills Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a. And what is Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a? Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a means the evil mind, the depraved mind, that moves in all the ten directions &ndash; pu&#x301;rva, pashcima, uttara, daks&#x301;in&#x301;a, u&#x301;rddha, adhah, iisha&#x301;na, naerta, agni and va&#x301;yu &ndash; all the ten. The entire evil force, the depraving force that moves in all the ten directions is Ra&#x301;vana. Rao + ana = Ra&#x301;vana, that is goading the mind towards hell. Now, Ra&#x301;vanasya maran&#x301;am. Where does the death of Ra&#x301;vana lie? When does that ten-faced demon die? He dies when one takes the shelter of Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;. So &ldquo;Ra&#x301;vanasya maran&#x301;am&rdquo; is Ra&#x301;ma. The one who takes shelter in Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;, in Parama Purus&#x301;a, in the Cognitive Faculty, can kill him, can kill that demon. &ldquo;Ra&#x301;van&#x301;asya maranam&rdquo; means that Supreme Cognitive Principle. Hence there is no difference between Ra&#x301;ma and Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. &ldquo;Then Hanuma&#x301;na, why do you always take the name of Ra&#x301;ma&#x301; and not Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a?&rdquo;  Now you see, the reply of Hanuma&#x301;na was:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Shriina&#x301;the Ja&#x301;nakiina&#x301;the ca&#x301;bhede Parama&#x301;tmani,<br>Tatha&#x301;pi mama sarvasva Ra&#x301;mah kamalalocanah.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->That is, when you are to move towards a particular object with maximum sincerity, all your propensities should be collected, brought to a particular point. Rather, they are to be pinnacled and that pinnacled &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is to be goaded unto that Entity without any second form, without any second name, without any second colour, without any second thing. That is why Hanuma&#x301;na says, &ldquo;Shriina&#x301;the Ja&#x301;nakiina&#x301;the.&rdquo; The yogaru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha of the word &ldquo;shrii&rdquo; is Laks&#x301;mii, the goddess of wealth, the goddess of prosperity and its actual meaning, that is, its bha&#x301;va&#x301;ru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha, is the entity possessing the mutative faculty which is full of energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In Sam&#x301;skrit, every word has got two types of meanings &ndash; one meaning is bha&#x301;va&#x301;ru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha, the other meaning is yogaru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha. Bha&#x301;va&#x301;ru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha is the meaning as per derivation and yogaru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha is the meaning as per common use. Say, pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nana. Pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nana means &ldquo;five-faced entity&rdquo; &ndash; this is the bha&#x301;va&#x301;ru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha word meaning &ndash; but people use the word pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nana in the sense of Shiva. This is &ldquo;yogaru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha.&rdquo; Do you follow? Nila. Nila means &ldquo;wind&rdquo; and niila means &ldquo;blue&rdquo;. Nila means &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;. Anila means &ldquo;not fixed&rdquo;, that is, moving. It is the bha&#x301;va&#x301;ru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha but the yogaru&#x301;rha&#x301;rta is &ldquo;air&rdquo;. Air is never fixed; that is why air is called anila. It is the yogaru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha, not the bha&#x301;va&#x301;ru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha. Bha&#x301;va&#x301;ru&#x301;rha&#x301;rtha is &ldquo;not fixed&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->There are three letters &ndash; &ldquo;sha&rdquo;, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; and &ldquo;ii&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sha&rdquo; is the acoustic root of the mutative principle, &ldquo;ra&rdquo; is the acoustic root of energy, and &ldquo;ii&rdquo; is the feminine term, &ldquo;striya&#x301;m&#x301; &lsquo;ii&rsquo;.&rdquo; The entity that possesses the mutative faculty, is full of energy and at the same time, is a feminine term, is &ldquo;shrii&rdquo;. Everybody wants to be qualified with mutative principle and energy; that is why it is the old usage of the East to use the word &ldquo;Shrii&rdquo; before the name, prefixed in the name &ldquo;Shriina&#x301;tha&rdquo; &ndash; Lord of Shrii &ndash; is Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a and Ja&#x301;nakiina&#x301;tha &ndash; Ja&#x301;nakii &ndash; means &ldquo;Siita&#x301;&rdquo;. Siita&#x301; is the adjective form of &ldquo;sii&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sii&rdquo; means &ldquo;to culture&rdquo;, to fertilize the land with the help of a tractor or plough. And its adjective, siita&#x301;, means well-cultured; that is, culture to the maximum degree of efficiency. Now where does this culture come from? Who is the Lord of this culture? Who is the source of inspiration or who is the supporter of this culture? Parama Purus&#x301;a. However, Shriina&#x301;tha or Ja&#x301;nakiina&#x301;tha means Parama Purus&#x301;a. So there remains no difference between Shriina&#x301;tha and Ja&#x301;nakiina&#x301;tha. &ldquo;I know it&rdquo;, says Hanuma&#x301;na. As, per spiritualism, as per spirituality or spiritual science there is no difference between Shriina&#x301;tha and Ja&#x301;nakiina&#x301;tha.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Who is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? What is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? The word krs&#x301;n&#x301;a has so many meanings. One meaning of krs&#x301; is &ldquo;to plough the land&rdquo;. And another meaning of krs&#x301; is &ldquo;to attract&rdquo;. He who draws, He who attracts, everybody towards Him, the Nucleus of the Universe, is &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; means the Nucleus of the Universe. The third meaning of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is bhurva&#x301;cak &ndash; &ldquo;the Entity who lives within one&#146;s &lsquo;I&rsquo; feeling&rdquo;. &ldquo;I am, because   Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is &ndash; I exist because Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a exists.&rdquo; This is the meaning. That is, if Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a does not exist, I also do not exist. My existence, my very existence, depends upon His existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->You know, for each and every entity there is an acoustic root; that is, each and every entity creates a special type of vibration in this universe, and that special type of vibration is known as the acoustic root. In Sanskrit it is called a biija mantra. Now, the acoustic root of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is klrm&#x301; (= ka + la + anusva&#x301;ra [am&#x301;]). Why is klrm&#x301; the acoustic root of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? Ka is the acoustic root of the objective world. Parama Purus&#x301;a creates the world from His divine body, and that&#146;s why I say each and every existence is the divine existence. Each and every boy, each and every girl, and each and every living creature is an avata&#x301;ra [incarnation] of the divine entity, so nobody can be hated or ignored. You are all divine children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When Parama Purus&#x301;a creates something, in that phase as Creator, Parama Purus&#x301;a is Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma, because He is the cause. [Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a = &ldquo;cause&rdquo;.] He is the Causal Entity, and the created universe which He creates is Ka&#x301;rya Brahma, because He is the effect. [Ka&#x301;rya = &ldquo;effect&rdquo;.] Now, for Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma the acoustic root, the biija mantra, is on&#x32D;m, and for Ka&#x301;rya Brahma, the created universe, the acoustic root is ka. That is why ka is the first letter of our consonants. In the Sanskrit alphabetical order, ka is the first consonant, because ka is the acoustic root of this created world, of Ka&#x301;rya Brahma, the Effect Brahma, the creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the word ka has several meanings. First, it is the first consonant. Secondly, ka means &ldquo;water&rdquo; &ndash; jalam&#x301;, niiram&#x301;, toyam&#x301;, udakam&#x301;, pa&#x301;niiyam&#x301;, kambalam, ka. Ka means &ldquo;water&rdquo;. One day I told you that the land covered with water, surrounded by water, is kaccha, or &ldquo;kutch&rdquo;. (Ka + chad + d&#x301;a = kaccha.) Kutch is a part of India that is [covered] with water. The third meaning of ka is the Effect Brahma, Ka&#x301;rya Brahma, the objectivated Brahma. The acoustic root of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is klrm&#x301;. The first letter is ka, because He controls this expressed universe, He attracts this expressed universe, He loves this expressed universe; so the first letter of His acoustic root is ka.<!-- /block --></p>

No, He lives with all living creatures; that is why He lives in bhu&#x301;tatattva, ks&#x301;ititattva [the solid factor]. The acoustic root of ks&#x301;ititattva is la. Controlling the ka and standing upon this la, that is, ks&#x301;ititattva, is klrm&#x301;, that is, ka + la + anusva&#x301;ra [am&#x301;].

<a name="18..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Perhaps you wanted that He should destroy your enemies. If you are on the path of dharma, that is, if your demands are justified, He will kill your enemies, but you will not get Him, because you did not want Him. If you want mukti [liberation] or moks&#x301;a [non-qualified liberation] from Him, if you are a suitable candidate then you may get it from Him, but you will not get Him, because you did not want Him. So an intelligent spiritual aspirant will say: &ldquo;I want you, I do not want anybody else. And why do I want you? Not because your presence will give me pleasure, but because your presence will give me the scope to serve you, because your presence will give the chance to give you pleasure &ndash; not to give pleasure to  myself.&rdquo; That is why an intelligent spiritual aspirant will say: &ldquo;I do not want anything from you, I want you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There is a story that once Rama and Lakshmana were crossing the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; [Ganges] with Maharshi Vishvamitra and were going to Mithila. Upon reaching the other bank of the river, the boatman saw that the boat was not wood, it was gold. &ldquo;Certainly that little boy Rama is not an ordinary boy,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It is because of his touch that the wooden boat has become gold.&rdquo; Then the boatman&#146;s wife came with all the wooden furniture &ndash; whatever wooden furniture was in the house was brought. She brought everything and got the things touched, and they all turned into gold. Then the boatman said, &ldquo;O my lady, you are a foolish lady, you do not know what to do. You are not at all practical. Now you see, the attributions lie with those feet. If you are intelligent, take those feet to your house and get everything converted into gold. This is the secret. There lies the secret.&rdquo; So what will an intelligent spiritual aspirant say? He will say, &ldquo;I do not want anything from You. Everything cometh from You, so You be mine.&rdquo; And what for? Just to serve Him. Why to serve Him? Not to get pleasure but to give Him pleasure. The man who wants to give Him pleasure is called gopa in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>

What is &ldquo;durjana&rdquo;? The man who depraves, who misguides others is called &ldquo;durjana&rdquo;. Now, a particular man may not be durjana for all. Suppose Mr. X is durjana for Mr. Y; he may not be durjana for Mr. Z.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->You see, there are merits and demerits in almost each and every individual. Suppose Mr. X is durjana for Mr. Y. Say, he has got merit worth 20 points and demerit worth 25 points, the resultant 5 points go in favour of demerit, so he is a durjana and he is durjana for Mr. Y. Suppose Mr. Y is a good man, he has got merit worth 15 points and demerit worth 13 points. So the resultant is 2 points in favour of merit. So, he is a good man. But, in his favour the resultant merit is only 2 and in the case of Mr. X the resultant demerit is 5 points. If Mr. Y comes in contact with Mr. X, Mr. X has demerit worth 5 points, Y has merit worth 2 points, and the resultant goes in favour of demerit. Mr. Y will become bad. But, in the case of Mr. Z, suppose merit is 30 points and demerit 15 points, then the resultant is 15 points in favour of merit. Mr. X has only 5 points demerit, so if Mr. X comes in contact with Mr. Z, Mr. X will become good. So for Mr. Z, Mr. X is not durjana; rather he is in a position to uplift the condition of Mr. X. It is not something permanent; it varies from man to man. So this term durjana is a relative term. &ldquo;Tya&#x301;ja durjana sam&#x301;sargam&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; you should avoid the company of a man who is durjana for you, that is, whose resultant demerit is more than your resultant merit.<!-- /block --></p>

You should be sa&#x301;dhu internally. You may or may not use any external saffron costume. In India, those who were called sa&#x301;dhu used all-white costume and those who were sannya&#x301;siis used an all-saffron costume. Saffron costume for sannya&#x301;siis and white costume for sa&#x301;dhus. The system is that sa&#x301;dhus will use the suffix &ldquo;da&#x301;sa&rdquo; after their names - Govardhana Da&#x301;sa, Yamuna&#x301; Da&#x301;sa, Hari Da&#x301;sa etc. In this way sa&#x301;dhus are to use the suffix da&#x301;sa. And sannya&#x301;siis are to use the suffix a&#x301;nanda after their names &ndash; Viveka&#x301;nanda, Parama&#x301;nanda &ndash; a&#x301;nanda after their names.  This is the technical difference between sa&#x301;dhus and sannya&#x301;siis. In Ananda Marga, they are known as sannya&#x301;siis. An avadhuta is a sannya&#x301;sii. &ldquo;Bhaja Sa&#x301;dhu Sama&#x301;gamam&rdquo;. You should always encourage the company of sa&#x301;dhu people. And now you know the meaning of sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->For each and every living entity one&#146;s personal life is the dearest thing. One loves one&#146;s personal life very much. This is the rule, this is the characteristic of all living beings. But those people who understand this sentiment of living beings and love others with the thought, &ldquo;I should not kill, I should not give them any trouble because they love their life as much as I love my own life&rdquo;, are true sa&#x301;dhus and those who lack this sentiment are not sa&#x301;dhus, they are asa&#x301;dhu. Preaching the gospels of peace, and at the same time slaughtering chickens, is not a proper thing for a sa&#x301;dhu because the one who kills the chickens loves his life and the chickens also love their own lives. So that man lacks the universal sentiment of love. He is not a sa&#x301;dhu. A sa&#x301;dhu must be vegetarian.<!-- /block --></p>

Sa&#x301;dhu &ndash; the detailed meaning is, he who uplifts others in all the strata of life. That is, he who helps others in their physical, psychic and spiritual development is a sa&#x301;dhu. Whoever has got more points than you, more resultant points in favour of merit, is a sa&#x301;dhu for you. This is just like the explanation of durjana. Suppose the resultant merit in your favour is 45 points, and another man has a resultant merit of, say, 60 points. Having 60 points of merit, that man is a sa&#x301;dhu for you. It is a relative term. Utilize each and every moment of your life in enjoying the company of sa&#x301;dhus.<!-- /block --></p>

As per occidental calculation, a day is from midnight to midnight and as per oriental system, that is, the system of Asia, a day is from sunrise to sunrise. One day in India means sunrise to sunrise. One day in Europe means midnight to midnight. In Europe, the date changes just after midnight and in India, the date changes after sunrise. That is the system. Day or &ldquo;ahah&rdquo; means from sunrise to sunset and night or &ldquo;ra&#x301;tri&rdquo; means sunset to sunrise, that is, night portion. You should be engaged in doing pun&#x301;ya karma, day and night, ahora&#x301;tram, from sunrise to sunrise. &ldquo;Kuru Pun&#x301;yam&#x301;&rdquo;. What is pun&#x301;yam&#x301;?<!-- /block --></p>

Be engaged in pun&#x301;ya work for twenty four hours; day and night, from sunrise to sunrise. How can one do pun&#x301;yam while sleeping? How can one be engaged in pun&#x301;ya karma? If during wakeful hours one is engaged in pun&#x301;ya karma, then during sleep what will it be? A composure of peace, a composure of welfare.

<a name="19..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In Sam&#x301;skrit, the entire literature is divided into four groups. One is ka&#x301;vya, the second is itikatha&#x301;, the third is itiha&#x301;sa and the fourth is pura&#x301;n&#x301;a. Ka&#x301;vya is &ldquo;Va&#x301;kyam&#x301; rasa&#x301;tmakam&#x301;.&rdquo; When a story has been narrated in a lucid way it is called ka&#x301;vyam. Then itikatha&#x301;: itikatha&#x301; is a proper record of what happened; that is, that which deals with factual statements is itikatha&#x301;. And itiha&#x301;sa is that portion of factual statement that has got educative value and helps you in your upliftment. That portion of itikatha&#x301; is called itiha&#x301;sa. The English term for itikatha&#x301; is &ldquo;history&rdquo;, in French &ldquo;histoire&rdquo;, but there is no English term for itiha&#x301;sa. And the last one is pura&#x301;n&#x301;a. Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a is not a fact, not at all a factual statement, but a story. That story has got educative value. That story helps you in your physical, mental and spiritual upliftment. The Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yana is a pura&#x301;na, the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata is itiha&#x301;sa and the history taught in schools and colleges is itikatha&#x301;. Itiha&#x301;sa is not taught in schools and colleges nowadays. And pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, just now I told you, is a story, but it has educative value. Vya&#x301;sadeva wrote eighteen pura&#x301;n&#x301;as. What was the central idea? Why did he write so many pura&#x301;n&#x301;as? His intention was to preach to the world that pun&#x301;ya means to help the people in their all-round development and pa&#x301;pa means to degrade the people, to misguide the people in all spheres of life. So here the word pun&#x301;ya has been used. You should be engaged in pun&#x301;ya karma, in helping others, for all the twenty four hours.<!-- /block --></p>

The jiiva microcosm, that is, attributional macrocosm, consists of the pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a&#x301;tmaka body, that is, this small physical structure, this small corporeal structure, and the crude mind: ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a, manomaya kos&#x301;a, atima&#x301;nas kos&#x301;a and so many kos&#x301;as. So, this small body and its small mind of so many stages are the creation of the reactive momenta of the microcosm, are of microcosmic creation. This is the difference. That is, one is attributionally macrocosm and another is attributionally microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>

Now, if this attributional difference between Para &ndash; Para means Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; and jiiva, is taken away, what will happen? If these attributional differences are taken away, there will be neither Para nor jiiva, neither Parama Purus&#x301;a nor small jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;. They will become one.<!-- /block --></p>

But, if we take away that attribution of the kingdom from Mr. X and that attribution of clubs from Mr. Y, X will become Y. Similarly, if Para becomes something non-attributional, and jiiva also becomes non-attributional, they will become Parama Shiva, both will become Parama Shiva. What is spiritual practice?

<a name="21..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Cognitive Faculty is the Supreme Subjectivity, and all other entities are His objects. Nothing remains secret or unknown or unseen for Him. You can not do anything secretly. You can not even think anything secretly. And as you know, human sadhana is a movement from electronic imperfection to nuclear perfection. So, everything in the universe, anything and everything, is just like electrons moving round Him. It may be a big elephant or it may be a small ant, there remains no difference for Him. All are His loving children.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sama plus&#x301;ina&rdquo; &ndash; You may say this insect is a very small insect. It is plusin, that is, a white ant, an insignificant creature. &ldquo;Sama mashakena&rdquo; &ndash; mashaka means &ldquo;mosquito&rdquo;. He has the same love, the same attraction or He attaches the same importance to a mosquito also. A mosquito is a very small creature. &ldquo;Sama na&#x301;gena&rdquo; &ndash; He has the same love, the same importance for na&#x301;ga also. What is the meaning of na&#x301;ga? There are three meanings of na&#x301;ga in Sam&#x301;skrta. One meaning is &ldquo;python&rdquo; &ndash; a big snake. Another meaning is &ldquo;aera&#x301;vata&rdquo;, that is, mammoth in English. There are several other meanings also. Na&#x301;ga means pertaining to hills. &ldquo;Sama ebhistribhih lokaeh&rdquo; &ndash; the same importance, same attachment, same love is for the entire tribhuvana. Tribhuvana means the expressed world, the psychic world and the astral world or, you may say, Causal World.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->He sees everything. He feels everything. Nothing remains unseen or unfelt. His position is just like a clandestine light. Now, when the focus is on the stage you will see so many things happening on the stage &ndash; an actor is acting, a dancer is dancing and so many things are happening on the stage and that clandestine light sees everything, all the happenings. Similarly, whatever you do, whatever you think, whatever you smell, whatever you taste, He sees, He witnesses everything and when nothing happens on the stage, that is, there is neither any actor nor any dancer nor any singer on the stage then that clandestine light also sees that vacuum. It is also witnessing the fact that nothing is happening on the stage. Similarly when you do nothing &ndash; when you are suspended in your causal body or in your samanya deha then you do nothing &ndash; even that stage of yours is witnessed by Him. Similarly, when you are not in a position to do anything or think, smell or taste, He witnesses that also. So, you are closely associated, closely related to Him and He is closely related to you. You are never helpless, never alone. You are always with Him and so you should never entertain pessimism or any inferiority complex.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You know, in Tantra Sha&#x301;stra there are two wings &ndash; one wing of Tantra is called a&#x301;gama and the other wing is known as nigama. There are two interpretations of the term Tantra, that is, two derived meanings. One meaning is &ldquo;Tam&#x301; ja&#x301;dya&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah Tantrah parikiirttitah&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Tan&rdquo; means &ldquo;dullness&rdquo;, &ldquo;lethargy&rdquo; and &ldquo;tra&rdquo; means liberator. That which liberates you from spiritual dullness, spiritual lethargy is Tantra. Another interpretation of the term Tantra is &ndash; &ldquo;Tan&rdquo; is a root verb, a Sam&#x301;skrta root verb, it means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. &ldquo;Tra&rdquo; means liberator. The root verb &ldquo;trae&rdquo; + suffix &ldquo;d&#x301;a&rdquo; = &ldquo;tra&rdquo;. It means liberator; &ldquo;trae&rdquo; means to liberate. So Tantra means the science that helps you in all-round expansion, rather that helps you in liberation by your all-round expansion. Tantra is the way to expand. A little boy&#146;s body always expands - daily, weekly, monthly. So, the body of a man up the age of 39 is called &ldquo;Tanu&rdquo;. In Sam&#x301;skrta tanu means &ldquo;expanding&rdquo;. And after 39 the body of a man is called shariira. Shariira means, that which wanes.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Lord Shiva&#146;s reply was that the minimum qualification is that he should have a human body. So, you know this minimum qualifications, this chance can be awaited by each and every human being because each and every human being has a human body. Lord Shiva says:<!-- /block --></p>

One gets moksa. And, for this purpose, that is, to know one self the minimum qualification is &ldquo;sukrtaerma&#x301;navo bhu&#x301;tva&#x301;&rdquo;. Passing through so many animal lives in the phase of pratisain&#x32D;cara, one acquires a human body and is eligible &ndash; one has acquired the minimum qualifications.<!-- /block --></p>

While one is in the body of an animal one cannot do any spiritual practice. After getting a human body, if one does not utilize that body in spiritual pursuits, one is surely a fool, because he is not utilizing his potentialities. He is not utilizing one&#146;s potentialities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When one becomes jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii then one attains moks&#x301;a. Also, in the first portion it is said, &ldquo;A&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam&rdquo; and in the last portion also it has been said &ldquo;Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii cenmoks&#x301;ama&#x301;pnuya&#x301;t.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

What is self-knowledge? What is self-realization? You see, it is the natural wont of each and every living being to see others, not to see himself. That is, whenever one becomes a subjective entity, he takes others as objective counterpart, but never the self as objective counterpart. One&#146;s subjectivity never merges with objectivity and that is the trouble. You want to know so many things but you never want to know yourself. Your &ldquo;self&rdquo; is your nearest entity but you never want to know yourself. That is the pity, that is the trouble. A&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam means a stage of objectlessness. Seeing one&#146;s own self within oneself and not guiding any cognitive or psychic faculty towards any objectivity. You have got so many psychic faculties. You have got so many cognitive faculties, too but you always try to goad your psychic and cognitive faculties to other objects. But, if you withdraw all your psychic and cognitive faculties and goad these faculties towards yourself and be at peace without coming in contact with any objective world that phase of your mind and spirit, that stance of [[non-]]relativity, is a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam. It is the true jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam because all other knowledges are contaminated by relativities. This jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam, because of its non-dependence on any second objectivity is of absolute character and it is a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam. For acquiring this a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam one need not go through volumes of books. One should develop sincere urge to attain this a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam and develop love for the Supreme. This is the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And in this process, after self-realization, one attains salvation. This is the reply of Shiva. So this should be treated as a&#x301;gama.<!-- /block --></p>
