<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->None of the movable or immovable property of this universe belongs to any particular individual; everything is the common patrimony of all, and the Father of all is Brahma. All living beings can enjoy their rightful share of this property, like members of a joint family in the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> system. As members of a joint family, human beings should safeguard this common property in a befitting manner and utilize it properly. They should also make proper arrangements so that everyone can enjoy it with equal rights, ensuring that all have the minimum requirements of life to enable them to live in a healthy body with a sound mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->We must not forget, even for a single moment, that the entire animate world is a vast joint family. Nature has not assigned any portion of this property to any particular individual. Private ownership has been created by selfish opportunists, as the loopholes in this system provide them with ample scope for self-aggrandizement through exploitation. When the entire wealth of the universe is the common patrimony of all living beings, can the system in which some roll in luxury, while others, deprived of a morsel of food, shrivel up and starve to death bit by bit, be said to have the support of dharma?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In a joint family every member is provided with adequate food, clothing, education and medical treatment, and amenities, as per their individual needs, according to the financial capacity of the entire family. If, however, any member of the family appropriates more grains, clothes, books or medicines than he or she requires, will that person not be the cause of distress to other members of the family? In such circumstances his or her actions will be certainly against dharma &ndash; certainly antisocial.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Similarly, the capitalists of this modern world are anti-dharma, or antisocial, creatures. To accumulate massive wealth, they reduce others to skin and bones gnawed by hunger and force them to die of starvation; to dazzle people with the glamour of their garments, they compel others to wear rags; and to increase their own vital strength, they suck dry the vital juice of others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->A member of a joint family cannot be called a social being if he or she does not possess the sentiment of oneness with the other members, or if he or she does not want to accept the lofty ideal of joint rights and the principle of rationality. According to true spiritual ideology the system of private ownership cannot be accepted as absolute and final, and hence capitalism cannot be supported either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->2<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Considering the collective interests of all living beings, it is essential that capitalism be eradicated. But, what should be the proper method to achieve this end?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->It cannot be denied that violence gives rise to violence. Then again, nothing can ensure that the application of force without violence, with the intention of rectification, will necessarily bring good results. So what should be done under such circumstances?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Nothing would be better, if it were possible, than the eradication of capitalism by friendly persuasion and humanistic appeals. In that case the peace of the greater human family would not be much disturbed. But can it be guaranteed that everyone will respond to this approach? Some people may say that a day will come when, as a result of repeatedly listening to such appeals and gradually imbibing them over a long time, as well as through proper mental and spiritual education, good sense will prevail among the exploiters. This argument is very pleasant to hear. Such attempts are not reprehensible. But is it practicable to wait indefinitely for good sense to prevail among the exploiters? By then the exploited mass will have given up the ghost!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Though the humanistic approach works in some cases, in most instances it does not produce any result; and even where it does work, it takes a very long time. So, wherever necessary, capitalism must be forced to abandon its ferocious hunger by taking strong measures. But it cannot be assumed that even these measures will be completely successful, because those who appear to be under control due to fear of the law will adopt other ways to fulfil their desires. Black marketing, adulteration, etc., cannot be totally eradicated by threats or by arousing fear of the law.<!-- /block --></p>

Similarly, when capitalists declare, &ldquo;We have amassed wealth by our talent and labour. If others have the capacity and diligence, let them also do the same; nobody prevents them,&rdquo; they do not care to realize that the volume of commodities on the earth is limited, whereas the requirement is common to all.

Surplus labourers are ruined, bit by bit, due to poverty and hunger.

Every dust particle of the universe is the common patrimony of each and every one of us, so it is not at all proper to allow a particular social class to perpetuate its rule. The peripheric evolution of the social cycle will continue, and along with this the fight of the sadvipras against the supremacy of each social class will also have to continue.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..154"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=154 type=paragraph -->Society belongs to all, but its leadership will be in the hands of sadvipras. The responsibility for leading society cannot be left in the hands of the ks&#x301;atriyas, because they will try to enforce ks&#x301;atriya rule. They will exploit the non-ks&#x301;atriyas and chew the bones and marrow of the weak. Nor can the responsibility for leading society be left in the hands of the vipras, because they will try to establish vipra rule. They will exploit the non-vipras and chew the bones and marrow of the non-intellectuals. Likewise, the responsibility for leading society cannot be left in the hands of the vaeshyas, because they will try to impose vaeshya rule. They will exploit the non-vaeshyas and chew the bones and marrow of the toiling mass. Shu&#x301;dras cannot undertake the leadership of society. Hence the victory mark<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn21"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn21">21</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> of the successful shu&#x301;dra revolution indeed embellishes the forehead of the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..155"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=155 type=paragraph -->The responsibility for leading society can only be entrusted to the sadvipras because they are well established in Yama and Niyama &ndash; they are imbued with Cosmic ideation. The social cycle will surely rotate, and as a rule the dominance of the ks&#x301;atriyas, vipras and vaeshyas will take place in succession. But if sadvipras control the nucleus of society, these social classes may attain some degree of prominence in social life, but they will never be able to become the absolute rulers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..156"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=156 type=paragraph -->Sadvipras will never have any rest. They will have to continue fighting tirelessly. This fight is the life of living beings. In the absence of this fight, the creation will cease to exist. Sadvipras are vipras, ks&#x301;atriyas, vaeshyas and shu&#x301;dras all in one, hence the leadership of the sadvipras will mean the victory of every social class.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..158"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=158 type=paragraph -->All movements are systaltic. If the phase of contraction is made more stringent by the application of force, a forward galloping jump occurs in the following phase of expansion. Evolution which takes place as a result of this forward galloping jump is properly called viplava [revolution]. Similarly, if the phase of expansion is prolonged by the application of force, then the following phase of contraction will undergo greater inertia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..159"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=159 type=paragraph -->If any age reverts to the preceding one by the application of force &ndash; that is, if the Vaeshya Age reverts to the Vipra Age or the Vipra Age reverts to the Ks&#x301;atriya Age &ndash; we can call this vikra&#x301;nti [counter-evolution]. Similarly, the movement of the social cycle by a backward galloping jump can be called prativiplava [counter-revolution]. Neither counter-evolution nor counter-revolution lasts long.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..160"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=160 type=paragraph -->Today, in the modern world, the Ks&#x301;atriya Age and the Vipra Age are still evident in some undeveloped countries. In most developed countries the Vaeshya Age is prevalent.

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Human beings have an inherent and limitless desire for all-round victory in all spheres of life. In any sphere of life, important or unimportant, it is unthinkable that people will be content to lead insignificant lives. The idea of moving along a set path, eternally subservient to nature, has always been repugnant to human psychology. Sometimes, however, people are compelled to submit to the laws of nature due to extreme circumstantial pressure, and this is due to their lack of sufficient intellect and stamina.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->All human sadhana is merely the effort to overcome internal weaknesses. In order to try to overcome their psychic imperfections, people constantly get involved in ideological conflicts and thus create ever-new philosophies of life. This is how human society evolved and established a great and rational ideology conducive to the highest fulfilment in life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Not all human energy, however, is exhausted in the effort to remove psychic imperfections. As people have to maintain their existence in this seemingly adverse physical world, naturally they must make constant endeavours in the physical sphere. In order to conquer static <i>Prakrti</i> [the Supreme Operative Principle], physical science, or <i>bhaotika vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i>, evolved. The Sanskrit word <i>vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i>, however, is not synonymous with the English word "science", because in Sanskrit <i>vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i> stands for <i>Brahma vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i> [intuitional science], or <i>adhya&#x301;tma vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i> [the science of spirituality].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Nowadays some people claim that science is the root of all evil and that new scientific inventions have created dissension in society, leading human civilization down the path to catastrophe. With an open mind we should carefully and thoroughly analyse such claims.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In war the moment people envisage the possibility of defeat, they begin to invent new weapons to help them to achieve victory. Physical science plays its part by discovering new formulas to assist in such invention. Had physical clash not existed, the creation and evolution of the human mind would never have been possible. The emergence of subtle human intellect as we know it today would never have happened.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This type of phenomenon has occurred in all organisms, and thus all organisms have developed scientific thought processes according to their respective psychic proclivities and capabilities. For example, the building of nests by bats, the construction of pathways by white ants and the weaving of webs by spiders prove that these creatures have some knowledge of science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Today many people have assembled here in Gorakhpur. Now I ask you, if no scientific progress had occurred, would it have been possible for all of you to walk here from your remote villages? In order to overcome physical and psychic problems and inconveniences, the people of a particular era invented and popularized bullock carts for transportation. Later they developed faster horse-drawn carriages. Subsequently, as the era changed, public demand also began to change. That is why different types of transportation, such as motor cars, aeroplanes and more recently rockets, have been invented at different times. None of these inventions should be condemned. They are all simply designed to meet the psychic demands of different ages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->We know that due to natural causes, <i>gur&#x301;</i> [raw sugar] usually cannot be preserved for a long time. Besides that, many people do not even like the taste of <i>gur&#x301;</i>. For these two reasons people invented sugar from molasses through scientific processes. Now, can anyone claim that the discovery of sugar has been an impediment to human progress? If we consider molasses more nutritious than sugar, would it not be more scientific to enrich sugar with nutritious ingredients, or would it be more reasonable to put out pro-molasses propaganda?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Some people take every opportunity to needlessly criticize science. Of course, such criticism comes from those who have lost their inner vitality and capacity to adjust to new situations, and from those who, due to physical inertia, have accepted some dogmatic notion as an established fact.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Engrained habits prevent people from easily adapting to new circumstances. That is why some people deliberately hesitate to recognize scientific contributions. As long as such people fail to establish a psychic parallelism with new scientific discoveries, they will denounce the very things which they themselves often use for the sake of convenience when the situation demands it. For example, those who bitterly criticize modern medical science and eloquently praise primitive medical methods do not object to using bandages approved and prescribed by modern allopathy. Even staunch supporters of <i>kha&#x301;di</i> [hand-spun cloth], the proponents of the "molasses philosophy" and the advocates of bullock carts wear mill-made cloth, take sugar in their tea and travel by aeroplane to deliver fiery lectures denouncing modern science.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> But after some time, when they get used to such applications of modern science, they stop abusing and denouncing those things. Things which they initially condemned now become easy for them to use, because the scarcity and non-availability of old things gradually forces them to adapt to the new things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Thus it is evident that those who criticize science in reality want to turn the onward current of the Ganges back to its source, to Gangotri. This totally contradicts the principles of dynamics. In fact, such an endeavour betrays a negative mentality. No amount of shaking the world and turning it upside down will ever bring back the age of ancient sages and hermitages. The general masses will never reject mill-made cloth for the bark of trees or eat raw flesh in preference to cooked food. There is no greatness in returning back to the <i>gur&#x301;</i> era from the sugar age. Perhaps those who have never tasted sugar would like to live in the <i>gur&#x301;</i> age, but once people have come in contact with sugar they will never fully revert back to <i>gur&#x301;</i>, even by mistake. The reason is that their enjoyment of tea with sugar has become common and natural. Of course, to enter into a <i>gur&#x301;</i>-sugar controversy is meaningless because <i>gur&#x301;</i>, too, was once invented through scientific endeavour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Conflicts in the physical sphere gradually awaken dormant human potentialities. Environmental influences also increase the degree of complexity of the human body. The problems of ancient and modern people are by no means identical. To keep pace with the changing problems of life, the human body and mind have gradually become more complicated. The physical structures of ancient humans would have certainly been unfit for solving the problems of today. As the mind becomes more complex, its direct centres, the nerve cells, and its indirect centres, the glands, undergo corresponding changes. As the nature of problems changes, the human mind responds by making new scientific discoveries. I am therefore compelled to say that the steady cultivation of science must go on and that such cultivation will never be an impediment to human progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->But most of the detractors of science do not want to recognize this obvious fact, just because they are guided by sentiment. They do not realize that their blind attachment to the past is propelling the flow of their minds towards inertia. They are making their minds more and more reactionary and losing their dynamism. Those who have lost the rhythm of life&#146;s movement should properly be called static and inert, enshrouded in darkness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Keeping pace with the change in time, the human mind should always be kept occupied with progressive thoughts and work methods. In order for people to be able to carry out new responsibilities, changes take place in the nerve cells of the brain. The structure of the physical glands simultaneously undergoes change. As a result not only are people&#146;s physical and psychic structures becoming more complex, but the entire society is also becoming more complex. The number and the magnitude of the problems is rapidly increasing. In such circumstances can we afford to remain smug and silent, exulting over past glories? No. We should scientifically research solutions to our problems. As the saying goes, "As the sword, so the scabbard." No matter how complex our problems may be, science will have to develop equally complex solutions to those problems. We certainly do not want to appear ridiculous by using primitive bows and arrows to fight against powerful atomic weapons.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The more complex the body becomes internally, the more control people are able to exert over the various parts of the body. With the progress of science it may one day be possible to deposit a person&#146;s body in a particular place in Gorakhpur and send only his or her brain to London. There will be no need to transport the load of the physical body to London. Although this sounds like a fairy tale, it is certainly going to happen. People will deposit their limbs in a body bank, and then enjoy a safe, sound sleep.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The cycle of rotation of the social classes will continue. That is to say, as class struggle continues, one class or another gains dominance in a particular era. Now if science remains completely in the hands of static people, the outcome will be disappointing. The only beneficial result will be that if the class struggle continues unabated, people will eventually understand that only <i>sadvipras</i> have the capacity to be the leaders of society. I call <i>sadvipras</i> only those people who strictly and sincerely follow the principles of <i>Yama</i> and <i>Niyama</i>.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> In the collective efforts of <i>sadvipras</i> lies humanity&#146;s best hope of establishing peace and progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Democracy is incapable of solving society&#146;s problems, because in a democratic system one class gets the opportunity to dominate the others, whose freedom is curbed to a great extent. Since democracy does not recognize any fixed principles as absolute, rivalry, jealousy, meanness, immorality, etc., take deep root and flourish unchecked. Moreover, the colour and form of democracy keep changing because it repeatedly accepts relative truths as cardinal principles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The establishment of a classless society is only possible for those who accept <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> [Supreme Consciousness] as the goal of their lives, for those whose entire mental power is ceaselessly directed towards one supreme goal. In a society where there is no class struggle, the remaining classes will have to disappear and all people will have to unite under the banner of one common ideology. This can only be done by <i>sadvipras</i>, and therefore, for the future welfare of the universe, a [benevolent] <i>sadvipra</i> dictatorship is an absolute necessity.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The establishment of such an ideal is not possible within the democratic system because candidates depend on petty thieves, hardened criminals and antisocial elements for votes. Able and competent candidates are defeated in elections when the issues of casteism, provincialism, communalism, etc., are raised. Moreover, people with absolutely no intelligence or moral standards and no experience in politics, administration, education, etc., are entrusted with the responsibility of determining the fate of the candidates.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Most individual and social problems can be beautifully solved by <i>sadvipras</i>, with the help of scientific research. Science is certainly capable of solving most of the land problems that exist to some degree in all countries of the world. If the need for foodstuffs decreases, the importance and value of land will automatically diminish. To satisfy a person&#146;s hunger, a single food tablet may one day be sufficient. The production of abundant quantities of such tablets in science laboratories will remove the disparity between the rich and the poor, because the poor are driven by pangs of hunger to become the slaves of the rich, who are then provided with many opportunities to accumulate more wealth. Of course, even before the development of synthetic food, science has already contributed in many ways to solving food problems. Although the world&#146;s population is increasing all the time, the total area of land available is not increasing proportionately. Even so, with limited areas of land at their disposal, people, with the help of science, are increasing food production through improved manure, seeds, irrigation systems, etc. We can therefore see that science is indispensable for human progress, and without it half the population of the world today would have died of starvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->We know, too, that medical science has helped people immensely in the past, continues to help them in the present and will continue to help them in the future. Medical and surgical developments have helped people to increase their longevity in the past and likewise continue to do so today. If people can successfully forestall ageing and death by replacing old glands with new ones, what more could they want? Medical science is now capable of doing this. One of the reasons that the physical body dies is that its glands become old and weak. Hence death can be delayed if a person&#146;s glands are replaced.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Of course humans beings will not achieve immortality by temporarily cheating death or by increasing their longevity a little, because they possess another thing: the brain. From this brain emanate psychic feelings such as "I exist" and "I do." When the brain becomes old and worn out due to age as well as constant use, it naturally decays and distorts information. If the entire brain is replaced, the whole human personality will undergo radical changes. In such cases it will have to be considered that the former person has died and a new person has taken birth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Through proper scientific research, it will be possible to bring about a change in the glandular structure of the body. As a consequence even a dishonest person will be able to become an honest one. But the previously acquired <i>sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras</i> [reactive momenta] of the mind will not change. Although this process may change the flow of a person&#146;s <i>pratyayamu&#x301;laka karma</i> [original actions], the flow of his or her <i>sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ramu&#x301;laka karma</i> [reactions to original actions] will not be affected.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The brain is the receptacle of the mind, and the mind is the receptacle of the <i>sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras</i>. Now, if the brain is replaced, the mind, with all its reactive momenta, will have to take a completely new receptacle, in which case the person will be an entirely new being. If through some scientific process a person&#146;s brain is replaced with a monkey&#146;s brain, the person will cease to be the owner of that human body. From the standpoint of psychology, he or she will not be human at all and the body will gradually take the form of a monkey&#146;s body. The secretions from the glands will also become similar to the secretions from the glands of a monkey&#146;s body. In the same way a man can be transformed into a woman or a woman into a man. And not only that: a powerful mental ideation can also bring about a change in the glandular secretions in the human body. In this way also a man can be transformed into a woman or a woman into a man. And through a partial change in his glands, it would not be impossible for a man to conceive. However, science can never change people&#146;s <i>sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras</i>. Therefore, for the development of their personalities, there is no alternative for human beings other than to perform sadhana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->For the sake of human progress, scientific research must always be encouraged, but it is desirable that it should be carried out under the supervision of <i>sadvipras</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

Thus little by little human beings will lose their reproductive power, but the reproductive urge in the human mind will never altogether disappear. Since the potential for creation exists in the original Creator, <i>Sagun&#x301;a Brahma</i> [the Qualified Supreme Entity], the seed of creation remains engrained in all human beings, who are sheltered in <i>Sagun&#x301;a Brahma</i>. On said auspicious day, humanity will step out of the limitations of the <i>ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a</i> [crude mind] and will fulfil its creative urge through the cultivation of subtlety. The human beings of that great age will build a better society, and create great literature and more progressive art.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->My personal opinion is that atom bombs will never be able to totally destroy human civilization, for humanity has not yet become intellectually bankrupt. The conflict between <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> [the introversial force] and <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> [the extroversial force] is going on magnificently now. So the conclusion is very clear: in the very near future people are sure to find a means to counter the atomic menace.

<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Let me tell you at the very outset that the English word &ldquo;history&rdquo; and the Sanskrit word <i>itiha&#x301;sa</i> are not synonymous. The chronological record of past events which is called &ldquo;history&rdquo; in English should be called <i>itivrtta, itikatha&#x301;, pura&#x301;vrtta</i> or <i>pura&#x301;katha&#x301;</i> in Sanskrit. <i>Itiha&#x301;sa</i> refers to the aspect of <i>itivrtta</i> or history which has educative value. <i>Itiha&#x301;sa</i> is defined as: <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Dharma&#x301;rthaka&#x301;mamoks&#x301;artham&#x301; niitiva&#x301;kyasamanvitam;<br>Pura&#x301;vrttakatha&#x301;yuktam itiha&#x301;sa pracaks&#x301;yate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The type of <i>itivrtta</i> which has the possibility of fulfilling physical longings, psychic longings, psycho-spiritual longings and spiritual longings, and which also imparts moral education, should be called <i>itiha&#x301;sa</i>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->According to this definition, the <i>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</i> can definitely be regarded as <i>itiha&#x301;sa</i>. I do not subscribe to the views of those who treat it merely as an epic or educative story. So you can now understand that the book called <i>The History of India</i>, which is usually taught in schools and colleges, should not be called <i>Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;er Itiha&#x301;sa</i>, but <i>Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;er Itikatha&#x301;.</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Books which only impart moral education and have no historical context are called <i>pura&#x301;n&#x301;as</i>. Books of this type are unable to help us to determine historical fact. In fact, their exaggerated and imaginary content creates confusion in the minds of the readers. For example, we can cite the case of the <i>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i>. The <i>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i> has great educative value, yet it is not <i>itiha&#x301;sa</i> or <i>itikatha&#x301;</i>. It is a <i>pura&#x301;n&#x301;a</i>. All the characters in the <i>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i> are imaginary. The <i>pus&#x301;pak</i> chariot, the imaginary flying vehicle in the <i>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i>, may create the misconception in people&rsquo;s minds that during the <i>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i> period the people of India knew how to manufacture planes. If they read such written records of our ancestors, people today may misunderstand history and be led into the false belief that the unreal is real, and thus fall prey to superstition. This is not the case only with the <i>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i> and other famous mythological books; many ancient stories and works of fiction are wrongly regarded as <i>itiha&#x301;sa</i>, causing the seeds of superstition to penetrate deeply into the minds of contemporary readers. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->There are many reasons why superstition takes root in the human mind. These reasons can be divided into several categories: ignorance of history, ignorance of science, superstition caused by blind attachment and superstition which has become a habit. Today we will analyse the superstitions which arise due to ignorance of history. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->First, let us discuss casteism. It is an undeniable truth that at the dawn of creation the earth was not inhabited by human beings. In the course of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> [the process of introversion in the Cosmic Cycle of creation], first plants evolved out of the five fundamental factors, then underdeveloped creatures, and finally human beings. The study of history has taught us that about one million years ago a class of semi-humans, closely related to apes of those times, emerged on the earth. These semi-humans were the tailless apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, orang-utans, etc.) and the early ancestors of human beings. After thus studying the origin of the human race and tracing the earliest human ancestors, every educated person will have to admit that all human beings have come from this semi-human clan. No group of people can logically claim that their ancestors are superior to those of others. Every intelligent person will have to admit that the ordering of the castes was something created by human beings and is not divinely ordained. As human beings originated from apes, all belong to one race. Were the ancestors of Brahmans monkey Brahmans, and the ancestors of Kayasthas monkey Kayasthas? Such a ludicrous concept will provide historians with amusing anecdotes. In fact, primitive people established themselves as members of the higher castes through verbal jugglery or by defeating others in battles of wits, and today their descendants claim this ancestral lineage. At the same time people with little intellect were forced to accept positions as members of the lower castes. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Many people today talk about purity of blood. Let us also discuss this point. If by purity of blood people mean pure Aryan blood, I will ask, did not non-Aryan blood enter into the collective body of the Aryans who migrated to India from Central Asia and the Arctic? Certainly it did, and this is the reason that their skin colour was gradually transformed from white into black or yellow according to the routes they took as they migrated into India. In India we can see black-skinned Brahmans and white-skinned Shu&#x301;dras because of this mixing of Aryan and non-Aryan blood. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Some people support casteism by referring to books about caste history. Although many of the historical texts of the different castes were written in difficult Sanskrit, one fundamental defect is apparent. If we believe the <i>shlokas</i> [couplets] in these texts, we will be led to believe that one caste was born from the mouth of the Supreme Entity, another from Its arms, another from the middle of Its body, and yet another from Its feet. Only those who are under the influence of intoxicants will accept such scriptures as authentic! Obviously, no human being can be born from the mouth, and although it is philosophically accepted that the quinquelemental universe was created out of the vast formless Cosmic Body, it is foolish to imagine that that Body has a mouth, arms, [etc.,] out of which the different higher or lower characteristics of the different castes were created. In fact, this Rgvedic <i>shloka</i>, which is a mere interpolation, has been used to perpetuate the defective concept of casteism. Furthermore, the actual meaning of the <i>shloka</i> is different from this. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;o&#146;sya mukhama&#x301;siit va&#x301;hura&#x301;janyo&#146;bhavat;<br>Madhya tadasya yadvaeshya padbhya&#x301; shu&#x301;dra aja&#x301;yata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[Brahmans came out of the mouth (of the Supreme Entity), Ks&#x301;attriyas were born from the arms, Vaeshyas came out of the trunk of the body, and Shu&#x301;dras were born from the feet.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Actually, here &ldquo;Brahmans&rdquo; means &ldquo;those who are <i>sattvagun&#x301;ii</i> [of a sentient nature] and have an intellectual disposition&rdquo;. Through allegory it is being suggested that intellectuals symbolize the mouth of the Supreme Entity, warriors (<i>rajahgun&#x301;ii</i>) represent the valiant arms, capitalists, merchants and traders (<i>rajastamagun&#x301;ii</i>) represent the middle portion of the Cosmic body, and workers (<i>tamogun&#x301;ii</i>) symbolize the feet. This is the proper interpretation of the <i>shloka</i>. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It is also easy to find numerous contradictions in caste history. For example, according to caste history there were only ten categories of Brahmans: five from North India and five from South India. As other groups of Brahmans did not fall into these ten categories, they were considered to be non-Brahmans. Besides this, the histories of different castes refer to the widespread practice of <i>niyoga pratha&#x301;</i> [fathering a child by a woman other than one&rsquo;s wife], which resulted in widespread promiscuity. Moreover, in the Buddhist Age the rigidity of the caste system loosened and the intermingling of castes became quite common. In regions where orthodox people tried to strictly follow caste rules, new castes and sub-castes were formed. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Let me tell you an interesting story which will illustrate the contradictory nature of caste history. In the caste history of the Bengal Brahmans it is mentioned that King Jayanta Shur brought five sincere Brahmans from Ka&#x301;nya Kubha to Bengal. These five Brahmans are described as the ancestors of the millions of Brahmans of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Barendrabhu&#x301;mi. (Did each of these five men marry a large number of Bengali women? Otherwise how could they have had so many descendants?) It is also stated that five Shu&#x301;dras came to Bengal along with the Brahmans as their servants and became the ancestors of the Kayasthas of Bengal. Now, in the caste history of the Kayasthas it is mentioned that King Jayanta Shur brought five warriors to Bengal from Ka&#x301;nya Kubha, and they are the ancestors of the Ka&#x301;yasthas of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Barendrabhu&#x301;mi. These Kayasthas were all warriors, and came on horseback wearing leather shoes. Despite their skill as warriors, they did not know how to cook, so five cooks accompanied them. These cooks became the ancestors of the Brahmans of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Barendra. Obviously the question arises, are such caste histories reliable? <!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->According to the caste history of the Kayasthas, Chitragupta was the first ancestor of the Kayasthas of Bengal. (All the Kayasthas except four or five groups accept Chitragupta as their first ancestor.) The amusing thing is that Chitragupta is only an imaginary character. He is the mythological son of <i>Brahma</i> [the Supreme Entity]. The caste history states that Chitragupta had twelve sons: Ca&#x301;ru, Suca&#x301;ru, Citru, Citraca&#x301;ru, Arun&#x301;a, Yatiindraya, Himava&#x301;na, Matima&#x301;na, Bha&#x301;nu, Vibha&#x301;nu, Vishvabha&#x301;nu and Viiryabha&#x301;nu. The twelve categories of Kayasthas &ndash; Ambas&#x301;t&#x301;ha, Shriivastava, Bhattana&#x301;gara, Ma&#x301;thura, Sakhasena&#x301;, Ganda, Su&#x301;ryadhvaja, Valmiiki, Kulashres&#x301;t&#x301;ha, As&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na, Nigama and Karana &ndash; descended from these twelve sons. But the interesting thing is this: the Kayasthas belonging to these twelve categories had two hands, but their father, Chitragupta, is depicted as having four hands, holding thunder, a club, a pen and an ink pot. Though Chitragupta was supposed to be human, he was the record keeper of an invisible kingdom. I leave it to you to decide whether the account of Chitragupta is reliable or not. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There is an unhealthy tendency among some sections of society to give credence to baseless stories and mythologies. They do so because they are ignorant of history. I have heard people say that since India was named &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo; after the Puranic character King Bharata, neither King Bharata nor the Puranas themselves should be regarded as false. However, facts contradict this. India was not named after King Bharata. In fact, the term &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo; is much older than the story of King Bharata. People have been misled and confused because of the similarity in the names. Etymologically, <i>bhara</i> means &ldquo;feeding the people&rdquo; and <i>ta</i> means &ldquo;expanding&rdquo;. So &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo; means &ldquo;a land which can readily supply food and shelter to its population and easily facilitate the unhindered psycho-spiritual development of its people&rdquo;. (<i>Vars&#x301;a</i> means &ldquo;land&rdquo;.) When the nomadic Aryans, who were used to living in an inhospitable environment, arrived in the fertile, prosperous land of India, they were so overwhelmed by the abundant wealth, warm climate, lush vegetation and verdant beauty of the country that they called it &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo;. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->It was the practice of the Aryans to name geographical regions or individuals according to their special qualities or characteristics. For example, the Aryans noticed innumerable pebbles and stones resembling <i>ja&#x301;m</i> [<i>Eugenia jambolana Lam.</i>] in the northwestern region of India, so they called it &ldquo;Jambudviipa&rdquo; (modern Jammu). [<i>Jambu</i> is the Sanskrit equivalent of the Bengali <i>ja&#x301;m</i>, and <i>dviipa</i> is Sanskrit for &ldquo;island&rdquo;.] A region that had two large lakes they called &ldquo;Dvigarttabhu&#x301;mi&rdquo; (modern Dogra). [<i>Dvi</i> = &ldquo;two&rdquo;, <i>gartta</i> = &ldquo;lake&rdquo;, <i>bhu&#x301;mi</i> = &ldquo;land&rdquo;.] As the northern part of India was inhabited by people of the Kash tribe, the area was called &ldquo;Kashmeru&rdquo;. (<i>Meru</i> means &ldquo;land&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Kashmeru&rdquo; became &ldquo;Kashmir&rdquo;.) Thus because the Aryans considered that India possessed wonderful qualities and vast resources, they called it &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo;. This name has nothing to do with the mythological King Bharata. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Some people in India attach great importance to the tradition whereby men wear a pigtail on the back of the head and a sacrificial thread across the body. They believe that a man is not virtuous unless he follows these two practices. When in ancient times the nomadic Aryans migrated to and settled in India, the country was already inhabited by Dravidians and Austrics, so naturally there was racial mixing between the Aryans and the non-Aryans. Eventually there was so much social blending that it was impossible to determine who were the torchbearers of Aryan culture and who were not. To distinguish themselves from the masses as the upholders of Aryan culture and Vedic religion, the Aryans started wearing a pigtail. Through their pigtail the Aryans proclaimed their Aryan identity, in spite of the fact that tremendous racial mixing had already occurred in India and that the skin colour of many of those who followed this custom was black. How can there possibly be any relation between these external rituals and the observance of dharma? <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Regarding the custom of wearing a sacrificial thread, one need not bother trying to find a connection between an ordinary cotton thread and one&rsquo;s internal spiritual elevation. The fact is that the Aryans &ndash; the original inhabitants of the Arctic and Russia &ndash; were very partial to drinking. The Aryans of the Vedic Age who came to India maintained many of the original Russian customs (some of which can still be found in the Russia of today). In that primitive age before the development of science, the Aryans, like numerous other tribes and races, were basically animists. They regarded the various natural forces as expressions of a divine entity and attributed all their fortunes and misfortunes to those deities. In order to save themselves from natural calamities, they used to chant hymns, make offerings of their favourite food and burn sacrificial wood to propitiate their gods. This is how <i>yajin&#x32D;as</i> and <i>homas</i> [two kinds of sacrifice] arose and why the Aryans of that time used to offer ghee, animal flesh and other favourite food items into those sacrificial fires. As the colour of clouds and smoke appear similar, the Aryans incorrectly thought that the smoke rising from their sacrificial fires would climb high in the sky, form clouds and bring down rain. The Aryans wrongly thought that the diseases which originated and spread from stinking, filthy places could be counteracted by the scented smoke of sacrificial fires. In an age in which science was still very primitive, the undeveloped Aryans engaged in sacrificial rituals, goaded by mundane considerations. Unfortunately, there are still groups of people today who think that unless sacrificial rituals are performed, religious practices will be incomplete. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The five categories of Brahman priests [Hota&#x301;, Rtvik, Udga&#x301;ta&#x301;, Adhvaryu and Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a] who performed sacrificial rituals were supposed to perform their religious duties with perfect calmness and mental serenity. This is how the Aryans expected their priests to conduct themselves. Obviously, the priests would scrupulously avoid drinking alcohol and shun the company of drunkards during a ritual or sacrifice. To keep drunkards away, they used to wear a piece of deer skin across their left shoulder as a distinguishing mark. As this symbol was used during sacrificial rituals, it was called a <i>yajin&#x32D;opaviita</i>. And when the priests wore the same symbol on their right shoulder during the performance of oblations to their departed ancestors, it was called a <i>pra&#x301;ciira&#x301;viita</i>. When they suspended the same symbol around their necks, it was called a <i>niviita</i>. Women were entitled to perform religious sacrifices, therefore it can be presumed that they also wore a <i>yajin&#x32D;opaviita</i>. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Later on, after deer had become somewhat scarce and the Aryans in India had become acquainted with cotton, the custom of wearing a deer skin was replaced with the custom of wearing a cotton thread. Subsequently, it became a part of their religious practice to always wear a cotton thread over the left shoulder. Whatever might have been the importance of sacrificial rituals and a sacrificial thread to the ancient Aryans, today in this relatively developed age of science, when people use their intellectual power and developed technology to fight against natural calamities and no longer propitiate deities by offering ghee in sacrificial fires, the intelligentsia should decide whether or not the custom of wearing a <i>yajin&#x32D;opaviita</i> is useful. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Many people become confused and believe in superstitions because they do not have a proper understanding of the correct meaning of words. I have often seen people debate over useless, trivial matters such as whether Rama or Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is greater, or whether Shiva or Narayana is greater. The word <i>Ra&#x301;ma</i> is derived from the Sanskrit root verb <i>ram</i>. Etymologically, <i>Ra&#x301;ma</i> means &ldquo;The Entity Who Is the Embodiment of Bliss&rdquo;, that is, <i>Purus&#x301;ottama</i> [Nucleus Consciousness]. Similarly, the word <i>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a</i> is derived from the Sanskrit root verb <i>krs&#x301;. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a</i> means &ldquo;The Entity Who Attracts the Entire Universe towards Himself&rdquo;, that is, <i>Purus&#x301;ottama</i>. <i>Ra&#x301;ma</i> and <i>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a</i> are therefore two names of the same Entity. Similarly, the word <i>Shiva</i> means <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> [&ldquo;Supreme Consciousness&rdquo;]. <i>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i> is a combination of two words: <i>na&#x301;ra</i> and <i>ayana</i>. <i>Na&#x301;ra</i> means <i>Prakrti</i> [&ldquo;Supreme Operative Principle&rdquo;] (<i>na&#x301;ra</i> can also at times be used to mean &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;) and <i>ayana</i> means &ldquo;shelter&rdquo;. So <i>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i> means &ldquo;The Shelter of the Supreme Operative Principle&rdquo;, that is, Supreme Consciousness. Thus <i>Shiva</i> and <i>Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a</i> are merely two names for the same Entity. So where is the scope to wrangle over this issue? The Persian word <i>Khuda&#x301;</i> and the Sanskrit word <i>Svayambhu</i> (according to some people the Vedic word <i>Svayambhu</i> has been transformed into the Persian word <i>Khuda&#x301;</i>) are also two names for the same Entity. Is there therefore any scope to debate over whether <i>Khuda&#x301;</i> or <i>Svayambhu</i> is greater? It is only due to their ignorance of etymology that people take part in unnecessary debates and arguments over the correct meaning of words and divide society. If all human beings are the offspring of the Supreme Entity, how is it possible that only Muslims are the favourite children of Allah, and only Hindus are the favourite children of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a? <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The fact is that all the created objects in this universe are the children of <i>Parama Brahma</i> &ndash; all are Its finite manifestations.

<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Whenever there is clash or conflict within any structure, whether subtle or crude, it develops increasing subtlety. This applies to both psychic clash and physical clash. The more subtle the crude mind becomes as a result of internal clash, the greater its spiritual awakening.

As a result of further spinning, that is, further physical clash, its fibres become so subtle that they are almost invisible to the eye.&rdquo; In the dexterous hand of <i>Prakrti</i> [the Supreme Operative Principle], the solid factor is metamorphosed into mind, and mind is later converted into Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Physical Clash<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the initial stage of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> [the process of introversion], there is only physical clash. The unit mind &ndash; the mind whose flow is connected with matter through the workings of its vital energy &ndash; is generated as a consequence of extreme physical clash. Thus we see that in the phenomenal world the primordial cause of creation is physical clash, and due to this clash animate entities are generated out of inanimate matter. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Though the term &ldquo;non-matter&rdquo; is taken to mean the <i>a&#x301;tman</i> [unit consciousness], the <i>maha&#x301;ttattva</i> [existential &ldquo;I&rdquo;] and the <i>aham&#x301;tattva</i> [doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;], a subtle analysis can lead us to the understanding that only <i>Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma</i> [the Non-Qualified Supreme Entity] qualifies as non-matter. Clash transforms matter into mind-stuff and mind-stuff into non-matter. Whenever the objective part of the Macrocosm is converted into non-matter, it is no longer Its objective part but becomes Its subjective part. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Although the unit mind appears to originate from matter, in the absolute sense it evolves from the Macrocosmic Mind. Because the matter from which it appears to originate is nothing but physical vibrations emanating from the Cosmic (Macrocosmic) Mind. And what (based on appearances) we call physical clash is, from the Cosmic point of view, direct Macrocosmic psychic clash, and as created within the microcosm, indirect Macrocosmic psychic clash. When what we call physical clash is mostly superseded by direct Macrocosmic psychic clash due to close proximity to the Cognitive Entity, a material object comes to be termed a conscious entity. When that conscious entity is further assailed by the direct waves of the Macrocosm, it can be called a human mind. Thus the human mind is created as a result of physical and psychic clash in the relative world and Macrocosmic psychic clash in the absolute sphere. The appropriate structure for the human mind is selected by the waves of the Macrocosmic Mind out of the five fundamental factors. That structure is the human body. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->So in human beings there is both physical and psychic clash. Due to the impact of both, humans gradually advance along the path of progress. But inanimate objects are only subjected to physical clash, because in them mind has no expression. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Even though both physical and psychic clash help to create progress, human beings can generally be divided into two categories: those who welcome psychic clash and those who prefer to undergo physical clash. The first category we can call <i>bha&#x301;vava&#x301;diis</i> [&ldquo;idealists&rdquo;] and the second category <i>bhogava&#x301;diis</i> [&ldquo;materialists&rdquo;] . I intentionally do not use the word jad&#x301;ava&#x301;diis<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> to describe the latter. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->It should be remembered that both the materialists and the idealists are <i>sa&#x301;dhakas</i> [spiritual aspirants], the only difference between them being their goal. A subtle analysis will reveal that both categories harm society. In order to advance, human beings will have to maintain a balance between the two, and will have to keep the idea of the Supreme fixed before them as their goal in the midst of physical clashes. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the relative sense, only a kind of physical clash exists in the <i>sain&#x32D;cara</i> [extroversial] phase of <i>Brahma Cakra</i> [the Cosmic Cycle of creation] whereas in the <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> [introversial] phase all three exist: physical clash, psychic clash and the attraction of the Great. Now, in the case of these clashes, what clashes against what? Whatever the clash, whether physical or psychic, it exists between two forces: <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> [introversial force] and <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> [extroversial force] &ndash; negative and positive. Suppose in the phase of <i>sain&#x32D;cara</i> the negative <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force is fixed at forty and the positive <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force is fixed at sixty. The resultant force will be twenty in favour of <i>Avidya&#x301;</i>. In the phase of <i>sain&#x32D;cara</i> this stronger positive <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force causes the [Cosmic] ectoplasm to move away from <i>Purus&#x301;ottama</i> [Nucleus Consciousness]. In the phase of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i>, if the negative <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force is fixed at sixty and the positive <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force at forty, the resultant will be twenty in favour of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i>, causing the [unit] ectoplasm to gradually advance towards Nucleus Consciousness, that is, towards non-matter.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The subtle Cosmic mind-stuff is metamorphosed into the material particles of the relative world. The return of these particles to non-matter is caused by physical clash, psychic clash and the attraction of the Great. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->To encourage physical clash is a kind of sadhana which is called <i>karma yoga.</i> In <i>karma yoga</i> people perform sadhana physically by rendering service to living beings and the world at large, by conducting scientific research, etc. Physical clash increases the inter-atomic space within material objects, resulting in the transformation of crude matter into mind-stuff. This transformation of matter into mind occurs due to the aforementioned net twenty-point negative <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force, so whatever energy of human beings and their physical science might be applied in the transforming process, those human beings and their physical science cannot add to the effect of that twenty-point force. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Those people who opt for the path of physical clash use all the energy they have gained in the process of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> to deal with matter. Thus although there is no scope for their minds to acquire knowledge, they certainly have room for devotion, because the goal of the <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force with which they are engaged in physical clash is Nucleus Consciousness. So those who move in the flow of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> are certainly advancing towards <i>Brahma</i> [the Supreme Entity]. This movement towards <i>Brahma</i>, this attraction towards Nucleus Consciousness, is termed &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Self-awareness develops through clash. The awareness that develops through physical clash is termed <i>jada&#x301;buddhi</i> [crude physical intellect] because it is associated with <i>jada&#x301;</i> [matter]. The consciousness of animals and undeveloped human beings is matter-oriented. But even in developed human society, if someone is an atheist or a materialist, we can only term their intellect as <i>jada&#x301;buddhi</i>. Such people deny the existence of spirituality in order to hide their intellectual deficiencies. Their denial betrays their moral and intellectual bankruptcy. It does not speak of their glory, nor does it diminish the value of spirituality. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Devotion plays a positive role in the process of clash. Had there been no factor to maintain the balance among all the objects created within the Macrocosmic Mind, the entire structure of the universe would have fallen apart. For the sake of harmony and balance within the universe, there is a mutual attraction among all the objects; each microcosm attracts the other microcosms. All finite microcosms &ndash; the innumerable manifestations of the Supreme Entity &ndash; are entitled to that universal love with which It has bound each microcosm to Itself, entitled to the wave of that universal love, in which Its divine ocean of bliss is perennially flowing. Attraction is the innate characteristic of microcosms. When this attraction is for finite objects, it is called <i>ka&#x301;ma</i> [&ldquo;physical longing&rdquo;], and when it surges towards the Cosmic Entity, it is called <i>prema</i> [&ldquo;divine love&rdquo;]. Of course, <i>ka&#x301;ma</i> is nothing but a limited form of <i>prema</i>. When microcosms rush towards <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> [Supreme Consciousness] attracted by the irresistible force of divine love, it is termed &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;. Since clash drives the microcosms towards subtlety, it follows that clash must be the sustainer of devotion. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Materialists are worshippers of <i>ka&#x301;ma</i>. They are preoccupied with casteism, nationalism, communism, etc. They confine their love to a particular social group or state and do not feel any qualms of conscience about spitting venom at another social group or state. Such a limited expression of love cannot be called devotion. Genuine devotees will shower their love equally on each and every entity of this universe. When materialists put on a show of universal love, it is merely a ploy which they use to misappropriate others&#146; property. <!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The second possibility is struggle on the intellectual plane &ndash; psychic clash. In this sort of clash, people strive only to satisfy their psychic longings unrelated to the physical body. They do not desire mundane objects of pleasure, but seek psychic objects such as name, fame, etc. Pure psychic clash is perhaps subtler than physical clash, but to what extent can it promote human welfare? Even educated and intelligent people constantly indulge in mudslinging against others merely to attain name and fame, even though they are not greedy for money. Can this sort of psychic clash lead the mind towards subtlety? On the one hand ectoplasms are powdered down due to clash and their minds may achieve a fair degree of expansion, but on the other hand, under the domination of the propensity of greed, their minds gradually move towards greater crudity; that is, they move along the path of negative <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i>. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Attraction of the Great<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->That is not to say that one should avoid physical and psychic clashes. On the contrary, one should encourage them, but without losing sight of the Macrocosmic goal. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->When one&rsquo;s mind becomes more subtle and expanded, it is no longer assailed by petty thoughts. The mind-atoms (atoms of ectoplasm) will be powdered down, and in the fire of sadhana those powdered-down atoms will become ensconced in non-duality. So physical and psychic clash achieve their highest fulfilment in the attraction of the Great. Without this divine attraction, life loses its charm. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The mind is one&rsquo;s best friend if it moves towards subtlety, but if it degenerates and becomes crude it is one&rsquo;s worst enemy. Due to psychic clash people today have created atom bombs, but as their endeavour is motivated by materialistic desires, the consequences have been horrifying. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The structure of the mind is determined by the nature of its object. If the psychic object is crude, the inter-atomic gaps within the mind decrease in size, and the mind will ultimately refuse to accept anything except its own crude object. For this reason the supporters of crude isms become incapable of accepting the rational ideas of others, and closing their eyes and plugging their ears, they try to cling to their own irrational rituals. Their psychic receptivity is lost due to the superimposition of crude ideation. They do not feel the need for the <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force to exceed the <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force. They say, &ldquo;Why should I bother about such subtle things. I am quite happy as I am.&rdquo; Such people, engrossed as they are with materialism, are bound to be reborn in crude material bodies. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->When the goal of one&rsquo;s ideation is <i>Parama&#x301;tman</i> [the totality of all unit consciousnesses], one progresses in an absolute sense. As one&rsquo;s psychic object is subtle and expansive, one&rsquo;s psychic body also becomes subtle and expansive and finally becomes one with the Macrocosm. It was assumed that during the period of psychic clash in the phase of <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i>, microcosms progress due to the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force (a negative twenty in our example). But as a result of Cosmic ideation, can the speed of the microcosms&rsquo; progress exceed that <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> speed? Yes, it can. This is known as the attraction of the Great. But some <i>sa&#x301;dhakas</i> whose brain and nervous system have become accustomed to the natural speed of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> find it difficult to adjust to the accelerated movement created by the attraction of the Great. This difficulty is expressed through vibrational symptoms such as tears of joy, horripilation, dance, etc. <i>Sa&#x301;dhakas</i> who can adjust to the accelerated movement will not be affected by these expressions. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The movement caused by the attraction of the Great is called true devotion; such devotion results from worshipping the Great. Physical clash also produces a type of devotion, but that is static in nature. And the devotion caused by psychic clash is mutative in nature. Actually, there is very little difference between the devotion born out of psychic clash and that born out of observance of the moral code [i.e., cardinal moral principles]. Such psychic-clash or moralistic devotees cannot feel the sweetness of sentient devotion, because their minds are not filled with the thought of the Supreme; their minds are filled with petty thoughts; their outlook is that of one engaged in a commercial transaction. Ideation on the Supreme is the only way to attain real spiritual peace. The attraction of the Great is the only genuine devotion. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><i>Parama&#x301;tman</i> has been attracting all to Himself,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> with no exception. Some people complain that <i>Parama&#x301;tman</i> has forgotten them, but to say that is unjust, for no living being is outside <i>Brahma Cakra</i>. He attracts all through His sweet bond of love. Sometimes this love appears to be painful, sometimes pleasurable. But whatever the experience, painful or pleasurable, He comes to you. He does not cast you away in a world beyond the scope of pain or pleasure. If you ever see that this has happened, you will know that you have lost your identity. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Hence when a genuine spiritual aspirant experiences happiness he or she will say, &ldquo;O Lord, how great You are to have remembered such an insignificant person as me,&rdquo; and when he or she experiences pain, &ldquo;O Lord, how great You are to have come to me in the form of sorrow, even when others ignore me.&rdquo; An innocent person who is acquitted in a court case should say, &ldquo;O Lord how great You are! You have saved me by upholding justice.&rdquo; And the guilty one should say, &ldquo;O Lord, how great You are! You have made me realize my mistakes by putting me through physical and psychic torment.&rdquo; And the judge should say, &ldquo;O Lord, You have honoured me by making me the deliverer of justice.&rdquo; <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->According to divine decree, if the negative <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force in <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> is sixty and the positive <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> force is forty, then the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force is twenty. With the help of this resultant force of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> (twenty), <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> attracts microcosms towards Himself. If microcosms surrender totally to <i>Vidya&#x301;</i>, they will certainly attain <i>Brahma</i> some day. And if the microcosms can, by virtue of sadhana, accelerate the flow of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i>, then their resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force will merge in the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force of <i>Brahma</i>. This pursuit of <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> in individual life is the sadhana of <i>Sagun&#x301;a Brahma</i> [the Qualified Supreme Entity]. But if one wrongly pursues the path of <i>Avidya&#x301;</i>, one moves counter to the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force of <i>Brahma</i>. The result of this movement against the Cosmic will can never be good. Philosophically it is known as <i>pralaya</i> [annihilation]. Hence while doing the sadhana of <i>Sagun&#x301;a Brahma</i>, one has to increase the <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph --><i>Sa&#x301; vidya&#x301; ya&#x301; vimuktaye</i> &ndash; &ldquo;<i>Vidya&#x301;</i> is that which brings liberation.&rdquo; Now the question is, with how much force can microcosms advance? As long as human beings advance due to the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force of the Supreme Entity, they are regarded as <i>sa&#x301;dhakas</i> of sentient devotion; that is, the wave of the resultant force during the <i>pratisain&#x32D;cara</i> phase is the wave of sentient devotion. In the flow of their movement they only have one desire in their minds, the desire for liberation. And when they cleanse themselves of all impurities and take the help of the full negative force in order to become one with Nucleus Consciousness, the devotion through which they advance is called <i>ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti</i> [&ldquo;non-attributional devotion&rdquo;]. At that phase of sadhana they do not desire liberation, but yearn for <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> alone. In this category of devotees the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force of twenty is converted into the original sixty <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force [of the Supreme Entity]. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Devotion can only be attained through rigorous penance, through action and knowledge for lifetimes together. Even illiterate people can perfect non-attributional devotion. When great scholars, well-versed in the scriptures, see the height of devotion of the common masses, they stare in blank amazement, like fools. When spiritual aspirants advance along the path of devotion, but do not develop the resultant <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> force sufficiently to attain the status of non-attributional devotion, they attain a stage of devotion called <i>ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga bhakti</i> [&ldquo;attributional devotion&rdquo;]. <!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is an ism? An ism develops when there is correlated physical and psychic parallelism among time, space and person. An ism cannot thrive in the absence of parallelism among time, space and person. A particular ism may be appropriate for some people or for some country, but it cannot be accepted by all people for all time to come.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ism and the Nature of Movement<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Nothing is static in this universe &ndash; everything is progressing, everything is moving on. The relative truth of all these changing realities appears to us as the truth from the perspective of a particular relative time, space and person. In spite of their relative nature, we accept these changing realities as true. In the material world forward movement and inertia come directly from the creative will of the Macrocosm, although there is nothing absolutely inert in this manifest universe. If anything inert or completely lacking in momentum exists, it will be obvious that the Macrocosmic creative will has ceased to function. The Macrocosmic creative will is the prime factor in creation, and its absence would indicate absolute cessation. Movement is all-pervading and multidirectional. It can flow in any direction. The universe can move in any direction according to the will of the Macrocosm, but under no circumstances can the universe be static, because there is nothing static in the Macrocosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Wherever there is movement it is related to time, space and person. A particular movement related to a specific time, space and person cannot tally with another movement belonging to a different time, space and person. When the movement of a particular time, space and person maintains parallelism of similar movement related to a particular physical and mental wave, the resultant is called an "ism". Therefore, when there is a change in either the physical or mental wave or both, the validity of a particular ism is lost due to the change in the time, space or person in which it was accepted. An ism may be accepted in a particular mental wave, but if due to a change in the physical wave the mental wave fails to maintain parallelism, the result will be that that particular ism will be considered [obsolete]. If anybody tries to re-establish an old political, economic or religious theory of two thousand years ago &ndash; a theory or ism based on past time, space or person &ndash; using whatever type of psychology, sentiment or adroit propaganda, it will not be possible to correlate it with the existing physical waves. Once lost the parallelism between the ism and the physical wave cannot be restored, even if the old mental environment is re-created. We perceive the change not only in the physical wave but also in the mental wave. No amount of scientific effort will make it possible to restore the mental wave of the past. There was a time when kings were worshipped as the incarnations of God, but today if anybody tries to reintroduce this antiquated practice using psychological propaganda, it will be impossible for people to accept it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Movement always expresses itself through waves. If in a given situation a particular wave is accelerated with excessive exuberance and as a result the next crest cannot be formed, expansion and contraction will still occur, although this movement falls outside the range of perception of the sensory organs. In order to accelerate the speed of a mental or physical wave, it is necessary to straighten it. Once the wave becomes maximally straight, the [acceleration] appears to be static. The straightness increases the velocity of the movement. From the curvature of the waves we try to determine the speed, pause [and] straightness [of] a uni-directional wave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[The speed varies with variation in the curvature of the wave. The speed varies inversely with the curvature.] That is, when the [curvature of the wave increases (the crest becomes higher)] the velocity decreases, and when the curvature becomes straighter the velocity increases. An ism or superstition cannot take form in the presence of a mental wave which is increasing in speed. Superstition can only be injected when the mental speed is reduced. It is easy to catch hold of a static object, but catching a moving object is an altogether different matter. Therefore, to be free from the shackles of superstition one has to keep moving ahead, otherwise it will not be possible to progress. To free oneself from the bondage of superstition it is essential to accelerate the mental speed, and one has to repeat the process progressively.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In general urban people are immune to superstition or less superstitious than others because they have to face comparatively more intellectual struggle. So they are intellectually more alert. Superstition takes deep root where there is staticity, but it is very difficult to inject superstition into scientifically-oriented minds because they are moving with comparatively greater velocity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Isms and the Eight Fetters<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The sentient, mutative and static forces are equally active in the contraction and expansion of movement. The ascending part of a wave is dominated by the mutative force and the descending part is dominated by the static force. At the optimum point of expansion and the optimum point of contraction the sentient force and the static force respectively dominate. The final [trough] of contraction brings with it the extreme static pause, [and the final crest of expansion brings with it the extreme sentient pause.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In fact, the sentient pause is no pause at all. As it is beyond the scope of sensory perception, the speed appears to be a state of pause. The expansive movement indicates progress towards optimum expression of the sentient force. It is therefore dominated by <i>Vidya&#x301;</i> [introversial force], and its extreme speed is embedded in the Macrocosm. In the same way, contractive movement is dominated by <i>Avidya&#x301;</i> [extroversial force], and at its extreme limit it is embedded in the ultimate static point.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The contractive movement at its extreme point or point of apparent pause is expressed by the <i>as&#x301;t&#x301;a pa&#x301;sha</i> [eight fetters]: <i>ghrn&#x301;a&#x301;</i> [hatred], <i>shaun&#x32D;ka&#x301;</i> [doubt], <i>bhaya</i> [fear], <i>lajja&#x301;</i> [shyness], <i>jugups&#x301;a</i> [dissemblance], <i>kula</i> [vanity of lineage], <i>shiila</i> [cultural superiority complex] and <i>ma&#x301;na</i> [egotism]. These eight fetters are created by the static state of mind, and [subsequently] the mind depends on these fetters in the course of its expansion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->These eight fetters supply the vital energy to isms or superstition. Isms, such as nationalism, casteism, provincialism, communalism, etc., create hatred and destroy human integrity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The eight fetters also generate dissonance [doubt] and suspicion in the subtle layers of the mind, although they are not generally expressed in external behaviour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It is isms which are responsible for creating distrust [fear] between social groups. Hindus generally do not trust Muslims and vice versa, as both believe in their respective isms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Shyness is also closely associated with isms. When a particular nation, caste, province or group is afraid of losing its prestige, the people in the group feel ashamed, and in that state of mind they do not hesitate to resort to ignoble means in order to save the prestige of their nation, caste, group, etc. People also behave in artificial ways for the sake of the prestige of an ism &ndash; ways that do not correspond to their internal feelings. Isms have such an influence over the human mind that even if a person has been defeated through logic or reason, he or she refuses to accept the defeat. People therefore have to wrench their minds free from the serpentine shackles of isms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Dissemblance is merely the endeavour to prevent an internal urge from gaining external expression. If a Vaishnava, who is supposed to be a strict vegetarian, is tempted to eat meat, he or she will try to suppress his or her desire in order to maintain the prestige of Vaishnavism. He or she adopts an expression [as if he or she is] unwilling to eat meat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Isms are also created around vanity of lineage. This is perhaps exemplified by the caste supremacy of the Brahmans, Saiyads and Pathans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The vanity of lineage is associated with the cultural superiority complex also. That is, the supremacy of any particular culture is dependent on an ism. Although according to perfect logic the culture of all humanity is one and indivisible, the exponents of isms do not understand this. They prefer to assert that the different sets of script and language, behaviour and habit, and local variations in expression, are actually the constituents of human culture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The supporters of political isms do not even hesitate to commit heinous acts for the sake of their ism. In the medieval period communalism dragged humanity to the nadir of degradation. Incredibly, a few people in the twentieth century still try to revive medieval communal feelings. Today people who make a habit of delivering high-sounding lectures do not hesitate to form unholy alliances with antisocial elements for the sake of their ism. We can therefore say without any doubt that they are under the evil influence of the static force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..20"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Ideology<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->So, what is people&#146;s duty? The existence of the physical body is relative because it is made of <i>pain&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;ta</i> [the five fundamental factors]. The protoplasmic cells of the body are in a constant state of flux of birth and death, so how can we say that the physical body is a permanent structure? The mundane universe is as relative as the physical body. The ultimate reality is <i>Brahma</i> [the Supreme Entity], but one has to maintain adjustment with the mundane universe. The pursuit of mundane experiences cannot be the goal of one&#146;s life; if it is, it will definitely vitiate one&#146;s value as a human being. We cannot take a comet or a meteor as the goal of life; if by chance somebody does, the comet or meteor will go out of sight within a short span of time because its relative velocity is greater than that of the earth. That is, it will no longer remain the goal of that person&#146;s life. If somebody says that the place where the cows are grazing is to the north, what will happen if those cows move to the east? Are we to accept the east as north? From this it is clear that no changing reality can be accepted as the goal of one&#146;s life. To recognize north we have to know the position of the polestar, because although the polestar changes its place, it always appears to be in the north in relation to the earth. So no changing reality can be taken as being the ideology of one&#146;s life, because it falls within the scope of time, space and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The supreme ideology is that which is impersonal and beyond the scope of time and space. It is not something personal like Ram, Shyam, Jadu, Madhu, etc. The Impersonal Entity is the supreme ideology. Only those who accept this Entity as their object of ideation can escape the inevitable consequences of degradation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->No social, political or economic ism can solve people&#146;s problems for an indefinite period of time, because there may be conflicting isms in the same place under varying conditions of time and person. Similarly, it is not prudent to presume that an ism which is successful in any one country at a particular time will be applauded by the people of some other country at the same time. Thus we see that no ism, but rather only the Supreme Reality, can be the ideology of human beings. The endeavour of humanity should be the achievement of the supreme ideology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The unit mind is also a changing entity, so it cannot be the object of ideation either. If people take any entity except the Supreme Reality as their object of ideation, we can take it for granted that people are giving indulgence to an ism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Many people worship their motherland as a goddess, and sometimes they even erect an idol of their motherland, but one should have sufficient wisdom to understand that service to the motherland cannot be the supreme goal of human life because the concept of the motherland is a changing reality. The motherland of today may be submerged under the sea tomorrow. For example, in the prehistoric past Gondwanaland became submerged under the Indian Ocean. So, the territorial jurisdiction of a country, province or district may change in the future. Therefore the worship of the motherland is not the worship of the Supreme Reality, and it is unwise to fight a violent war on the issue of territorial jurisdiction and thus disturb the peace. The inhabitants of the countries involved should, in a better way, find a mutual settlement of such issues.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Service should always be for the sake of service [i.e., should be selfless]. It should be a part of <i>Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;</i>, Cosmic ideation. As long as people live in the country of their birth] they should serve that country, because when they have a direct relationship with the land [they have a great opportunity to do maximum service]. But this should not be misconstrued to mean that they should only serve their motherland and not other countries. If people go to another country, they may get more scope to render service in that new country, and may not get as much chance to serve their original country as they would have if they had remained there. In this connection let me repeat once again that service itself is not an ideology &ndash; <i>Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;</i> is the real ideology. Service to humanity is a part of <i>Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;</i>. I am also of the opinion that no ism can save humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Wise people regard the Supreme Entity as the supreme ideology and march ahead maintaining adjustment with time, space and person. They always think that <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> [Supreme Consciousness] is their Father, <i>Parama&#x301; Prakrti</i> [Supreme Operative Principle] is their Mother, and the entire universe is their homeland. It is not bad to love the land of one&#146;s birth or to feel grateful that one was born in a particular country. But if, under the influence of any ism, one feels hatred for others, this type of patriotism is definitely harmful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Consciousness is the fundamental subjectivity. It cannot be the object of human beings. It is the multiple of all the multiplicities, the collective of all the collectivities. To be one with <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> means to convert oneself into His object, to surrender one&#146;s subjectivity into His subjectivity. On this path one has to transform the five fundamental factors into the objective mind, convert the objective mind into the subjective mind, and finally surrender the subjective mind into the Supreme Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The supporters of isms do not believe in the Supreme Consciousness; therefore they can be correctly termed heretics. Those who do not accept Him act out of ignorance. They do not understand that the universe is His crude manifestation. Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, the so-called untouchables, ants and the totality of human beings are all His manifestations. The followers of isms foolishly consider themselves to be God&#146;s chosen people [because of their mental fetters], and they do not hesitate to brand others as non-Aryans, kafirs [infidels] or heathens, in utter [rejection]. They think that the Supreme Father bestows His grace only on them, not on the rest of creation. They are not prepared to understand that those they call non-Aryans, kafirs, heathens or <i>mlecchas</i> are also part of His manifestation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->For those who have taken the Supreme Consciousness as their only object of ideation, the whole creation appears to be His manifestation. They feel that if they do not regard all other human beings as their brothers and sisters, they will be disregarding the Father, and when the Father is not respected, the relation between the members of the family will break down. So people will have to believe in universal fraternity before they can fully accept the Supreme Consciousness.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
