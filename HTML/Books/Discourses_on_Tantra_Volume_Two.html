<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The many features of Tantra which distinguish it from other spiritual traditions make definition difficult within a short space. But if we are to focus on the single most characteristic of Tantra&#146;s distinguishing features, surely that must be the spirit of fight. Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti has said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The main characteristic of Tantra is that it represents human vigour. It represents a pactless fight. Where there is no fight there is no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Under such circumstances Tantra cannot be there, where there is no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, no fight. It is an impossibility to conquer a crude idea and to replace it by a subtle idea without a fight. It is not at all possible without sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Hence, Tantra is not only a fight, it is an all-round fight. (&ldquo;Tantra and Its Effect on Society&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Tantra finds or creates circumstances designed expressly to bring out, rather than to intern away, one&#146;s problematic mental tendencies. &ldquo;A practitioner of Tantra becomes elevated and attains mastery over a hostile environment. Tantra does not accept the teaching of the Vedas that human beings should move internally, and carefully avoid any association with their environment.&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Fundamental Difference between Veda and Tantra&rdquo;) So only if a spiritual path at some stage deliberately seeks out fearful, demoralizing or tempting circumstances in order to fight and overcome them by Cosmic ideation and by trust in the guru, does it deserve to be called Tantric.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is not only an external or internal fight, it is simultaneously both. The internal fight is a practice of the subtler portion of Tantra. The external fight is a fight of the cruder portion of Tantra. And the fight both external and internal is a fight in both ways at once. So practice in each and every stratum of life receives due recognition in Tantra.&#8230; The practice for raising the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is the internal sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Tantra, while shattering the bondages of hatred, suspicion, fear, shyness, etc., by direct action is the external sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. (&ldquo;Effect&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Both the &ldquo;internal fight&rdquo; and the &ldquo;external fight&rdquo; refer to the fight against internal enemies &ndash; but the latter uses external means to intensify the fight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The very first night that a Tantric goes to the burial ground, he is stricken with fear.&#8230; But when he returns home after finishing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the mind is much lighter than before. When he goes out for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the next night, he is much less fearful. And thus the Tantric steadily and slowly overcomes fear. This is the applied process of Tantra which will help the practitioner overcome all instincts. (&ldquo;Fundamental Difference&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Though practices such as that of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in a burial ground may be the clearest instances of techniques designed to bring to the surface one&#146;s mental propensities, such practices are not required of all Tantrics. But all Tantrics are brought face to face with their weaknesses in one way or other. A Tantric guru assigns to his disciples tremendous responsibilities for social change. The disciples&#146; participation in an activist movement aimed at a just and spiritually-based society forces them to confront sometimes physical fear, but more routinely the fear of social censure and the fear of the overwhelming task before them. The inferiority complex is the most debilitating fear which most of us must learn to overcome in our lives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Tantra advises, &ldquo;Jump into your environment without the least hesitation. Don&#146;t be afraid. Fear will leave you step by step. Tomorrow you will not be as fearful as you are today, the day after you will be even less fearful, and ten days from now you&#146;ll notice that you are completely fearless.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Fundamental Difference&rdquo;)<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Out of the tremendous number of darshans, or discourses, which A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rtijii gave on a great range of subjects during thirty-seven years as preceptor of Ananda Marga, a great many have been carefully preserved in published form and/or on tape. We have drawn on this wealth for the present collection by first assembling all the discourses or sections thereof which related to the topic of Tantra; and by then electing to include all but those few discourses (all related to this part, on The Nature and Practice of Tantra) which were found to contain only topics already covered in other discourses. Though the subject matter may be virtually the same, each discourse will be found to have its own special appeal, and we recommend these discourses to readers, though regrettably they could not be included here:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, Viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, and Divya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra&rdquo; in Notes on Spiritual Philosophy. &ldquo;Theory and Practice&rdquo; in A Few Problems Solved 6. &ldquo;A&#x301;gama and Nigama&rdquo; in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam 2. &ldquo;The Requirements for Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;&rdquo; in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam 3. &ldquo;The Minimum Qualifications for a Sa&#x301;dhaka&rdquo; in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam 4. &ldquo;Pashupati, Viireshvara, and Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo; in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam 5. &ldquo;Where Is Va&#x301;ra&#x301;n&#x301;asii?&rdquo; in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam 7. &ldquo;Shiva&#146;s Seven Secrets&rdquo; in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam 12. &ldquo;Seven Secrets&rdquo; in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam 14. &ldquo;Veda Tatha&#x301; Tantra&rdquo; [&ldquo;Veda and Tantra&rdquo;] in Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha Part 13. &ldquo;Some Important Questions and Answers&rdquo; (some of the Q & A on pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, and divya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra) in Notes on Spiritual Philosophy. &ldquo;Aghora&rdquo; in Varn&#x301;a Vicitra&#x301; [Various Uses of Letters] 2. &ldquo;A&#x301;gama&rdquo; in Varn&#x301;a Vicitra&#x301; 2. &ldquo;Ekendriya &ndash; 1&rdquo; (a part covers the etymology of tantra) in Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell 6. &ldquo;The Speciality of the Fifth Fundamental Principle of Prout&rdquo; (a part relates to Bhaeravii cakra) in A Few Problems Solved 9.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Within each of the four parts of Discourses on Tantra, the articles are in chronological order.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate here &ndash; in addition to the original language of each speech, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if other than in this book, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In the cases of some of the discourses published here, no written record was found of the language in which the discourse was given; but if the language could be clearly inferred from the location and other circumstances of the discourse, we have cited that language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In all cases where a tape was in existence for a discourse given in English, we have re-edited the published discourse with reference to that tape. The retranslations (from the original Bengali) of &ldquo;The Intuitional Science of Tantra&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prapatti, Vipratti, and Aprapatti&rdquo; were also carried out with reference to the tapes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Wherever it is noted below that there was more than one existing translation of the same discourse, all the existing translations have been consulted in preparing the discourse for this edition. All retranslations (&ldquo;retr.&rdquo;) that were done took all possible material from existing translations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The abbreviation &ldquo;DMC&rdquo; sometimes appears at the end of a discourse. Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra was a special spiritual gathering addressed by the preceptor, or guru. The abbreviation &ldquo;RU&rdquo; at the end of a discourse indicates that the discourse constituted a Presidential speech to Renaissance Universal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the editors have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Eds.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The important early discourse &ldquo;Tantra and Its Effect on Society&rdquo; was given in Hindi, and translated soon thereafter into the English version that appears in this book. That original Hindi can no longer be found.  Because the author used English terms infrequently in the early years, translators often rendered Sanskrit terms into English in a way that was at variance with the author&#146;s preferences as they later came to be known. With this discourse, it was therefore found necessary to provide the preferred renderings, indicating the changes in square brackets.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->It was frequently the author&#146;s practice, in the case of discourses given in a language other than Bengali, to personally review the Bengali translation and to make revisions and additions. Wherever this appeared to have been done, the editors have taken the Bengali version as the basis for the English translation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The cover of the book shows the Bhuvaneshvarii Yantra. The upright and inverted triangles are an ancient Tantric design, also to be found in the Ananda Marga pratiika. (The  yantra and the pratiika should not, however, be confused. For an example of the Ananda Marga pratiika, please see the title page.)<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today I would like to discuss mata and patha [opinions regarding the Supreme, and paths to the Supreme]. Mata means a certain style of thought, so we have to see where the action of thinking originates, develops, and culminates; and we have to see on what the action of thinking depends. When someone says, &ldquo;It&#146;s my opinion, my personal view,&rdquo; where does the action of thinking lie and how does it take place? Thinking depends on the unit mind; it originates in the unit mind and is maintained in the unit mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the absolute sense what is the unit mind? The Cosmic Mind reaches a state of maximum crudification through sain&#x32D;cara [the phase of extroversial movement], and thereafter starts returning to Its original abode through pratisain&#x32D;cara [the phase of introversial movement]. The small &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling that gradually develops within crude matter is called the unit mind. Although the Macrocosmic Mind is the Supreme Controller of everything in this universe, It does delegate a certain degree of control to unit minds as they increase in complexity in the phase of pratisain&#x32D;cara. Therefore the unit mind can be called a primary sub-centre in a physical structure within the Macrocosmic Mind. Unit minds have to act within the periphery of time, place, and person, as created by the Macrocosm, and their different styles of action are called mata [opinions]. Just as the unit mind is dependent on time, place and person for its creation, maintenance and annihilation, each of its expressions also depends on a particular time, place and person. This is why opinion carries its highest value in a particular time, place, or individual, and loses its value, or becomes altogether non-existent, when any of these three relative factors changes. Opinions do have some value in both individual and collective life. But when one is dealing with the Absolute Entity, who transcends the boundaries of time, place and person, does one&#146;s opinion have any value? No, in this case an individual opinion has no value whatsoever. Thus the statement Yata mata, tata patha<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is not logically tenable. An opinion held by a particular individual or group regarding the social sphere, the economic sphere, or the political sphere does have some value, but to attempt to express an opinion concerning the absolute sphere would be simply ludicrous.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->An opinion is a psychic object. An opinion of a particular person is, in effect, an object of the object of the Cognitive Faculty [the objects of the Cognitive Faculty are minds and the objects of minds are opinions]. So how can an opinion become the subject of the Supreme Subjectivity? How can it know the Knower of the known? One&#146;s opinion in this regard has no value &ndash; for anyone to have an independent opinion about Parama Purus&#x301;a is meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Regarding Parama Purus&#x301;a the unit mind can do only one thing: become one with Him as the Supreme Subject. The unit mind must accept Parama Purus&#x301;a as its object, and run towards Him. Even this proposition is illogical in the absolute sense. Rather it should be said that the unit mind will have to return to its own subject. This should be the only movement, movement towards the Parama&#x301;gati [literally, the &ldquo;Supreme Terminus where the movement, or journey, of finite entities culminates&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Thus a unit mind may hold many opinions about the mundane world, but no opinion regarding the spiritual world. The path which leads to supreme bliss is a singular one; there is no second path. The path is one, and only one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If this universe is considered as a circle, its nucleus is the blissful Purus&#x301;ottama to which every point on the circumference is connected. If any microcosm located on any point of the circumference wants to reach the Nucleus, he or she will have to move with Cosmic ideation, floating on the divine waves of bliss. From no matter what point on the circumference one measures the distance to the Nucleus, that radius will always be the same. This radius is termed the a&#x301;nanda ma&#x301;rga [the path of bliss]. So the a&#x301;nanda ma&#x301;rga is the only ma&#x301;rga. The spiritual path has nothing to do with the opinions of any particular individual or of any group of individuals, because Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; cannot be attained by opinions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The Three Stages of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga there are three particular stages of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; which can be fused into one, or can remain separate: Sha&#x301;kta, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;aviiya, and Shaeva. True spiritual practice is a happy combination of these three stages. In endeavouring to reach the Nucleus of the Cosmic Cycle from any point on the circumference, one must develop each stage, for each has an equal importance. To understand Ananda Marga one has to understand the significance of the three stages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Who is a Sha&#x301;kta? A Sha&#x301;kta is one who is determined to awaken his or her cognitive faculty and fight against the negative influence of the static principle. Such a person struggles ceaselessly against psychic impurities and physical ailments in individual life, and against social evils and economic disparity in collective life. A Sha&#x301;kta is not afraid of the crushing load of unhappiness in life, and never surrenders to pessimism, but fights against the miseries of life with revolutionary zeal. This is the criterion of a Sha&#x301;kta. Such dauntless fighting spirit wins the laurels of victory for a Sha&#x301;kta one day, a victory which is never possible through coaxing and cajoling. Of course, as a war strategy, there can be a temporary truce, but nothing more than that.<!-- /block --></p>

Shiva objected to her going and tried all He could to dissuade her, but in vain. Sati went to her father&#146;s house. Up to here in the story, Prakrti has been dominant, and Purus&#x301;a dormant, as is the case with a microcosm in bondage.<!-- /block --></p>

Totally absorbed in His own self, He placed the dead body of Sati on his shoulder and began to move throughout the universe.

So Prakrti suffered immense hardship to attain Purus&#x301;a, but Purus&#x301;a remained totally indifferent.

They do not make a hair-splitting analysis regarding fight or non-fight, for they know they will remain absorbed in the Cosmic flow of bliss for eternity.

In liila&#x301;bha&#x301;va the sa&#x301;dhakas&#146; entire existences become vibrated with the vibrations of the Cosmic dance, causing them to burst out in dance, laughter, tears  and song. But in nitya&#x301;nanda there is no such expression as this. Purus&#x301;ottama [the Nucleus Consciousness] is the supreme source of the countless forms and flows that emanate during liila&#x301;bha&#x301;va; but His own stance is nityabha&#x301;va [eternal and unchangeable].

<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The Course of Physical and Psychic Development<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The more that unit beings advance towards the Supreme Being, the more their physical and psychic bodies (which are made of Macrocosmic stuff) advance from crude to subtle. In the first phase of Macrocosmic imagination, the Cognitive Faculty moves from subtle to crude. One atom or particle comes in closer proximity to another atom or particle. The name of this process is sain&#x32D;cara. And when these particles begin to drift away from each other or become powdered down, thus going beyond the scope of sense perception, it is called the process of pratisain&#x32D;cara. When an object becomes more condensed it should be understood that the Macrocosmic mind-stuff is decreasing its inter-molecular gaps. This causes an object to gradually come within the periphery of sense perception. When there comes to be a high degree of diversity in the structure of the condensed object, it requires a self-activated psychic factor for its preservation, maintenance and destruction. This psychic entity (the mind) is created as a result of clash due to inter-molecular proximity. Thus it can be said that mind emerges as a result of clash within the material structure. But it must not be forgotten that matter is nothing but a condensed state of Macrocosmic mind-stuff. What we call matter is not crude matter as such, but a metamorphosed form of Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The unit mind finds its expression through clash. This process of clash causes the psychic atoms to get powdered down and expanded to such a degree that the mind expands into the universe, transcending the limits of the small &ldquo;I&rdquo;. This continous unfoldment and expansion of the mind through constant clash and cohesion is brought about mainly by Prakrti. The unit mind finds natural problems which it must solve, such as procuring food, finding accommodation, and rearing children &ndash; not to mention simply staying alive. The more difficult these obstacles are, the more scope the mind gets to unfold. The struggle to overcome obstacles is the primary factor in the development of the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->But there is also a secondary factor, and that is the influence of a more-developed mind on a less-developed mind. Domestic animals such as dogs and cats get ample scope for accelerated development due to their contact with the human mind. The company of human beings often accelerates their progress more than do the natural forces which present them with obstacles to overcome. So if a dog&#146;s mind can develop into a monkey&#146;s mind, and a monkey&#146;s mind into a human mind, in the normal course of evolution, then a dog that is in constant contact with a human being may experience a tremendous intellectual growth and be reborn as a human being, bypassing the stage of a monkey. Such galloping changes do take place in the process of animate evolution; and comparatively undeveloped creatures, if advantaged with human contact, can establish themselves in human form in a shorter period than can comparatively developed creatures deprived of human contact.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->When a microcosm reaches a stage of expanded consciousness, having made considerable psychic progress due to natural clashes or due to contact with more-developed minds, and is able to control the psychic propensities as opposed to being subservient to them, it is called manus&#x301;ya [human being]. The term manus&#x301;ya, or ma&#x301;nus&#x301;a, means &ldquo;mind-preponderant being&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->With the development of the mind, the physical structure becomes more complex. It can be put in another way: the physical structure grows in complexity in order to serve as a proper vehicle for the expression of a developed mind. When the psychic activities are channelized in different directions or engaged in combatting various obstacles, the brain, the medium of the mind, is bound to become more complex.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Similarly, undeveloped human beings can make rapid psychic progress due to natural clashes or due to contact with great personalities. The greater the application of psychic energy to a unit being, the more its physical stuff is transformed into mind-stuff. This helps it attain greater psychic expansion, and consequently the greater reflection of Cosmic Consciousness on the unit mental plate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Unit beings have attained a human body after evolving from the stage of animality through structures of ever-increasing complexity.

If they continue to allow mean thoughts to dominate their minds, they will degenerate to the even cruder stage of inert matter, becoming bricks, stone or wood. Just as animals have no scope to elevate their thoughts or practise spirituality, similarly human beings who make their minds animal-like through animalistic thinking are unable to pursue spiritual practices. Even after receiving spiritual initiation or receiving an education, they behave like ignorant fools. But those who are by mentality undeveloped human beings, but not animals, will if they receive initiation carry on spiritual practices, and will if they receive education behave like intelligent people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Spiritual initiation and education will bring about mental development in those who have degenerated to the level of animality, but it will be next to impossible for them to develop spiritually.

If we remember this fact, if we work for the well-being of all, then undeveloped human beings will be able to develop their spiritual potentiality when they come in contact with us.

Even those whom society respects as intelligent or learned may, in reality, be no better than &ldquo;polished satans&rdquo;, or what the scriptures call &ldquo;demons&rdquo;.

Original actions are performed under one&#146;s own initiative, and thus one is fully responsible for them. Every original action is a new action. It may represent an extension of the experience of the past, but it is not a reaction. And the actions which human beings are compelled to perform as reactions to their previous actions are called reactive actions.

The reason is that when all original actions are surrendered to Brahma, there remain only the reactive actions. The reactions may be good or bad [according to whether they are resultants of good or bad original actions]. But think about how many of the deeds you performed before coming to the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; were good and how many were bad. To tell the unpleasant truth, ninety-nine percent of your deeds were bad. Hence it is often the case that sa&#x301;dhakas have to suffer much more from bad reactive momenta than get to enjoy good ones. It can even be said that the more one suffers from reactions, the more one is progressing along the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Of course, the requital of the reactive momenta may possibly be pleasurable instead of painful; it all depends upon the nature of one&#146;s actions. In either case, the more one surrenders one&#146;s actions to Brahma, the shorter will be the period of requital caused by the reactions. In this case the intensity of the requital will be greater than normal; but this is a good sign, because intense requital means the exhaustion of the requital within a short period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Suppose you have incurred a loan of a thousand rupees.

But if you want to free yourself from the debt quickly, you will have to pay a larger amount every month, which will obviously cause more suffering. Likewise, if one does not feel the need to be freed of one&#146;s reactive momenta quickly, one can undergo less affliction, but then one may have to wait ten or twenty lives to exhaust all the reactive momenta. Moreover, within those ten or twenty lives one will probably undergo psychic degeneration, and due to one&#146;s mean actions imbibe new reactive momenta.<!-- /block --></p>

Of the three, the Sha&#x301;kta sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the most important, because it is the initial stage of the microcosm&#146;s journey towards the Macrocosm. Progress on this journey is made through pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra yoga. As all spiritual aspirants are aware, the goal of pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, and dhya&#x301;na is the attainment of sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra is the conscious endeavour to withdraw the mind from mundane qualities and attractions &ndash; easier said than done!

<a name="2..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra has four stages: yatama&#x301;na, vyatireka, ekendriya and vashiika&#x301;ra. Yatama&#x301;na is a conscious effort to transcend the negative influence of the propensities. Suppose you see one of your colleagues taking a bribe, and think, &ldquo;Had I not been an Ananda Margi I could have also earned some extra money in this way.&rdquo; This shows that your propensity of greed is not fully controlled, but as you are keen to control it, you have adopted the Ananda Marga way of life. For this conscious effort on your part, you deserve the appellation yatama&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->In vyatireka, the second stage, some propensities may be controlled at one time, but uncontrolled at another time. Or a person may control physical desire, but suffer from an increase in anger; or may become free from greed for money but will develop a strong desire for name and fame. After delivering an eloquent lecture he or she will say, &ldquo;All the credit goes to Brahma. It is only by His grace that I could deliver such a lecture,&rdquo; but in his or her heart will think, &ldquo;What an excellent speech I gave today.&rdquo; This is called vyatireka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->In the ekendriya stage, the propensities are brought under control, no doubt, but not permanently. In order to exhaust the reactive momenta the propensities sometimes strongly assert themselves, causing one to repent as a result. (Ask yourself whether or not you have experienced this sort of mental torture.) Hence this stage does not represent complete pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra either, because the pa&#x301;shas and ripus [fetters and enemies of the mind] are not totally controlled.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->The pa&#x301;shas and ripus assert themselves through the medium of the mind and the indriyas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn8"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn8">8</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> If even one indriya remains uncontrolled, it should be concluded that there is still a worm in the flower of the mind; and a worm-eaten flower cannot be offered to the Lord. Only when all the indriyas are fully controlled can it be said that the mind is under the complete control of the a&#x301;tman [unit consciousness]. This is real pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra, or vashiika&#x301;ra siddhi, for it means Prakrti has merged into the Supreme Cognitive Principle. This is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asharan&#x301;a [taking the shelter of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a] in devotional psychology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The importance of pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is immense, because it involves a harmonious blending of knowledge, devotion and action. In this sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the Sha&#x301;kta bha&#x301;va finds its consummation, and the latent devotion starts sprouting. This sprout ultimately develops into the highest Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava bha&#x301;va. Shaeva bha&#x301;va is the path of knowledge. So in social life there is a great need for Sha&#x301;ktas and Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas. The pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra yoga with which a Sha&#x301;kta starts rendering service to the world reaches its consummation in the perfect and total service of the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava. Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra begins with vigorous action and culminates in selfless devotion.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn2">2</a></b>)  In this chapter the author&#146;s focus is psychological: the author discusses the different mentalities characteristic of Sha&#x301;ktas, of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas and of Shaevas. From a philosophical point of view, the different recognized schools of the Hindu tradition &ndash; five in all, known as the Paincopa&#x301;sana&#x301; &ndash; are distinguished on the basis of their different deities, or objects of meditation. In Shaeva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra (Shiva Cult) one&#146;s object of meditation is Shiva. In Sha&#x301;kta&#x301;ca&#x301;ra it is one of the representations of Shakti, or Prakrti. In Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava&#x301;ca&#x301;ra it is Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u. In Saora&#x301;ca&#x301;ra it is Su&#x301;rya (the sun or the sun god), and in Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra it is Gan&#x301;apati (Ganes&#x301;a). In all the cults, the more subtle practitioners understand that their particular deity is a representation of the infinite Brahma. &ndash;Eds</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn3">3</a></b>)  The story goes that King Daksha&#146;s main purpose in staging the sacrificial ritual was to humiliate Shiva, for he never forgave Shiva for marrying Sati against his wishes. When Sati realized this, and saw that her pleas to stop the harsh vilification of Shiva were falling on deaf ears, she threw herself into the fire. Shiva received immediate news and rushed to the spot to try to save her from being totally consumed by the flames. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn4">4</a></b>)  I.e., the two experiences, nitya&#x301;nanda and nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi, are no more different from each other than are the two bha&#x301;vas, or stances, from which the two experiences respectively come. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn5">5</a></b>)  Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, karma and bhakti are forms of spiritual practice which emphasize, respectively, discrimination, selfless action, and devotion. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn6">6</a></b>)  Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, dhya&#x301;na and sama&#x301;dhi are the last four limbs of as&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;ga [eight-limbed] yoga. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn7">7</a></b>)   Offering of mental colours to the Lord, also known as Guru pu&#x301;ja&#x301;.  &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn8">8</a></b>)   An indriya is a sensory or motor organ, together with its respective nerves, nerve fluid, and site in the brain. &ndash;Eds</p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is Tantra? The process of transforming [latent divinity] into the Supreme Divinity is known as Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The sleeping divinity in animality is termed, in the language of spiritual aspirants, the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii. So we find that actually the spirit of Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; lies in infusing a [vibration] in the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii and pushing her up towards the spiritual goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The significance of the term tantra is &ldquo;liberation from bondage [the bondage of dullness, or staticity]&rdquo;. The letter ta is the seed [sound] of dullness. And the root verb trae suffixed by d&#x301;a becomes tra, which means &ldquo;that which liberates&rdquo; &ndash; so the spiritual practice which liberates the aspirant from the dullness or animality of the static force and expands the aspirant&#146;s [spiritual] self is Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. So there cannot be any spiritual practice without Tantra. Tantra is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Spiritual practice means practice for expansion, and this expansion is nothing but a liberation from the bondage of all sorts of dullness [or staticity]. A person who, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, aspires for spiritual expansion or does something concrete, is a Tantric. Tantra in itself is neither a religion nor an ism. Tantra is a fundamental spiritual science. So wherever there is any spiritual practice it should be taken for granted that it stands on the Tantric cult. Where there is no spiritual practice, where people pray to God for the fulfilment of narrow worldly desires, where people&#146;s only slogan is &ldquo;Give us this and give us that&rdquo; &ndash; only there do we find that Tantra is discouraged. So only those who do not understand Tantra, or even after understanding Tantra do not want to do any spiritual practice, oppose the cult of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The factors behind their repulsion from sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; are two in number. The first is what is known as the psychology of spiritual inertness, and the second is a sort of phobia. The spiritual phobia is the greatest enemy of human society. This phobia is the main discouraging factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As I was saying, the [acoustic root] ta represents dullness, and the endeavour to liberate one&#146;s self from this dullness is known as Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->At this point I would like to say a few words about the biija mantras [seed sounds, acoustic roots] of Tantra. In this universal arena each and every action has a certain acoustic implication. The fundamental sound that works behind an action is known as the seed of that action. If the different expressions of the Cosmic Self or of the Macrocosm are termed devata&#x301;s, then at the root of every devata&#x301; there lies a particular seed or sound. That particular seed or sound is known as the biija mantra of the devata&#x301; concerned. The will power (biija bindu or ka&#x301;mabiija) of the Cosmic Self, [in] its first expression, takes the form of the na&#x301;da (first expression moving in a straight line). After that the na&#x301;da is converted into kala&#x301; [curvature created under the influence of mutative Prakrti], and the sensible or perceptible manifestations of this kala&#x301; are known as the jagat or &ldquo;world&rdquo;. The spirit of the term jagat is &ldquo;passing show&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So we find that the world, which is an expression of kala&#x301;, comes from the na&#x301;da, and the na&#x301;da comes from the ka&#x301;mabiija, or will force (Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga), of the Great. [Na&#x301;da has the acoustic form of on&#x32D;m.] This on&#x32D;m is the collective form of three seed letters, a, u, and ma, representing creation, preservation and destruction, respectively. So the word on&#x32D;m can properly represent this manifested universe. Through proper analysis we get fifty fundamental sounds, or acoustic roots, from on&#x32D;m &ndash; that is, on&#x32D;m is a collective form of those fifty sounds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Every worldly action is expressed through activating waves having the potentialities of those fundamental sounds as their nuclei. The potentiality of a particular sound or the potentialities of more than one sound may act as nucleus or nuclei, according to the nature of the action concerned. These fundamental sounds are the creative forces of the universe, so they are known as ma&#x301;trka&#x301; varn&#x301;as [causal matrices]. Whatever exists in the universe is [supported] by a sound of this type.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->One of the things existing in the universe is contraction or dullness. Contraction or dullness is also something worldly. Since it exists, it will certainly have some biija mantra. The biija mantra of this dullness is ta, and the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; that liberates spiritual aspirants from the influence of this ta is Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->There is spiritual force in each and every living entity. The practical interpretation of Tantra is to awaken this spiritual force and expand it, with the one objective of unifying it with the Supreme Divinity. The lowermost portion of the spinal cord is known as kula, [the abode of] Svayambhu&#x301;. It is called kula because it bears the weight of the main physical trunk: ku means &ldquo;creation&rdquo; and la means &ldquo;holder&rdquo; (la&#x301; + da = la). [The abode of] Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, bearing the weight of the main physical trunk, is rightly termed kula.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The unconscious animality residing in this kula in a coiled form, is nothing but the latent divine force. It gets back its original status as soon as its attachment for crude objectivities is removed. Because of its coiled form, this sleeping divine force is known as the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, or the &ldquo;coiled serpentine&rdquo;. So the first and foremost phase of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; lies in awakening the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii from her long hibernation, with the help of a proper wave coming from a great spiritualist [and] with the help of a proper mantra. But for one&#146;s spiritual march, just to awaken her is not sufficient. This awakened kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii must be pushed upwards, and her existence must be suspended in the non-attributed existence of Shiva [Supreme Consciousness]. To suspend the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii in Shiva is the ideal of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Dhya&#x301;yet kun&#x301;d&#x301;aliniim&#x301; suks&#x301;ma&#x301;m&#x301; mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;raniva&#x301;siniim&#x301;<br>Ta&#x301;mis&#x301;t&#x301;a devata&#x301; rupam&#x301; sa&#x301;rdhatri balaya&#x301;nvitam;<br>Koti saoda&#x301;miniibha&#x301;sam&#x301; Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;gavesthita&#x301;m.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[One should meditate on the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii &ndash; residing in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra in a subtle and divine form &ndash; coiled three-and-a-half times &ndash; with the effulgence of a million moons &ndash; wrapped around the Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->There are various glands of various types in the human structure. Each and every gland may be treated as the controlling station of a particular mental [propensity], and the intensity of expression of the mental [propensities] depends on the proper secretion of hormones from these glands. As a general rule hormones secreted from the lower glands cannot influence the upper glands, but they can, directly or indirectly, influence the glands situated at lower points. Since the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra [corresponding to the pineal gland] is the highest cakra, or plexus, hormones secreted by that plexus can control all other glands of the human body. Just now I said that the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is awakened by the force of spiritual waves, or of mantra, and these glands help spiritual aspirants by creating such a force. The sahasra&#x301;ra cakra being the controller of all the glands, it is the central station of all the waves and mantras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In each and every important gland or sub-gland there resides the seed of its expression, that is, a ma&#x301;trka&#x301; varn&#x301;a. So in the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra there [lie the seeds] of all expressions &ndash; that is, all the ma&#x301;trka&#x301; varn&#x301;as are there. The synthetic form of all the ma&#x301;trka&#x301; varn&#x301;as is the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra [on&#x32D;m-sound]. So it is crystal-clear that the potentiality of expression of all the instincts of the human mind lies in the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Human [staticity] can be converted into spirituality or divinity only after arriving at the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra. The lowermost plexus, the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, is the site of crudeness, and the uppermost plexus, the sahasra&#x301;ra, is just the opposite, it is the site of consciousness. So people of animal instinct have no other way, if they want to free themselves from worldly illusions, than to take the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii from the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra to the sahasra&#x301;ra. The inner spirit of raising of the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is for one to control the [propensities] and seed sounds of the different glands and to suspend one&#146;s self in Paramashiva [the Nucleus Consciousness], whose rank is beyond the scope of all the instincts and seed sounds. It is a process of shattering the pa&#x301;shas [bondages] of all mental weaknesses; and after conquering these weaknesses and other mental ripus [enemies], to transform animality into divinity. This sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is a great fight. After establishing oneself above the scope of each and every instinct, idea and seed sound, a sa&#x301;dhaka must go on with his or her fight, with the intention of merging himself or herself into the Supreme Entity which is beyond the arena of the world of ideation. So the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Tantra is a great battle, a sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;samara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The main characteristic of Tantra is that it represents human vigour. It represents a pactless fight. Where there is no fight there is no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Under such circumstances Tantra cannot be there, where there is no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, no fight. It is an impossibility to conquer a crude idea and to replace it by a subtle idea without a fight. It is not at all possible without sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Hence, Tantra is not only a fight, it is an all-round fight. It is not only an external or internal fight, it is simultaneously both. The internal fight is a practice of the subtler portion of Tantra. The external fight is a fight of the cruder portion of Tantra. And the fight both external and internal is a fight in both ways at once.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So practice in each and every stratum of life receives due recognition in Tantra, and the coordination and cooperation of the practices in all strata represents Tantra in its proper perspective. The practice for raising the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is the internal sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Tantra, while shattering the bondages of hatred, suspicion, fear, shyness, etc., by direct action is the external sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. When those who have little knowledge of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; see the style of this external fight, they think that the Tantrics moving in the cremation ground are a sort of unnatural creature. Actually the general public have no understanding of these Tantrics. In the direct fight against the ripus and pa&#x301;shas they may appear to be unnatural for the time being, but one cannot ignore the fact that in wartime every person becomes, to some extent, unnatural in his or her activities.<!-- /block --></p>

A section of the polished intelligentsia, because of their meanness and degraded tastes, misunderstood Tantra and went against its idea. Those who could not understand the inner spirit of the terms madya, ma&#x301;m&#x301;sa, miina [matsya], etc. (known as the Pain&#x32D;camaka&#x301;ra),<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> accepted the crude worldly interpretations of those articles, and their Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; was nothing but an immoral antisocial activity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The process of Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is gradual. But with even a preliminary advancement in this sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, sa&#x301;dhakas attain certain mental and occult powers which make them stronger than the average person in terms of mental and spiritual development. But if in the process sa&#x301;dhakas forget Parama Brahma, the culminating point of all our vital expression, and employ their mental and occult powers to exploit the common mass and to satisfy their lusts, then the demerit lies with those individuals, not with Tantra. If sa&#x301;dhakas remain vigilant and alert regarding the principles of Yama and Niyama, that is, the cardinal moral principles, there is little chance of their degradation. Rather with their developed mental and occult force, they will be in a position to render better service to humanity and to utilize their intellects in a better way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->People can use any of their powers or attainments either for virtue or for vice. If anyone applies his or her potentialities in evil or destructive designs instead of in good ones, then the powers or potentialities are not to be blamed &ndash; all the lapses are lapses of the person. Money can be used in various public welfare projects; yet it can also bring on various socials evils. Swords can be applied to suppress the stupid, but also the gentle. So is the sword or the money responsible for its own good or bad use? Certainly not. It is highly improper to allow the powers attained through Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to become extroversial; it is proper to exercise all these attainments in more complex sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, in the subtler pursuits, so that spiritual obstructions are forced out of the human mind. This spiritual attainment helps the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii to ascend and to merge with, or unify with, Supreme Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Tantra should be utilized only in the subtle field; if applied extroversially, it brings about so much of the crude impact of worldly affairs that the degeneration of a sa&#x301;dhaka becomes unavoidable. The power that is applied by degenerated Tantrics in the s&#x301;a&#x301;t karma<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> of Tantra &ndash; that is, psychically killing, psychically dominating or controlling, stupefying, hypnotizing, etc. &ndash; has, in reality, nothing to do with spirituality. All of these powers are simply mental powers attained through Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. They can be attained even without practising Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, by practising certain mental processes. But then such powers can be successfully applied only against mental weaklings. No endeavour of this sort will find any opening with mentally stronger persons. And none of these actions carries any value for a spiritual sa&#x301;dhaka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->To attain Tantric power one has to practise both external and internal sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; has to stage a fight of both kinds. As a part of the external fight one has to apply a vigorous force or control over his or her worldly conduct and expression, while in the internal fight one has to arouse and to take up his or her kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii against one&#146;s crude thought with all the strength of one&#146;s intuition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The ascent of the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii is brought about through the practice of certain processes. At the sahasra&#x301;ra, or pineal gland, the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii drinks the hormone secreted by that plexus. The biological explanation of this is that the sa&#x301;dhaka attains control over the flow of nectar secreted from the sahasra&#x301;ra (i.e., over a particular hormone secreted from the pineal gland). This flow of nectar is the main support of divine life. During this period of kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; establishing control over the &ldquo;coiled serpentine&rdquo;), sa&#x301;dhakas attain or establish control over the ascent and descent of the [sus&#x301;umna&#x301;] fluid. The mental trends of sa&#x301;dhakas are vitalized by the nectar of the sahasra&#x301;ra &ndash; by this hormone &ndash; and by the well-controlled movement of the [sus&#x301;umna&#x301;] fluid, bringing the sa&#x301;dhakas uncommon sagacity and vigour. The blending of such sagacity and vigour adorns a sa&#x301;dhaka with an attractive personality, with sharp intelligence and with an unparalleled spirit. Only under the sound leadership of such Tantrics can a dharmic social and national life be lived.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->On this path of human advancement from animality to divinity, everybody has a particular position and exerts an influence on society corresponding to that position. Every human being, as a matter of principle, by virtue of being Homo sapiens, certainly has equal rights with others in every walk of life, but Tantra admits specialities to individuals in proportion to their positions on metaphysical strata. Tantra does not recognize any racial, genealogical, political, national or economic differences among human beings, but it does give recognition to individual vigour. The fundamental difference between the Vedic Aryan ideals and the Tantric ideals is that among the Vedic ideals, much importance is granted to racial and clan differences, while in Tantra only the ideal human gets the honour. There is very little scope for spiritual development in the prayerful Aryan religion, and that is why the Aryans who settled in India gradually became influenced by Tantra. The effectiveness of Tantra in developing personality and vigour within a short span of time made Tantra attractive to the Aryans. So in the beginning they started practising Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but with strict secrecy. During the daytime they would remain Aryans with their usual emblems &ndash; shikha&#x301; [sacred hair] and su&#x301;tra [sacred thread] &ndash; but at night they would throw off their upaviita [sacred thread] and caste differences and practise Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in Bhaeravii cakra.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The spirit of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to control the extroversial trends of the mind &ndash; to guide one&#146;s self in a proper way &ndash; so sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and the Tantric cult are synonymous. Ceremonial sacrifices, prayers, and other extroversial rituals are neither Tantra nor sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Every sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; that aims at the attainment of the Supreme, irrespective of its religious affiliation, is definitely Tantra; for Tantra is not a religion, Tantra is simply the science of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; it is a principle. In reality, can anyone stand up in any sphere of life without [sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;]? Can we achieve the honour, the status and the other commodities that we want in this material world without a struggle? And when we consider our aspiration for development and advancement in the mental world &ndash; that cannot be brought about without a struggle either. So everywhere, whether in the crude sphere or in the subtle sphere, struggle is the essence of life. The proper role of human beings lies in [controlling] and harnessing all sorts of crude forces or trends. Thus not only is Tantra an asset in the spiritual world; but even in the most material and crude spheres of life there is no other recourse than to accept Tantric ideals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Those who sparkle and arouse their vigour in the physical and the mental worlds by staging a struggle against crude tendencies become superhuman persons in human frames. Such personalities, adorned with vigour and vitality, receive ovations everywhere. As a matter of fact, whatever may be the social or administrative [system of a country] &ndash; whether it is a democratic republic, or a bureaucracy, or a dictatorship &ndash; only those rule who have [invoked] vigour and personality in themselves. Vigorous personalities always rule the weaklings. If individuals having great personalities and great vigour enter into politics, they become [strong or autocratic leaders], while others bow to their command.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Personalities of intermediate category [in regard to their vigour] do not like to shoulder the responsibilities of a [strong leader]. They carry on their [autocratic leadership] under the safe shelter of a monarchical or republican government (by making the crown or the parliament a puppet in their hand); though it cannot be emphatically stated that democracy succeeds only in countries where people lack vigour. There are many countries where the people do not lack vigour, yet where democracy has claimed success. Of course, this has a political side too. [Autocracy] makes its appearance only in those countries where the people have an ample store of vigour yet where the government has become infested with a high degree of corruption. In England and the United States of America there is no dearth of vigour, yet due to efficient forms of government, democracy has never failed. But in Pakistan and Egypt, because of hopeless and pitiable sorts of governments, the people in general have accepted [autocracy] wholeheartedly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->In this world there are also many countries where there are no honest, sincere leaders in the political sphere and whose governmental body is full of corruption, but where, nevertheless, democracy has not suffered any setback. Anyway, the essence of my comments lies in the fact that even in worldly affairs one&#146;s personality is developed through Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; meets success everywhere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->In this regard, it may be asked whether the [strong leaders] of the world practise any Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or not. To this my answer will be that, perhaps unknowingly, they have always followed Tantric principles. You perhaps know that the great hero of Indian independence, Subhash [Chandra Bose], was an ardent follower of the Tantric cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The caste system is based on the principle of distinctions and differences. This system has constituted the greatest obstruction to the formation of a strong, well-organized, well-knit society. This system does not provide a clue to or a seed of the possibility of unity in diversity. The caste system is recognized by the Vedas only, not by Tantra. In the Tantric cult, although there is cent per cent scope for a person&#146;s all-round development, nevertheless, as human beings, all remain in an equal status. That is why there cannot be any compromise between Tantra and the caste system.<!-- /block --></p>

The deficiencies of Vedic society have in this way inflicted great harm on Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->True Tantrics will certainly allow special honour and recognition for individual potentialities and vigour, but as human beings, all will be equal to them. In the Buddhist Age as well, Tantrics followed this principle. In ancient times, Bengal and Mithila were great seats of Tantra. At that time those who had advanced in Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; those Brahmans, Kayasthas, Vaidyas, etc., who were engaged in the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of raising the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii &ndash; were identified as kuliinas. Those who were supporters of the Vedas (also known as shruti) were recognized as shrotriyas. Though as human beings the kuliinas and the shrotriyas all enjoyed equal status in the then society, the kuliinas used to receive special honour as sa&#x301;dhakas. Ballal Sen, the king of Bengal, was originally a Buddhist Tantric, but later on became a Hindu Tantric.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Tantrics are to stage a fight against all crude forces, a pauseless struggle against inequality and cowardliness. Equality in society cannot be achieved if the [basis of power] is quantitative alone, without any consideration of qualitative value, for today those who do not try to invoke vigour in themselves by sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; far exceed in quantity those who do. So it is not by democracy, but by entrusting power to the true Tantrics, that equality in the economic and social spheres must be established in this material world. The establishment of equality is possible only by Tantrics and not by non-Tantrics. Of course not only in the mental and spiritual arena, but in the material sphere as well, complete or cent per cent equality is an impossibility. So Tantrics have to continue their fight indefinitely. For them where is the opportunity to have a rest?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->To remain satisfied with a little is contrary to human nature. That is why, since the dawn of creation, human beings have been worshipping the Supreme Entity. People longed for supreme knowledge, for indirect and direct spiritual realization. This fundamental human yearning for supreme expansion led people to discover the practical cult of spirituality. Moreover, it created in the human mind the sense of inquisitiveness, the spirit of dedication, and the thirst for knowledge. It is because of these noble qualities that human beings have become what they are today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The divine revelations experienced by the sages of the ancient Vedic age through their meditative vision have been compiled in the Vedas. Thus the Vedas have to some extent quenched the human thirst for intellectual knowledge. But they have not quenched the thirst for supreme knowledge, the fundamental thirst of human life. That thirst can only be quenched through the illuminating realizations of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practice].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is no reliable evidence to suggest that in the Vedic period spiritual knowledge was handed down from preceptor to disciple. As far as we know from the history of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, Lord Shiva was the first to propound it, and He gave this spiritual cult the name Tantra. Tantra is the secret behind spiritual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The scriptural definition of tantra is Tam&#x301; ja&#x301;d&#x301;ya&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah tantrah parikiirttitah [&ldquo;Tantra is that which liberates a person from the bondages of staticity&rdquo;]. Tam&#x301; is the acoustic root of staticity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Tantra has another meaning as well. The Sanskrit root verb tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. So the practical process that leads to one&#146;s expansion and consequent emancipation is called tantra. Thus sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and Tantra are inseparable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Strictly speaking, theoretical knowledge cannot be called Tantra. Tantra is a practical science. Hence in Tantra the importance of book knowledge is secondary. The practical process of Tantra begins with the physical and progresses to the physico-psychic, then to the psycho-spiritual, then ultimately results in [the supreme spiritual stance,] ensconcement in the a&#x301;tma&#x301; [self]. [This scientific process sets it apart from many other schools.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->As the practical aspect is the most important factor in Tantra, the greatest emphasis is placed on the preceptor-disciple relationship. The disciple must do intense spiritual practice to be worthy of the preceptor&#146;s instructions at every stage of development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->And it was for this reason that Sada&#x301;shiva never wanted the Tantric teachings to be written down. However, in course of time, due to a lack of competent preceptors and disciples, Tantra was about to be lost to society. It therefore became an imperative necessity to put the teachings in book form to save them from total extinction. There are presently sixty-four Tantric texts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Tantra is broadly composed of two parts &ndash; nigama and a&#x301;gama.

[Literally, &ldquo;The edge of a razor is very sharp and difficult to walk on.&rdquo;] This path, to walk upon, is like a path strewn with sharp razors. The disciple has to tread the path with extreme caution. The disciple needs the help of the guru [preceptor] at every step. Without this supervision, any defect in the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; as imparted by the guru, or the least negligence on the part of the disciple in following the instructions, inevitably leads to the disciple&#146;s downfall. For success on the path of Tantra, the proper preceptor and the proper disciple are both essential. So the first step in Tantra is the selection of a competent preceptor and a worthy disciple.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The situation can be explained through the following analogy with agriculture: The disciple&#146;s heart is a field; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the ploughing and irrigation of the field; and the preceptor&#146;s initiation is the sowing of seeds. If the seeds are defective they will not sprout; if the field is infertile the harvest will be poor; and even if the seed and the field are ideal, yet the field is not properly ploughed or irrigated, the harvest will be poor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->According to Tantra, disciples are of three categories. The first category are likened to pitchers placed inversely in a tub of water. Such pitchers contain water as long as they are kept in the tub, but as soon as they are taken out, all the water pours out. These disciples acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from the preceptor they forget all his teachings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The second category of disciples are like people who carefully climb a plum tree and pick plums from its thorny branches. Unfortunately they become so absorbed in climbing down the tree that they completely forget about their carefully-collected plums, which fall out of their bags and break open on the ground. Such disciples learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The best category of disciples are like pitchers positioned right side up. When such pitchers are put in a tub of water, there is water both inside them and all around them; and even when they are removed from the tub, they remain full to the brim with water. These disciples carefully preserve in the jewel caskets of their hearts whatever they learn from their preceptor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->According to Tantra there are also three types of preceptor: the inferior, the mediocre, and the superior. Inferior preceptors are those who deliver high-sounding speeches but do not bother about whether the disciples follow their teachings or not. Mediocre preceptors impart knowledge to their disciples, no doubt, and also check on whether the disciples are following their teachings, but they are not too demanding. Superior preceptors, however, take meticulous care to ensure that their disciples follow their teachings. If they discover that their disciples are negligent in any way, they compel them to practise more painstakingly by applying circumstantial pressure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In the Vedic system there is no such strong preceptor-disciple relationship, for Vedic knowledge is completely theoretical.

<a name="4..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The practice of Tantra can be divided into several stages. Everyone has his or her own individual sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, and there is no denying that at the initial stage human beings are normally animals (and have hence been called &ldquo;rational animals&rdquo;). A human being who lacks viveka [discrimination] is actually worse than an animal. Animals are undeveloped creatures, and thus certain behaviour on their part may be condoned. But humans are developed, so improper conduct by them cannot be condoned. The initial stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is meant for people of animal nature and is thus called pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra or pashubha&#x301;va [pashu = &ldquo;animal&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->When sa&#x301;dhakas advance in the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, guided by the instructions of the preceptor, they develop an ideation proper for human beings. At this stage they are called viira [heroic]. Just as animals are controlled through external pressure, in the stage of pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; disciples must be controlled by the external application of pressure of circumstances. This will help establish them in viirabha&#x301;va. But those who are more elevated than animals do not depend on external pressure for spiritual progress. Their progress is determined by both external pressure and internal urge.<!-- /block --></p>

Hence there is no contradiction between Tantra and science. People are found at all different stages, according to their ideation &ndash; animal-like, heroic, or god-like &ndash; as they ascend on the scale of evolution.

Sada&#x301;shiva was the propounder of both branches of Tantra, hence there cannot be any contradiction between them. Under ordinary circumstances the human mind is dominated by animal propensities. Of course, these baser propensities are not equally strong for all people. Those who have intense animal desires rush toward objects of physical enjoyment. Such people cannot just suddenly give up their objects of enjoyment in favour of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Those whose desire for physical enjoyment is less intense can easily abstain from physical objects, but what are the first-mentioned people to do?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->If such people try forcibly to turn their minds away from their objects of enjoyment, they will face disastrous consequences. Psychologists are well aware of the dangers of attempting to suppress or repress one&#146;s desires. One may be able to maintain saintliness for a certain time, but the raging storm cannot be contained forever. It is not unusual for those who remain virtuous early in life to fall prey to immoral desires later in life. The dark shadow of immorality fell across the lives of many sannya&#x301;siis and sannya&#x301;siniis or bhiks&#x301;us and bhiks&#x301;uniis [monks and nuns] in the past for this very reason, that they had tried to suppress their desires by force. Some people pretend to be virtuous but indulge in immoral deeds secretly; if their numbers increase in society it is an unhealthy sign. The practice of the Five M&#146;s was formulated for those people who harboured secret desires for crude physical enjoyment. But for those guided by subtle propensities, the subtle Pain&#x32D;camaka&#x301;ra, or yoga ma&#x301;rga, was prescribed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->The main idea behind the practice of the crude Pain&#x32D;camaka&#x301;ra is to carry out sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; while in the midst of crude enjoyments. While carrying out this practice, they will limit the degree of their indulgence.  By limiting the use of objects of enjoyment they will gradually increase their psychic power, and will ultimately rise above the allurement of enjoyment. For example, a wine addict will drink a controlled measure of wine as a part of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The science of spirituality developed out of human beings&#146; innate desire to unravel the mystery of creation. Humans began to search for the secret causes underlying both the dreadful and the beautiful aspects of nature. They looked around them at the rivers and streams, the far-flung mountain ranges, the flashes of lightning; they heard the thunder; they listened to the roaring of ferocious animals &ndash; and they began to plumb the depths of these mysteries. These endeavours to get at the hidden truth of everything are what is known as Tantra. Since these endeavours were carried on at different times, in different places, and by different groups of individuals, we find some differences in methodology among the various schools of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Tantra originated in [South] Asia, and its propounders were the Austrics, [the Dravidians,] and the Mongolians.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Among these peoples, the Dravidians and the Mongolians were more developed, the Austrics less. The practitioners of the more-developed Tantra would look upon things from a broad point of view, renouncing all narrow thinking. They would always strive hard to advance the welfare of the masses. Through such selfless service, they would overcome the fetters of the mind, such as hatred and shame. The practitioners of the less-developed Tantra would behave in just the opposite way. They would indulge in casteism; in expressions of untouchability; and in expressions of hatred and envy in relation to other groups.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The overcoming of material bondages signifies the greatest human progress. The word tantra signifies that one &ldquo;frees oneself from the bondages of crudity;&rdquo; therefore Tantra is considered the best kind of spiritual practice. Lord Sada&#x301;shiva was the first propounder of this Tantra. He developed certain fixed rules, and thereby ensured all-round progress in the different aspects of human life. He brought about a perfect system, reviewing and coordinating all branches of Tantra. He researched and proved the efficacy of both the [external] and the [internal] aspects of Tantra.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The [external] aspect of Tantra consisted of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; with skulls, in cemeteries. The [internal] aspect of Tantra consisted of the practice of yoga. [It is ultimately] through [internal] Tantra that human beings can reach the heights of spiritual success.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Human beings can never win liberation by flattering Prakrti. An entity which is flattered becomes proud. Human beings must not become the slaves of matter. If sa&#x301;dhakas will worship Purus&#x301;a and ignore Prakrti, they will find that Prakrti will automatically begin to flatter them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There is no such thing as &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; in this world. All sorts of powers lie dormant in human beings. Sometimes we get glimpses of these latent powers. In a more-developed terminology, these glimpses will be called &ldquo;intellect&rdquo; or &ldquo;intuition&rdquo;. Human beings can develop that which they have glimpsed, eventually attaining extraordinary powers. In the eyes of ordinary people, these powers appear to be supernatural, but actually they are natural. But it is a fact that ordinary persons cannot do these extraordinary things, and that is why they look upon these powers as supernatural.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Tantra is a source of such extraordinary powers. Within a short  period, all the pa&#x301;shas and ripus [fetters and enemies] which bind the mind become broken. As long as the mind is in bondage, it tends to move towards crude material objects; that is, the mind remains inextricably associated with matter. But once the bondages become snapped through the practice of Tantra, the mind becomes detached from those crude objects. This implies the elevation of human beings, because [it is through detachment that] physical, psychic, and spiritual progress becomes possible. Humans are predominantly-mental beings, and sometimes [certain of them] develop extraordinary intellect; because of their greater concentration of mind, their societies consider them to be a superior type of person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When we talk about the ripus [enemies] of the mind, we mean only the [internal, or, innate] enemies.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> For a human being to bring the ripus under perfect control signifies an important victory. Those persons who can do so attain greater control over the forces of matter, and can perform feats that in the eyes of the common masses betoken some kind of supernatural power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In Tantra the endeavour to establish control over matter or over external forces is called avidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And the practice which leads to self-realization is called vidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And that branch of Tantra which is neither vidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; nor avidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is called upavidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Only vidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; contributes to the welfare of humanity; the other two practices are merely a waste of time. Ma&#x301;ran&#x301;a, ucca&#x301;t&#x301;ana, sammohan, va&#x301;shiika&#x301;ran&#x301;a, etc., come within the definition of avidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The practice of avidya&#x301; leads to degradation. Sada&#x301;shiva, the original propounder of Tantra, collected and systematized all the branches of Tantra, but He did not encourage the practice of avidya&#x301;, because it is an inferior order of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. When people practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in order to attain &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; powers, their mental objects ultimately become crude, for after attaining such powers, they utilize them for self-aggrandizement or for revenge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; was almost extinct for the last 1200 years. And there are now only a handful of real Avidya&#x301; Tantrics left &ndash; the rest are charlatans and hypocrites. After death, these people will be reborn as worms and insects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Human beings practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in order to become one with Brahma, not to become ghosts or ghouls. To become one with Brahma, they must practise Vidya&#x301; Tantra, and not Avidya&#x301; Tantra. Of course through either kind of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, sa&#x301;dhakas gain freedom from the pa&#x301;shas and ripus. But the difference between the two sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;s is that the practitioners of Vidya&#x301; Tantra channelize their  spiritual powers towards the attainment of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, whereas the practitioners of Avidya&#x301; Tantra utilize their acquired powers for mundane benefits. Through Vidya&#x301; Tantra one &ldquo;binds&rdquo; [wins] Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, while through Avidya&#x301; Tantra one binds [dominates] living beings. Vidya&#x301; Tantrics accept Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; as their object of supreme adoration, and in order to become one with Him, they channelize all the powers they have acquired towards Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->From a medical point of view also, Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; has its usefulness. In ancient times there were Vedic experts in a&#x301;yurveda.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> But as they were not Tantrics, they were handicapped in fully utilizing their medical knowledge to cure patients. Because of their prejudices &ndash; their hatred of certain groups, their belief in untouchability, their casteism, etc. &ndash; they would hesitate to touch the bodies of their patients; whereas the Tantric doctors, because of their control over [such enemies and fetters as] hatred, fear and shame, could render medical service in a proper way. The practices of dissection and surgery rested mainly in the hands of Tantric doctors.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know that Tantra is a spiritual cult. It is a cult because Tantra clearly explains how to do a sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of a particular type and stage, and what the achievement will be from each such sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. All possible details have been worked out. It is a systematic practical science. It is vaevaha&#x301;rika [practical] &ndash; not bookish. Tantra is dharma, and &ndash; since A&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t dharmah [&ldquo;Dharma is the assemblage of all your conduct&rdquo;] &ndash; one has to do Tantra practically in one&#146;s individual life. But the practical side of Tantra is very abstract and subtle. One has to be very careful indeed in practising it. So that sa&#x301;dhakas might know and understand the practical side clearly, Pa&#x301;rvatii posed questions to Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva answered them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The questions of Pa&#x301;rvatii were for the sake of lokashiks&#x301;a&#x301; [education of the people]. Those questions which are only for the sake of questioning or for the sake of measuring the knowledge of the other person have no value on the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; ma&#x301;rga [path of spiritual practice]. They are a sheer waste of time. When the questions asked are intended for the purpose of knowing and then doing, the questions are termed pariprashnas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What to do; how to do; why to do &ndash; these are pariprashnas. Such pariprashnas make up the nigama sha&#x301;stra. Such pariprashnas constitute the philosophical, theoretical, side. And the practical side, constituted by the answers of Sada&#x301;shiva, is the a&#x301;gama sha&#x301;stra. In other words, the pariprashnas of Pa&#x301;rvatii go to make up the nigama sha&#x301;stra, and the practical answers of Sada&#x301;shiva make up the a&#x301;gama sha&#x301;stra. Nigama and a&#x301;gama together make up the Tantra sha&#x301;stra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->One of the questions posed by Pa&#x301;rvatii was, &ldquo;What is to be done to get self-realization?&rdquo; She had posed this question for the sake of lokashiks&#x301;a&#x301; &ndash; so that sa&#x301;dhakas might be highly benefited. Actually, the intellect in those days had not developed to the point that there were people who could pose such subtle questions about sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But as the subtle truths of the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; had to be handed over to people, Hara [Shiva] and Pa&#x301;rvatii had decided to enter into a dialogue of the type compiled in the nigamas and a&#x301;gamas. Pa&#x301;rvatii posed questions, and Shiva answered them.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So the question of Pa&#x301;rvatii was, &ldquo;What is to be done for self-realization? People are seen to undergo fasting, to perform strenuous rituals, to travel to obscure holy places, to take all sorts of pains, to know the self. What is the right path?&rdquo; So Shiva replied,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Na muktirtapana&#x301;dhoma&#x301;dupava&#x301;sashataerapi;<br>Brahmaeva&#x301;hamiti jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva&#x301; mukto bhavati dehabhrt.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->[Liberation is not attainable by penance, sacrificial rituals, or hundreds of fasts. Living beings attain liberation when they realize, &ldquo;I am Brahma.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The idea that one can get mukti [liberation] through tapah, that is, by torturing the body, is not correct. God is internal; what has He to do with anything external? Standing in water for days, standing on one foot for months, raising one hand or both hands heavenwards and standing like that for a long time, burying oneself in the earth for days &ndash; all these things are simply meaningless. They no doubt call for great physical power and a great capacity of endurance &ndash; but many people undertake heavy physical labour; don&#146;t even animals work very hard? Will all such people and animals get mukti? It is not correct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->One cannot get to God through physical tapah. Neither can one get to Him through homa and havana [sacrificial rituals]. Were this possible, it would be very easy for the rich to find God! And the poor could never get near to Him! These things are all meaningless, and represent a very backward stage of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Upava&#x301;sa in the sense of fasting is also useless. Were it effective, the poor and the unfed would need to make little effort to reach God!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->But if one does real upava&#x301;sa, that can do a lot. The scriptural meaning of upava&#x301;sa is &ndash; by derivation &ndash; upa, which means &ldquo;near&rdquo;, and va&#x301;sa, which means &ldquo;to stay&rdquo;. Upava&#x301;sa therefore means &ldquo;to make the mind stay near Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;&rdquo;. In other words, it means to withdraw the mind from thoughts of physicalities and keep it near Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. The Sanskrit word for fasting as such is anashana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->One may do tapah, homa, upava&#x301;sa, a hundred thousand times, but mukti will never be obtained. So then what should one do?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->After giving the negative side, after dismissing the system of worship then prevalent, Shiva went on to explain the positive side. If these things are not to be done, what then is to be done? Shiva said, Brahmaeva&#x301;hamiti jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva&#x301; mukto bhavati dehabhrt &ndash; that is, &ldquo;When one is established in the knowledge that &lsquo;I am Brahma,&rsquo; mukti is obtained.&rdquo; But a theoretical knowledge that &ldquo;I am Brahma&rdquo; will not do &ndash; one has to be truly established in this ideation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Anubhu&#x301;tim&#x301; vina&#x301; mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha vrtha&#x301; Brahman&#x301;i modate;<br>Pratibimbitasha&#x301;kha&#x301;graphala&#x301;sva&#x301;danamodavat.<!-- /block --></p>

Seeing the reflection in water of a sweet fruit hanging from the branch of a tree does not give one the taste of the fruit.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->One has to taste the fruit. If one sees its reflection in the water and pretends to have tasted and enjoyed it &ndash; how much reality and value there is in that you know very well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Having heard this, Pa&#x301;rvatii said, &ldquo;Very well, I have understood. But please tell me where to search Brahma.&rdquo; Lord Shiva then said, Dharmasya tattvam&#x301; nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;ya&#x301;m &ndash; &ldquo;The tattva of dharma is nihita in the guha&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The tattva of dharma &ndash; that is, the &ldquo;essence&rdquo; of dharma &ndash; is He, the Lord. He is nihita. Nihita means &ldquo;hidden&rdquo;. He is all around but He is hidden in the guha&#x301;. So though He is all around, one has not to search for Him all over, one has to search for Him in one&#146;s guha&#x301;. Guha&#x301; has a couple of meanings &ndash; &ldquo;cave&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Here the second meaning applies. One has to search for Him in one&#146;s &ldquo;I&rdquo;. The one who is inside your &ldquo;I&rdquo; is you yourself. Search for your self &ndash; you will find Him. As long as the [real] you is there, the Lord is also there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->You are a sa&#x301;dhaka. He is the sa&#x301;dhya [object of adoration]. And the link is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. As long as these three tattvas exist, you are not He. When all three have become one, one may say &ldquo;I am Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;&rdquo; &ndash; never prior to this. Until this stage is reached, one has to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; most diligently, with greatest nis&#x301;t&#x301;ha [sincerity]. (Having established oneself solidly in the state of Brahma-hood, one may or may not do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; one may do it to set an example for the world; that is, one may do it for lokashiks&#x301;a&#x301;.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->One must do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; most regularly. As long as one has a body, one must go on doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. You must have noticed that a shiny new lot&#x301;a&#x301; [small metal vessel] will no longer retain its lustre and newness after a year&#146;s use. One has to clean it quite regularly with tamarind in order to maintain its shininess. The mind is like that &ndash; one has to do regular sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to keep it neat and clean.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->For those who are searching the Lord without and not within, Sada&#x301;shiva says,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Questions related to spiritual practice and spiritual progress &ndash; questions not simply for inquiry&#146;s sake but for the sake of understanding and for the sake of following the instructions given &ndash; are known as pariprashnas (for example, questions put by disciples to their gurus as to how to sit, how to bid pran&#x301;a&#x301;ma [respectful salutations], and how to repeat mantra). Pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;tena pariprashnena seva&#x301;ya&#x301; [&ldquo;By surrender, spiritual questioning, and servicefulness&rdquo;]. Questions put only for logic&#146;s sake are not pariprashnas; with such questions the time of the questioner and that of the answerer is wasted. And sometimes questions are put not in order to know but in order to test the scholarship of the guru &ndash; such questions are not pariprashnas either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If pariprashnas are put and answered, and then recorded, or if people somehow get acquainted with such questions and answers, people will be benefited. But during the time of Sada&#x301;shiva nobody was there to put such questions. Pa&#x301;rvatii learned sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; from Shiva (as did their son Bhaerava). Pa&#x301;rvatii and Shiva decided that the former would pose the questions, and the latter would reply, and thus people would get acquainted with the questions and answers and be benefited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->They decided to formulate these questions and answers for the all-round development of human society. They decided to cover all branches of knowledge &ndash; art, architecture, literature, medical science, spiritual science, etc. For example, you know that in ancient times there was [a simple form of] giita [song]. There was also [va&#x301;dya, basic instrumental music]. And people were performing some mudra&#x301;s unconsciously with their hands and feet. So Lord Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii decided to coordinate and systematize giita, [va&#x301;dya] and mudra&#x301;. Pa&#x301;rvatii began to pose questions, and Shiva began to answer; and the sam&#x301;giita sha&#x301;stra [science of music] was produced.

<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Dance was known in quite a primitive age. This kind of dance was rhythmic.

The rule is that rhythmic dance requires strength; only males can do it; because it is tiring. But Pa&#x301;rvatii gave lalita nrtya, in which mudra&#x301; has an important role. Indian dances and other Oriental dances are mudra&#x301;pradha&#x301;na [dominated by mudra&#x301;]. And Occidental dances are chandapradha&#x301;na [rhythmic].<!-- /block --></p>

In this way mudra&#x301; sha&#x301;stra came about, sam&#x301;giita sha&#x301;stra came about. Shiva invented a rhythmic dance and Pa&#x301;rvatii created a dance dominated by mudra&#x301;.

For instance, if one calls to a person, as soon as the sound vibrations of &ldquo;Come&rdquo; touch the person&#146;s ears, they directly reach the mind. But the person can be made to understand through mudra&#x301;s [gestures of the fingers] also. Similar are the cases of expressing that one feels hot and sweaty, that one feels thirsty, etc., without speaking, through different physical gestures. Hence, mudra&#x301; has sha&#x301;nta bha&#x301;va [it is peaceful, calm].

Once Pa&#x301;rvatii posed a question to Shiva. (Actually she asked it not for herself, but just to make people understand the desideratum of human life.) The question asked was, &ldquo;What should be the object of worship for those who are doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;?&rdquo; Humans create the objects of their worship according to their own intellectual standards. Primitive humans worshipped plants, trees, earth, rivers, etc. It is not logical to think that one can acquire pun&#x301;ya [virtue] by immersing oneself in the Ganges, but cannot acquire it by immersing oneself in the Thames. If pun&#x301;ya can be acquired by immersion, it can be by immersion either in the Ganges or in the Thames. And can there be no pun&#x301;ya from taking a dip in the Yamuna, which originates, like the Ganges, in the Himalayas, and runs side by side with the Ganges? There are some who worship stone: they make idols out of stone, according to their imaginations, and they worship them. How can an idol give you salvation &ndash; an idol made by you? You have shaped the idol with different chisels and hammers; you are its father, its creator; so how can it give you salvation? It is all unscientific.<!-- /block --></p>

Plants and trees are in a process of growth. But the idol has been created and shaped by you, by your chisel and hammer &ndash; how can it give you salvation?&rdquo; Pa&#x301;rvatii then said, &ldquo;[Is] idol worship, too, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

They say that they don&#146;t feel like returning to the village, as the villagers are illiterate and under-developed. This feeling is very dangerous. And if such feelings creep into the mind as a result of having acquired a little intellectual knowledge, the chances of developing this complex are much greater in the realm of spirituality, when a sa&#x301;dhaka begins feeling somewhat elevated with the development of some occult powers and the feeling of a little bliss.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="8.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.8.fn4">4</a></b>)  If one&#146;s mind is concentrated on Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, even if that concentration is irreverent, one will progress spiritually. Irreverent concentration will eventually become reverent concentration. But even reverent ideation, if constantly broken by thoughts of one&#146;s personal concerns, will be ineffective. &ndash;Eds.</p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="8.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.8.fn6">6</a></b>)  That which is known as anna (ad + kta) in the Sanskrit language is called pin&#x301;a in the Vedic language. I remember having mentioned before that in ancient times, when the Aryans from Russia came to India, they started cultivation. The border country of Bha&#x301;rata [India] was called Saptanada Desha [Land of Seven Rivers], which later on came to be known as the Punjab. (Those seven rivers were the Jhelam, the Chenub, the Satluj, the Ravi, the Beas, the Kabul and the Sindhu.) The people of that place used to sit together at noon to have their meal &ndash; that is, in the Vedic language, to have their pin&#x301;d&#x301;a. So a place where the farmers would have their meal was called pin&#x301;iika. That pin&#x301;d&#x301;iika in Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta became pin&#x301;d&#x301;ii-a, and this in old Punjabi became changed to pin&#x301;ae, or pin&#x301;d&#x301;ii. In the Punjabi language, pindi means &ldquo;village&rdquo; &ndash; for instance, &ldquo;Rawalpindi&rdquo;, &ldquo;the habitation of the Rawals&rdquo;.</p>

Here lies the importance of Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; the practice of intuitional science &ndash; and the necessity of sharan&#x301;agati, total surrender to Parama Purus&#x301;a. The spirit of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to wage an all-round fight against Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, to overcome Her tenacious influence. This battle of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; can be carried out in one of three ways &ndash; Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or Madhyama&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

It is never attained by flattery. Powerful people are greatly appeased by the entreaties and flattery of cowards, and might grant certain concessions or favours, but would never grant complete freedom. Dominion status may be granted, but the attainment of complete independence remains a far cry away. Thus, in order to attain salvation, to establish the reign of complete independence, a spiritual aspirant will have to fight against Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

Their will to struggle, their courage and valiant spirit are undoubtedly praiseworthy. But in the absence of a fixed goal before them, they fail in their endeavour to attain liberation. Often, before attaining success in the battle against Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;rii sa&#x301;dhakas become tempted to misuse their hard-earned spiritual power, causing damage to themselves and society. As a result they unknowingly invite  more darkness, more crudity, and gradually degenerate to the level of animality. That is why wise sa&#x301;dhakas do not accept the path of Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; as an ideal one.<!-- /block --></p>

They move forward towards the spiritual effulgence, or Brahmajyoti, tearing the veil of darkness of Avidya&#x301;. Ananda Marga accepts the path of Madhyama&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, because in this process sa&#x301;dhakas have a fixed goal.  A purposeless and random fight usually does not bring victory, rather it causes unnecessary wastage of time and energy.<!-- /block --></p>

Every day she was absorbed in deep meditation, enjoying the immense bliss of many different sama&#x301;dhis. One day Sada&#x301;shiva playfully withdrew her bliss for a long period.

So at that stage of humanity when this viirabha&#x301;va develops, when a person becomes ready to fight against all opposite forces, he is a viira. In Tantra this is called viirabha&#x301;va, and for him, the Supreme Entity is &ldquo;Viireshvara&rdquo;. The man becomes viira, and his Lord becomes Viireshvara &ndash; no longer Pashupati, but Viireshvara. One of the names of Parama Purus&#x301;a is Viireshvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When the person is fully established in viirabha&#x301;va &ndash; that is, he is never to be frightened, never to be defeated, never to accept any defeat (you girls should remember that here &ldquo;he&rdquo; means &ldquo;she&rdquo; also) &ndash; then he is established in viirabhava. And that bha&#x301;va is called divyabha&#x301;va. And that man is no longer known as viira. He is a deva, or devata&#x301;. Kramen&#x301;a devata&#x301; bhavet. &ldquo;He becomes devata&#x301;, he becomes deva in human structure, deva in human framework.&rdquo; That stage is divyabha&#x301;va. Then that person&#146;s goal, his object of adoration, becomes &ldquo;Maha&#x301;deva&rdquo;, not Viireshvara but Maha&#x301;deva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the first phase the Lord was Pashupati, in the second phase Viireshvara, and in the final phase Maha&#x301;deva. So the same Lord, according to one&#146;s own psycho-spiritual stratum, is to be addressed sometimes as Pashupati, sometimes as Viireshvara, and sometimes as Maha&#x301;deva. Now, I have said that a person has three types of expression: One expression is thinking, the thinking faculty, and the second one is speaking&#8230; In the first the function is within the nerve cells, and in the second, the function is &ndash; where? With the lips. And the third action is action with the physical body, corporal action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now in the case of pashus, that is, animals in human structure, the thought-waves move like this&#8230; and the lips speak like this&#8230; and the actions are like that! There is no adjustment amongst these three expressions. The person is a pashu, the person is in the stage of pashu, in the stage of animality, although the structure is like that of a human. In the society these people are in the majority, and others are in a hopeless minority; and I want you boys and you girls to try your best to decrease the number of these pashus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->And in the second phase, that is, in the viira stage, the thought-waves move like that&#8230; but the words and the actions are one. That is, there are some differences between thoughts on the one hand, and words and actions on the other hand, but the words and the actions are the same. What these people say, they do. In society, these people, these people of viirabha&#x301;va, are respected as great men, as Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;as, as leaders of society, as leaders of the country. But there is a defect in them also, because their thoughts and their actions are not the same. Their actions and words are the same, but their thoughts are not the same. Do you follow? They are [in] viirabha&#x301;va, they are viira; their Lord is Viireshvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->And in the final stage, that is, when one attains the stage of devata&#x301;, then what one thinks, one says; and what one says, one does. There is no difference amongst thinking, saying, and doing. And that is the best stage of human structure or human existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->You should all try to be like this, and I want the number of such persons, who have attained the stratum of devata&#x301;, to increase.

<a name="14..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Just like pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra yoga is not complete in itself. Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, you know, is a practice to control the movement of the vital energy of a particular body: Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;n yamayatyes&#x301;ah pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;mah [&ldquo;The process of controlling the va&#x301;yus, or energy flows in the body, is known as pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma&rdquo;]. It is the process by which the movement of vital energy is controlled by a spiritual aspirant. But pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma should always be associated with bindu dhya&#x301;na, that is, meditation on a particular point. If pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma is not associated with bindu dhya&#x301;na, it will affect self-restraint. Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma will make the mind restless. Similarly, pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra yoga &ndash; here the actual English term is &ldquo;withdrawal&rdquo; &ndash; should always be associated with dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The difference between dhya&#x301;na [meditation] and dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; [concentration] is that dhya&#x301;na is something stationary; that is, the object is a stationary one in the case of dhya&#x301;na. In the case of dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, the mind moves along with the object; that is, there is a dynamic force behind dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;. And dhya&#x301;na, although sentient, has no movement in it. In the sphere of &ndash; rather, in the arena of &ndash; spiritual practice, pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra has very much importance, because in the primordial phase of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, one will have to withdraw one&#146;s mind from the physicalities of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now in pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra yoga, what are you to do after withdrawing all your propensities from the objective world, from the physicalities of the world? To where are these mental propensities to be directed? If the mental propensities are withdrawn, but are not guided to some other point, what will happen? Those withdrawn mental propensities will create internal disturbance in your mind, will create disturbance in your subconscious and unconscious strata. It is dangerous. Sometimes it so happened in the past, and may happen in the future, that if a spiritual aspirant, without the guidance of a strong guru, tried or tries to practise pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra only from reading books, there would be some danger. So whenever you are withdrawing your mental propensities from different objects, you are to guide those collected propensities into some moving object, moving within the realm of your mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And what is that moving object? That moving object is your citta &ndash; your objectivated &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. The citta is moving. The citta is something moving. So these withdrawn propensities are to move towards the citta and not towards external objects. They stop moving towards external objects, but they start moving towards the internal citta. That is the thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->If the propensities are withdrawn, but not goaded towards the citta, then there will be a dangerous reaction. I think you have understood. That is why it has been said, Yacched va&#x301;un manasi pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;ah &ndash; &ldquo;What are intelligent spiritual aspirants to do? They are to goad their mental propensities to the citta.&rdquo; Here the word va&#x301;un represents the external movement of the propensities. Then manasi + pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;ah &ndash; that is, &ldquo;those withdrawn propensities are to move towards the citta.&rdquo; Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;ah va&#x301;un manasi yacchet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Tad yacched jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tmani. The citta, after consuming those withdrawn propensities, also moves. It moves within the mind, not toward any external object &ndash; not toward an external elephant, but toward the elephant created within your mind. Tad yacched jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tmani &ndash; &ldquo;and the citta, along with the withdrawn propensities, is to be guided towards the aham&#x301;tattva, the doer &lsquo;I&rsquo;, the owner &lsquo;I&rsquo; &ndash; the &lsquo;I do&rsquo; feeling that is subject to the &lsquo;I&rsquo; having a direct objectivity.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.14.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#14.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Here this doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;, although not in movement, still has the full potentiality of movement. It can move. It may move. It can partly transform itself into the done &ldquo;I&rdquo;. So it has the potentiality. So that citta, that is, the done &ldquo;I&rdquo;, is to be directed towards the doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;, the aham&#x301;tattva. Not the feeling &ldquo;I exist,&rdquo; but the feeling that the &ldquo;I&rdquo; that exists is now able to do something. This is the aham&#x301;tattva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati niyacchet. Now this jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tma&#x301;, or aham, has also got potentiality, so the mutative principle is very prominent in it. That doer or mutative principle is also a binding fetter, a tethering agency. So &ldquo;one will have to withdraw this jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tma&#x301;, this aham&#x301;tattva, into the mahattattva&rdquo; &ndash; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati niyacchet. Mahati means &ldquo;within the mahattattva&rdquo;. And what is the mahattattva? The mahattattva is the feeling &ldquo;I exist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now in this pure &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling there is hardly any movement, because it is a creation of the sentient principle. But you know, although the sentient principle cannot give any specific figure, any boundary line, still it is a sort of bondage, and because there is bondage there is fight within and without. You are doing something. Is there no fight, is there no movement? Although there is no figure, there is fight, there is movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->So jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati.  [The mahattattva] is almost free from bondage, but there is still bondage. Suppose a very good man is harshly rebuking an immoral person for having insulted him. Is that unfair? No, no, it is not unfair. It is called sentient anger. Anger is static; but sometimes it may be sa&#x301;ttvika, it may be sentient. And that type of anger is sentient anger &ndash; sa&#x301;ttvika krodha in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Tad yaccheccha&#x301;nta a&#x301;tmani. &ldquo;Now this pure &lsquo;I&rsquo; feeling, &lsquo;I exist&rsquo;&rdquo; &ndash; where all your propensities, along with the citta, and the citta along with the aham&#x301;tattva, and the aham&#x301;tattva along with the mahattattva, form one strong unit of movement &ndash; &ldquo;is also to be withdrawn and merged into that Cognitive Principle.&rdquo; And that Cognitive Principle is free from all bondages.

<a name="15..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is yoga? You know that in Sanskrit almost all the vocabulary, all the words of its vocabulary, have two types of meanings, two types of significances. One is the root meaning: in Sanskrit this is called the bha&#x301;va&#x301;ru&#x301;d&#x301;ha&#x301;rtha. The other is the use of the word in common parlance &ndash; what the common people say, how the common people use the word: this is called the word&#146;s yoga&#x301;ru&#x301;d&#x301;ha&#x301;rtha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->For example, the word pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nana. The bha&#x301;va&#x301;ru&#x301;d&#x301;ha&#x301;rtha, that is, the root meaning, of pain&#x32D;ca&#x301;nana is &ldquo;having five faces&rdquo;. The yoga&#x301;ru&#x301;d&#x301;hartha is &ldquo;Shiva&rdquo;. There are so many Messrs. Panchanan in the state; but actually the meaning is &ldquo;something having five faces&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The word yoga has also four interpretations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Where the root verb is yuj, and the suffix ghain&#x32D; is added, it becomes yoga; here yoga means &ldquo;addition&rdquo;. &ldquo;Two plus two is equal to four&rdquo; is yoga, is addition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->One thing you should know is the pronunciation of the letters in the Sanskrit alphabetical order. There are four letters known as antahstha varn&#x301;a [convertible letters] &ndash; ya, ra, la, va. These four letters are not independent sounds or independent letters. They are known as antahstha varn&#x301;a, that is, when they appear as the first letter of any word, they will have a special sound; and when they are not the first letter, that is, when they are in the middle or at the end of any word, they will not have this special sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->For example, the letter ya, that is, i plus a, is a vowel. Ya is a vowel. It is ya, but it will have a special sound when it is the first letter of any word. That is, when it is the first letter of any word, its pronunciation will be ya [as in the English &ldquo;jump&rdquo;]. So yoga is pronounced [&ldquo;joga&rdquo;], not [&ldquo;yoga&rdquo;]. But when ya is in the middle or the last portion of a word, its pronunciation will be [&ldquo;ya&rdquo;] not [&ldquo;ja&rdquo;]. For instance, it is [&ldquo;viyoga&rdquo;] not [&ldquo;vijoga&rdquo;], [&ldquo;samaya&rdquo;] not [&ldquo;samaja&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When the letter ra is the first letter [of a word], its pronunciation is like [&ldquo;ra&rdquo;]. Otherwise it is [&ldquo;r&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;serve&rdquo;)].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->When la is the first letter its pronunciation will be ordinary la, just like lata&#x301;, but when it is in the middle or the end of a word then its pronunciation will be lr + a = lra. When la is not the first letter, that is, when la is the middle or is the last letter, it is pronounced lra. For example, phala is pronounced phalra, not phala. Village people say phara, this is the [comparatively] correct pronunciation. Phala is not the correct pronunciation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, va. When va is the first letter its pronunciation will be like the English &ldquo;v&rdquo;, and when it is not the first letter, its pronunciation will be like &ldquo;w&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So it is [&ldquo;joga&rdquo;], not [&ldquo;yoga&rdquo;], because ya is the first letter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When the root verb is yuj, the meaning is &ldquo;addition&rdquo; (&ldquo;two plus two is equal to four&rdquo;). But in the case of addition the individual identity is maintained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->However, in the second case, the root verb of yoga &ndash; pronounced [&ldquo;joga&rdquo;] &ndash; is yuin&#x32D;j. Yuin&#x32D;j + ghain&#x32D; = yoga, that is, after adding the suffix it becomes yoga. In this case yoga means &ldquo;unification&rdquo;. A&#x301;tman becomes one with Parama&#x301;tman.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In the case of unification, the unifying parties do not maintain their separate identities. Take, for instance, a mixture of sugar and water; when sugar mixes with water it forms a solution. In this case the sugar and the water fail to maintain their separate identities. This can be termed as &ldquo;unification&rdquo;. So in philosophy, or in Tantra, yoga is not the word derived from the yuj root but comes from the root word yuin&#x32D;j. That is, this yoga means &ldquo;unification&rdquo;. A&#x301;tman unifies with Parama&#x301;tman without maintaining its separate identity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The third meaning of yoga is based on the Yoga Su&#x301;tram of Maharshi Patanjali. There yoga means Yogashcittavrttirnirodhah [&ldquo;Yoga is the suspension of all psychic propensities&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There are a great number of psychic propensities in the human mind, as compared to the animal mind. The human mind, broadly speaking, has fifty propensities. These fifty propensities work internally as well as externally and get expressed through the ten sensory and motor organs. Therefore, the total amounts to one thousand propensities. That is, these fifty basic propensities have one thousand expressions or mental occupations. These are called cittavrtti in Sanskrit. The controlling seat of these one thousand expressions is known as the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra in Sanskrit. It is also known as the &ldquo;thousand-petalled lotus&rdquo;. The English name for the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra is the pineal gland or pineal body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now, let us understand the meaning of cittavrttirnirodhah. When these propensities moving in one thousand directions are withdrawn, when these expressions are suspended, this is known as cittavrttinirodhah. Now if these mental occupations are suspended, all the activities of the human structure will come to an end. According to Patanjali, this is the final stage of yoga. The word nirodhah means &ldquo;suspension&rdquo;. It is derived as follows: ni &ndash; rudh + ghain&#x32D;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->But this interpretation of yoga by Maharshi Patanjali is not accepted by Tantra. Tantra says: Sam&#x301;yoga yoga ityukto jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; Parama&#x301;tmanah. &ldquo;The unification of the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; with Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is yoga,&rdquo; as per Tantra. Sam&#x301;yoga means &ldquo;unification&rdquo;, and yoga ityukto means &ldquo;known as yoga&rdquo;. So here Tantra has moved a step further. According to Patanjali, yoga is the suspension of mental propensities. However, you know that when mental propensities are withdrawn from externalities and suspended, then, for want of a desideratum, they create disturbances in the internal layers of the mind. Although those propensive expressions will not be functioning externally, they will be active internally. One may not steal externally but may steal internally. Tantra refuses to accept this concept.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->According to Tantra, the unification of the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; with Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; means yoga. After withdrawing the mental propensities, they are to be guided towards the Supreme Entity. Then alone will the withdrawal be final. Only by guiding these withdrawn mental propensities towards the Supreme Cognition can the total unification of the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; with Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; be possible, and this is yoga.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Several times in the past I narrated a story from the Hara- Pa&#x301;rvatii sam&#x301;va&#x301;da [dialogues of Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii]. The story goes that once Pa&#x301;rvatii asked Shiva, &ldquo;What are the secrets of success?&rdquo; In His reply, Lord Shiva said that there are seven secrets of success:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Phalis&#x301;yatiiti vishva&#x301;sah siddherprathama laks&#x301;an&#x301;am;<br>Dvitiiyam&#x301; shraddhaya&#x301; yuktam&#x301; trtiiyam&#x301; gurupu&#x301;janam;<br>Caturtho samata&#x301;bha&#x301;vo pain&#x32D;camendriyanigrahah;<br>S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hain&#x32D;ca pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ro saptamam&#x301;naeva vidyate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Citation"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ndash;<i>Shiva Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The first factor or secret of success is Phalis&#x301;yatiiti vishva&#x301;sah siddherprathama laks&#x301;an&#x301;am &ndash; &ldquo;I must be successful in my mission.&rdquo; This firm determination is the first secret of success. A spiritual aspirant must have this firm determination: &ldquo;I must be successful in my mission.&rdquo; This firm determination is the result of extreme love for the Supreme Entity. When this love for the Supreme remains unassailed, uncontaminated, it creates this firm determination: &ldquo;I must be successful in my mission.&rdquo; This is the first secret of success.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Dvitiiyam&#x301; shraddhaya&#x301; yuktam. The second requisite factor of success is shraddhaya&#x301; yuktam. One must have shraddha&#x301; for one&#146;s desideratum. What is shraddha&#x301;? Shraddha&#x301; is a Sanskrit word having no corresponding word in any other developed language of the world. That is why I will have to explain this word. Shraddha&#x301; comes from shrat, meaning satyam, and dha&#x301; from the root verb dha. When one ascribes everything to one&#146;s goal, or one&#146;s object, or to the Supreme Subjectivity appearing as one&#146;s object, and moves, or rather directs one&#146;s everything towards Him, then that movement is shraddha&#x301;. First ascribing that supreme veracity to the object (actually it is the Supreme Subjectivity taken as an object) and then directing one&#146;s everything towards Him, is that mental movement which is called shraddha&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Respect&rdquo; or &ldquo;reverence&rdquo; does not carry the sense of shraddha&#x301;. This shraddha&#x301; can also be created or can also be developed when there is sincere love, extreme love, for Him. So the second factor also depends upon the love for the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Trtiiyam&#x301; gurupu&#x301;janam. What is a guru? In old Sanskrit gu means &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; and ru means dispeller, &ldquo;dispelling agency&rdquo;. Therefore the entity, the guiding faculty, that dispels all darkness, all spiritual darkness, is the guru, and gurupu&#x301;janam is doing as per the desire of the guru. This third factor is created only when one gets the guru as the embodiment of spiritual guidance, as the embodiment of Brahma in His role as spiritual guide.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Caturtho samata&#x301;bha&#x301;vo. Since all are the creations of the same Lord, and the progeny of the Supreme Progenitor, all have the relationship of brothers and sisters amongst themselves. Nobody is higher and nobody is lower. There must not be any superiority complex nor any inferiority complex; that is, there must be samata&#x301;bha&#x301;vo &ndash; complete mental balance. When this balance is established, when this mental equipoise is established, then we say it is samata&#x301;bha&#x301;vo.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Pain&#x32D;camendriyanigrahah. You know that the human motor organs and sensory organs are the link between the external physicalities and the internal arena of human existence. Now, if these organs, motor and sensory, are properly restrained or properly controlled, the mind can function properly, moving towards the Supreme Cognitive Faculty. That is why the fifth requisite factor is that the spiritual aspirant should restrain his or her sensory and motor organs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->S&#x301;as&#x301;t&#x301;hain&#x32D;ca pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ro. What is a&#x301;ha&#x301;ra? A &ndash; hr + ghain&#x32D; = a&#x301;ha&#x301;ra. That which a man collects from the external world is a&#x301;ha&#x301;ra. This is physical a&#x301;ha&#x301;ra. Mental a&#x301;ha&#x301;ra can be obtained both from the external objectivities and from the internal psychic world. You may eat a physical rasagolla&#x301; [Indian juicy sweet] and get pleasure, or you may create a rasagolla&#x301; in your mind and &ldquo;eat&rdquo; it and get pleasure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Here the word pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ra has been used, not parimita&#x301;ha&#x301;ra. Parimita means &ldquo;controlled&rdquo;, not taking too much, not taking too little. But in this shloka, pramita&#x301;ha&#x301;ra has been used, which means that the food should be controlled or balanced, and at the same time substantial or nutritious. There are many people who are otherwise good but have no control over the food they eat. It is very important that whatever one gets should not be taken indiscriminately; rather, there should be control over food, and at the same time it should be nutritious.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->After narrating these six factors, Lord Shiva said, &ldquo;O Pa&#x301;rvatii, there is no seventh factor.&rdquo; That is, if you practise these six factors, you require no seventh factor.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Ghosts and Evil Spirits&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now let us see what happens when a person dies. When a person dies, their physical body, along with the nerve cells and nerve fibres, remains in the earth and finally becomes one with the earth. When death takes place, the mind, along with the reactive momenta and the non-cerebral memory, leaves the body and moves here in the universe, with the help of rajogun&#x301;a [the mutative principle], till it gets another body, a suitable body to quench its thirst and satisfy its reactive momenta. Those reactive momenta, in the second body, are known as sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The mind, along with the reactive momenta and non-cerebral memory, is not visible. One cannot see it. And when it is not visible, it is not possible for anybody to say, &ldquo;I have seen that mind, that videhii a&#x301;tma&#x301; [disembodied spirit].&rdquo; But we should remember that the dissociated mind is not alone. In that mind there are the reactive momenta and also the non-cerebral memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->(That mind moving in the universe with the mutative power of the Cosmic Operative Principle is not visible, and at the same time, for want of a nucleus, a seat for the mind, and nerve cells, the mind cannot function properly. For proper functioning it requires ectoplasmic stuff, a body of ectoplasm. So even for ectoplasmic expression it requires a new body. In proper time, due to the mixture of ova and spermatozoa, what happens? The mind becomes associated with a new structure, and the original minds and lives of both the ova and the spermatozoa cease to exist. But those ova and spermatozoa are selected to suit the purpose of this detached mind with its reactive momenta.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now during this period, this transitional period, when the mind has left the previous body, before it gets the new body, what happens? It moves in the universe, invisible and inaudible. But you know, by dint of Tantric practice, anybody can develop their ectoplasmic structure. They may be a Vidya&#x301; Tantric, they may be an Avidya&#x301; Tantric, but the ectoplasmic development is there. So such Tantrics can, with the help of their own ectoplasmic stuff, help the detached mind to get a temporary ectoplasmic body. And for the time being that detached mind, with the help of the ectoplasmic stuff of that Tantric &ndash; Vidya&#x301; Tantric or Avidya&#x301; Tantric &ndash; gets that ectoplasmic structure, and when that ectoplasmic structure is a bit solidified it becomes visible, and due to its vibrational frequency it may become audible too, but only for a short span of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You have heard stories about bones being thrown into a particular house, bricks being thrown into a particular house, a cot moving upwards, etc. You have heard these ghost stories about certain haunted houses. What are these things? A Tantric, certainly not a Vidya&#x301; Tantric, but an Avidya&#x301; Tantric, with the help of a certain portion of their own ectoplasmic stuff, sits tight in an a&#x301;sana [meditation posture], and, with the help of their ectoplasmic stuff, creates an ectoplasmic body for a detached mind (known as preta in Sanskrit). And with the help of their ectoplasmic stuff, attached to the detached mind, they do all these things. But at the time their body remains motionless. So these things are actually not done by ghosts. They are actually done by that Avidya&#x301; Tantric with the help of that detached mind. One may say that these things have been done by ghosts, but they were not actually.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And there is another type of being also. I say &ldquo;being&rdquo; because it is difficult for me to say that they are living beings or that they are dead beings. What happens? There are seven recognized devayonis, divine entities. They are called &ldquo;divine&rdquo;, though actually they are not divine, because they are better, or higher, than ordinary human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Suppose a person is practising spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; regularly, properly, and with proper inspiration and sincerity, but some other desires, some other longings, remain coverted in the person&#146;s mind. The person is a good person, he or she is sincerely doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but in his mind he thinks, &ldquo;If Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; gives me ten lakhs &ndash; or five lakhs &ndash; or only two lakhs &ndash; everything will be managed properly. Oh, no! I won&#146;t ask for these things. No, no, no, it is bad, it is bad.&rdquo; That desire, that longing for money, remains in him, although he or she is a developed soul, not a bad person, not at all a bad person. So what happens? Because of his piety, after death he gives up the physical structure, the solid body, and gives up the aquatic structure, that is, apatattva, also; but the other three factors &ndash; tejas [luminous factor], marut [aerial factor], vyoma [ethereal factor] &ndash; remain with him, with his detached mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->These beings are called devayonis. They are of seven types &ndash; yaks&#x301;a, raks&#x301;a, kinnara, gandharva, vidya&#x301;dhara, siddha and Prakrtiliina. In the example I gave, the person had a longing for money, but was a developed soul. Unknowingly or unconsciously the desire came into his or her mind, and that desire was the cause of his or her downfall, degradation, depravation. This type of being is called yaks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In Bihar, particularly in the northern portion of Bihar, in most but not all of the villages, you will find a place just outside the village, known as the Brahmastha&#x301;na. That Brahmastha&#x301;na is the place where the villagers used to assemble to worship the yaks&#x301;a. In the images of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika [Puranic] gods and goddesses you will find the yaks&#x301;a and yaks&#x301;inii standing just to the right and left of the deity; a yaks&#x301;a and yaks&#x301;inii with ca&#x301;maras [ceremonial whisks] in their hands. What is a yaks&#x301;a? It has a body, but not a quinquelemental body; a body with three factors, tejas, marut and vyoma. That luminous body cannot be touched, but it can be seen sometimes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Raks&#x301;a. People with fighting spirit, with proper dedication and proper spiritual aspiration, but who sometimes think, &ldquo;If I get the blessing I will kill those antisocial elements &ndash; No, no, no, during pu&#x301;ja&#x301; [worship, meditation] I should not think like this.&rdquo; You have understood, I think? Those thoughts coming in the mind during pu&#x301;ja&#x301; become the cause of degradation. After death the person won&#146;t have a physical body or aquatic body, but tejas, marut and vyoma will be there. This type is called raks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Kinnara. &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; has given me everything, but I am not good-looking. I want to be very good-looking, so that people will say &ndash; No, no, no, it is very bad.&rdquo; Such good persons, good souls (and they are good people, not ordinary people) after death also acquire this type of three-elemented body. They are called kinnara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301;dhara. &ldquo;I am a good sa&#x301;dhaka, but haven&#146;t any vocal power. I can&#146;t dance properly, I can&#146;t sing properly, my vocal cord doesn&#146;t function well. I require more attributions, more qualifications &ndash; and if I get more qualifications I will get promotion in the service also. Oh, no, no, no. These are all bad things. These are all bad desires. A person should not have any desires.&rdquo; When such a person dies, they also get that type of body, luminous, gaseous and ethereal. These three bhu&#x301;tas are there. These people are called vidya&#x301;dhara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Next &ndash; a person is doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, there is no longing. Then, &ldquo;I sing bhajanas, but my sound is not good. My vocal cords don&#146;t function properly. My vocal expression should be a bit more sweet and rhythmic &ndash; No, no, no, these are all bad things, bad things.&rdquo; This type of good person, in the body they take in their next life (not &ldquo;next life&rdquo;, but &ldquo;post-physical life&rdquo;), is known as gandharva. They have a longing for music. And that is why music is called gandharva vidya&#x301; in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The sixth is the siddha. What is a siddha? Suppose there is a good soul, a good person who has no physical desire. But during sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;Yes, love for God has been created. Yes, people love me, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; loves me. But I should have some occult power, so that people will say, &lsquo;This person has power, and is not an ordinary person. This person has occult power &ndash; alaokika shakti &ndash; aeshvarya &ndash; vibhu&#x301;ti&rsquo; &ndash; No, no, no, these are bad thoughts, bad thoughts.&rdquo; When this type of person dies, their post-physical body is known as siddha. They are the best among the devayonis. I will say something regarding these siddhas later on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->And the seventh is Prakrtiliina &ndash; those who worship idols, ascribing Brahma-hood to that idol, thinking that the very idol is God, the very image is God; worshipping stone, worshipping wood, worshipping metal. Tantra says, Mrcchila&#x301;dha&#x301;tuda&#x301;rva&#x301;dimu&#x301;rtta&#x301;viishvaro buddhayo&#8230; [&ldquo;Those who think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is confined within idols made of clay, stone, metal or wood&#8230;&rdquo;] Mrt means &ldquo;earthen image&rdquo;; shila&#x301; means &ldquo;made of stone&rdquo;; dha&#x301;tu means &ldquo;made of metal&rdquo;; and da&#x301;ru means &ldquo;made of wood&rdquo;. And they ascribe Godhood to that wood or to that metal or to that stone. Then what happens? The person is ideating on that stone, or wood, or metal, and what happens? Yadrshii bha&#x301;vana&#x301; yasya siddhir bhavati ta&#x301;drshii &ndash; &ldquo;A person adopts a body according to their object of ideation.&rdquo; Their own self is transformed into that entity, the entity which was their object of meditation. Now such people worshipping different forms of Prakrti finally take the form of those entities, and become stone, become wood, become metal. They are called Prakrtiliina. They become one with Prakrti and remain there for an indefinite period. What a durdaeva, I will say! What a painful state of existence!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now, among these seven types of devayoni, the siddha is the best. Siddhas perform their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; remaining just at the half-way point. And whenever there is an assemblage of singers or dancers, what happens? Gandharvas, with their mental bodies, their reactive momenta and non-cerebral memories, assemble. Wherever there is any programme of music, there they assemble, but invisible. Sometimes, though, they become visible. I will explain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Wherever there is any spiritual gathering, siddhas come. And during a musical function, whenever the mind of a particular artist becomes concentrated, they will see the luminous bodies of gandharvas. Similarly, during meditation, or particularly during kiirtana, when a spiritual aspirant&#146;s mind becomes concentrated, they will feel the existence of those siddhas. In Jamalpur, in the area of the tiger&#146;s grave, there were assemblages of large numbers of siddhas. One of our senior grhii a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas [married spiritual teachers] used to see them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->I will narrate a very short story. A few years back, two of our ka&#x301;pa&#x301;lika sa&#x301;dhakas<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> came to a river. That river is not a big one, but the depth is there. They were at a loss to decide how to cross the river. Just on the other side of the river there was a burial ground, a cremation ground. They were thinking hard, at midnight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->All of a sudden, they saw a luminous body just in front of them. The luminous body began moving, and these two boys followed it. Coming to a particular point, that luminous body started crossing the river, and these two boys followed him. And that particular portion of the river was very shallow, knee-deep. They easily crossed the river and reached the other side. Just on the other bank there was a tree. From there they went two different ways to do their night practice. And after night practice they came back to the tree. They again saw that luminous body and again followed it and crossed the river.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->After coming to the original bank, the junior boy addressed the senior man, &ldquo;Oh Da&#x301;da&#x301;, let us request that luminous body to bless us.&rdquo; As soon as he said this, the luminous body disappeared. What was that luminous body? A siddha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Now what happens when a person sees some unnatural picture or unnatural image or unnatural being? One possibility I have already explained &ndash; it may be that a Tantric, with the help of his or her ectoplasmic structure, has created a body for a disembodied mind just to terrorize others. A Vidya&#x301; Tantric will not do these things, but an Avidya&#x301; Tantric may do so just to terrorize others, as they used to do in the past. After getting some money they would stop the practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->And suppose that some time you go to a particular house which people say is haunted. There are some haunted houses in every town, and I have already told you that if you find any haunted house, you just purchase it and use it. Ghosts won&#146;t terrorize Ananda Margis, because every Ananda Margi is a ghost. [laughter] &ldquo;They are the followers of Shiva.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Ghosts will not terrorize ghosts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->What happens there? Due to terror, due to pre-imposed terror, a person&#146;s mind gets concentrated. Due to fear the mind gets concentrated, and due to concentration, what happens? A certain portion of the person&#146;s own ectoplasmic stuff goes to help a detached mind in creating a body, an ectoplasmic body. So you see your own creation; the creation has been made out of your own ectoplasmic stuff. But that detached mind was also there. It was not a ghost. And those Brahmapisha&#x301;ca, or several kinds of &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo;, are all of your creation. Your ectoplasmic stuff is transferred to that detached mind due to your mental concentration, temporary concentration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->And this type of concentration takes place under five types of circumstance &ndash; ks&#x301;ipta, mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha, viks&#x301;ipta, eka&#x301;gra and nirodha. Ks&#x301;ipta is when the mind is very perturbed, full of worries and anxieties. At that time, due to sudden, short concentration, such a thing may happen. Mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha is when your brain fails to decide what to do or what not to do &ndash; you are at a loss for what to do. This is called mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha &ndash; mu&#x301;h plus kta. Viks&#x301;ipta &ndash; you are not concentrating on a particular point, but finally your mind becomes tired and, in that state, you see those things. You know by lullabies we make the minds of children viks&#x301;ipta and they fall asleep. (Lullabies, you know? &ndash; poems recited in the ears to put children into deep slumber, not ordinary sleep.) Eka&#x301;gra is when your mind gets pointed. And the fifth is nirodha, when you suspend all the expressions of your propensities. In these five conditions you may see those things and you may, knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously, transfer certain portions of your ectoplasmic body to a detached mind and create a positive hallucination of this kind.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Many of you surely know that sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; means Tantra and Tantra means sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The word tantra can be interpreted in two ways. Behind every action, behind every expression, there is a particular sound. By hearing the sound of someone&#146;s approaching footsteps, you conclude that Mr. So-and-so is coming. Every action &ndash; moving, walking, etc. &ndash; has its own sound. Sometimes human beings sit completely motionless &ndash; they are inert. The acoustic root of inertness is ta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Often we use a special sound to help us do a particular thing. For example, while goading the bullocks of a cart, different sounds are produced at different times by the driver. In the olden days, drivers of four-wheeled horse-drawn coaches (which resemble the contemporary tom-tom) would utter a ra-ra-ra-ra sound to make the horses gallop off. And when the driver pulled the reins and shouted tha, the horses would stop. So this coach became known as a ratha: a coach which starts with a ra sound and stops with a tha sound. Many words have been created in this way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Another example: In the olden days, orthodox people wouldn&#146;t use leather shoes and wore wooden sandals instead. (They were nothing like the laced shoes which people wear today.) Now, when they walked those wooden sandals would make a t&#x301;hak-t&#x301;hak sound. T&#x301;hakam-t&#x301;hakam karoti yah sah t&#x301;hakkura [&ldquo;One who makes a t&#x301;hak-t&#x301;hak sound is called a t&#x301;hakkura.&rdquo;] The surname T&#x301;ha&#x301;kur [anglicized &ldquo;Tagore&rdquo;] is derived from t&#x301;hakkura. So people who wore wooden sandals were addressed as &ldquo;T&#x301;ha&#x301;kur Masha&#x301;i&rdquo;. In this way many such words have come into existence. Even today in Gujarat, you will find many people with the surname T&#x301;ha&#x301;kur. In Maharashtra they are named T&#x301;ha&#x301;kre or T&#x301;ha&#x301;kare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->To resume our original discussion, ta is the acoustic root of inertness or staticity. Tantra is the spiritual practice which liberates one from the bondage of staticity (ta). It makes one active and dexterous in action. It exhorts people to work, to leap headlong into action, to run, to extend their hands and feet. This is the spirit of Tantra. Tam&#x301; ja&#x301;dya&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah tantrah parikiirttitah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So &ldquo;Tantra is the practical process which removes jad&#x301;ata&#x301; [dullness and inaction].&rdquo; In Hindi jad&#x301;ata&#x301; is called ja&#x301;r&#x301; &ndash; and winter is called ja&#x301;r&#x301;a, because in the winter people sit like lumps of inert matter. When the warm wind blows they burn up that inertness. On the night of the Holi festival, observed one day before the Dol Ya&#x301;tra&#x301; festival, young people burn a heap of rubbish which represents the dullness of winter. The spirit of this is, &ldquo;From today I shall no longer remain inert. I will not sit like a lump of clay in fear of winter.&rdquo; This is called the Holi festival in northern India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Tantra has another meaning. The Sanskrit root verb tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. A child&#146;s body gradually expands, and this expansion continues up till the age of thirty-nine; but the younger the person is, the faster the expansion. Young children have a big appetite; moreover, their hands and feet are constantly active, and this exercise facilitates the process of growth and expansion. As long as the body is expanding, it is called tanu; it expands in one way or another up till the age of thirty-nine. After thirty-nine years, however, the body gradually wears away: the head become bald and the skin wrinkles. At that stage the body is called shariira, which literally means &ldquo;that whose nature is to wear out, to become wrinkled, and finally to be destroyed&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So the root verb tan means to expand, and thus Tantra is the scientific process which leads to liberation through the process of expansion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->These are the two meanings of tantra: their inner spirit being the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->What is the nature of the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of human beings? The bondages and mental limitations that afflict human beings exist not in the external sphere, but in the internal sphere. One whose mind is very narrow is a mean-minded person, whereas one whose mind is broad is a great person. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; broadens and enlarges the mind. How? It is the innate characteristic of the human mind to become as it thinks &ndash; Ya&#x301;drshii bha&#x301;vana&#x301; yasya siddhirbhavati ta&#x301;drshii [&ldquo;As you think, so you become.&rdquo;] To associate oneself with Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Entity, is the actual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. There is no one greater than Parama Purus&#x301;a, and so, when the mind ideates on Him, it expands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And when the mind expands, what will happen to the bondages of crudity imposed on it by Prakrti? As an analogy, imagine what will happen if your body has been bound with a rope and you then expand your body. What will happen to the rope? It will snap. Similarly, the moment your mind expands, the bondages of Prakrti, which had kept you so small, will snap, will be ripped apart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This is Tantra in a nutshell. You should bear in mind that the fundamental spirit of humanity is expansion. Brahma paves the way for expansion and, in the process of expansion, liberates human beings from their bondages. This is why Tantra has been given its name. So Tantra is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is Tantra. Without sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the practice of Tantra is impossible.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;The Intuitional  Science of Tantra&rdquo;. Before I come to that topic, however, let me first say something about [the word] tantra. Usually the word tantra is derived from tan plus trae plus d&#x301;a. The root verb tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. The process by which one attains liberation from all bondages by strengthening and expanding one&#146;s entitative existence is called Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The word tantra can be interpreted in yet another way. Each and every entity, each and every existence has an acoustic expression of its own. For instance, ta is the acoustic root of dullness or inertness. And the process that brings liberation from this state of staticity, or ta, is called Tantra. Tam&#x301; ja&#x301;d&#x301;ya&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah tantrah parikiirtitah [&ldquo;That which redeems human beings and paves the way for their emancipation from the bondages of staticity is called Tantra.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The cult that Sada&#x301;shiva formulated and introduced into human society to ensure the removal of inertness in the physical, psychic and spiritual strata of life is called Tantra. Tantra is not at all theoretical; it is essentially practical, and on the basis of practice, its philosophy has evolved. The major portion of the science of intuition in the Vedas, on the other hand,  is purely theoretical; only a small portion is practical. In Tantra, ninety percent of the intuitional science is practical, and only a very small portion is theoretical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The science of intuition in the Vedas has already been discussed extensively. Tantric literature, like Vedic, offers an elaborate treatment of intuitional science. Both Veda and Tantra have proclaimed that everything of this manifested universe emanates from Brahma. As the Vedas have put it:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;nanda&#x301;ddhyeva khalvima&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni ja&#x301;yante;<br>A&#x301;nandena ja&#x301;ta&#x301;ni jiivanti;<br>A&#x301;nandam&#x301; prayantyabhisam&#x301; vishanti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->And Tantra has expressed it similarly:<!-- /block --></p>

Those who are averse to struggle will never make any progress; what to speak of progress, without struggle one will lag behind. Hence, struggle is the essence of life. Those who abhor struggle, who consider struggle to be violence, have no place in this universe.

On the contrary, it advises spiritual aspirants that the more love and devotion they develop for the Cosmic Goal, the more speedily they move towards Him.

We distinguish between living and non-living entities on the basis of their movement. Those who lack in dynamism, though physically they may be alive, are virtually dead: there is no justification for their existence. Hence my exhortation to all is to become active, vigorously active.

The moment one transgresses one&#146;s jurisdiction out of vanity or ego, one is removed from that post. Whenever one misuses or abuses one&#146;s authority, the Lord pushes the person out, and the person falls on his knees. This is the rule. The Lord is controlling everything; He does not tolerate the abuse of power or authority by anyone. In fact, one of His names is Darpaha&#x301;rii [Stealer of Vanity]. He does not tolerate anyone&#146;s darpa [vanity].

No one can say with any certainty that a particular medicine will cure a particular disease. Even the physician who specializes in the treatment of that disease may himself die of that disease.

There is an old saying in Bengali, Sa&#x301;bdha&#x301;ner ma&#x301;ra nei, which means, &ldquo;Caution circumvents trouble;&rdquo; but Rabindranath Tagore once said that caution no doubt circumvents trouble, but it is also true that trouble sometimes circumvents caution!

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="20..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->During yesterday&#146;s DMC<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.20.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#20.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> I said something about Tantra. It is not enough to say that the ideological difference between Veda and Tantra is wide; rather one should say that it is very wide. Tantra is a practical and natural process and is thus easily practised and followed by the members of society. People easily accept it as their own.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There is a shloka in the Vedas that begins, Uttis&#x301;t&#x301;hata ja&#x301;grata pra&#x301;pya bara&#x301;n nibodhata &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Arise, awake. Seek a competent teacher and start moving along the path of spirituality.&rdquo; This is similar to the spirit of Tantra. But the Veda further says,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;urasya dha&#x301;ra&#x301; nishita&#x301; duratyaya&#x301; durgam&#x301; pathastat kavayo vadanti.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.20.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#20.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..4"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->That is, &ldquo;The path is as sharp as a razor&#146;s edge, so move along it carefully.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Here Tantra begins to differ from Veda. The process of Tantra progressively develops the qualities latent in human beings and at the same time eliminates the defects. In Tantra, therefore, there is no question of the path being as sharp as a razor&#146;s edge. Because of this spirit, a practitioner of Tantra becomes elevated and attains mastery over a hostile environment. Tantra does not accept the teachings of the Vedas that human beings should move internally, and carefully avoid any association with their environment. Rather, Tantra suggests that spiritual aspirants should rid their minds of fear from the very beginning. The Vedas maintain, however, that fear will be automatically removed from the mind some day in the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;; but who knows when that auspicious moment will come? It is not desirable to wait indefinitely for that. Moreover, while moving in this way, something unexpected might happen which might be detrimental to individual and collective growth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So Tantra advises, &ldquo;Jump into your environment without the least hesitation. Don&#146;t be afraid. Fear will leave you step by step. Tomorrow you will not be as fearful as you are today, the day after you will be even less fearful, and ten days from now you&#146;ll notice that you are completely fearless.&rdquo; The process of Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is formulated along these lines. The very first night that a Tantric goes to the burial ground he is stricken with fear; there is horripilation all over the body. But when he returns home after finishing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the mind is much lighter than before. When he goes out for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the next night, he is much less fearful. And thus the Tantric steadily and slowly overcomes fear. This is the applied process of Tantra which will help the practitioner overcome all mental propensities. In Tantra, there is a nice blending between the internal sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, an ongoing psychic process, and physico-psychic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In the Vedas, however, physico-psychic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is totally absent &ndash; only psychic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is practised, which may lead to trouble.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Tantra is of the opinion that the Vedas cannot fulfil the hopes of beginners on the spiritual path &ndash; the hopes of making some discernible spiritual progress at the outset. In fact there is often retardation. That is why the Vedic system of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; has been almost totally rejected by society. Even in the past it was not widely popular, and today it is practised by only a few people. And the little Vedic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; which is practised today is merely a few prayers to Parama Purus&#x301;a. For example, they pray, &ldquo;O Lord, show me the way. Please help me get Tantric initiation.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So Vedic initiation today is just the first step towards Tantric initiation. The sa&#x301;dhaka says, &ldquo;O Lord, I want to follow the path of spirituality and wish to practise the Tantric process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Please give me the opportunity to learn it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Sarve ca pashavah santi talavad bhu&#x301;tale nara&#x301;h:<br>Tes&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;napraka&#x301;sha&#x301;ya viirabha&#x301;vah praka&#x301;shitah;<br>Viirabha&#x301;vam&#x301; sada&#x301; pra&#x301;pya kramena devata&#x301; bhavet.<!-- /block --></p>

When one is unaware of the dos and don&#146;ts of life, one is no better than an animal. One will have to rise higher step by step.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When one masters the first stage of Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and acquires some knowledge and intellect and learns about the dos and don&#146;ts of life, one is no longer like an animal but is a veritable hero.&rdquo; In Tantra that system of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is called viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra. Viirabha&#x301;vam&#x301; sada&#x301; pra&#x301;pya kramena devata&#x301; bha&#x301;vet &ndash; &ldquo;while doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in viirabha&#x301;va [the ideation of viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra], the sa&#x301;dhaka merges in that viirabha&#x301;va.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And just as one who fights against the fear instinct is called a viira&#x301;ca&#x301;rii,  one who has overcome fear, who has gone beyond fear, is called a divya&#x301;ca&#x301;rii. And the divya&#x301;ca&#x301;rii who successfully defeats the ripus and the pa&#x301;shas<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.20.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#20.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and, rising above petty selfishness, identifies himself or herself with the collective interest, becomes one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. This gradual movement towards the supreme goal is the path of Tantra. It is a safe path where there is no scope for fear. And the naturalness of human life is not impaired under any circumstances.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The Tantric sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; introduced by Sada&#x301;shiva was the first sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to be given in this world. Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the only sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Without sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; there is no Tantra and without Tantra there is no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Tantra has yet another speciality. According to the Vedas, practical life is guided by theory. But the efficacy of a theory should first be tested in the practical sphere. Movement on the basis of an untested theory may or may not be fruitful. The theory of Tantra has been evolved on the basis of practical experience on the path. And as the theory is formulated on the basis of efficacy in the field of application, it always leads to success. It is infallible in applied life.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="21..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->During the last few days, I have been saying repeatedly that Tantra has its own special characteristics. Although Ananda Marga is essentially Tantra-oriented, it too has a few special features of its own.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As I have said previously, our ideology maintains that no one need be afraid of anything under any circumstances. If anyone does become afraid, it should be understood that he or she is doing something opposed to our ideology. So you should remember that no situation will ever arise in this world which will give you cause for fear.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It has been said that Parama Purus&#x301;a is the fear of fear. That is, fear is as afraid of Parama Purus&#x301;a as humans are afraid of [objects of] fear. Bhiis&#x301;an&#x301;am&#x301; bhiis&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301;na&#x301;m &ndash; &ldquo;He is the dread of all dreaded things.&rdquo; A feared object is as afraid of Parama Purus&#x301;a as others are afraid of it. So, as you are the progeny of Parama Purus&#x301;a, who or what can possibly give you cause to fear?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->I have also said that sins are just like the dust that settles on our clothes. By shaking the clothing, the dust will vanish. This simple action can be done by everyone. Ananda Marga has clarified that human beings are the progeny of Parama Purus&#x301;a and are thus the objects of His love and affection. Whatever might be the nature of the sins they commit, they will never be deprived of His affection. Parama Purus&#x301;a may scold them, but He can never hate them. He will simply shake the dust off their clothes and take them onto His lap. So the most important thing is complete surrender. People should always remember that they are the progeny of Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is enough.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In this regard something also should be clarified, something which differentiates the ideas of Ananda Marga from other established ideas. Ananda Marga is very different from isms and theories. We do not want to condemn people over very small or trivial matters, a practice which was common in our past society, ridden with various caste divisions and so on. According to our philosophy, only that injustice which harms others should be considered as pa&#x301;pa [sin].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In ancient times people were made outcastes on trivial charges of social crimes. We do not subscribe to such beliefs. According to us, the only error which may be considered as a sin is the one which harms society, and nothing else. In the past, mental wrongdoing was considered as a sin in all cases, according to the ancient Tantric traditions too. It is of course a fact that all sins first originate in the mind, that mental sins are transformed into external sins. But according to Ananda Marga, unless mental sins take external form, thus harming the society, they should not be considered punishable. (Sa&#x301;dhakas, however, will always rectify their mental sins, because they may take external form one day. If the mental sin does take an external form, it should be punished vigorously. An effective way of rectifying such a sin is to sing and dance kiirtana.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->One should not keep thinking again and again why such a thought came in the mind. It is useless to do so. You should continue to discharge your duties with an open mind, with full awareness of your responsibilities. You should not waste your time bothering about the minor deviations you make along the path of your movement. We are no longer like the ancient logicians or lawmakers. Our duty is to make the best use of the strength and capacity of the entire human race. To analyse everything threadbare or to suppress human strength and capacity or to limit human activities can never be considered as humanistic. Moreover, I do not think it good to criticize anyone behind their backs, saying, &ldquo;Well, Mr. So-and-so may be leading a virtuous life now, but don&#146;t you know, he was a terrible sinner in the past.&rdquo; We must forget the past. I said at the outset that sins are like the dust of the street that settles on clothing. We must shake this dust off and move ahead.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Those considered social criminals will have to accept punishment in accordance with the law. Even if society does not punish the wrongdoers, they are bound to be punished by Prakrti. Under no circumstances, however, will Parama Purus&#x301;a ever consider them as hated beings. One should not think, &ldquo;Oh, dear, dear, dear, I&#146;m such a sinner. Oh, how can I ever approach Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; Rather one should think that as one is a sinner one should rush up to Parama Purus&#x301;a as quickly as possible, saying, &ldquo;So much dust has accumulated on my clothes. How strange it is that You still haven&#146;t taken me on Your lap and shaken it all off.&rdquo; One should ask insistently why one was allowed to be covered with so much dust for so long.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Always remember that an effective way of freeing the mind from one&#146;s past sins is to sing and dance kiirtana. This will certainly bring about the desired result. You should also remember that no matter how many sins you have committed, you are never subject to hatred in the eyes of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He may scold you, but He cannot hate you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->I have said many a time that Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot do two things: He cannot create a second Parama Purus&#x301;a like Himself, because whoever has established an intimate friendship with Him, whoever has identified himself with Him, becomes one with Him. Secondly, however hard He may try, He can never hate anyone, because everything is in His mind. Even if He wanted to hate someone, to hate would mean that He was indirectly hating Himself. And that is why Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot hate anyone, even if He wants to. You should always remember this.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today in a short discourse I shall try to say something about diiks&#x301;a&#x301; [initiation] and its importance relative to the existence of a microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You know that in every sphere of life there is a need for some goal, or for some guiding factors that show the way to a goal. And if the sphere we speak of is human progress, in that sphere also such factors are necessary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I have already told you that human existence is an ideological flow. To accelerate human progress, we need very powerful guiding factors. The factor of will, for example, connects the physical and physico-psychic existence of human beings to spiritual existence, and merges it into that spiritual existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Guiding factors should come from a subtler source, and in the case of the spiritual initiation of a human being, those guiding factors emanate from Parama Purus&#x301;a. And this is why in A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> it has been clearly stated, Brahmaeva Gurureka na&#x301;parah &ndash; that is to say, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a alone is the Guru.&rdquo; All kinds of inspiration for human beings come from that source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As far as initiation is concerned, there are two types. The first type is usually known as Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;, and the second type is usually called Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->As you all know, the word veda means &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. In this sense Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; means that when inquisitive persons want to know what they should do, how they should do, and why they should do, they pray to Parama Purus&#x301;a, &ldquo;O Lord, I cannot see clearly because I am enveloped in blinding darkness. Out of Your grace, You show me the way. I cannot move by myself. Tell me, out of Your kindness, how I can move forward.&rdquo; When they receive a lesson in how to pray in such a way, this is called Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. The &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo; [a Vedic rk, or verse, composed in Ga&#x301;yatrii rhythm and therefore often known as the Ga&#x301;yatrii Mantra] and a few other rks of the Rgveda are mantras of this sort.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And thereafter, when the same persons, by His grace, learn the proper way to progress in the physical, psychic and spiritual spheres, that is called Tantrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..9"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->[By birth, everybody is a shu&#x301;dra, with an animal-like mentality. Going through a renewal, the person becomes a dvija, i.e., expresses the desire to become human. A person next becomes a vipra, an intellectual, by studying scriptures. And finally, when the person begins to realize Brahma (through psycho-spiritual initiation) he or she becomes a Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What is sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra? Here sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra means Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->After diiks&#x301;a&#x301;, the concerned person acquires considerable knowledge regarding how to do, what to do, why to do, and what his or her actual path should be. The person learns all these things. This is what is called Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. After following this path, that individual reaches the zenith of spirituality. He or she becomes a Brahman.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The word diiks&#x301;a&#x301; in Tantra has been defined:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Diipajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam yato dadya&#x301;t kurya&#x301;t pa&#x301;paks&#x301;ayam tatah; Tasma&#x301;tdiiks&#x301;eti sa&#x301; prokta&#x301; sarvatantrasya sammata&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..14"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->[The process which produces the capacity to realize the inner import of mantra and which expedites the requital of the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, or reactive momenta, is called diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Diipajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means &ldquo;torch&rdquo;, that is, the knowledge that takes a human being from the darkness of animality towards the effulgence of divinity. In the initial stage, human beings require a torch to light up the way for them. This is what is called diipajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. The initial letter of diipajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is dii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->And when a spiritual aspirant moves from the most negative point towards the ultimate positivity, what happens? His or her accumulated sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras start to become exhausted. That is, all his or her sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras start to wane. For this &ldquo;waning of sins&rdquo; the Sanskrit word is pa&#x301;pa&#x301;ks&#x301;ayam. The initial letter of ks&#x301;ayam [waning] is ks&#x301;a. So the dii of diipanii together with the ks&#x301;a of ks&#x301;ayam becomes diiks&#x301;a. And with the addition of the feminine suffix t&#x301;a, the word becomes diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Lord Sada&#x301;shiva is the father of all Tantric scriptures. According to Him, this is the real interpretation of the term diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. For psychic development and spiritual elevation, people will invariably have to pass through this process of initiation. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In a short discourse, I shall try to say something regarding diiks&#x301;a&#x301; and initiation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As you know, for want of sufficient vocabulary in certain tongues, we are to use some words having close proximity to the required term. [Here, for instance, we have to use the English word &ldquo;initiation&rdquo; for the Sanskrit diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. But] the word &ldquo;initiation&rdquo; cannot represent the spirit of diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. The rudimental meaning of &ldquo;initiation&rdquo; is &ldquo;to resort to a new avenue of progress&rdquo;. Certainly diiks&#x301;a&#x301; is a new avenue of progress, but diiks&#x301;a&#x301; is also something more.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The first thing to be known and remembered is that, as per the science of yoga, diiks&#x301;a&#x301; is divided into two important phases. The first phase is known as Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;, and the second phase is known as Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. In Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;, the aspirant requests the Supreme Entity, Parama Purus&#x301;a, to show him or her the path. It is not a cult; it is just requesting the Supreme Father to let him or her know the secrets of success in the stratum of spirituality. The Ga&#x301;yattrii Mantra (it is commonly known as the Ga&#x301;yattrii Mantra, but its actual name is the &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo;) is Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. Here the request is, &ldquo;O Lord, show me the path. O Lord, guide our intellect towards the supreme path, so that I may be one with the Supreme Entity.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->This is the &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Ga&#x301;yattrii Mantra&rdquo;. Here the aspirant says, Bhu&#x301;r bhuvah svah maha janah tapah satya asya saptalokasya savitur devasya, savitur pitur devasya, savitur devasya, tatpitur devasya, varen&#x301;yam bhargo dhiimahi, varen&#x301;yam pu&#x301;janiiyam, bhargo jyoti, dhiimahi bayam&#x301; dhya&#x301;nam kurmah, kena ka&#x301;ran&#x301;ena bayam&#x301; dhya&#x301;nam&#x301; kurmah.

<a name="23..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The exact English translation will be &ldquo;The Supreme Father who did create the seven strata of manifestation &ndash; we meditate on His divine effulgence. And why do we meditate on His divine effulgence? So that He may guide our intellect unto the path of bliss, unto the path of supreme blessedness.&rdquo; So here the prayer is to guide the brain unto the proper path. It is Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; &ndash; tan no dhiyo pracodaya&#x301;t &ndash; &ldquo;so that He may guide our intellect towards the path of blessedness&rdquo;&#8230; sah no buddhya&#x301; shubhaya&#x301; sam&#x301;yunaktu &ndash; &ldquo;so that He may connect our intellect with blessedness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So these things are Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. There is no scope for such an interpretation or such a phase in &ldquo;initiation&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now, the second phase is Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.  Actually this Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; is a cult. In the term &ldquo;initiation&rdquo; this cult is not properly clarified, or rather, nothing has been clearly said regarding this cult. As you know regarding the word tantra: tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;, and tra means &ldquo;liberator&rdquo;; so the science that frees the aspirant from the fetters of bondages by expansion &ndash; by expanding the mind, by expanding the existence &ndash; is Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Another meaning: ta is dullness, and tra means liberator. So the science that liberates the aspirant from dullness and expands his or her entire existence is Tantra &ndash; Tam&#x301; ja&#x301;dya&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah tantrah parikiirttitah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now this Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; has three phases, rather you may say three sub-phases: and they are diipanii, mantra&#x301;gha&#x301;ta and mantra caetanya. And the derivation of the word diiks&#x301;a&#x301; is also from diipanii:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Diipajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam yato dadya&#x301;t kurya&#x301;t pa&#x301;paks&#x301;ayam&#x301; tatah;<br>Tasma&#x301;tdiiks&#x301;eti sa&#x301; prokta&#x301; sarvatantrasya sammata&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..12"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->[The process which produces the capacity to realize the inner import of mantra and which expedites the requital of the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, or reactive momenta, is called diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Diipajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam. What is the first letter? Dii. Then, kurya&#x301;t pa&#x301;paks&#x301;ayam&#x301; tatah. Ks&#x301;ayam &ndash; what is the first letter? Ks&#x301;a. So the word becomes diiks&#x301;a, and the feminine term will be diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now what is diipanii? Everything lies coverted within the self. The Supreme Entity is also within your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. [He] is with you, but you do not know Him. That is, the Supreme Entity is with you, but You cannot see Him. You cannot realize Him. Why? Because you are covered by, you are surrounded by, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the cimmerian darkness of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. This diiks&#x301;a&#x301;, Tantrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;, is just like a torch. And by focusing the torch, you see your route through the darkness. That is why the first sub-phase is diipanii &ndash; diipanii means &ldquo;showing the torchlight&rdquo;. But no such thing is there in the term &ldquo;initiation&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Diiks&#x301;a&#x301; gives the aspirant the route, the way, or rather the path, of bliss. It shows the path of bliss. And to show the path of bliss, light is required; and that light is also supplied by diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. This light is diipanii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Then, pa&#x301;paks&#x301;ayam. You know what pa&#x301;pa is: pa&#x301;pa is negative reactive momenta. Whatever you do, the reaction is there, and when the reaction is not satisfied, not quenched, it remains in dormant form. The momentum is there, but not expressed. And there is also the case of positive work, that is, when you do something for the advancement of living beings &ndash; that is something positive, it is a positive action. In sama&#x301;ja sha&#x301;stra [social scriptures] this positive action is called pun&#x301;ya, and when you do something against the public interest, this negative action is known as pa&#x301;pa. Now this negative action in reactive form, that is, this negative reactive momentum, is called pa&#x301;pa; and pa&#x301;paks&#x301;ayam is brought about by diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. And how is that ks&#x301;ayam<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.23.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#23.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> to be effected? Through actions &ndash; through reactive actions.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.23.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#23.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  These reactive actions may be on the physical plane, or may be on the psychic plane. But diiks&#x301;a&#x301; teaches us how these reactive momenta are to be satisfied on the psychic plane, thus freeing the person from the bondages of pa&#x301;pa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now this process of freeing a person from the fetters of pa&#x301;pa is divided into two sub-phases: mantra&#x301;gha&#x301;ta and mantra caetanya. Mantra&#x301;gha&#x301;ta means, as I have already told you, that each and every mantra has the support of an acoustic root: and when that acoustic root strikes at the root of the coiled serpentine, it is aroused. This is called mantra&#x301;gha&#x301;ta. After that this roused coiled serpentine moves with the force, or the stamina, it gets from the mantra. It moves towards the supreme positivity, and this movement is called mantra caetanya. With the help of this mantra&#x301;gha&#x301;ta and mantra caetanya, a spiritual aspirant is freed from all the mundane bondages, bondages both on the physical and on the psychic plane.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So whereas in the case of &ldquo;initiation&rdquo; we see that it is just a resort to an avenue of progress and nothing more than that, nothing amplified, diiks&#x301;a&#x301; is divided into two phases, one primordial and the other final, and that final phase is further divided into three parts, or phases: diipanii, mantra&#x301;gha&#x301;ta and mantra caetanya. But as we have no proper word for diiks&#x301;a&#x301; in English or any other language, we have no alternative but to use the word &ldquo;initiation&rdquo; for diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. The actual Sanskrit word for the English term &ldquo;initiation&rdquo; is abhis&#x301;eka, not diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I invented kaos&#x301;ikii on September 6th [1978]. This dance is both an exercise, and a medicine for twenty-two diseases. It is a sort of panacea for almost all female diseases, and for many male diseases in younger boys. It is a medicine for most liver diseases. It assures safe deliveries for women, and also checks the advent of old age. It is a medicine.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava &ndash; which was not invented by me, but by Sada&#x301;shiva some seven thousand years ago &ndash; is an all-corporal exercise, an exercise for the entire body, including the brain. (There are intellectual exercises for the brain, but hardly any physical exercise. In fact, ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava is the only physical exercise for the brain.) And among all dances it is the best. But it is not for women.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit, tan&#x301;d&#x301;u means &ldquo;of jumping habit&rdquo;. You see, when rice is prepared from paddy [in the traditional rural way] the paddy and rice jump. Because of this, rice is called tan&#x301;d&#x301;ulam in Sanskrit. Tan&#x301;d&#x301;u plus the suffix sna makes ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava, the dance where jumping is the main thing. Now this dance was invented by Sada&#x301;shiva to maintain the physical and psychic purity of sa&#x301;dhakas. That may help them in their spiritual progress. And Pa&#x301;rvatii, the spouse of Shiva, invented lalita ma&#x301;rmika, which means &ldquo;voice of the inner spirit&rdquo;. The dance used for kiirtana is lalita ma&#x301;rmika. It represents the inner voice of the spiritual aspirant. The main thing in lalita ma&#x301;rmika is the expression through mudra&#x301;. In ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava there is no mudra&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Among the disciples, among the devotees, there was an altercation as to which dance should be accepted. It was decided that both should be equally accepted and equally respected. And as a result of this adjustment between ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava and lalita, Indian music was started &ndash; it is known as &ldquo;Indo-Aryan&rdquo; music. Indian music is divided into two schools, the A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta School and the Da&#x301;ks&#x301;ina&#x301;tya School. The common name for the A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta School is Hindustani Sangeet, and that for the Da&#x301;ks&#x301;ina&#x301;tya School is Karnataka Sangeet. As a result of this adjustment, Indian music was started. It was started by Sada&#x301;shiva, and that is why He is called Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja: Na&#x301;datanuna&#x301;t&#x301;esham&#x301; [&ldquo;The One whose very body is made out of the na&#x301;da &ndash; the primordial sound &ndash; is the Lord of the Dance.&rdquo;]. This adjustment first created the Indian ta&#x301;la. The first letter of ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava is ta, and the first letter of lalita is la &ndash; ta&#x301;la was created in Indian music.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Lalita is to be used during kiirtana. It is the only dance which is universally accepted as the best dance for kiirtana. Ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava is a heroic dance, showing the fight between life and death. The knife represents life, represents your vital stamina, and the skull represents the death that wants to destroy you. You are fighting against death with your weapon, be it a knife or a trishula (trident). And as per the rule, during the day, if one so desires, one may use a live snake in place of the skull; and at night one may use a fire masha&#x301;la [torch] or a d&#x301;amvaru [small drum].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.24.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#24.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> This is the rule. So ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava represents the eternal fight, the fight for survival, the fight to maintain existence, the fight to establish oneself as a man in this world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now during Maha&#x301;cakra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.24.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#24.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and several other discourses, there has been a vijaya for devotees. You know, in Sanskrit there are two similar words, jaya and vijaya. Jaya means &ldquo;victory&rdquo;, victory over the inimical force, but victory of temporary nature. When the enemy is defeated, you become a jayii; but in the next phase or in the next moment the enemy may again rise up, become victorious &ndash; you may be defeated. And what is vijaya? Vijaya means &ldquo;victory of a permanent nature when the enemy is completely destroyed&rdquo;. I think during the past few discourses there has been a vijaya for devotees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the course of spiritual achievement, spiritual progress, the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii is alone in the field, as indeed is the karmii. But the devotee<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.24.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#24.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is always sitting on the lap of the Cosmic Father and is never alone. In the sha&#x301;stras it has been said that the devotees know that the Cosmic Father maintains His relationship with His children always through ota yoga and prota yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->What is ota yoga? The Cosmic Father has a direct relationship with each and every entity of this world, animate or inanimate. Not a single grain of sand nor a single blade of grass is neglected by Him. All are his affectionate children. This is His ota yoga.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.24.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#24.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Each and every entity, animate or inanimate, has a direct link with Him, and thus nobody can ever be alone in the world. It is His duty to look after His children. So a devotee can never develop the psychology of melancholia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->You know, &ldquo;melancholia&rdquo; means to feel hopeless, helpless &ndash; &ldquo;There is no one to love me.&rdquo; Devotees never feel this type of melancholia, because they know that they are always with their Supreme Father. But jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis suffer from such diseases. You will find psychic diseases, insanity mostly, among jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis, among so-called learned and intellectual people. Bhaktas, however, never suffer from these diseases. They are free from all psychic diseases. And the devotee&#146;s march is a march to serve the Supreme Entity in a better way, not to attain any emancipation or salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The devotees know that whatever their Supreme Father will do for them is best for them. They never ask for anything, mundane, supramundane or psychic, because they know their actual needs, their actual necessities, are better known to their Father. A child of two months does not know what it requires; its mother knows. It is solely dependent upon its mother. Similarly, devotees are solely dependent on the Cosmic Father, and for that reason the Cosmic Father has a special responsibility for the devotees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->I have already said that devotees never develop any psychological ailment or psychological depression, even if they are sinners. You know, while moving along the road, your body or your clothes may come in contact with dust and dirt &ndash; this is what is called &ldquo;sin&rdquo; in society. And if your body or your clothes become filthy due to any sort of dirt or dust, others may laugh at you, others may ridicule you, others may hate you, but your father cannot ridicule you, cannot hate you, cannot laugh at you. What is his duty? Then and there he will come and put you on his lap and clean you. He will wash your clothes and say, &ldquo;Oh, my child, while moving along the road, be a bit careful.&rdquo; This is the relationship of the Cosmic Father with pa&#x301;piis [sinners]. And the devotees know this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->But the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis and karmiis say that each and every action has an equal and opposite reaction, provided that the three fundamental relative factors remain unchanged. Very dangerous, very dangerous! And that is why they suffer from so many psychic diseases; they are afraid of the sins they have committed in the past. But the devotees know, &ldquo;My Father is there; He may punish me, but He will free me from all those bondages, all those fetters.&rdquo; So devotees are always carefree. And as I told you, devotees are cunning people. Not only are they intelligent, they are also cunning. That is why I said that devotees are A-grade intellectuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->You see, the path of dharma is kut&#x301;ila for those jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis and karmiis, but for devotees it is straight. Dharmasya kut&#x301;ila gatih [&ldquo;The path of dharma is kut&#x301;ila, tortuous&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It is kut&#x301;ila for whom? For jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis and karmiis?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Ks&#x301;urasya dha&#x301;ra&#x301; nishita&#x301; duratyaya&#x301; durgam&#x301; pathastad kavayo vadanti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..16"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->[The edge of a razor is very sharp and difficult to walk on. Similarly, the path to the Absolute is difficult to follow. This is what realized persons say.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..17"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Those jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis will say, &ldquo;It is a dangerous path!&rdquo; &ndash; durgam&#x301; pathastad kavayo vadanti. In Vedic Sanskrit, kavi means &ldquo;learned man&rdquo;, &ldquo;scholar&rdquo;, not &ldquo;poet&rdquo;. (In laokika [comparatively recent] Sanskrit, kavi means &ldquo;poet&rdquo;.) Those scholars, those jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis, say it is a durgam path. What does durgam mean? &ldquo;Not easy to move&rdquo;. But what is it for a devotee? Sukhamanantama&#x301;nandam [&ldquo;Spiritual bliss is equal to infinite pleasure&rdquo;]. It is a straight path, it is a movement that ends in union with the Supreme Father. So there is nothing durgam in it; rather it is very easy, it is very natural. So my advice to you all is, feel His existence within your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24..19"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[The scriptures differ, the social codes differ; each sage has a different opinion. The essence of dharma lies deep in the mind; the path followed by realized persons is the true path.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->So many scriptures say so many things. What is an ordinary person to do? Which scripture is to be followed and which is not to be followed? What is what and which is which? A person may be in a dilemma to decide what to do, and what not to do. Shrutayo vibhinna&#x301;h &ndash; &ldquo;The scriptures vary from one another.&rdquo; Smrtayo vibhinna&#x301;h (smrti means &ldquo;social code&rdquo;) &ndash; &ldquo;social codes also vary from one another.&rdquo; In the past there was Na&#x301;rada Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;, Para&#x301;sara Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;, Manu Smrti; and now all the smrtis have been replaced by the Hindu Code Bill. There are so many social codes. What is an ordinary person to do?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The pandits, the propounders of those social codes, vary from one another. One says, &ldquo;Do this.&rdquo; Another says, &ldquo;No, no, no, do this.&rdquo; Somebody will say that while doing your upa&#x301;sana&#x301; [prayers] you should face east; some will say, &ldquo;No, no, no, face west.&rdquo; What are ordinary persons to do? They are at a loss to know what to do.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24..23"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;There is not a single muni who does not differ from other munis.&rdquo; Muni means &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;. Muni means maniis&#x301;i &ndash; &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;. However, Tantra says, &ldquo;No, no, no, those intellectuals are not munis.&rdquo; According to Tantra, muni means, Na munih dugdhaba&#x301;lakah munih sam&#x301;liina ma&#x301;nasah &ndash; &ldquo;Those so-called intellectuals, so-called scholars, are not actually munis, or actually intellectuals.&rdquo; Munih sam&#x301;liina ma&#x301;nasah &ndash; &ldquo;Those whose minds have become one with the Supreme Entity, whose ma&#x301;nasa has become sam&#x301;liina with Parama Purus&#x301;a, are munis.&rdquo; Naekamunir yasya matam&#x301; na bhinnam.<!-- /block --></p>

This &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, this feeling of &ldquo;I exist&rdquo;, is called guha&#x301;. The spirit of dharma, the spirit of Parama Purus&#x301;a, lies hidden within your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. So in order to get Him, in order to discover Him, search within your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, and not hither and thither &ndash; not on this tiirtham [site of pilgrimage] or that tiirtham.<!-- /block --></p>

That connecting point, that common point, is called tiirtha. Tiirastham&#x301; ityarthe tiirtham.

And when one comes in contact with Him, one will know all the secrets of the universe. Because all the secrets of the universe are known only to Parama Purus&#x301;a, and to nobody else, not to any jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis or any [karmiis].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->A few months back a very knotty question was placed before me. The question was knotty, no doubt, but the reply was not at all knotty. The reply was very simple. The question concerned the fact that almost all the scriptures of the past said that women are not eligible for salvation. Almost all the scriptures of almost all the so-called faiths said that before the attainment of salvation, women will have to come back in male framework. And those other faiths where there is no scope for rebirth, said that women will have to wait for the final day of judgment, that is, doomsday, before they can get or expect any salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Certainly it was a knotty problem, rather, a knotty question. But according to Ananda Marga, women have equal rights in each and every sphere, so why shouldn&#146;t they also have the right to attain salvation? You see, boys and girls are just like the two hands of the father. The father loves the little girl as much as he loves the little boy. And would the father want his boy to attain supreme bliss and his girl to burn in the fire of hell? Certainly not. If one says this, one is not doing justice to the Supreme Father. To say this is bad, extremely bad.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii asked Lord Shiva, &ldquo;O Lord, what is the minimum qualification for becoming a spiritual aspirant?&rdquo; You know, for each and every job in the newspaper advertisement column, it will say, &ldquo;The minimum qualification is this or that.&rdquo; So Pa&#x301;rvatii&#146;s question was, &ldquo;What is the minimum qualification for becoming a spiritual aspirant?&rdquo; Pa&#x301;rvatii&#146;s question was a healthy one, no doubt, a very healthy question. And the following reply was given by Shiva, I think about seven thousand years ago when He was here in India (but the question was not placed before Shiva in English):<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;namidam&#x301; Devi param&#x301; moks&#x301;aeka sa&#x301;dhanam;<br>Sukrtaerma&#x301;navo bhu&#x301;tva&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niicenmoks&#x301;ama&#x301;pnuya&#x301;t.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..5"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[Self-knowledge is the greatest means to attain salvation. People are born as human beings due to their past good sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, but to attain non-qualified liberation they will have to attain self-knowledge.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->To attain salvation one is to know oneself; that is, knowledge, the projection of the knowing faculty, should not be outside, it should be inside. Inwardly-projected actional expression is a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam, and outwardly-projected actional expression is aparajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam. One should acquire a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam, that is, one should have inwardly-projected actional manifestations. And this is the route, this is the way, this is the path of salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And who is to acquire this a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam and finally attain salvation? Sukrtaerma&#x301;navo bhu&#x301;tva&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niicenmoks&#x301;ama&#x301;pnuya&#x301;t. By passing through so many frameworks of so many animals and so many other beings, one acquires the human framework, one gets the human structure. And when one gets the human structure, one becomes eligible for self-knowledge, a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam. And by dint of acquiring that a&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam, one attains salvation. So Shiva&#146;s reply is that the minimum qualification for getting salvation, for doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, is just a human structure. He never said that it should be a male structure, that it should be the body of a male. He said it should be the body of a human being. The question was raised by an honourable woman, Pa&#x301;rvatii, and Shiva&#146;s reply satisfied her very much. About seven thousand years ago this was said by Shiva. So as per Tantra, women have an equal right to attain salvation, and there has been no differentiation made by Shiva in this respect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And you see, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a also said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25..14"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->[Just as one&#146;s own life is precious to oneself, the lives of other created beings are precious to those beings; so those who are really virtuous treat other beings as they would themselves.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->For each and every living being, one&#146;s personal life is very dear, very costly. Each living being has love for their own life. A man who, knowing this fact, realizing this fact, loves others as he loves himself, is called a sa&#x301;dhu. A man should not be carnivorous, like cats, dogs and tigers. A man must not eat meat but must love each and every living being as he loves himself. Such a man is called sa&#x301;dhu. Such a man &ndash; here &ldquo;man&rdquo; is in the common gender, not the male gender &ndash; may be a male, or may be a female. You know, &ldquo;man&rdquo; is not only masculine gender, &ldquo;man&rdquo; is common gender also. &ldquo;Man is mortal&rdquo; &ndash; here &ldquo;man&rdquo; means both male and female.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now, Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;na&#x301;m. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said, &ldquo;Just to save these sa&#x301;dhus&rdquo; (sa&#x301;dhu means one who loves others as he/she loves himself/herself<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.25.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#25.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->) &ndash; &ldquo;for their paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; &rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->(Tra&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;to save&rdquo;. Tra&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;relief work&rdquo;, which as you know is called tra&#x301;n&#x301;a ka&#x301;rya in Sanskrit. What&#146;s the difference between tra&#x301;n&#x301;a and paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a? Here Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a says, Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;m. Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;saving permanently&rdquo;. Suppose you have saved a person from some danger: if that saving is of a temporary nature, it is tra&#x301;n&#x301;a. During flood and famines you do tra&#x301;n&#x301;a work. You do not help people permanently, but give them temporary relief, so it is tra&#x301;n&#x301;a. But when permanent relief is given, when people are saved from the attacks of demons permanently, then it is called paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a. When one is freed from all the worldly fetters, it is permanent relief. And this permanent relief is for sa&#x301;dhus. Sa&#x301;dhu includes both males and females. Thus Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a supports Shiva.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;m vina&#x301;sha&#x301;ya ca dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m. &ldquo;For the annihilation of, for the destruction of, dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m&rdquo; (dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m means &ldquo;antisocial elements&rdquo;)&#8230; dharmasam&#x301;stha&#x301;pana&#x301;rtha&#x301;ya. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a does as He does for what, what is the purpose? For the sam&#x301;stha&#x301;pana of dharma. Stha&#x301;pana means placing an entity in its right position. Suppose dharma is in its right position. Due to many factors, it may become degraded. This degradation is called gla&#x301;ni. If it is placed back in its right position, where it was and where it should be, this is called stha&#x301;pana. But here Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a says, sam&#x301;stha&#x301;pana, that is, &ldquo;placing it in its proper position and making proper arrangement to keep it in its proper position&rdquo;. Dharma sam&#x301;stha&#x301;pana&#x301;rtha&#x301;ya sambhava&#x301;mi yuge yuge &ndash; &ldquo;I come here again and again.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Here Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a never says that women have no right to attain salvation. So on behalf of the philosophy of Ananda Marga, and also on behalf of the cult of Tantra, I hereby announce that males and females, who are the boys and girls of Parama Purus&#x301;a, the sons and daughters of Parama Purus&#x301;a, have an equal birthright to attain salvation. Those who say that women are not entitled to the same are antisocial elements. They represent vested interests.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Those who consider themselves greatly learned, and proudly state that they know, do not really know. Those persons who, on the other hand, think that they do not know anything, may be the ones who actually know. So if we want to know who is knowledgeable and who is ignorant, it will be very difficult to arrive at a correct judgment. Offhand we cannot make any comment. Just phat&#x301; kare [impulsively], we cannot say anything. Before deciding we shall have to ponder very deeply.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->I shall conclude with a few remarks on a particular word I just used &ndash; the word phat&#x301;. In the Tantric system of old there were three biijas [acoustic roots] &ndash; phat&#x301;, vas&#x301;at&#x301; and vaos&#x301;at&#x301;. Before performing different sorts of kriya&#x301; [work], one of the biijas would be uttered. This was the system. In whatever the work, the biija was quickly transformed into action. That is to say, the thought process was made to act very quickly. An example would be if someone had a sudden desire to go to Cuttack and he or she set out then and there &ndash; he or she gave his or her wish an immediate actional form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->So in this Tantric system, if one wanted to transform his or her work or thought into quick action, then the phat&#x301; mantra was uttered before performing the action. Therefore we still say [in Bengali] that such-and-such person is doing something phat&#x301;-phat&#x301; &ndash; is doing something very phat&#x301;-phat&#x301;. Phat&#x301; is that Tantric biija. Bar&#x301;r&#x301;a phat&#x301;phat&#x301;a&#x301;ni &ndash; loke bale na&#x301; sab! [&ldquo;This man is blurting out his thoughts abruptly and impulsively!&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And as I said, one cannot tell phat&#x301; kare whether a particular person is a learned person or a fool. One has to think a great deal before commenting on such a thing. Here it is better not to apply the Tantric biija, phat&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today I will relate to you an episode of Tantric history &ndash; an episode which has almost been lost. I think you all know that Sada&#x301;shiva was the first Tantric Maha&#x301;kaola on this planet. His mission was Kurvantu vishvam&#x301; Ta&#x301;ntrikam &ndash; &ldquo;To get the whole universe initiated into the Tantric cult&rdquo;. To become a Tantric means to fight directly against the opposing forces and obstacles on the path of progress and to preach the lofty gospels of universal humanism. That human beings are the greatest of all living beings is to be proven in action, not in mere words or theoretical moral principles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In that early phase of human civilization, there were more rifts and clashes among the different clans and tribes than there are today. It was therefore safer for human beings to live on hills. Later, with the development of civilization, they moved down to the plains and settled in woods and forests.  But in those early days, they would sleep in hill-caves after blocking the entrances with big rocks. Fire had not yet been discovered, so they could not protect themselves by burning fires around their encampments in the caves and forests. Fire was discovered much later.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The hills on which people used to live were called gotras in Vedic Sanskrit. So if a person called Ra&#x301;ma lived on a certain hill, the hill was called &ldquo;Ra&#x301;magotra&rdquo;. Similarly, the hill where Shya&#x301;ma lived was known as &ldquo;Shya&#x301;magotra&rdquo;, and all the people who lived on it belonged to that gotra. This was the system followed in that early period of social development. Prior to that [patriarchal system], each hill was ruled by a gotrama&#x301;ta&#x301;, or clan mother. The clan members would all obey her and would introduce themselves by her name; and likewise the hill itself would be named after that matriarch. These days this system has evolved into a dogmatic clan or caste system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So each hill was named after its sage. If Mahars&#x301;i Ka&#x301;shyapa [The Great Sage Ka&#x301;shyapa] was the leader of a hill clan, that clan was called Ka&#x301;shyapagotra. If Mahars&#x301;i Bharadva&#x301;ja was the leader, it was called Bharadva&#x301;jagotra. Thus, the early matriarchal system was followed by a patriarchal system of leadership.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Those people who lived on the same hill under a common patriarch lived just like brothers and sisters. However, they considered the members of other hill communities to be their deadly enemies. And since all on one hill were brothers and sisters, they could not marry among themselves. So what would they do in order to marry? One clan would defeat a neighbouring clan in battle, and they would forcibly drag the vanquished women, with hands bound, back to their own hill for a life of domestic servitude. The males of the defeated clan were utilized as slaves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Even to this day, there is a custom whereby the mother asks her son on the eve of his marriage, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; He replies, &ldquo;I&#146;m going to bring you a maid-servant.&rdquo; It comes from those days when the victorious clan would drag the defeated women back to its own hill. Not only that &ndash; to bind someone you need a rope or a chain ([now] called a ga&#x301;nt&#x301;char&#x301;a&#x301;).<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The women would be brought back in those days with chains on their wrists, otherwise they might run away. The iron bangle that a married woman wears today is a symbol of that early servitude. In those days women also fought in battle, and were often hit on the head and severely injured. A small vermilion mark then came to represent the blood streaming from their cracked heads. But today a woman must wear that vermilion mark if she is to be recognized as married. This is quite different from the original idea. Actually these are all just different dogmas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga I have said that those who wish to use vermilion as a decorative mark may do so. Some women like to wear plastic bangles, others like to wear iron ones. I am not going to object to the use of these ornaments. Similarly, if someone uses vermilion on the forehead I have nothing to say against it, because that, too, is a matter of decoration. Those who like to use  vermilion may do so. I hope, however, that the original reason for the use of vermilion is clear.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So even today women bear the mark of servitude by wearing iron bangles on their wrists, thus giving the impression that they have been vanquished; they still use the vermilion which originally symbolized bloodshed; they still tie the ga&#x301;nt&#x301;char&#x301;a&#x301; after marriage, which symbolizes their being forcibly carried away; and the bridegroom still often says to his mother on the eve of his departure for the marriage, &ldquo;I&#146;m going to bring you a maid-servant.&rdquo; How absurd! No one is anyone&#146;s servant. The system of slavery was abolished long ago. You should oppose these dogmatic beliefs. They are very objectionable. You should understand the history behind them, and then do the right thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There were three main ethnic groups in India in those days: Austric, Mongolian,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and Negroid. In [East] India they all mingled into one. The dark-complexioned non-Aryan Austrics were the original people of India, and thus there is Austric blood in most of the present population of India. The Bengalees, being a mixture of these three groups, evolved in a particular way and developed a particular psychology. They have developed certain morphological characteristics from which one can easily deduce that they are Bengali. Their physical appearance and nature are a result of a special type of blood mixture. Those groups which have mixed blood are generally very intelligent, and the Bengali people are no exception. Besides being intelligent, they have other marked psychological traits which characterize them as Bengalees: they are sports fanatics, even those who do not play any sport themselves, and they are equally mad for open-air theatre and established theatre. These psychological traits result from the integration of the different racial groups.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In the days of Shiva, three ethnic groups intermingled. One was the Austric group, the black non-Aryan people; the second was the Mongolian group who came to India from the north, that is from Tibet and China; and the third was the fair-complexioned Aryan group which entered India from the west. The Aryans are further divided into three groups. The Aryans of the far north are Nordic. Their complexion is reddish-white, their hair is reddish and the irises of their eyes are brown, which is to say also reddish. The second group, the Alpine group, have bluish hair, bluish irises and a pinkish-white complexion. The third group, the Mediterranean group, have a milky-white complexion, black hair and blackish irises. The Aryans who settled in India came mostly from this Mediterranean group, and converged, as mentioned, with the Mongolians from the north [and with the Austrics].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There was a general disharmony among these three groups that had converged in India, expressed in numerous feuds and clashes among the various hill clans. In those days, a war party would ride fully armed to a rival hill to bring a woman back by force. Even today, in certain parts of India, the bridegroom and his party act this out as a marriage ritual by riding on horseback fully armed to the marriage ceremony and staging a mock battle. The leader of the group, that is the bridegroom, is called bara, which in Sanskrit means &ldquo;best of the lot&rdquo;, because on that day he is the most important man.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->This predominantly racial conflict among the different hill clans was raging fiercely during the period of Lord Shiva. Shiva worked hard to cultivate a perfect friendship among the three warring groups. He knew that in the absence of such a friendship, the future of humanity was dark. Just as Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a wanted to unite all the people of the then India and create a Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata [Great India], similarly, Shiva wanted to unite the three warring groups. He thought that his lofty spiritual cult and ideology and his unique school of medicine would not be properly conveyed to future generations if the people continued their racial battles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Those were also the days of polygamy. Shiva himself had three wives &ndash; Pa&#x301;rvatii, an Aryan girl; Ka&#x301;lii, an Austrico-Dravidian girl; and Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;, a Mongolian girl. He hoped these marriages would restore the spirit of friendship among the three races. With the help of his three wives, he propagated the gospels of dharma and the practices of Tantra. It was a great advantage for Shiva that he was accepted as a god equally by the Aryans, the Mongolo-Tibetans and the Austrics. Much later, even the Buddhists and the Jains accepted him as their god, because Shiva wanted to bring about a blending of the human race. This is the same Shiva who was known among Buddhists as Bat&#x301;uka Bhaerava. From &ldquo;Bat&#x301;uka&rdquo; come words such as &ldquo;Bur&#x301;o&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bar&#x301;uya&#x301;&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bur&#x301;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bor&#x301;a&#x301;&rdquo; [all applied to Shiva] and &ldquo;Bur&#x301;oshiva&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In many cities and towns of Bengal you will come across [the place name] Bur&#x301;oshivatala&#x301;. Bur&#x301;oshiva was the Shiva of the Buddhists. In Calcutta, the area around Bur&#x301;oshivatala&#x301; became known as Bur&#x301;o Ba&#x301;ja&#x301;r [ba&#x301;ja&#x301;r = &ldquo;bazaar&rdquo;, &ldquo;market&rdquo;]. Many people from Marwar settled there and it became a prosperous market, but it became wrongly pronounced &ldquo;Bar&#x301;a Ba&#x301;ja&#x301;r&rdquo; [&ldquo;Big Market&rdquo;]. In fact, originally it was not a big market. Of course, there are Bar&#x301;a Ba&#x301;ja&#x301;rs in many cities, but this Bar&#x301;a Ba&#x301;ja&#x301;r in Calcutta was not named because it was a &ldquo;big market&rdquo;; rather it was the market area surrounding the Bur&#x301;oshiva temple.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Later Shiva felt that there should be proper media to propagate the grand and lofty ideals He was teaching. Toma&#x301;r pata&#x301;ka&#x301; ya&#x301;re da&#x301;o ta&#x301;re bahiba&#x301;re da&#x301;o shakti [&ldquo;Give strength to the person to whom you give the flag to carry&rdquo;]. Otherwise who would be able to carry forth so much knowledge, wisdom, intellect, and such a deep spiritual cult? Incompetent people cannot be expected to carry the legacy of anything. If I teach something to an incompetent or undesirable person, it will bear no fruit, it will get wasted. A heron can never learn to speak like a mynah bird, no matter how much it is trained. The incompetent person is just like the heron. What did Shiva do about this?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii had a son called Bhaerava, and Ka&#x301;lii a daughter named Bhaeravii. Shiva first taught Bhaerava Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, or ka&#x301;pa&#x301;lika sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (the Tantric sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; which utilizes the human skull); and the ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava dance. Since then all those people who have learned the Tantric practices have also been called Bhaerava, they all introduce themselves by the name Bhaerava. They lose their individual names such as Ra&#x301;ma, Shya&#x301;ma, Tom or Dick, and automatically become a part of Shivagotra [the Family of Shiva].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Shiva proclaimed, &ldquo;You are all mine. Whatever hill you live on you are still my own. I will think well of you. I will think about your collective welfare. I will work for your collective well-being. Come one and all to me safely and fearlessly and tell me your needs. I will help you. A&#x301;tmagotram&#x301; parityajya Shivagotram&#x301; pravishatu [&lsquo;Leave your own gotra and enter Shivagotra&rsquo;].&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Whoever is a spiritualist has left his or her own gotra and has entered the Shivagotra. In Ananda Marga also, separate gotras are not recognized. All belong to Shivagotra. I have only stated that at the time of marriage the bride and bridegroom should not have any direct relationship three generations above and three generations below.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> If this condition is not met, the marriage should not be solemnized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Ananda Margis have no caste or gotra. I have said before also that the division of humanity into Ka&#x301;shyapagotra, Bharadva&#x301;jagotra, etc., is nonsensical. This is just to mislead people. If we look back in [anthropology] we will see that the forefathers of the present-day humans were apes or ape-men. So if people are very particular about their gotras, I will say to their faces, &ldquo;Boys and girls! You belong to the ape gotra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->We have all descended from our common ancestors, the apes. The same is true in relation to the castes. [One might try to argue that] the forefathers of the Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;as were the ape-Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;as and the forefathers of the Ks&#x301;atriyas were the ape-Ks&#x301;atriyas; but that just isn&#146;t so. As apes do not have any particular caste, the present-day caste differences are all hypocrisy and maliciousness. You should remove even the least vestige of these nonsensical notions. You must not give credence to such things.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->So Shiva taught Bhaerava. Then He thought: &ldquo;If I teach this only to my son; that is, if my son alone knows this secret spiritual cult, this great asset for humanity, and my daughter remains ignorant, then fifty per cent of the society will remain a burden for the other fifty per cent; that is, the women  will remain a burden for the men, and the movement of the men also will be greatly impeded.&rdquo; Even in those days, seven thousand years ago, Shiva thought in this way. &ldquo;If I only give the strength and responsibility to carry the burden to my son, Bhaerava, that will not be good. I will also have to give some of the responsibility to my daughter, Bhaeravii.&rdquo; And that is what He did. And since that day, any woman practising Tantra is known as Bhaeravii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->His other wife, Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;, had a son called Ka&#x301;rttikeya, but he was more of a dandy. Even though he wished to, he did not have the moral courage to practice Tantra. The practice of Tantra requires a little courage &ndash; it is not for cowards. (Some people say that Ka&#x301;rttikeya was known as Devasena&#x301;pati and was a general of the gods [deva means &ldquo;god&rdquo; and sena&#x301;pati means &ldquo;military general&rdquo;], but the fact of the matter is different. Ka&#x301;rttikeya&#146;s wife was called Deva&#x301;sena&#x301;, and so he was Deva&#x301;sena&#x301;&#146;s pati [husband], or Deva&#x301;sena&#x301;pati. You should remove this common misunderstanding. If people say that Ka&#x301;rttikeya was the general of the gods, they are wrong.) Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; was a little sad that the son of one of her co-wives and the daughter of her other co-wife were taught the practice of Tantra while her own son turned out bad. To console her and help her forget her sadness, Shiva gave her extra love and affection. This did not please his other wives, Pa&#x301;rvatii and Ka&#x301;lii, who naturally complained to him about this. But actually, what he did was right. There is a rhyme about Shiva&#146;s marriage to three girls:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..23"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->T&#x301;a&#x301;pur t&#x301;upur vrs&#x301;t&#x301;i par&#x301;e nadey elo ba&#x301;n<br>Shivt&#x301;ha&#x301;kurer biye habhe tin kanya&#x301; da&#x301;n.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="27..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Those three girls were Pa&#x301;rvatii, Ka&#x301;lii and Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;. People used to complain that Shiva was &ldquo;dancing with Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; on His head.&rdquo; (Suppose you are doting on someone, people will say that you are &ldquo;dancing with So-and-so on your head&rdquo;.) In later days, people completely misinterpreted the facts and made statues of Shiva with Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;&#146;s head placed on his head and water flowing from her mouth.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> These are all mythological interpretations. Could such a thing ever be possible? The poet Bharat Chandra Raygunakar wrote in his famous magnum opus:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..26"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; na&#x301;me satii ta&#x301;r taraun&#x32D;ga emani<br>Jiivanasvaru&#x301;pa sei sva&#x301;mii shiroman&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..27"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->[Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; the blessed one is the jewel sitting on Shiva&#146;s head with water flowing from her mouth.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Here shiroman&#x301;i means &ldquo;a jewel placed on one&#146;s head&rdquo;. If you are doting on someone, people will say that you are &ldquo;dancing with So-and-so on your head&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Thus we see that even in those days Shiva did not accept any differentiation between males and females. He taught Tantra to both his son and his daughter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Let me tell you a short story about Ka&#x301;lii. One night she thought, &ldquo;What will happen if my little daughter meets with any danger when she goes out to practise Tantra? Let me go out and help her.&rdquo; In Tantra, however, it is not permitted to intervene in anyone&#146;s individual practices. Bhaeravii went out and practised her sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; according to the instructions she had received. Shiva was already absorbed in sama&#x301;dhi in the burial ground. Ka&#x301;lii thought, &ldquo;Even if Shiva is able to see me from a distance on this dark new-moon night he won&#146;t be able to tell who I actually am &ndash; he&#146;ll think I&#146;m Bhaeravii.&rdquo; Now while walking in the darkness, Ka&#x301;lii accidentally stepped on Shiva&#146;s chest. When she realized whom she was stepping on, she felt ashamed and stuck out her tongue [a sign of embarrassment or shame in India]. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Shiva. Ka&#x301;lii was dressed like Bhaeravii to misguide Shiva, but how could she introduce herself as Bhaeravii, their daughter, to her own husband? So Ka&#x301;lii said, &ldquo;I&#146;m Kaoverii.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (In southern India there is a river named Kaoverii. People mistakenly call it &ldquo;Ka&#x301;verii&rdquo;. The actual Sanskrit word is &ldquo;Kaoverii&rdquo;. The English spelling was at one time &ldquo;Cauveri&rdquo;.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->In any case, Ka&#x301;lii said that she was Kaoverii, a name she has also been called ever since. Those who do not know the story in the proper context say that Shiva was lying down and Ka&#x301;lii was standing on his chest with her tongue stuck out.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->From a study of history we learn that in those days there was no differentiation between men and women regarding spiritual practices or the spiritual code of conduct. To enable the entire society to develop what He propounded in social, economic, educational, medical, scientific and artistic fields, Shiva taught His daughter in the same way that He taught His son. Shiva was the original propounder of Tantra and the first Maha&#x301;kaola. Those who oppose what Shiva did are to be treated as opportunists. If they wish to keep women subjugated, to curtail women&#146;s natural rights, they are opposed to Shiva and the code of dharma. In fact, I should say that they are veritable demons, and such demons in human form cast a shadow on the glory of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know that even before Sada&#x301;shiva there was dance, there was music; people used to sing, also; but everything was in a disorderly manner. The dexterous hands of Sada&#x301;shiva made it a science &ndash; rather, an artistic science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is not an easy job to dance properly and correctly. The fundamental requirements, or the fundamental spirit, of dance, instrumental music, and song were brought within the framework of science by Sada&#x301;shiva, and that is why He is also known as &ldquo;Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja&rdquo;: &ldquo;Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja&rdquo; means &ldquo;King of the Dancers&rdquo;. (And another name of Sada&#x301;shiva is &ldquo;Na&#x301;datanu&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;music personified&rdquo;.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Dance is a highly-developed art. In the Oriental variety of music, you know, three items come within the fold of <i>sam&#x301;giita,</i> or music: dance, song, and instrumental music. The collective name in Sanskrit is <i>sam&#x301;giita</i>. Lord Sada&#x301;shiva brought everything within the framework of science, and just now I called it &ldquo;artistic science&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the Oriental variety of dance there are several <i>mudra&#x301;s,</i> that is, postures. When giving something to a living being, the <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this [demonstrates]. When giving something to something past, not present in the world, the <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this [demonstrates]. The &ldquo;don&#146;t fear&rdquo; <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this. The &ldquo;take what you want&rdquo; <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this. The &ldquo;come forward&rdquo; <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this. The &ldquo;be serpentine&rdquo; <i>mudra&#x301;</i> is like this. &ldquo;Be subtle, maintain a link with the earth&rdquo; is like this. There are so many <i>mudra&#x301;s</i> used in the Oriental variety of dance. It is not an easy job to learn it, but rather a very difficult job.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now the fundamentality, or rather the primordial phase of Oriental dance, is <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>. It is not a very easy job either. The knees must cross the navel. When they cross the navel it is called <i>Brahma ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>. When they cross the <i>ana&#x301;hata</i> [mid-point of the chest] it is called <i>Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>. When they cross this portion [indicates the throat], it is called <i>Rudra ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>. It is very difficult to dance <i>Rudra ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>. It requires long practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->That is why Lord Sada&#x301;shiva is known as Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja. And when these boys [indicates them] were dancing, it was just like a picture of Nat&#x301;ara&#x301;ja in <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava mudra&#x301;</i>. It is called <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava; ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> is a <i>mudra&#x301;</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Why is it called <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i>? In Sanskrit <i>tan&#x301;d&#x301;</i> means &ldquo;to jump&rdquo;. <i>Tan&#x301;d&#x301;u</i> means &ldquo;of jumping habit&rdquo;. <i>Ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> means &ldquo;having the use of <i>tan&#x301;d&#x301;u,</i> the use of jumping&rdquo;. But jumping in the proper style, not in a disorderly manner. You should learn it properly in a disciplined way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> represents life; you know Tantra is a cult of life, it is not a cult of death. For Tantra you should be strong physically, mentally and spiritually. First in the present tense; Lord Shiva says all your expressions, all your manifestations, must be based on the present tense. So this <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> is the starting phase of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> I said represents life, it represents vitality. There are so many forces that want to destroy you, so many forces forces that are inimical to you by nature. Say a snake &ndash; a snake is a born enemy. There are many such born enemies. As Tantra represents life, <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> says that one&#146;s spirit should be based on vitality, based on the principle of survival.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->This human skull represents death. You are surrounded by death, but you must not be defeated, you must not develop the psychology of fear or defeatism. So the knife is with you to fight against death.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.28.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#28.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Yours is a fight for survival. In the daytime one may also use a snake to represent death &ndash; not an ordinary snake, but a venomous snake. In India our boys dance with a snake. But at nighttime neither a skull nor a snake will be visible. Here there is light, they will be visible, but in a burial ground, in a cremation ground, where there is darkness, a snake or skull will not be visible. There you may use fire to represent death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This is the spirit of Tantra. To fight, to fight for survival. [[It is the normal wont of all living beings to fight for survival.]] It is normal life moving towards the supreme state of abnormality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Lord Shiva started this <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> dance, and his spouse, Pa&#x301;rvatii, started the <i>lalita</i> dance, <i>lalita ma&#x301;rmika</i>. What you did just at present while singing <i>kiirtana,</i> that is called <i>lalita. Lalita</i> represents that now we are enjoying bliss, we are in a happy mood. We are in a happy mood, and the hands should be above ninety degrees. Do you follow? I think you followed me. Lalita represents a happy mood, and it was invented by Pa&#x301;rvatii, Lord Shiva&#146;s spouse. <i>Lalita</i> helps people in their spiritual progress and psychic expansion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now the <i>devas,</i> the Tantrics of that era, about seven thousand years ago, learned <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> and <i>lalita</i> and wanted there to be a musical expression for the general public. That is your RAWA.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.28.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#28.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->For the general public there was the middle course. This middle course is called <i>madhyama ma&#x301;rga</i> in Sanskrit, <i>majhjhima&#x301; ma&#x301;gga</i> in Buddhist scriptures. And that path, where the subtle aspects of spirituality combined with the subtle aspects of vitality, was represented by [<i>ta&#x301;la</i>].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->A middle course was invented, and in Oriental music it is called <i>ta&#x301;la</i>. Oriental music is based on <i>ta&#x301;la. Ta&#x301;la</i> means &ndash; the first sound of <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> is <i>ta&#x301;,</i> and the first sound of <i>lalita</i> is <i>la</i> &ndash; <i>ta&#x301;</i> plus <i>la</i>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Yes, this was the origin. And on the basis of <i>ta&#x301;la,</i> Oriental music invented so many <i>ra&#x301;gas</i> and <i>ra&#x301;giniis,</i> so many tunes and sub-tunes, in the hoary past.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now in all of South Asia and Southeast Asia the music is based on this <i>ta&#x301;la</i>. It is the happy blending of <i>ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava</i> and <i>lalita,</i> and in it there are two main offshoots. One is known as the A&#x301;rya&#x301;varta offshoot, from Persia to Vietnam, and the other is the Da&#x301;ks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;tya offshoot of all South India, Ceylon, Indonesia, Malaysia and up to Australia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->This is the science, and this science was invented by Sada&#x301;shiva. It is to be learned with proper care and proper respect. These boys displayed excellently what I am trying to say. I am extremely pleased with the sweetness they displayed.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="29..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know, the cult of spiritual practice, the cult that leads one to the final desideratum of human life, is called Tantra. In Tantra, there is hardly one percent theory; ninety-nine percent is practice. And you also know that a good theory may not help a person, it is practice that counts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Suppose you know how to prepare a particular sweet, but practically you cannot do it. In such a case, will you get that delicious taste? Theory will not be able to help you. In Tantra there is ninety-nine percent practice, and practice precedes theory. The theory was prepared on the basis of practice and not practice on theory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It may be that a theory is very sweetly worded but cannot be translated into action. In Tantra, the theory succeeds the practice, that is, the practice precedes the theory. And when the Tantras were invented, there was hardly anything in black and white, because it was practice. Later the Tantras were given book form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Tadekam&#x301; japa&#x301;ma tadekam&#x301; smara&#x301;ma<br>Tadekam&#x301; jagatsa&#x301;ks&#x301;iiru&#x301;pam&#x301; nama&#x301;mah;<br>Tadekam&#x301; nidha&#x301;nam&#x301; nira&#x301;lambamiisham<br>Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja&#x301;mah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[<i>Tadekam&#x301; japa&#x301;ma.</i>] You say so many things, and major portions of what you say are meaningless, simply a wastage of time and energy. And not only do you say things, but you speak in your mind. And that is also a wastage of energy. Before going to Stockholm, you may say within your mind a thousand times, &ldquo;I have to go to Stockholm, I have to go to Stockholm, I am to go to Stockholm&rdquo; &ndash; a mere wastage of time and energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What is thought? Thought means to speak within. Thought is closely related to soliloquy. Suppose there is nobody to hear you and you are speaking. What is that? It is just like a thought. When you are speaking to yourself, it is called &ldquo;soliloquy&rdquo;. Thought is also like that. Some of your thoughts are of such a nature that, if others hear them, they will say you are insane.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So here the Tantric says, &ldquo;Look, what I am to say within my mind, speak to myself, I should speak regarding You, and not regarding this or that, that or this; so my time will be properly utilized &ndash; there will not be any wastage of time and energy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><i>Tadekam&#x301; smara&#x301;ma</i>. You may be remembering, &ldquo;Oh, when I went to Alaska, my host served me a very delicious menu.&rdquo; You are thinking like this &ndash; a story of, say, twenty, or perhaps twenty-five or thirty, years ago. You are remembering &ndash; what? It is a sweet memory. What is the necessity?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Memory should be of &ndash; what? A tactual experience that took place in my mind in the course of my sadhana, or the bliss that I enjoyed during <i>kiirtana</i>. Memory should be like this. &ldquo;My memory should also be centred around You, so there will not be any wastage of time and energy.&rdquo; What do people do generally? People generally remember past stories of pain and  happiness, sweet stories of near and dear ones. But all those things are a mere wastage of time and energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><i>Tadekam&#x301; jagatsa&#x301;ks&#x301;iirupam&#x301; nama&#x301;mah</i> &ndash; &ldquo;If I am to pay respect to anybody, I am to pay respect to You only.&rdquo; Because all other objects of this universe are expressions of that very <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>. So I pay respect to the Nucleus who created all these great personalities, all these little and big ones.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->As per yoga and Tantra, to <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> one is to do <i>namaste</i>. <i>Namah</i> plus <i>te</i> &ndash; &ldquo;I pay respect to You&rdquo; &ndash; <i>namaste</i>. And <i>namaska&#x301;ra</i> means, &ldquo;I am paying my respects.&rdquo; And that is why you may use the word <i>namaste</i> only for <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> but <i>namaska&#x301;ra</i> for both <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> and the <i>jiiva</i> [unit being]. <i>Tadekam&#x301; jagatsa&#x301;ks&#x301;iirupam&#x301; nama&#x301;mah</i> &ndash; &ldquo;If I am to pay respect to anybody, I am to pay respect to You only.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Whenever one is doing something, there is some goal, there is some objective. Whenever one is moving, one must have some destination, one must have some culminating point, one must have some terminating point. So then, what are You? &ldquo;You are the Terminus of all termini.&rdquo; You are going to Stockholm. Stockholm is the terminus. You are going to London. London is the terminus. But for all these termini, the Supreme Terminus is You.<!-- /block --></p>

Why? All these termini are located within certain boundaries. London, for example, is a city in Great Britain. You are going to Paris, Paris is a town in France. [[That is, they are]] under certain limitations, certain boundaries. But You, the Supreme Terminus, You are beyond the peripheries of time, space and person, above all boundaries, and that is why You are the Supreme Desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->I have said so many times that &ldquo;desideratum&rdquo; is such a point, such a term, that it should not have any plural form. That is, there should not be any word such as &ldquo;desiderata&rdquo;. &ldquo;Desideratum&rdquo; always remains singular. Because You are the Singular Entity, You are the Single Desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><i>Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja&#x301;mah</i>. Say, from here, if you were to go to England &ndash; how are you to go if you are not to take the help of any vehicle? Perhaps running up to the shore and then swimming. But is it practical or practicable? No. Is it feasible? No. Then what will be the better or the practical approach? By truck up to the beach and then a boat or a big steamer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now, if you are to cross the peripheries of time, space and person, what are you to do? You require a big ship. <i>Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja&#x301;mah</i> &ndash; &ldquo;O <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a,</i> Thou art a big ship, and we have taken shelter in Thee.&rdquo; <i>Bhava&#x301;mbodhipotam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja&#x301;mah</i> &ndash; &ldquo;O <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>!

<a name="30..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Yesterday I talked about the variations amongst plants, animals and humans. Now, amongst humans also, there are certain variations. Some may have the structure of humans, but may be cherishing the ideas of an animal. From their physical structure, you may say that they are humans, but mentally they are not humans. They are just like animals. The Sanskrit word for &ldquo;animal&rdquo; is pashu. They are pashus in human structure. And there are some humans who are just like humans &ndash; with all the merits and demerits &ndash; and there are some whose physical structure is like that of a human, but who are godly in nature. So among humans, there are these three species &ndash; pashu, viira and deva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now let us see what yoga is. Then I will say something regarding these three species of humans &ndash; pashu, viira and deva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Some people say that the proper interpretation of yoga is Sarvacinta&#x301;paritya&#x301;go nishcinto yoga ucyate &ndash; &ldquo;When the mind is free of all thoughts and all internal projections, that state is yoga.&rdquo; Some people say that just doing physical exercises and controlling the glands and tissues is yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit, the word yoga comes from two root verbs. One is yuj, which means addition. &ldquo;Two plus two equals four&rdquo; &ndash; this is addition. Another meaning of yoga is yuin&#x32D;j, which means &ldquo;to unify, to make one&rdquo;. When two become one, this is unification. When sugar is put in water, the identity of sugar is lost. This is unification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now, Sarvacinta&#x301;paritya&#x301;go nishcinto means that the mind is free from all thoughts or all psychic projections, but it does not mean unification, nor even addition, so this explanation cannot be accepted by wise men. Neither physical exercises nor suspension of the mind is yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Another interpretation is Yogashcittavrttinirodhah. There was a great philosopher named Patanjali. He said this about two thousand years ago. The human mind has fifty main propensities, and these propensities, both inside and outside, are working in ten different directions. Each and every propensity works within and without, internally and externally: so, fifty [times] two. And these proprensities work in all ten directions: fifty [times] two [times] ten equals one thousand. The propensities, the expressions, are one thousand. And these propensities are finally controlled by the pineal gland, and not by the pituitary gland. The pineal gland is called sahasra&#x301;ra in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now, as per Patanjali, the explanation is Yogashcittavrttinirodhah &ndash; that is, &ldquo;controlling or suspending all these one thousand propensities&rdquo;. You may have controlled all these one thousand propensities, but this does not mean any addition or any unification, so this interpretation is also meaningless. It cannot be accepted by wise people, because this interpretation has nothing to do with the proper import of the term yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Then the final interpretation, the interpretation of Ananda Marga, is Sam&#x301;yoga yoga ityukto jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; Parama&#x301;tmanah &ndash; &ldquo;The unification of unit consciousness, jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;, with Supreme Consciousness, Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, is yoga.&rdquo; When the unit entity, the unit consciousness, becomes one with the Cosmic Consciousness, that becoming one, that unification, is yoga. In that unification, the unit consciousness loses its identity. When the river comes in contact with the sea, it no longer remains a river. It becomes one with the sea, it becomes the sea. For this process of yoga the best interpretation is Sam&#x301;yoga yoga ityukto jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; Parama&#x301;tmanah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->What are the stages? (Suppose the little boy cannot get through the books of philosophical science &ndash; so there are stages.) I told you that amongst humans, there are three species, pashu, viira, and deva &ndash; animals in human form, men in human form, and gods in human form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Those who are in pashu form have to elevate themselves to the standard of man-god, that is, God. Pashu form means always moving in order to eat, drink, or sleep &ndash; for these things. They will have to elevate their standard to become human both in mind and body. This style of practice is known as pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, as taught by Lord Shiva about seven thousand years ago.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->For those who are humans both in mind and body, the style of practice is called viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra. Our avadhu&#x301;tas and avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301;s practise viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra. Viira means brave. Why is it called brave? It is because they are fighting against the fetters of mind, they are fighting against the satanic fetters. So certainly they are brave. This viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra is of two kinds. In the southern Himalayas, the practice taught by Shiva is known as viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra. North of the Himalayas &ndash; in Tibet, China, Siberia, etc. &ndash; the practice taught by Shiva was known as Ciina&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, that is, &ldquo;the Chinese style&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->From ancient India, the great Tantric yogi Vashistha came to China about five thousand years ago to learn this Ciina&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, the Chinese style of viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, and the Chinese-oriented [Tantra]. About 1500 years ago, a great yogi from China, named Pa Fa Hu Le, went to Bengal to revive Ciina&#x301;ca&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Those who are established in viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra have elevated themselves to the standard of deva. They are gods in human structure. What is the meaning of &ldquo;god&rdquo; here? Here &ldquo;god&rdquo; is meant with a small &ldquo;g&rdquo;, not a capital &ldquo;g&rdquo;; the feminine form is &ldquo;goddess&rdquo;. For &ldquo;God&rdquo; with a capital &ldquo;g&rdquo;, there is no feminine form; &ldquo;God&rdquo; is common. So, what is God?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Everything in this universe emanates from the Supreme God &ndash; capital &ldquo;g&rdquo;. All are different waves, coming out, emanating, from the Supreme Entity. All the waves have their peculiar length, no two waves are the same. That is why in A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram I said, Vaecitryam&#x301; Pra&#x301;krtadharmah sama&#x301;nam&#x301; na bhavis&#x301;yati &ndash; &ldquo;Variety is the law of nature, there cannot be cent per cent equality.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Each and every entity has its peculiarity, its speciality. No two articles or expressions of the world are the same. These expressions of Parama Purus&#x301;a are devas. The controller of these devas, or the factor just above these devas, is Maha&#x301;deva. Maha&#x301;deva means the Supreme God, Supreme Entity. Here the &ldquo;g&rdquo; is capital &ldquo;g&rdquo;. Those who have elevated their status and are recognized as deva &ndash; their goal is attainment of Maha&#x301;deva, attainment of the status of Maha&#x301;deva, to be one with the Supreme Entity. This is divya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra. Their souls, their spirits, their entities, their existences, finally become one with Maha&#x301;deva. Hence they are deva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The first style, from animality to humanity, is known as pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra. The second stage, or the second style, is viira&#x301;ca&#x301;ra in the south of the Himalayas and Ciina&#x301;ca&#x301;ra north of the Himalayas. As the final stage, divya&#x301;ca&#x301;ra is for all people who want to elevate themselves to the supreme excellence of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->A question may arise whether the mind can at all function in an entity lacking a physical body. In a disembodied state the mind cannot work, because ectoplasmic structure can never function in that state. The stuff of which the mind is composed cannot function once it is detached from the body, because the mind-stuff functions only when the brain is active and the nerve cells are active. Physical death brings about dissociation of the nerve cells, hence the ectoplasmic structure stops functioning. So when people say that there is a ghost in such-and-such tree, it is totally baseless. The brain of a dead person has already been burnt in the cremation fire or transformed into soil in a grave, so how can it function? A disembodied soul or disembodied mind can never function.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->But it is true that often a powerful person will associate his or her ectoplasmic structure with the disembodied mind. Suppose there is a man named Ra&#x301;ma Ba&#x301;bu who has great ectoplasmic strength, great ma&#x301;nasadha&#x301;tu. (In A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.31.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#31.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the word citta&#x301;n&#x301;u has been used for ma&#x301;nasadha&#x301;tu). He, employing a portion of his own ectoplasm, activates the disembodied mind according to its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [reactive momenta]. In this case the reactive momenta remain associated in the form of seed with the disembodied mind. Now, the disembodied mind has no ectoplasmic structure because it has no physical body. Under the circumstances Ra&#x301;ma Ba&#x301;bu can get that particular disembodied mind or soul to do many things. If people such as this happen to be wicked by nature, they can cause the disembodied entity to hurl pieces of bone, brick, etc., into someone else&#146;s house. Sometimes the cots on which people recline are also found to be tilting. All these actions are done by the ectoplasmic structure of a powerful person, not by that of the dead person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->So to stop this nonsense you should find the real culprit and give the person a good shaking. You will find that the throwing of pieces of bone, brick, etc., will immediately stop. All this comes within the scope of Avidya&#x301; Tantra. It often turns out that the person who was responsible for the throwing of the bricks is found sitting quietly in a corner of the burial ground, and their ectoplasmic structure is getting that hapless disembodied soul to do all those wicked things. If you hit their arm with a good stick then their wicked deeds will immediately stop. And when you see a cot rising from the ground with the ectoplasmic strength of that person (though you cannot see the ectoplasmic arm that raises it, as ectoplasm cannot be seen), just brandish a stick at random. It will turn out that the arm of that wicked Tantric gets broken. Perhaps that person was seated three miles away from the actual site of occurrence. These are all interesting things &ndash; Avidya&#x301; Tantric things.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="32..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know that according to the Indo-Aryan custom (commonly called simply &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo;) there are certain special techniques for moving different parts of the body following a particular system. The heel of the foot is related to the sound ta&#x301;, the ball of the foot to the sound dhin, and the toes to the sound dhae. In the kaos&#x301;ikii dance all three are utilized to some extent. But in the ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava dance ta&#x301; is utilized more than dhin [and dhae not utilized at all].<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.32.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#32.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> About seven thousand years ago, Sada&#x301;shiva first introduced the ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava dance, and so far as the kaos&#x301;ikii dance is concerned, I first introduced it on September 6, 1978. Actually, both ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava and kaos&#x301;ikii are more physical exercises, useful to the body, than they are forms of dance. Kaos&#x301;ikii serves as a medicine for twenty-two diseases &ndash; it is a panacea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava dance is an all-body exercise, by which even the brain and its nerve cells become strengthened. Ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava is a very vigorous exercise. The Sanskrit word tan&#x301;d&#x301;u means &ldquo;upward jump&rdquo;, and hence the dance which involves a lot of jumping is called ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava. You know that rice is called tan&#x301;d&#x301;ula in Sanskrit, because while husking the rice with a traditional wooden husking machine the rice grains leap from the paddy husks and scatter all around. Lord Sada&#x301;shiva invented ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava as a valuable tool for dharma praca&#x301;ra [the propagation of spirituality], but that does not mean that ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava is easy for everyone to do.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rvatii lent her cooperation to Shiva in many ways in propagating spirituality. Shiva introduced the ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava dance, and Pa&#x301;rvatii introduced the lalita ma&#x301;rmika dance. Ananda Marga has accepted the system of combining the lalita ma&#x301;rmika dance with kiirtana. Now to create a link between the ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava invented by Shiva and the lalita ma&#x301;rmika invented by Pa&#x301;rvatii, certain rhythms were invented or discovered. The common term for all these rhythms is ta&#x301;la: the ta&#x301; of ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava and the la of lalita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The two of them together, Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii, did a lot for the all-round development of the people of that dark prehistoric age. In that distant past, Shiva had to invent so many new things &ndash; the science of medicine, the science of music, the science of art, the physical sciences, etc. Pa&#x301;rvatii would at times ask Shiva various questions, and with the replies which Shiva gave, she acquired the capacity to educate the masses in the science of spirituality. Shiva used to reply gladly to all Pa&#x301;rvatii&#146;s questions. The collective name of all those queries is nigama, and the collective name of the answers is a&#x301;gama. A&#x301;gama and nigama together form the basis of Tantra sha&#x301;stra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now, what is sha&#x301;stra? That which teaches discipline to human beings is called sha&#x301;stra. It usually deals with the dos and don&#146;ts, that is, with what should be followed and what should not be followed, what should be practised and what should not be practised. The book which makes people well aware of the dos and don&#146;ts is called sha&#x301;stra.

The Sanskrit root verb tan means to expand, and the verb trae means to liberate; so the scientific process that paves the way for the liberation of human beings [by expansion of their minds] is called Tantra. So the word tantra has two implications, one &ldquo;expansion&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;emancipation&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->You all know that the name of India is Bha&#x301;rata in Sanskrit. The Sanskrit root verb tan [becoming ta] forms part of the word bha&#x301;rata. The root verb bhara means &ldquo;to feed&rdquo;, so the land which has abundant food to feed its population and where there is enormous scope for psycho-spiritual expansion is called Bha&#x301;rata. As ta means &ldquo;that which helps in all-round expansion&rdquo;, bhara plus ta [plus an&#x301;], bha&#x301;rata, means &ldquo;the country which supplies abundant food to its population and provides ample scope for psychic and spiritual development&rdquo; &ndash; Bharata sambandhiiya ityarthe Bha&#x301;rata. Similarly, tantra means &ldquo;the scientific cult which provides ample scope for all-round expansion in human life and thus paves the way for the attainment of salvation&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The word tantra has a second derivation. Tan is a Sanskrit root verb, as I have already mentioned.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.32.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#32.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> However, there is also the sound ta, the acoustic expression of dullness or lethargy. So [in the second derivation], the science which helps human beings to shake off the propensity of dullness or lethargy is called tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Both interpretations of tantra are equally recognized. Shiva was the original propounder of Tantra, and as I said earlier, Tantra has two wings, a&#x301;gama and nigama. Both these interpretations come from a&#x301;gama and nigama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->As I said, Pa&#x301;rvatii asked Shiva a number of questions, and Shiva replied to those questions in detail. One of the most important was, what are the minimum qualifications of a spiritual aspirant? Shiva said in reply that the minimum qualification of a spiritual aspirant is that he or she must have a human body: and for this neither wealth nor formal education nor social position is necessary. It is enough that one have a physical body. With that body one can carry on the practice of Tantra quite well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In another important answer to one of Pa&#x301;rvatii&#146;s queries, Shiva said that a sa&#x301;dhaka must maintain an equanimity of mind; that is, one who is a real spiritual aspirant must not allow any sort of complex to develop in one&#146;s mind. Any sort of complex &ndash; superiority complex, inferiority complex, fear complex, defeatist complex, hopelessness &ndash; is detrimental to spiritual progress. When Parama Purus&#x301;a is with us as human beings, why should anyone be afraid of anything? When the Supreme Entity, the greatest repository of human knowledge, is always with you, you have no reason to be afraid of anything. He is the loving Father of all created beings, so why should anyone fear anyone or anything? This is why the genuine spiritualist will never allow a fear complex to disturb his or her mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Likewise, when that extraordinary Entity is your Father, and you are the loving child of the Cosmic Entity, why should you indulge in an inferiority complex? Under no circumstances are you ever inferior to anyone. Never forget for a moment that you exist within the Cosmic Mind. But again, as this entire universe is the creation of the Supreme Creator, no one is inferior to you either. That is why you can by no logic afford to indulge in any sort of superiority complex in your mind. In fact, all living beings are like your brothers and sisters. No one is superior to you, no one is inferior to you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Those who believe in casteism in fact go against the fundamental principle of the Universal Family. One and the same creator is the Universal Progenitor, so where is the scope for caste discrimination?  All are brothers and sisters, with equal dignity. This is the principle of equality, as enunciated by Lord Shiva. You are not inferior to, nor insignificant by comparison to, anyone; nor are you superior to or more important than others. You must not have any defeatist complex in your mind. When the all-powerful and all-knowing Parama Purus&#x301;a is your guide, who can defeat you? Even if this creation falls into complete dissolution, Parama Purus&#x301;a will remain with you. He will save you from utter annihilation. So under no circumstances should you indulge in a defeatist complex. This is the advice of Lord Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Yet another significant remark of Shiva is Varttama&#x301;nes&#x301;u vartteta [&ldquo;Live in the present&rdquo;]. You can under no circumstances ignore the present. You have to determine your course of action keeping in view the present. You cannot in any way bypass the hard realities of life. That is, your movement, your activities, everything, should be directed towards Parama Purus&#x301;a; but simultaneously, you have to solve all the urgent problems you are facing at the moment. You have to become tremendously active in order to bring about a satisfactory solution to problems of all varieties &ndash; the problem of food, the problem of clothing, the problems of housing, of education, of medical care, and other mundane problems. And while trying to solve all these problems, you should always remember Shiva&#146;s advice: that under no circumstances should human beings ignore the hard realities of life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject of discourse is &ldquo;Yoga and Tantra&rdquo;. Some people are curious to know what yoga is and what Tantra is, and where they agree and where differ. First let us discuss what yoga is.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The word yoga is derived as the Sanskrit root verb yuin&#x32D;j plus the suffix ghain&#x32D;. Or alternatively, the root verb yuj plus the suffix ghain&#x32D;. If yoga is derived as yuj + ghain&#x32D;, it means &ldquo;addition&rdquo;, such as &ldquo;two plus two equals four.&rdquo; But if yoga is derived as yuin&#x32D;j + ghain&#x32D;, it means &ldquo;unification&rdquo;, such as the unification of sugar and water. When sugar and water are mixed, you will no longer find sugar separate from water. But in the case of &ldquo;two plus two equals four,&rdquo; you will find the first &ldquo;two&rdquo; and the second &ldquo;two&rdquo; separately. Two mangoes plus two mangoes equals four mangoes: here you will still be able to see the four mangoes separately. So in the case of yuj + ghain&#x32D;, yoga means &ldquo;unity&rdquo; or &ldquo;addition&rdquo;, and in the alternative case it means &ldquo;unification&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Besides the two derivations of yoga, there are also various definitions of yoga. Maharshi Patanjali defines yoga as Yogashcittavrttinirodhah &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Yoga means the suspension of all the psychic propensities.&rdquo; In the human mind there are fifty main propensities. If by some special means the propensities are suspended, their expressions are stopped, in that case the mind will cease to function. That state of psychic suspension is here termed yoga. But we have defined yoga above to mean unification, and we can see that the suspension of propensities does not in any way mean that those propensities are being unified. The suspension of the propensities does not necessarily lead to the unification of the unit mind with the Cosmic Mind. This definition does not make clear, unification with whom or what. Hence this definition of yoga is not acceptable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now the second definition is Sarvacinta&#x301;paritya&#x301;go nishcinto yoga ucyate. That is, &ldquo;When the mind is free from any sort of thinking, the mind is completely free of thoughts, that state is called yoga.&rdquo; Now if the mind becomes free from thought, it does not lead to unification. When people are in deep sleep, when they do not even dream, the mind becomes free from thought, and people become unconscious. In that state also the mind stops thinking. But is that yoga? No!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now another definition, as given by Sada&#x301;shiva, is Sam&#x301;yoga yoga ityukto jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;nah. That is, &ldquo;The unification of the unit soul, the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;, with the Universal Soul, that is, Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, is yoga.&rdquo; This seems to be the best, most scientific, definition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now let us see what Tantra is. The Sanskrit root verb tan literally means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. From the root verb tan comes the Sanskrit word tanu, which means &ldquo;a body that is expanding&rdquo;. A child&#146;s body is called tanu in Sanskrit, because it grows and grows until thirty-nine years of age. The human body up to thirty-nine years of age can be called tanu. But thereafter it is called shariira. Shariira means something which wears out, which becomes contracted. So a child&#146;s body is not shariira, and an old man&#146;s body should not be called tanu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word tantra is derived as: tan + trae + d&#x301;a. Tra [trae + d&#x301;a] means &ldquo;that which liberates.&rdquo; So Tantra means the science which shows the path for the emancipation of the human entity through psycho-spiritual expansion. In other words, the spirit of Tantra is ever to continue expanding.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Tantra has another meaning also. In the Indo-Aryan alphabet, there are fifty letters. A is the first letter, and ks&#x301;a is the last letter. Now, the main human propensities are fifty in number, but within one propensity there are several sub-propensities; because the propensities have a certain faculty, and that is, that they can work in ten directions, and can also function both internally and externally. So ultimately we get the total number of propensities as fifty main vrttis times two (internal and external) times ten (working in ten directions), which equals one thousand. So although primarily there are fifty propensities, secondarily there are one thousand propensities. These one thousand propensities are controlled by the pineal gland in the brain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Each of these propensities has its own vibration and its own colour as well. When someone grows angry, there is a certain vibration in the body, and in accordance with this vibration, the body trembles and simultaneously changes its colour. The fair-complexioned man becomes reddish, the black-complexioned man becomes violet. So you see, each and every object in this universe has its own vibration, its own colour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->These vibrations, representing some action or some object, are called acoustic expressions. A person when angry speaks in a certain way, but the same person in a normal state speaks in a different way. The voice of the angry man has undergone a clear change from its normal state to an abnormal one. Likewise, each and every propensity has its own vibration, and each vibration has a certain colour and sound. The sounds of the fifty propensities constitute our language. These alphabet sounds &ndash; a, a&#x301;, ka, kha [the first vowels and the first consonants or the Sanskrit alphabet] &ndash; are our acoustic expressions. Each sound has its own colour, and because of these fifty sounds and fifty colours, we call the alphabet varn&#x301;ama&#x301;la&#x301; in Sanskrit. Varn&#x301;a, or &ldquo;letter&rdquo; &ndash; there are svaravarn&#x301;a [vowels] and vyain&#x32D;janvarn&#x301;a [consonants] &ndash; literally means &ldquo;colour&rdquo;. There are primarily fifty sounds or colours, but secondarily one thousand sounds or colours. As I said, each and every propensity has a particular colour. The  colour of the sentient principle is white, of the mutative yellow, and of the static black.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->For example, sha is the sound for the mutative principle. Now these representative sounds are called biija mantras in Sanskrit, and &ldquo;acoustic roots&rdquo; in English. Sha is the acoustic root of the mutative principle, sa is the acoustic root of the sentient principle, and s&#x301;a is the acoustic root of the static principle. When someone walks or starts moving, it produces a sound, khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;; so the acoustic expression of movement is khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;-khat&#x301;. Behind every action or existence there lies a sound vibration. The particular sound vibration supporting a particular entity or action is known as its acoustic root.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In ancient times, some orthodox people avoided wearing leather shoes. They liked to wear wooden sandals. When people wearing wooden sandals would walk, it automatically produced sounds like t&#x301;hak-t&#x301;hak-t&#x301;hak. So the group of people who used to make a t&#x301;hak-t&#x301;hak-t&#x301;hak sound during movement were called T&#x301;hakkara &ndash; T&#x301;hakam-t&#x301;hakam karoti yah sah T&#x301;hakkarah. T&#x301;hakkara evolved into T&#x301;ha&#x301;kur [anglicized as &ldquo;Tagore&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So it is clear now that there is an acoustic root behind each and every action, behind each and every existence. As I said, sha is the acoustic root of the mutative principle. Similarly, ra is the acoustic root of energy (energy meaning all varieties of energy). Sha + ra = shra, meaning &ldquo;where the mutative principle is backed by energy&rdquo;. Now shra plus the feminine suffix ii equals shrii. It means &ldquo;where there is mutative force plus energy&rdquo;. So shrii ultimately means charm. In practical life, every human being longs for charm. This is the reason why since ancient times it has been the custom in India to prefix the word Shrii to a person&#146;s name.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So I hope you are now clear about what an acoustic root is. Similarly there is an acoustic root ta. Ta represents dullness or lethargy. So literally tantra [combining two derivations] means &ldquo;a systematic and scientific process which brings about first expansion, and thereafter liberation from the bondages of dullness and lethargy&rdquo;. This liberation is called tantra in Sanskrit. Tantra means &ldquo;liberation from bondages&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.33.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#33.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->You know that each and every living being wants liberation from bondages. Out of this inherent longing for freedom from bondages arises dharma. Dharma means expansion. Suppose someone is tied with a rope. If the person&#146;s body expands or swells or becomes bigger and bigger in size, the rope will snap. So Tantra is defined as the process of expansion and of emancipation from crudifying bondages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->So now yoga and tantra have come close to each other in meaning. Yoga means the unification of jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; and Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.33.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#33.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  And how can this unification take place? It is possible through gradual expansion, that is, by dint of the constant practice of Tantra. This practical cult or spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; exists only in Tantra and nowhere else. Pra&#x301;rthana&#x301;rcana&#x301; ma&#x301;traeva bhramamu&#x301;lam. That is, &ldquo;Prayer and eulogy only mislead one.&rdquo; Only by dint of spiritual cult can one attain success. Thus sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is Tantra and Tantra is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now how can one attain siddhi through the practice of yoga? The jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; will take the ideation of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, and then the former will become one with the latter. How is it possible for the microcosm to become Macrocosm? The Macrocosm, or Parama Purus&#x301;a, has one unique characteristic, and that characteristic is, whoever ideates on Him becomes one with Him. The very nature of the mind is to become as it thinks. If it thinks of money, the mental stuff will one day, in a gradual process of crudification, be converted into money. After one&#146;s physical death, the mind will be converted into money, and may find shelter in the iron safe of a moneylender. Will that be desirable? No, certainly not!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Ya&#x301;drshii bha&#x301;vana&#x301; yasya siddhir bhavati ta&#x301;drshii &ndash; &ldquo;As one thinks, so one becomes.&rdquo; There is a certain insect that eats cockroaches.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.33.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#33.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> When that insect appears before a cockroach, the cockroach becomes mortally frightened. Due to the fright its nerve fibres cease to function, and when the fright becomes more intense, its nerve cells also cease to function. The severe fright creates a picture of that voracious insect in the cockroach&#146;s mind, and due to that persistent image a transformation of its nerve cells gradually sets in, which then extends to the nerve fibres, and at the end of this process the cockroach will appear to that insect to be a member of its own species. The insect actually thinks that the cockroach is a member of its own tribe, so how can it eat the cockroach? If human beings take the Cosmic ideation, they will also become one with the Cosmic Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Now the question is, how can human beings take the ideation of Parama Purus&#x301;a? Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis will analyse, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is like this or like that.&rdquo; Karmiis will think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is a master of action.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.33.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#33.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (Now, what relation do bhaktas have to jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na?<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.33.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#33.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  A devotee will think, &ldquo;I may be a virtuous person, I may be poor, I may be learned or foolish, but, O Lord, I belong only to You.&rdquo;) And a devotee thinks of the Lord just as people think of their nearest and dearest ones. He thinks, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is mine;&rdquo; and in this process of constant ideation, his or her mind gradually expands. From this sort of closeness, a person ultimately becomes one with Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. Such a person of devotion is called a bhakta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Thus we see that jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis are Tantrics, because by acquiring knowledge they expand their minds, and thus become one with the all-expansive Cosmic Mind. Karmiis are also Tantrics, for by dint of actions, they expand their minds and become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Bhaktas are also Tantrics, because they develop so much love and devotion for Parama Purus&#x301;a that, in the process of constant ideation, they become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Thus there is hardly any difference between Tantra and yoga. [Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, karma, and bhakti are the three main branches of yoga.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->But yes, there is one thing. Human life is very short. If someone wants to cultivate knowledge, he or she may not get sufficient time. Even if someone starts cultivating knowledge at the age of five or six, the time will not be adequate. The scope of knowledge is infinite, whereas life is finite or short. If someone diverts his or her time and energy towards the attainment of objects other than Parama Purus&#x301;a, that person&#146;s time becomes less utilized and more misused.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33..23"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;After churning all four Vedas, and all the scriptures, the yogis assimilate the quintessence, and the non-essential parts are consumed by the so-called scholars.&rdquo; The four Vedas and all the scriptures are as vast as the ocean. Just as by churning curd [yogurt] we separate the butter from the buttermilk, so by churning the ocean of scripture, the butter comes to the surface and the buttermilk remains at the bottom. Those who are real devotees eat up the butter, and the so-called intellectuals start quarrelling among themselves over the distribution of the buttermilk. And ultimately that also may spoil before they can drink it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->There is a story that once a man of knowledge and a man of devotion went together to a mango orchard. The man of knowledge started verifying whether the mangoes were langra or himsagar or what varieties. Now there are over 1500 varieties of mango in the world. The man began to ponder over which varieties of mango were available in that orchard; and in the process of this constant analysis the sun set and evening fell on the orchard. Then the man started counting the numbers of the leaves, the branches, the twigs, etc. The night became darker. But what did the devotee do meanwhile? He straightway climbed a tree and started eating the mangoes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->As a rule, devotees are more intelligent than jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis. They utilize their time properly, and you know that those who utilize their time properly are more intelligent than those who do not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Now let us analyse how devotees conduct themselves. A devotee is confident from the very beginning that the Lord belongs to him or her, and to him or her alone. When something belongs to someone, there remains no obstacle or impediment between the person and the belonging. Suppose there is a son who says, &ldquo;My father.&rdquo; That son may be a scholar or a big fool, he may be rich or poor, but after all, his father belongs to him, and he can easily come near his own father and serve him. At that time no father will ever say, &ldquo;You are a fool, get out of here.&rdquo; He can never do such a thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->There is a family relation between the Father and the son, and because of this family relation, the intimacy between the two will keep growing, and the internal thoughts will also remain very, very pure. This is why wise people say that the cult of devotion is the greatest. It is the best method to expand one&#146;s mind. And as the fundamental spirit of Tantra is to expand one&#146;s mind, snapping the bondages, devotion is the best Tantra. That is why I repeat again and again that Tantra and yoga are not different from each other, rather they are almost the same thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->A devotee will practise a&#x301;sana, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; and dhya&#x301;na,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.33.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#33.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and during this practice he will have one thought uppermost in his mind &ndash; that the Entity on whom he is ideating is his nearest relation, and no one is nearer to him than his Lord. Because of this, a devotee&#146;s mind will become highly expanded in a short period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In the life of a person of action, kiirtana may or may not play a significant role, but in the life of a person of devotion, kiirtana is indispensable. To put it more explicitly, a devotee cannot live without kiirtana, just as you cannot remove a fish from water. If you remove a fish from water, it will die an instant death. Likewise, if a devotee is prevented from doing kiirtana, the person will die.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The secret of a devotee&#146;s heart is known to Parama Purus&#x301;a. In Jamalpur I told you that Parama Purus&#x301;a does not reside in Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha [the mythological abode of Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u], nor on the throne, nor in the heart of a yogi. He actually resides in the heart of a devotee. A devotee is always bound to think of Parama Purus&#x301;a at heart, because their mutual relation is one of love and devotion. That is why Parama Purus&#x301;a clearly proclaims, Madbhakta&#x301;h yatra ga&#x301;yanti tatra tis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;mi Na&#x301;rada &ndash; that is, &ldquo;I reside, O Na&#x301;rada, wherever my devotees are singing.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.33.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#33.fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->So Parama Purus&#x301;a says to Na&#x301;rada that He does not reside anywhere except where His ardent devotees are singing kiirtana. Philosophically, Parama Purus&#x301;a is omnipresent, but His nucleus remains at a particular place. That particular place, where the nucleus resides, is not Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha. That particular place is where His ardent devotees are singing His glories in kiirtana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->So you will notice that when people do kiirtana out of deep love, a highly powerful spiritual vibration is created. Those who do kiirtana feel that vibration in their minds, hearts, and everywhere. They become virtually intoxicated with unbounded bliss. That sort of bliss is not attainable by a person of knowledge. It may be that that person of knowledge will one day become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a, but he or she will not be able to attain that bliss; nor is that bliss attainable by a person of action. That bliss is attainable only by a person of devotion. The &ldquo;wholesale right&rdquo; to that boundless bliss lies with that devotee only.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="34..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject of discourse is &ldquo;Yoga, Tantra and Kevala&#x301; Bhakti&rdquo;. In the sphere of spiritual practice, yoga, Tantra and kevala&#x301; bhakti, all three, are essential for the realization of Parama Purus&#x301;a. We should not ignore any of the three, although [ultimately] Parama Purus&#x301;a can only be attained by dint of bhakti &ndash; rather, kevala&#x301; bhakti [non-attributional devotion].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now let us see what yoga is.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The word yoga may be derived either from the Sanskrit root verb yuin&#x32D;j plus the suffix ghain&#x32D;, or from the root verb yuj plus the suffix ghain&#x32D;. When yoga is derived as yuj + ghain&#x32D; it means &ldquo;addition,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;two plus two equals four.&rdquo; But when yoga is derived as yuin&#x32D;j + ghain&#x32D;, it means &ldquo;unification&rdquo;. For example, when sugar and water are mixed together, they become one. Sugar loses its individual identity. This is the real yoga.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.34.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#34.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And yoga has also three major definitions. One of them is Yogashcittavrttinirodhah. The expressions or propensities of the human mind are primarily enumerated as fifty. And secondarily they are considered as one thousand in number.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.34.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#34.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  The mind survives because of these vrttis. If the vrttis become non-existent, the mind also loses its existence. According to Maharshi Patanjali [who gave the above definition], if the vrttis are suspended, if their expressions are withdrawn and the vrttis become functionless, at that stage the mind will enter into a state of non-manifestation, the mind will lose its outward expression, and this state will be called yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now let us see. If the mind ceases to express itself and altogether stops functioning, how can it unify itself with any other object? In the state of functionlessness, the mind is transformed into something crude. At that stage the mind will become like a desert where there is no flower or fruit. Now on the one hand yoga means unification, but here in the practical sphere there is nothing with which the mind can unify itself; hence Patanjali&#146;s definition of yoga does not seem to be very rational.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There is yet another definition of yoga, Sarvacinta&#x301;paritya&#x301;go nishcinto yoga ucyate &ndash; &ldquo;When the mind is absolutely free of thoughts, when the mind is completely thought-less, that state of mind is called yoga.&rdquo; Now when a person is sleeping, not even dreaming, in that state the mind is free from thoughts; furthermore, when someone becomes unconscious, at that time also the mind remains free from any thought whatsoever. But that is not yoga. The question is, since the mind is not unified with anything, how can this be accepted as a definition of yoga?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->However, there is yet a third definition, which does seem reasonable. Sam&#x301;yoga yoga ityukto jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; Parama&#x301;tmanah &ndash; &ldquo;When the unit consciousness merges itself fully and is finally identified with the Supreme Consciousness, Shiva, that is called yoga.&rdquo; Here the microcosmic drop merges into the vast ocean of Consciousness; the microcosm merges into the Macrocosm. This state of supreme union or merger is what is called yoga. What is the supreme goal in the life of a spiritual aspirant? To merge the individual existence into Parama Purus&#x301;a, Parama&#x301;tman, the ocean of Macrocosmic Consciousness. This is the real yoga. A person who would endeavour continuously in his or her individual life to attain the Supreme Entity should know that [this] yoga is the only way to attain it. There is no doubt about that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now let us see what Tantra is, and what the relationship is between Tantra and yoga. Tam&#x301; ja&#x301;dya&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah tantrah parikiirtitah. The sound ta is the acoustic root of dullness.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.34.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#34.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So &ldquo;the science or systematic process that liberates one from the bondage of dullness or lethargy is called tantra.&rdquo; The word tra is derived from the Sanskrit root verb trae, plus d&#x301;a. Tra means liberator, so the liberator from ta, that is, dullness, is called tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There is yet another definition of tantra. In Sanskrit there is a root verb tan, which means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. (From this root verb tan the word tanu is derived. Tanu literally means the growing body of a child. The human body continues to expand up till the age of thirty-nine; that is why a young body is called tanu. Tanu means &ldquo;that which is expanding&rdquo;. An old man&#146;s body should not be called tanu; it should be called shariira, because an old man&#146;s body does not expand, it decays.) So tantra means that which shows the way towards expansion and ultimately liberation.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.34.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#34.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->When the unit soul or unit mind transcends the barriers of limitation, and in the process becomes infinite, there remains no bondage of finitude. That is the state of liberation. One&#146;s existence becomes one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Here Tantra and yoga are in complete agreement. So we have established that the word tan means expansion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Let me digress a little to explain further the significance of the term ta [derived from tan]. You know the Sanskrit name of India is Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a. The root verb bhar means &ldquo;to feed&rdquo; or &ldquo;to nourish&rdquo;, and the root verb tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;, &ldquo;to grow&rdquo;. So the entity whose function is to feed, to nourish, and then help to grow, is called bha&#x301;rata. And thus the land which feeds its population and thereby helps in the physical, psychic and spiritual growth of that population is called Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a. (Vars&#x301;a means &ldquo;land&rdquo; or &ldquo;country&rdquo;.) Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a is a land which facilitates gradual growth and finally leads to emancipation; in other words, the mind and the soul gradually expand, and the soul becomes one with the Universal Soul. And in the state of highest expansion, all the eight fetters and six enemies of the human mind, that is, all the external [externally-imposed] and internal enemies of the human mind, will cease to exist; and thus when the microcosms are free from all bondages, they cease to remain as microcosms and become one with Shiva [Supreme Consciousness]. In Tantra it is said, Pa&#x301;shabaddha bhavet jiivah pa&#x301;sha muktah bhavet Shivah &ndash; &ldquo;Those who are bound by the fetters are jiiva [unit consciousness] but one who is free from the fetters is Shiva.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->So we see that as a practical matter there is no difference between yoga and Tantra. Yoga is a practical cult; Tantra is also a practical cult. There may be a slight difference in language, but there is no difference in practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now we come to kevala&#x301; bhakti. What is bhakti, or devotion? Bhakti is defined as,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..14"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Bhaktir Bhagavato seva&#x301; bhaktih prema svaru&#x301;pinii;<br>Bhaktira&#x301;nanda rupa&#x301; ca bhakti bhaktasya jiivanam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..15"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->[Bhakti is service to God; bhakti is the form taken by divine love; bhakti is the embodiment of bliss; bhakti is the life of the devotee.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..16"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->When spiritual aspirants advance towards Parama Purus&#x301;a by dint of the practice of yoga or Tantra, they develop an exclusive devotion towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. Ananyamamata&#x301; Vis&#x301;n&#x301;ormamata&#x301; premasaun&#x32D;gata&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;Spiritual aspirants withdraw their minds from all mundane objectivities, and with the same intention direct all their physical, psychic and spiritual propensities towards Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; They remove their individualities, and accept Parama Purus&#x301;a as their nearest and dearest one. This is what is called exclusive love for God. This is called kevala&#x301; bhakti. And only in this stage does devotion reach its fruition or culmination.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The term bhakti is derived as bhaj + ktin. When all the propensities are withdrawn from all other objects and diverted towards the Supreme goal, this is called bhakti. You may have noticed that people sometimes establish some kind of devotional relationship with God out of selfishness. For that reason there are different gradations of devotion. For example, there is ta&#x301;masikii bhakti, static devotion. People sometimes wrongly pray to the Lord, &ldquo;Such and such persons are my enemies. Let harm befall them.&rdquo; Here the mind has a defective thought within. The ideation is related to Parama Purus&#x301;a, there is no doubt about that, but here the person does not want to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a, rather he wants Parama Purus&#x301;a to help him by harming his enemies. Here you are moving towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, you are even mentally speaking to Parama Purus&#x301;a, but to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a is not your goal. Under these circumstances, Parama Purus&#x301;a may or may not grant your prayers, but one thing is certain, you will not attain Parama Purus&#x301;a, because you do not really want Him. This type of devotion is called ta&#x301;masikii bhakti [static devotion]. A genuine spiritual aspirant should keep away from this type of static devotion, because it leads to degradation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The second type of devotion is ra&#x301;jasikii bhakti [mutative devotion]. In this type of devotion, the mind moves towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, and there is devotion, no doubt, but the mind does not want to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. Here the sa&#x301;dhaka prays to Parama Purus&#x301;a, &ldquo;O Lord, grant me some kind of progress or financial achievement or a promotion in my job or more profit in business.&rdquo; In this type of devotion you do not pray to Parama Purus&#x301;a to help you by harming your opponents &ndash; so far, so good &ndash; but still you do not want to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a, you also want something for yourself. And for this reason, you will not attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is no doubt a type of devotion, but it is not the best type of devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Yet the third type of devotion is called sa&#x301;ttvikii bhakti [sentient devotion]. In this devotion you do not pray to Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; to achieve anything. You do not want Him to harm your opponents, you do not expect anything from Him. This devotion is better in that sense. But there is still a defect inherent in this type of devotion. It is just like the prayer of an old man who feels that if he does not carry on his religious observances he is likely to be criticized by his neighbours. So he carries on his practices with that sort of devotion. Or sometimes a person prays to the Lord saying, &ldquo;O Lord, I have been here on earth for a long time, I am faced with so many problems in life, now, O Lord, take me on Your lap.&rdquo; Here the person who is praying wants the cessation of his or her worldly afflictions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->You cannot attain Parama Purus&#x301;a with this sort of prayer either, because at this stage you still do not say that you want Parama Purus&#x301;a to be your own. This will not serve the purpose. Only when the mind has an intense desire to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a alone, and nothing else, is it the highest devotion. This is called kevala&#x301; bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->You can make an analogy. A little child is crying for its mother. But what does the mother do? She immediately rushes to the child and gives it a number of colourful toys. The child stops crying immediately. But if a persistent child insists that it does not want anything else but its mother, the mother is compelled to take the child on her lap. So the devotees with kevala&#x301; bhakti in their hearts do not ask Parama Purus&#x301;a for anything. Even if Parama Purus&#x301;a proposes to give them this or that, the aspirant will say, &ldquo;No, Lord, I don&#146;t want anything but You. I want to remain with you. What You are offering to me is a trivial thing; I want You and You alone, nothing else.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Now even within this ideal state of devotion there is a  gradation. Even those who have this sort of ideal devotion may think that they will worship Parama Purus&#x301;a because by worshipping him they may be able to enjoy bliss. So here also there is some slight selfishness, because one shows devotion to Parama Purus&#x301;a with an expectation of attaining some bliss thereby. This sort of devotion with a slight tinge of selfishness is call ra&#x301;ganuga&#x301; bhakti. Although it is one of the higher categories of devotion, it is not altogether free from a tinge of selfishness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->There is yet another type of devotion, which is free from even this tinge of selfishness. It is [the highest kind of] kevala&#x301; bhakti, [the highest kind of] non-attributional devotion. Here the devotee says, &ldquo;I serve Him, I worship Him, because I want Him to get bliss from my devotion or service or worship. I don&#146;t want anything for myself. I want Him to enjoy the bliss.&rdquo; This type of devotion is called ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti, and the type of devotee having this sort of non-attributional devotion is called a gopa.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="35..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Humans should always be careful about the company they keep. What is the result of keeping good company? By spending time with good persons, a deep impression is imprinted on the mind, causing the desire to be good to rise in the mind. If, on the other hand, one chooses to associate with a drunkard, a thought will eventually come in the mind, &ldquo;What is the harm if I drink a little wine?&rdquo; And if one associates with thieves, one will think, &ldquo;What is the harm if I steal something?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->To give an example, suppose a person is standing beside a tea stall. There the smell of the tea wafts to the person&#146;s nose. The person will then say, &ldquo;Give me a cup, too.&rdquo; In this incident, the smell of the tea affects the mind. If that person had not remained near the tea stall, the smell would not have reached the nose and perhaps that person would not have taken tea for two or three days. This is the influence that association has on the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Hence humans should choose their company very carefully, for a mistake in this will cause them to repent their whole life. Even parents who realize that they themselves are not good should send their children to live in a good student hostel, or keep them with some of their relatives who are good &ndash; lest their own influence cause harm to the children. One must be very strict about this. In Tantra it is said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Satsaun&#x32D;gena bhavenmuktirasatsaun&#x32D;ges&#x301;u bandhanam;<br>Tasma&#x301;dasatsaun&#x32D;gamudran&#x301;am&#x301; sa&#x301; mudra&#x301; parikiirttita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..5"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[Keeping good company leads to liberation, whereas the company of bad people leads to greater bondage. The mudran&#x301;am &ndash; shunning &ndash; of bad company is called mudra&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The Tantric practice of mudra&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; means to associate with good human beings in order to attain liberation. Here you must remember that salvation [or liberation] is not only spiritual, it is in all spheres of life, in all the strata of life. In all the spheres of life &ndash; social, economic, etc. &ndash; struggle has to be launched. Wherever there is no food, begin the struggle for it; if clothing is needed, then there should be struggle for it; if there is no irrigation system, struggle for it; if there is no accommodation, struggle for it. And the greatest [liberation] is to liberate the soul from all bondages &ndash; that alone is real liberation. Spiritual liberation is the only [ultimate] liberation, other liberations are not [the ultimate liberation]. This is because today one may become free from some physical bondage, but tomorrow it will come back again. Today one may be free from hunger, but tomorrow hunger will return. Spiritual liberation, though, is permanent liberation, eternal freedom. Good association results in salvation and bad association results in bondage. Hence evil company must be avoided.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the Sanskrit language, mudran&#x301;am has two meanings. One is &ldquo;to print&rdquo;, and the other is &ldquo;to shun&rdquo;. The words asatsaun&#x32D;ga mudran&#x301;am here mean &ldquo;to shun evil company&rdquo;. But mudran&#x301;am also means &ldquo;to print&rdquo; &ndash; for example, pustak mudran&#x301; kara&#x301; [to print a book &ndash; in Bengali]. By mistake people say pustak mudrita kara&#x301;. In Sanskrit, mudrita does mean &ldquo;to shun&rdquo; &ndash; for example, Caks&#x301;u mudrita kara&#x301; hala means, &ldquo;One&#146;s eyes shunned the world [by closing].&rdquo; Pustak mudrita kara&#x301; does mean, &ldquo;to close the book&rdquo;; [but pustak mudrita kara&#x301; does not mean &ldquo;to print the book&rdquo;;] &ldquo;to print the book&rdquo; should be written pustak mudra&#x301;unkita kara&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->However that may be, Asatsaun&#x32D;ga mudran&#x301;a kara&#x301; means &ldquo;to shun evil company&rdquo;, and this is the practice of mudra&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Shankaracharya said that if you shun bad company and associate with very good people, you will be able to do good to society, and you will continue to do virtuous deeds.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="36..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->We will discuss Tantra a little in relation to prapatti, viprapatti, and aprapatti. The original propounder of Tantra was Lord Sada&#x301;shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->From the viewpoint of geography, Tantra has two main divisions &ndash; one is the Bengal school of Tantra, the other is the Kashmir school of Tantra. The Bengal school is less ritualistic and more practical, while the Kashmir school is more ritualistic and less practical. And from the viewpoint of spiritual practice, Tantra has five main divisions: Shaeva Tantra, Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, Saora Tantra, and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra. It is said that Shaeva Tantra attaches more importance to the faculty of knowledge and to the elimination of caste and other social discriminations. Sha&#x301;kta Tantra lays greater stress on the attainment of power and its judicious application. Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra aspires to lead humanity towards Parama Purus&#x301;a through the cult of sweet, divine bliss, but there is less social consciousness. Saora Tantra places much importance on medical treatment and astronomical progress, and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya Tantra provides inspiration for people who are divided into different social groups to work unitedly.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.36.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#36.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Here I do not propose to say anything special about Shaeva or Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, but I must say something about Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra. It is said that Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra aspires to lead spiritual aspirants towards Parama Purus&#x301;a through the cult of blissful experiences. (If I ever say anything in the future regarding Saora Tantra, I will discuss it at great length and during that discussion I will point out that Saora Tantra was not only concerned with the sciences of medicine and astronomy. It was much more than that, especially in the Middle East and India about one thousand to three thousand years ago. However, in the present context this is irrelevant.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->While dealing with Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra [Vaishnavite Tantra], we notice that although it had its origin in India, more particularly in southern India, it was later significantly influenced by the Middle East. As a result, the modern Vaishnavism, or rather the Vaishnavism which was prevalent during the Mughal period, was greatly influenced by the Sufism of the Middle East.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Our topic of discussion is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and His life. During Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s lifetime, Sufism was not in vogue in the Middle East. The Vaishnavism of southern India, as enunciated in the Bha&#x301;gavata sha&#x301;stra &ndash; that is, the Shriimad Bha&#x301;gavata [of that sha&#x301;stra], not the Shriimad Bhagavad Giita&#x301; &ndash; came much later than Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The Dravidian Brahmans of southern India had not yet become clearly divided into two branches; later they were to become divided into the Ayengars and the Aiyars. (The Ayengars were Vaishnavites and the Aiyars were Shaivites. One could easily distinguish the Aiyars from the Ayengars by their distinct styles of decorating their foreheads with holy ash.) While the different classifications of Tantra could be found in those days, they were not very rigid or distinct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If the forward march towards Parama Purus&#x301;a through the cult of sweet, divine bliss is the basic spirit of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra, then that spirit must have been reflected in both Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. This forward march can be effected only through prapatti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When a devotee advances through the cult of sweet devotion, he or she prefers to avoid the path of philosophical intricacies. Suppose you have been allotted a certain duty and you have to run hard to perform that duty. If you are offered some delicious sweets you will say, &ldquo;No thank you, not now. Let me run first, then I will take some rest and enjoy the sweets little by little with great pleasure.&rdquo; While running, one&#146;s mind remains at a high speed, tremendously preoccupied. That is why you cannot, at that speed, savour even delicious food. Similarly, when you advance in the cult of sweet devotion, you enjoy more and more sweetness. While advancing, you enjoy bliss at every step. Obviously, at that stage, you do not like the tormenting harshness of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->I have said several times prior to this that prapatti &ndash; that sweetness of divine ecstasy &ndash; was fully developed in Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. But as I have also said, the karma yoga which is the hallmark of Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi is not opposed to prapatti. Now let us analyse whether the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na ma&#x301;rga [path of knowledge, or discrimination], as associated with Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi, is more consistent with the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na ma&#x301;rga of Shaivism or with the cult of sweet, divine bliss found in Vaishnavism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;rthasa&#x301;rathi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a demonstrated an enormous wealth of knowledge. All His teachings were based primarily on the cult of knowledge. He taught His philosophy to Arjuna, and it does not smack of negativism or escapism. According to Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, whatever takes place in this universe is designed by the Cosmic will. Nothing can happen without the Cosmic desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Jiivas are compelled to act under the impact of two personalities. One is the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; which craves to accumulate so many things, big or small, and to give so many things to society. The small &ldquo;I&rdquo; creates a world of its own centring around that little &ldquo;I&rdquo;, a world of illusion wherein the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; is entrapped and where it considers itself to be the supreme monarch. But simultaneously there is a larger world, the much larger world of Parama Purus&#x301;a, a world where the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; is a mere bubble. All the hopes and aspirations, all the desires and urges, of that insignificant bubble residing within the vast mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a, attain supreme fulfilment only at the time when it merges itself in the main stream of the Cosmic flow. Otherwise, individual hopes and desires remain forever unfulfilled and unrealized. Human beings cherish thousands of desires in their hearts, but those desires generally remain unfulfilled, because the waves of individual human desire do not maintain parallelism with the waves of the Cosmic desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->It was quite natural for Arjuna to hesitate in slaying His friends and relations on the battlefield. The Kaoravas were his dear kinsmen, and there were many other kings and vassals who were bound in ties of intimate friendship with Arjuna. He felt compassion for all his friends and relatives, but that love and compassion for his relatives and friends was something related to Arjuna&#146;s unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. It had no validity in the Cosmic world. Therefore Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a addressed and exhorted Arjuna in the following manner: &ldquo;Oh, Arjuna, don&#146;t think that you are killing anyone. No one ever kills or is ever killed. Weapons can never kill anyone.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="36..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So what will you do? Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s flow of imagination continues unceasingly. No one can resist that mighty flow of Cosmic imagination. It was erroneous for Arjuna to think that he himself was killing his dear kinsmen, the Kaoravas. Thus Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said: &ldquo;Things are already planned and predestined by Me. I have already planned everything out in My mind. You are just an instrument.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There are two things to note here. The first thing is that according to Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da [the Doctrine of Illusion], the very existence of the material world, though not altogether denied, is given little importance. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s teachings, however, are not actually Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da. In Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da, the systaltic movement of the Macrocosm is not altogether accepted. Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;dii philosophers argue that the universe is the magic of the miracle-creating Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;: aghat&#x301;ana ghat&#x301;ana pat&#x301;iiyasii Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; [&ldquo;the dexterous hand of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; that can even create things impossible to create&rdquo;]. &ldquo;Nothing is really happening, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is doing everything&rdquo; &ndash; it is strict monism.<!-- /block --></p>

However, when at the next stage He told Arjuna, &ldquo;I have already set everything in a pre-arranged plan, you are a mere tool in my hands,&rdquo; it was clearly aprapatti. Till then it had not been clearly stated that &ldquo;It is I who do everything. Everything takes place as per My wish.

It is the final statement about the supreme human desideratum. Regarding the path of movement, many things are said, but regarding the goal the final word is this: &ldquo;Forgetting all other things, forgetting your desires and aspirations, come to Me.&rdquo; Ma&#x301;mekam&#x301; sharan&#x301;am&#x301; vraja &ndash; &ldquo;take shelter in Me.&rdquo; This is nothing but prapatti.<!-- /block --></p>

On this path there is neither prapatti nor aprapatti.

<a name="37..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Perhaps you know that the word guru is a very old Vedic word. It means &ldquo;one who dispels darkness&rdquo;. Now, this expression &ldquo;one who dispels darkness&rdquo; is often used without deeper understanding. This darkness actually belongs not only to the psychic stratum or the spiritual stratum, but to all strata of human existence. That is, darkness prevails in all the three strata &ndash; in the crude physical sphere, in the psychic sphere, and in the spiritual sphere. So a guru will necessarily have to be able to remove darkness from all three strata. If he teaches the alphabet or some academic matter to students, he will be called a teacher &ndash; teacher in the academic sense. That will not do. If, again, he removes darkness from the psychic world, he imparts intellectual knowledge to his followers, that will not be enough either. And if, finally, he dispels darkness only from the spiritual stratum of his disciples, that will not do either. The fact is that a guru &ndash; if one is to be accepted as a real guru &ndash; shall have to remove darkness from all the strata of the physical world, all the strata of the psychic world, and also all the strata of the spiritual world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now let us look at the spiritual world. In the spiritual world, he alone can be a guru who can lift downtrodden humanity to a high spiritual level, who can illumine humanity with spiritual effulgence. That is, only a Maha&#x301;kaola has the requisite qualification to be a guru, others cannot be gurus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In order to be an ideal guru in the spiritual sphere, one must be throughly conversant with the minutest details of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, every aspect of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, important or unimportant. The guru must not only learn those things, but must also possess the capacity to teach those practices to others. Otherwise he should not be treated as a guru. The Maha&#x301;kaola alone has this capacity, no one else. Kaolas are those who by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; have successfully elevated their microcosmic stance and established it in the Macrocosmic one; but a Maha&#x301;kaola is one who is a kaola, certainly, but at the same time possesses the capacity to help others as well to get to that exalted kaola position. In the past Lord Shiva was one such Maha&#x301;kaola. Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was another. To be a guru one must be a Maha&#x301;kaola.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->One must possess knowledge regarding sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, not only thorough knowledge of the sha&#x301;stras [scriptures]. And in order to gain thorough scriptural knowledge, one must know as many important languages as are necessary for the purpose. That is to say, it is not enough that a guru acquire the necessary qualifications to be able to teach sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (that is, impart lessons on the practical cult); he must possess adequate knowledge of theory also. That is, in order to know the inner secret of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, he must possess thorough and authentic scriptural knowledge; then only should he be accepted as a perfect guru in the spiritual sphere. One who has a fairly good knowledge of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and can also help others in that realm, but is completely devoid of intellect, or knowledge of languages and scriptures, cannot be a perfectly competent guru in the spiritual sphere; for, being a guru, he will have to explain the theoretical side also. If, suppose, I say to someone, &ldquo;Do this,&rdquo; I should also explain why he or she should do that, and at the same time I should be able to support it in the light of the sha&#x301;stras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->You may raise the question, &ldquo;What is a sha&#x301;stra?&rdquo; You might point to a voluminous book and call it a sha&#x301;stra, but that would be misleading. Sha&#x301;stra in the true sense means, Sha&#x301;sana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah sha&#x301;strah parikiirtitah &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Sha&#x301;stra is that which disciplines and liberates humans.&rdquo; So a guru must be well versed in sha&#x301;stra, otherwise he cannot show the right path to humankind. The term guru would be a misleading misnomer &ndash; which is never desirable. Sha&#x301;stra does not necessarily mean the Vedas; it means the way to emancipation through inculcation of rigorous discipline; it is something that prevents one from taking license in the name of liberty. It means clear instructions that guide everyone along the path, that lead to attainment of prosperity and welfare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Sha&#x301;sana&#x301;t. What is this sha&#x301;sana? Does it mean torture? No. Does it mean punishment? No. Does it mean atonement?  No. Not at all. Here sha&#x301;stra means anusha&#x301;sana. What is anusha&#x301;sana? Hita&#x301;rthe sha&#x301;sanam anusha&#x301;sanam &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Anusha&#x301;sanam means that degree of rectificatory punishment which will be conducive to one&#146;s well-being.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->A spiritual guru must be well-acquainted with all the processes of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, must have the capacity to convince others, must possess complete knowledge of the scriptures, must know many languages, and must have comprehensive knowledge and intellect, plus some extra qualifications. What are those qualifications? Nigraha&#x301;nugrahe shakto gururityabhidhiiyate &ndash; &ldquo;the guru must possess the capacity both to punish, and to love, or bless, his disciples.&rdquo; Punishment alone, without love, is not good. Love and punishment should go together, and the degree of punishment should never exceed the degree of love. Then  only  can  one be called a real spiritual guru.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->I have already said that a guru must be an authority on all subjects in all the three strata:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->As a spiritual guru, he must be thoroughly versed in spiritual science &ndash; both the theory and the practice. He must know how Parama Purus&#x301;a associates Himself with jiivas [unit beings]; and he must know how jiivas associate themselves with Parama Purus&#x301;a (they associate themselves just as the Ganges merges into the Bay of Bengal). Otherwise, how can he teach this science to others?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And who knows this science? Only Parama Purus&#x301;a knows it, because He Himself has created everything. He has created our sense organs, and He has created the tanma&#x301;tras<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.37.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#37.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> that our sense organs detect. He can create anything He likes. But remember, He does not do anything. His &ldquo;doing&rdquo; means His thinking. Things will take shape as He thinks. No one but Parama Purus&#x301;a knows how He does it. So how can people know Parama Purus&#x301;a if He does not teach to others the science of knowing Him? Only Parama Purus&#x301;a knows the science and the method to realize Him, to know Him; because He has created both human beings and the path that they must move along. So people can know the method by His grace only. Hence it has been said in A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.37.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#37.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Brahmaeva Gururekah na&#x301;parah &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Brahma alone is the Guru.&rdquo; Through His physical structure, He teaches the actual science to the spiritual aspirants. People should clearly understand this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There are many people who are prone to think that in the spiritual realm there is no need to acquire intellectual knowledge for God-realization; and in support of their thesis they mention the names of some great men. Now it is true that for God-realization, academic qualification may not be necessary at all: there is no differentiation between a learned person and a foolish one. But in order to be a guru, one must be a learned person. God-realization is not enough for a guru, he must possess other qualifications as well. So a person who is devoid of learning and scriptural knowledge and the capacity to teach others, and the twin capacities to punish and reward his disciples, should never be accepted as a spiritual guru. A guru does not mean only a spiritual guru, he must be a guru for the intellectual and physical worlds also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->After the spiritual sphere comes the psychic sphere, which is cruder than the former. That is, the guru must be aware of the nature of the human mind &ndash; what it is made of, how it should be elevated step by step from crude to subtle, how all the unit minds can march together in unison towards the goal &ndash; in a word, he must know both the theoretical and the applied sides of psychology. He must know a thousand times more than is written in books. He must assimilate everything through his own refined intellect. And then only can he teach others perfectly. That shows that he must be not only a spiritual guru, but also a guru in the psychic world. There is a sense of want in the human mind. One who can remove the sense of want is a guru. In order to qualify as a guru, one must have the power to remove psychic wants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->As in the spiritual sphere, so also in the psychic sphere, a guru must be learned. He should be well-versed in the humanities; in fact, in all branches of human knowledge. In order to be a spiritual guru, it will be sufficient that he have mastery over scriptural treatises; but to be a guru in the psychic sphere, he must be well-versed in all branches of human knowledge. A limited knowledge of a few scriptures will not do. And simultaneously, he must be conversant with the style in which the human mind functions, as also in the method to control and guide it properly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Next comes the physical world. The followers, the disciples, of the guru, are men and women of flesh and blood having physical structures. They have their sorrows and miseries, their tears and smiles. This is their life. They have their problem of food and clothing; they have their pleasures and pains, their tears of pain and tears of joy; they become elated in happy circumstances and depressed when things go wrong. It is the duty of a guru to provide his followers with the wherewithal for their progress. This is what an ideal guru is to do in the physical sphere. As a guru in the physical world, he will have to teach mankind such techniques as will solve their wordly problems &ndash; problems of food, clothing, education and medical treatment. A guru must see to it that their mundane problems are solved.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->So in order to be a guru, one must come onto this earth with the highest qualifications in the spiritual field, and with the greatest capacity to face the mountainous obstacles in the physical world. To shoulder the responsibility of a guru is not child&#146;s play.<!-- /block --></p>

If the entire mind is focused on the colour of the rose, the mind will become totally identified with the rose and will ultimately think, &ldquo;I am the rose.&rdquo; Sama&#x301;dhi on the indriyas<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.38.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#38.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is also possible. One who attains sama&#x301;dhi on a particular indriya consciously brings it under control and gets one&#146;s work done according to one&#146;s sweet will. This was widely practised in Avidya&#x301; Tantra in the past.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The indriyas can function either within or beyond their immediate surroundings. For instance, from here you can physically see a part of Calcutta. But if you have been to Naihati [a small town about thirty miles from Calcutta], you will certainly also be able to visualize a part of that town while sitting here in this room. In this case a proper adjustment must be brought about between your eyes and the previous perception. Your mind decides, &ldquo;I want to see the features of Naihati,&rdquo; and your eye indriya responds accordingly. This is called the &ldquo;mental eye&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Avidya&#x301; Tantrics make use of this sort of process. With the help of their sense organs and ectoplasms they create positive hallucinations. In Sanskrit this science is called ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii vidya&#x301;. (Ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asa does not refer to any monstrous type of animal, but to a particular group of humans.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.38.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#38.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> ) With the help of your mental eyes and your psychic power you can create an image visible to the eyes of an ordinary person. You can actually suspend the power of vision of another person so that he sees the object you want him to see. This is called ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Such negative practices are common in Avidya&#x301; Tantra. For example, suppose a wicked person may be sitting in a solitary place where bones are scattered around. Using his or her psychic power, the person can create ectoplasmic &ldquo;hands&rdquo;, and command them to throw the bones into the house of the person whom he or she wishes to harm. The inhabitants of the house, ordinary people no doubt, will certainly be terrified by such occult phenomena. They will think it is the work of a ghost and will probably decide to move out of the house. Instead of bones, bricks or stones could also be hurled. To do this, one does not require great power &ndash; ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is an occult power of inferior degree.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, though fictional, contains some stories which illustrate ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. The golden deer is one such story. Of course, there was never a real golden deer &ndash; can you imagine such a thing? &ndash; rather the &ldquo;demon&rdquo; Marich fabricated a golden deer using his occult power. Another such story goes as follows: Prince Angad, the son of King Bali, was about to present his credentials to King Ravana in court. The nineteen ministers present wanted to humiliate him in some way, and decided to use their ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii ma&#x301;ya&#x301; for the purpose. Present in the court at the time were Prince Angad, King Ravana and his son Indrajit, and the nineteen ministers. In order to baffle Angad, the ministers created a form tanma&#x301;tra,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.38.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#38.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> a type of positive hallucination, through which they all assumed the form of King Ravana. So, his vision distorted, Angad&#146;s perception was that there were a total of twenty Ravanas by the side of Indrajit. Nineteen of them were the ministers, of course, but due to the hypnotic spell exercised by their ectoplasm on his mind (they put themsleves into a kind of ta&#x301;nma&#x301;trik sama&#x301;dhi, in this case involving the tanma&#x301;tra of form), they all looked like Ravana. The best way to disturb someone&#146;s mental concentration is to make him or her angry by being provocative. Be it Vidya&#x301; Tantra or Avidya&#x301; Tantra, everything depends on the degree of psychic concentration. So Angad thought, &ldquo;I have to disturb their mental balance by provoking them in some way and making them angry. If I make them angry, their arms and legs will tremble and they will lose their mental balance. Consequently they will lose their ectoplasmic support, and their ta&#x301;nma&#x301;trik sama&#x301;dhi will be destroyed.&rdquo; And Angad did just that. He said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="39..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I have already told you that ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii vidya&#x301; is not the black magic of so-called demons, but a kind of occult science. Perhaps you know that Tantra is divided into two branches, and similarly, occult powers are expressed in two ways. Sa&#x301;dhakas who have reached Iishvarakot&#x301;i (but not Brahmakot&#x301;i, the highest stage of human realization) through intense spiritual practice attain both vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301; shakti, both positive and negative occult power. People usually call this aeshvarya [divine power], but this is not completely accurate. The other day while discussing that phenomenon with a few people, I said that some of these occult powers are dependent on space, while others are beyond it. Iishvarakot&#x301;i sa&#x301;dhakas, through special efforts, can master some negative and positive powers, and may apply them to certain human beings, places, or ideas. But a Brahmakot&#x301;i sa&#x301;dhaka can apply those powers throughout the entire universe at one time, through his prota yoga. Moreover, with the help of ota yoga, he can apply his power to an individual place or person if he so wishes. The same thing, when applied on a crude level, may take the form of magic. This explains the external side; but if people remain satisfied with the attainment of these occult powers and stop advancing along the supreme path, the fullest expression of their human potentialities will be checked. To bring about the greatest fulfilment in life, sa&#x301;dhakas will have to reach the pinnacle of the state of ekendriya. That is, instead of directing their mind-stuff towards crude objects, they must channelize their minds towards the Macrocosm, and embrace the Macrocosm fully as their goal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="39..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;dhakas who accept this shloka as the supreme and final guidance, and move accordingly along the path of ekendriya sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, are capable of devoting their minds to the highest stage of spiritual realization. Their lives become meaningful. It is not enough just to ideate on Brahma, one must also practice ekendriya sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Here ekendriya means that all the expressions of the sensory and motor nerves, and all the energy and subtle power of the nerves, indriyas, and mind-stuff, should be directed towards the Supreme Goal. This uni-directional movement towards the goal is the stage of ekendriya. In this stage the sa&#x301;dhaka does not attach any importance to any particular indriya, idea or thought, but attaches paramount importance to the Supreme Goal. Such a sa&#x301;dhaka ultimately rises above both Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301; Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301; Tantra is an approach of positive ideas towards the world, whereas Avidya&#x301; Tantra is an approach of negative ideas. People who tread the negative path tend to become crude. And if they follow the path of positive ideas, they may attain name, fame, social status, etc., but fail to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. They will even fail to attain higher lokas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.39.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#39.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The person who follows neither of these two paths, but thinks only of Parama Purus&#x301;a, will attain Him one day and will be elevated from the ekendriya stage to the vashiika&#x301;ra stage. This path of transcending positive and negative ideas is called in Tantra madhyama ma&#x301;rga [middle path]. (Buddha called it majhjhima&#x301; ma&#x301;gga). This is the only path that leads to the highest fulfilment in human life. Na&#x301;nyah pantha&#x301; vidyate ayana&#x301;ya [&ldquo;There is no other path&rdquo;]. At that stage the sensory world has no attraction for a sa&#x301;dhaka whatsoever. But those sa&#x301;dhakas who dabble in the positive and negative aspects of Tantra readily become engrossed in mundane affairs. The time and energy employed to master the positive and negative aspects is a waste, for it diverts the mind and delays its movement towards the higher planes of existence. In my opinion it is better not to waste one&#146;s time on such inconsequential pursuits. Instead it would be wiser for people to utilize their time and energy in the attainment of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="40..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Tantra, as you know, is divided into two branches &ndash; Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301;. Shiva formulated all the Tantras, and thus all Tantrics regard Shiva as their supreme and final shelter. In all schools of Tantra there are certain rules, and these are compulsory for practitioners of both Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301; Tantra. The difference between the two is that Avidya&#x301; Tantra invariably leads one towards crudification, and ultimately annihilation; whereas Vidya&#x301; Tantra leads one from crude to subtle, and invigorates the human life, mind and soul &ndash; in fact the whole existence &ndash; with exuberant joy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->At the initial stage of progress in spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the human mind becomes more subtle, enabling one to achieve a certain degree of control over the physical world as well as the mind. This realm of existence, in which psychic control can be exercised to some extent, is called the ka&#x301;mamaya jagat [of the Macrocosmic Mind]. Through such psychic control one can gain material wealth, or earn a certain degree of name and fame. Now, where do these things come from? They come from the cruder manifestation of the Cosmic Mind (this perceptible world is itself a cruder manifestation of the Cosmic Mind). Thus at this stage sa&#x301;dhakas may attain and establish supremacy over certain things in the crude world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->One may also strive to make the mind more subtle while endeavouring to exercise greater control over the mundane world. This is the path of Avidya&#x301; Tantra. In this endeavour the practitioners remain totally preoccupied with the attainment of name, fame, prosperity, and material enjoyments &ndash; these are their goals. The purpose of their spiritual practice is to make the mind increasingly subtle, in order to be able to exercise further control, not only over the physical world, but over the crude minds of other microcosms as well. Their goal is not noble, and will result in their ultimately being converted into inert matter. So the final result of Avidya&#x301; Tantra is extreme crudity. I have attempted to explain this in some of my ghost stories.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.40.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#40.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Try to find time to read them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="40..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The second stage is artha. What is artha? Suppose a person has been struck with afflictions (they are of three types &ndash; crude, subtle and causal) and seeks to destroy them. The permanent cessation of these triple afflictions is named parama&#x301;rtha, and their temporary cessation, artha. At this second stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; human beings also try to make their minds more subtle through spiritual elevation, but not to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. Their goal is to develop the capacity to dominate the minds of others. Paradoxically, they are trying to make the mind subtle while attempting to establish supremacy over others. This stage is neither entirely Vidya&#x301; nor entirely Avidya&#x301; &ndash; it is an intermediate stage. Sa&#x301;dhakas who tread this path cannot attain the supreme fulfilment of existence, for they try to master the psychic occult powers of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and ignore Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. Their fate is to move in the crude arena of the psychic sphere of Parama Purus&#x301;a until the day comes when they lose their psychic power and degenerate. Maharshi Jaimini formulated his philosophy, the Pu&#x301;rva Miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301; Darshana, on the basis of this type of psychology. But in this world, such a philosophy does not stand the test of pragmatism, either physical or mental, or of spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="41..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Khamu&#x301;rtti.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.41.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#41.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Kha + mu&#x301;rtti = khamu&#x301;rtti. Khamu&#x301;rtti literally means &ldquo;image in space&rdquo;. Since ancient times rs&#x301;is, sages, yogis, and spiritual aspirants have sometimes seen a kind of luminous body or disembodied soul, by the divine grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. These luminous bodies assist spiritual aspirants in all possible ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Only spiritual aspirants are able to see these luminous bodies through the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Though they are visible to the naked eye, they cannot be photographed. Spiritual aspirants can speak to these luminous bodies and get answers to their questions. While the words of a spiritual aspirant may be recorded on a tape recorder, the answers given by the luminous bodies cannot be recorded. If a spiritual aspirant asks them for any mundane object, they may or may not grant the request. If they do grant the request, they do so only once, and after that they will never come within that person&#146;s sight again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If a spiritual aspirant asks for something spiritual, one may get it either directly or through the siddhas. Siddhas are a category of microvita<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.41.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#41.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  which are very helpful to spiritual aspirants. I have already told you about the different categories of devayonis or microvita, and in that connection I have said something about siddhas. Yogis and spiritual aspirants say that sometimes during their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; they see siddhas and receive direct help from them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->People see khamu&#x301;rttis due to the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. But the guru cautions them that they should never ask for any object of enjoyment or any mundane object from a khamu&#x301;rtti. If people want objects of enjoyment, they will find themselves caught in the insidious snare of enjoyment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->It is worth mentioning here that one should not confuse khamu&#x301;rtti with cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a. Cha&#x301;ya&#x301; Purus&#x301;a is a mere game of light and shade. If someone gazes intently on a dazzling white object and then looks at a dimly-lit object, one will only see a shadow. This shadow is called cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a. If you look towards the sun for a while and then look at another part of the sky, you will see a kind of shadow. Similarly, if you look at the flame of a burning lamp for some time and then look at a source of dim light, you are sure to see a kind of shadow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In ancient times, people who practised hypnotism<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.41.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#41.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> would see cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a at night with the help of the moon, or with the help of a burning lamp (fueled by ghee) on new-moon nights. With their vision fixed on the cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a, they would gradually become conversant with the science of hypnotism. Since olden times, the practice of Avidya&#x301; Tantra and the science of hypnotism have been well known in India and China. In modern times, the science of hypnotism was used to cure disease by Dr. Mesmer, a [European] physician. Since then, curing diseases by the science of hypnotism has been called &ldquo;mesmerism&rdquo;, after him. So now you understand that cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a as used in hypnotism or mesmerism is only a game of light and shade.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->A khamu&#x301;rtti, however, is a thoroughly spiritual vision. Cha&#x301;ya&#x301; purus&#x301;a is a mere image of a shadow, whereas khamu&#x301;rtti is an image of bright effulgence. If any of you have had a chance to see such a khamu&#x301;rtti or are still seeing one on any occasion due to the grace of the guru, you should not pray for any mundane object or for any finite object of enjoyment from these khamu&#x301;rttis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There is yet another kind of shadowy appearance unrelated to khamu&#x301;rtti. In Tantra this is known as yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii darshana. As a result of practising a special type of Tantra, people attain the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi. (Such people are known as yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhas &ndash; sa&#x301;dhakas who have attained a type of occult power.) These yaks&#x301;in&#x301;iis<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.41.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#41.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> work under the instructions of the siddhas, and provided that some rules and regulations are not violated, they abide by their instructions. Usually the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;iis cannot be induced to perform any evil deed. They have no influence in the supernatural and spiritual spheres &ndash; their influence is primarily exerted in the physical sphere and to some extent in the psychic sphere. They follow the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhas like a shadowy image, and very often can be found moving on walls or inside rooms like black shadows. I have never heard of anyone being harmed by a yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii, but it may have happened.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->I know a certain person who was a professor of physics in a college in Bihar. Let us suppose his name was Swapneshwar Chattopadhyaya. I heard that he had attained yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi. He did not have a son, but a daughter who lived far away from him, in the house of her father-in-law. She had a daughter who used to live with her grandparents (Swapneshwar Chattopadhyaya and his wife). The granddaughter was very young &ndash; about two or three years old.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Once Mr. Chattopadhyaya had to go to Calcutta for quite a long time in connection with his academic pursuits. His wife &ndash; say her name was Kanika &ndash; was a very good but a timid woman. The thought that she would have to live alone for a long time made her feel half-dead. After all, how far could she rely on her tiny granddaughter? Mr. Chattopadhyaya consoled his wife, saying, &ldquo;Don&#146;t worry. My yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii will take care of you. She will help you in all ways.&rdquo; On the eve of his departure for Calcutta, he showed his wife a black shadowy image reflected on the wall of their meditation room. Though the figure was very small, it looked like a human figure. Mr. Chattopadhyaya said to his wife, &ldquo;This yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii will protect you from all troubles and dangers.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->He set out on his journey and was expected to return after forty-five days. Immediately after his departure, many strange things began to happen. Wherever Kanika went, the image of the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii followed her like a shadow. For the first few days Kanika was a bit nervous, seeing the shadowy image, but later on, as she was obliged to spend time in its company, she overcame her fear. Rather, she grew more courageous than before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->At noon one day, while Kanika was washing the dishes in the kitchen, she suddenly noticed that the image of the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii was shaking abnormally. At first she was puzzled, but then she saw the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii move quickly out of the room. She followed the image and also left the room. The yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii came to the door of the living room beside the main gate. Kanika discovered that a thief dressed like a gentleman was about to escape with a suitcase that was kept in the room. The thief caught sight of Kanika and took to his heels, leaving the suitcase behind. The main gate had been left open by mistake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->On another day, Kanika was sitting in the kitchen kneading flour. Suddenly she noticed that the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii was shaking violently again. Kanika looked at the figure in utter amazement. Immediately it went out of the kitchen, and Kanika followed it closely. The yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii rushed towards the well across the courtyard of the house. As soon as Kanika looked towards the well she became alarmed&#8230; horrified. She noticed that her three-year-old granddaughter was sitting precariously on the edge of the well, looking down into it. If she moved slightly this way or that, or if she moved only a little to look at her own reflection in the water, she would immediately fall into the well. No one could prevent her certain death. Kanika moved stealthily forward from behind, picked the child up, and placed her on her lap.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Barely a month had passed since Swapneshwar had left for Calcutta. One day Kanika was cutting okra (&ldquo;ladies&#146; finger&rdquo;) in the kitchen. Suddenly she looked at the image of the yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii on the wall, and she noticed that it was gradually disappearing. She looked all over the wall but could not see the image anywhere. Meanwhile, she heard the sound of someone knocking at the front door. Kanika went to the door and opened it, only to see Swapneshwar standing on the doorstep. Seeing Kanika, Swapneshwar said, &ldquo;I was supposed to stay in Calcutta for one and a half months, but as the job was finished in one month, I came home without delay.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I am narrating what little information I have about yaks&#x301;in&#x301;iis. Formerly, some people used to perform yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; according to the prescribed Tantric rituals. I do not know if people still do the same thing today. In the past there were no caste or communal barriers as far as these Tantric practices were concerned, nor are there any today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The system of performing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; on various deities is not exactly the same as this, but somewhat similar. Deities like shadowy figures also become visible through this practice. Although this sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is different to some extent from the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi, the psychology in both is the same. All the systems of Ka&#x301;lii siddhi, Durga&#x301; siddhi, d&#x301;a&#x301;kinii siddhi, yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi, etc., are different in practice, yet they are similar theoretically. In case one wants to achieve the siddhi of various deities, one should acquire more mental purity than in the case of yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi, da&#x301;kinii siddhi, yoginii siddhi, etc., because this subject concerns the psychic stratum. It is of elevated nature, but it has no relation whatsoever to the realm of genuine spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Once when I visited Allahabad, a certain gentleman came in contact with me. He told me that he had attained Ka&#x301;lii siddhi. I said to him, &ldquo;Well, can you try to tell me something about your experiences? For instance, what do you see, what do you understand, etc.?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->He said, &ldquo;I perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; according to such and such system. One day after sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; I saw a shadowy image of Ka&#x301;lii on the wall. Since then, whenever my mind gets concentrated, that image of Ka&#x301;lii produces some kind of vibration in my mind which enables me to understand what it wants to convey to me. Last night that image conveyed to me that you were coming to Allahabad today from Bihar and that you would stay here for a few days.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->I asked him, &ldquo;Can you see the red mark on Ka&#x301;lii&#146;s feet, her ankle bells, her iron bangles, the garland of skulls around her neck, the garland of fingers, etc.?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->He replied, &ldquo;No, I do not see anything like that. All those things are mixed up in the shadow. The shadow itself is the combination of all those things.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Then I asked him about yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi, and I also asked if he knew the difference between yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi and Ka&#x301;lii siddhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In the case of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi, there is less devotional intensity due to lack of deep ideation. But during Ka&#x301;lii sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; there is a fair degree of devotion, and at the same time the psychic state is somewhat peaceful.  Usually, people do not utilize Ka&#x301;lii shakti for destructive purposes, but of course there may be some Avidya&#x301; Tantrics who use their acquired power for malevolent deeds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->This type of siddhi of various deities is a kind of psychic achievement of a higher order, yet this has nothing to do with the spiritual world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..24"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Uttamo Brahmasadbha&#x301;vo madhyama&#x301; dhya&#x301;nadha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;;<br>Japastutih sya&#x301;dhadhama&#x301; mu&#x301;rtipu&#x301;ja&#x301;dhama&#x301;dhama&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..25"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->[Ideation on Brahma is the best, dhya&#x301;na and dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; are second best, repetitious incantation and eulogistic prayer are the worst, and idol worship is the worst of the worst.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->You may have heard that some people attain bhu&#x301;ta siddhi or preta siddhi (the ability to communicate with ghosts). This ability is greatly inferior to yaks&#x301;in&#x301;ii siddhi.  In olden days, some people would follow the practice of bhu&#x301;ta siddhi, usually to extend their influence or to do harm to others, and would perform many misdeeds. Today no one follows this practice; if some people do, they are very few.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Instances of people being possessed by ghosts, gods and goddesses, d&#x301;a&#x301;kiniis, yoginiis, etc., are somewhat similar to this from the psychological perspective. You may have noticed that sometimes people look for those who are &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; by Manasa&#x301; [snake goddess], Satii-Ma&#x301; [Mother Satii], etc., when they feel an immense desire to find answers to their questions. Others visit special places or localities to attain the exact answers to their problems.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Although these things are similar psychologically, they are somewhat different in practice. To treat various diseases by performing a special type of dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; [deep concentration] on various gods and goddesses, is nothing but the play of the conscious, subconscious and unconscious levels of the mind.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.41.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#41.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="41..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->If, due to the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a, someone gets the chance to see a khamu&#x301;rtti and asks that entity for success on the path of self-abnegation, then one may get such inspiration from that siddha devayoni (positive microvitum). One will merge one&#146;s individual existence and spiritual flow into the Macrocosmic stance of Parama Purus&#x301;a and attain savishes&#x301;a or savikalpa samadhi, the state of partial absorption of mind; or, by merging in the supreme stance of Parama Purus&#x301;a, attain nirvishes&#x301;a or nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi, the state of complete absorption of mind. This is the summit of spiritual attainment. In the final stages of one&#146;s spiritual journey, the entitative existence of the sa&#x301;dhaka is merged into Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="42..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The word guhya<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.42.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#42.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> as commonly used means something mysterious, something concealed, something like a dreadful nightmare, some secret chant, some mystical occult power; or witchcraft. Or finally, it may indicate the five branches [exclusive to] Avidya&#x301; Tantra &ndash; ma&#x301;ran&#x301;a, vashiikaran&#x301;, ucca&#x301;t&#x301;ana, sammohana and stambhana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Avidya&#x301; Tantra has six branches in all; the sixth branch is called sha&#x301;ntikarma, which is an element common to both Vidya&#x301; Tantra and Avidya&#x301; Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The six branches of Vidya&#x301; Tantra are: to awaken benevolent intellect, to awaken noble propensities, to arouse a sense of humility, to arouse a sense of dharma, to arouse a sense  of self-surrender, and sha&#x301;ntikarma [propitiatory rites for others&#146; welfare]. So as we see, sha&#x301;ntikarma is an element common to both Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The s&#x301;at&#x301;karma [six actions] of Vidya&#x301; Tantra are applied in order to elevate human beings in the world of spirituality by goading them towards auspicious thoughts; whereas the s&#x301;at&#x301;karma of Avidya&#x301; Tantra are applied in order to exploit human beings and utilize them for one&#146;s own self interest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The first action of Vidya&#x301; Tantra is the awakening of the benevolent intellect in human beings. Very often people are guided by the crude intellect. That is, they have intellect, but they cannot utilize it; or their intellect is not utilized in the practical sphere. Now if these people are trained to utilize their intellect in the practical sphere, they can prosper in life. This is how both human beings and animals can be guided along the respective paths of their own welfare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The second action is the awakening of the nobler vrttis [propensities] in the human mind. There are approximately one thousand propensities in the human mind. They are controlled from a particular point in the guru cakra. That particular point is called the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Not that the total number of propensities is exactly one thousand. But anyway, of the propensities, some are benevolent, some are malevolent, and some are neutral.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Some are neutral, as I said. For instance, if you inadvertently put your hand into fire, you quickly withdraw it; if thorns prick your foot, you quickly pull your foot back; when you see a snake in front of you, you take a quick jump; when you feel hungry you tell your mother to give you some food. Similarly you may feel sleepy, drowsy, etc. These are all neutral tendencies of mind. There is neither merit nor demerit in these psychic tendencies. Likewise, seeing, hearing, tasting, touching &ndash; these actions are also neutral in character, that is, neither good nor bad. Even in the most undeveloped protozoa, some of these instincts, if not all, are found to exist. The two recognized criteria of living beings &ndash; to multiply and to attempt to survive &ndash; are very prominent in undeveloped protozoa. These two are also neutral tendencies, above the domain of merits and demerits.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There are some other propensities which are definitely malevolent &ndash; for instance the eight fetters, the six enemies, harming others, tyrannizing over others without reason, profligacy, exploiting society, deliberately confusing and misguiding others, duping society with lofty words, falsehood, and hypocrisy. These are undeniably malevolent tendencies of mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And as regards the benevolent tendencies, they are compassion, love, sense of righteousness, service, helping others in distress, consoling the bereaved, arousing hope in frustrated hearts, etc. So the second action of Vidya&#x301; Tantra is to arouse the benevolent tendencies in the minds of human beings and of other microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The third action of Vidya&#x301; Tantra is the awakening of the sense of humility. Arrogance disturbs peace. If human beings develop modesty instead of arrogance it does no harm to anyone, and many undesirable situations can be prevented by thus avoiding arrogance. A modest person is respected and admired by others. Hence people should be taught to be modest starting at an early age. And even with those who have grown old, efforts should be made to rectify their arrogant nature. If such people are corrected, they too can learn modesty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301; dada&#x301;ti vinayam&#x301; vinaya&#x301;dya&#x301;ti pa&#x301;trata&#x301;m;<br>Pa&#x301;tratat dhanama&#x301;pnoti dhana&#x301;ddharma tato sukham.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..13"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->[A proper education leads to modesty, and through modesty one wins the respect of society.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The fourth action is the awakening of the sense of dharma in human beings. The basic difference between human beings and other creatures is that human beings are capable of following dharma. This propensity of dharma is either dominant or dormant in human beings. A person in whom the propensity of dharma is very much alive should be encouraged to make vigorous efforts to augment it even more, so that the propensity of dharma becomes more and more manifest. One who is sleeping should be awakened. In the absence of the sense of dharma there is hardly any difference between humans and animals, rather the human without dharma goes one step lower than the animal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;ha&#x301;ra-nidra&#x301;-bhaya-maethunain&#x32D;ca<br>Sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nyametad pashubhirnara&#x301;na&#x301;m;<br>Dharmo hi tes&#x301;a&#x301;m adhiko vishes&#x301;ah<br>Dharmena hiina&#x301;h pashubhih sama&#x301;na&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..16"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->[Food, sleep, fear, procreation &ndash; these are the common properties of humans and  animals. But humans possess an especial dharma (Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma), in the absence of which they are no better than animals.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The fifth action of Vidya&#x301; Tantra is to arouse the sense of self-surrender. Human beings are microcosms, finite; whereas Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Macrocosm, the Infinite Entity. So if a finite microcosm throws down a challenge to the Infinite Macrocosm, it is simply ludicrous. If a tiny mouse wants to wrestle with a lion, the lion may or may not even be aware of the final outcome, but the poor mouse will know all about it. That is why starting from early childhood one should develop the habit of self-surrender to the Supreme Entity in all thoughts and actions. There is no greater happiness or peace or joy than in complete surrender to Parama Purus&#x301;a. The essence of the spirit of self-surrender is contained in the following shloka:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Tvameva ma&#x301;ta&#x301; ca pita&#x301; tvameva<br>Tvameva bandhushca sakha&#x301; tvameva;<br>Tvameva vidya&#x301; dravin&#x301;am&#x301; tvameva<br>Tvameva sarvam&#x301; mama Devadeva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..19"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[Thou art my father and my mother, Thou art my friend and my eternal companion, Thou art my learning and my wealth, Thou art my everything, O Supreme Lord.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Sha&#x301;ntikarma, performing propitiatory rites, is the sixth action of Vidya&#x301; Tantra. If one&#146;s predominant defects, caused by the influence of bad stars, are removed, then the suffering consequent upon those defects, and therefore also the legacy of the bad stars, can be avoided.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Now let us analyse the six actions of Avidya&#x301; Tantra. <ol> <li>One part of Avidya&#x301; Tantra is to kill or cause the death of someone through mantra or through some related technique or in some artificial way. This is called ma&#x301;ran&#x301;a. [Ma&#x301;ra literally means &ldquo;annihilation&rdquo;.] <li>Bringing somebody under one&#146;s control by means of a mantra or a dravyagun&#x301;a [some plant or other natural substance which projects psychic effects], or by wearing a squirrel&#146;s tail like a ring on the little finger of the left hand and chanting the mantra hriim&#x301; kriim&#x301; klu, or by feeding that tail to a person in a cha&#x301;nci pa&#x301;n [a betel preparation], is known as vashiikaran&#x301;a. But remember that this action must be accompanied by purashcaran&#x301;a [raising the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, the dormant force] as per Avidya&#x301; Tantric style. When under the influence of vashiikaran&#x301;a, a person becomes completely controlled and behaves like a servant. <li>Cat&#x301;ana or ca&#x301;t&#x301;ana means one&#146;s residence. When somebody is uprooted from his or her residence by means of a mantra or some mystic power or some dravyagun&#x301;a, the process is called ucca&#x301;t&#x301;ana. It is said that if a particular mantra is written on a brick in red ink and buried under the northeast corner of a house by a naked person on a rainy night, the owner of that house becomes uprooted within three days. This process may or may not fructify, but if it actually does the effect is disastrous. Keeping this fact in mind, I have deliberately refrained from giving the mantra in this book. <li>To get someone to do something by hypnotizing the person with light waves or by fixing one&#146;s gaze on him or by breaking or overpowering his personality is called sammohana. In English this process is called hypnotism. The [European] physician Dr. Mesmer did some research on this method to find out if this process could be utilized for the benefit of the public; hence this process is also known as &ldquo;mesmerism&rdquo;. <li>Stopping the flow or movement of something is called stambhana. Stambha means &ldquo;pillar&rdquo;. Since any moving thing will be stopped when it hits a pillar, stopping the movement of something by means of a mantra and some dravyagun&#x301;a is called stambhana. By using some mantra and holding under the tongue a ka&#x301;nt&#x301;a&#x301;nat&#x301;e root fitted into a silver ring (like a hub circled by its wheel), one can stop another person&#146;s movement or action. Suppose someone is about to urinate. The flow of urine is stopped. In the science of a&#x301;yurveda, the medical condition of constricted urination is known as mu&#x301;trastambha [just as this Avidya&#x301; practice is known as mu&#x301;trastambha]. Va&#x301;kstambha [stopping the flow of another person&#146;s voice] is a similar Avidya&#x301; Tantric practice. But the Avidya&#x301; Tantric should be cautious about trying to maintain the stambhana for a long time, because it requires him or her to remain in an abnormal condition [sometimes physiologically abnormal], which will eventually harm the person. <li>The sha&#x301;ntikarma of Avidya&#x301; Tantra means to save someone from a danger or a disease by means of certain rituals, and then redirect that danger or disease towards another person: that is, to help one person to survive by killing another. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->When the Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na and Vajraya&#x301;na Tantras of the Buddhist school of philosophy were popular in Bengal, these six actions of Avidya&#x301; Tantra were widely practised. But when the Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;na and Vajraya&#x301;na vanished from Bengal, the six actions also fell out of use. And the six actions of Vidya&#x301; Tantra fell out of use simultaneously. It is good that the actions of both have been forgotten by people. What is desirable is that people move towards spiritual elevation along the paths of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, karma, and bhakti<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.42.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#42.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> with a healthy and rational outlook.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="42..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The secret processes of Vidya&#x301; Tantra and Avidya&#x301; Tantra are called guhya vidya&#x301;.

Destroy my enemy, destroy. Uproot my enemy, uproot.&rdquo;] This sort of mentality should not be allowed to develop in a person. This sort of prayer should also be avoided.<!-- /block --></p>
