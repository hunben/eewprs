<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The people of ancient times used to employ all their energy for the gratification of their gross propensities (vrttis). But eventually they noticed that even through the persistent application of their individual and collective forces, their propensities were not fully fulfilled. It appeared that some unseen and greater force was playing with them every moment, thwarting all their efforts. Gradually they understood that, no matter how strongly they tried to impose their individual and collective might, their capacity was limited for their field of action was confined to the relative factors of time, space and person. What is that entity to whose inviolable decree they were ultimately compelled to submit? What are His characteristics? Who is He? No matter how developed the intellect or how pervasive its force, it is so difficult for us to fathom the immeasurable vastness of that Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->People unable to attain their objects of desire, bang their heads against the wall in utter frustration. Yet sometimes desired objects come to them whether they had wished for them or not. They accept this as their fate. But fate does not depend on anyone&#146;s whim, for if whim were everything, the seed of the microcosmic longings would have withered, but it has not. Thus people began to think that fate is nothing more than the reactions to their past actions. But as they cannot see their or understand their original actions, they call it their adrs&#x301;t&#x301;a (destiny). But in spite of human beings having attained a certain amount of freedom from the Supreme Controller (who allots the reactions to actions) even then they are at His total mercy. They are like footballs which can be kicked in any direction according to the desire of the players. This dependence on Parama Purus&#x301;a is essential for movement and inspiration. While seeking the original source (Praeti) of this inspiration, the thoughtful people of the distant past cultivated intuitional science (Brahmatattva). The subtlety of thought of those contemplative, progressive people lead them gradually from the world of matter to the world of ideas, and from the world of ideas to the world of consciousness. In the world of wisdom they were the first rs&#x301;is, the first torch-bearers of the illuminating flame of knowledge. They eventually succeeded in using their intellectual faculties to penetrate the sphere of Consciousness. As a result of the constant churning of their intellect human beings learned Brahma-vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na or intuitional science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Lay people went to those rs&#x301;is to illuminate the dark recesses of their minds with their bright light. And those wise people, in this process of answering each complex or simple question, eventually became masters of the intuitional sciences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The questions of the lay people were:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..6"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What is Brahma? What is the fundamental cause of our existence? What sustains our life? On what foundation does our existence stand? What is our base? Why is life a passing experience of pleasure and pain? O knower of Brahma, provide us with proper answers to these questions&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;lah svabha&#x301;vo niyatiryadrccha&#x301;<br>Bhuta&#x301;ni yonih purus&#x301;a iti cintya<br>Sam&#x301;yoga es&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; na tva&#x301;tmabha&#x301;va&#x301;d<br>Atma&#x301;pyaniishah sukhadukha hetoh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There is an unending number of questions in the human mind. &ldquo;Do the solutions of the above problems lie in the time factor? Is time the final answer? Is it the absolute truth? It appears that the first cause of creation is hidden in the womb of time. So time must be the original cause, the absolute factor? Is this not so? Whatever took place, whatever is taking place and whatever will take place is within the periphery of time, is it not? It must be the temporal factor (ka&#x301;la shakti) which has been giving birth to the universe as the Universal Mother (Vishvajananii); which has been preserving everything in its rhythmic and cyclical movement; and which, with its frantic dance, raucous laughter, and gnashing teeth has been destroying the world with its formidable power. The inscrutable play of light is nothing but a momentary flash upon its features. Belching darkness out of darkness time alone is the sole, well-established entity. O rs&#x301;i tell us, is not time alone the Absolute Entity?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The knower of Brahma replies, &ldquo;No, time is not the Absolute Entity.&rdquo; Time is only a relative factor, which is entirely dependent on the mutual relationship of place and person. Time is but the mind&#146;s measurement of the motivity of action. When there is no motivity of action, or when there is motivity of action but no mind to measure it, there is no time. To say that time is beginningless and endless is also incorrect. How can I accept that the universe was created in the womb of beginningless time, and that in the womb of endless time the universe will disappear? The mind (pa&#x301;tra-mana<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->) in which measurement exists did not exist before the creation, and thus there existed no imagination to measure time. The place and person upon which time depend are also relative factors. This evolutionary panorama revolves around the relative interdependence of the three relative factors time, place and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Thus time, which is entirely dependent on place and person, can never be the Absolute Factor. During sleep or in a senseless state the relation between place and person is not properly manifest, and so time becomes non-existent for that period. In order to realize that a period of time has lapsed between going to sleep and waking up, one has to study the environmental changes. We have formulated the solar year, solar month and solar day on the basis of the earth&#146;s rotation around the sun. Similarly, the lunar year, lunar month and lunar day have been determined on the basis of the rotation of the moon around the earth. If the earth has not moved around the sun, or the moon around the earth, or if the stars and planets had not followed their respective movements, time would never have existed. Unlike Tom, Dick and Harry; or citta, ahamtattva and mahatattva; or Purus&#x301;a, time is not a well manifest factor; it is neither non-matter nor is it totally independent of matter. Even if we were to call time non-matter, we would still have to admit that time is dependent on objects. The symbolization of time is impossible because it is non-material. Moreover, it is impossible to form an idea of time without thinking of objects as its existence is dependent on objects. If we say &ldquo;a hundred thousand years ago&rdquo; at once we indirectly think within ourselves that this incident occurred after an object like the earth rotated around an object like the sun a hundred thousand times. So no matter how we measure time, backward or forward, we have to bring it within the count of kalpas (mythologically, one day and night of Brahma &ndash; a period of 432 solar years of the mortals) or yugas (era), years or months, and these kalpas, yugas and months are solely and wholly dependent on objects. In the absence of objects these concepts of time would have been non-existent. I have already told you that the objects upon which time depend are also not the ultimate factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Direction (such as east, west, north, south) is not the absolute factor either. From afar the moon looks like a small dish but nearer it looks like a continent. Thus space too is not a stable entity. By the shortest route Bhagalpur is to the east of Monghyr but by the long route, which takes one around the whole world, it is to the west of Monghyr. So direction is also not an absolute factor. The person factor is also far from absolute &ndash; people&#146;s nature and characteristics are so different. Time is not a fixed concept because it is dependent on changing entities. The news of the world of yesterday is &ldquo; past&rdquo; to us, &ldquo; present&rdquo; to some other planet, and &ldquo;future&rdquo; to yet another planet. Past, present and future, upon which the expansion of time depends, are imagined according to the differences in place and person. So in reply to this natural question of the human mind, the rs&#x301;is or seers of those days said, &ldquo;Time can never be accepted as the primordial cause of creation.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Is nature (svabha&#x301;va) the fundamental cause of the universe?&rdquo; The rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;No, nature does not have original authorship.&rdquo; Nature is only the flow of the three immanent principles (sattva, rajah and tama) of Prakrti. It is an evolutionary flow and thus on seeing just one stage of it we can infer its previous and subsequent stages. Being aware of the trends of nature, we can study the tendencies and behaviour of living beings, plants and inanimate objects: what their individual characteristics are, how they evolved, what their potentialities are, how they will develop, etc. This study is what is called science. When this study is concerned with the material world, we call it physical science.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Nature is not the original authority or doer-entity, but is the dynamic waves of the centrifugal and centripetal movements (Sain&#x32D;cara and Pratisain&#x32D;cara) of Prakrti. It can at best be the determinant of the intrinsic characteristics of objects, but not their primary cause. Nature is a certain law, a certain procedure, but not the creating force. Nature cannot be accepted as the supreme authority.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So what is the primary cause of the world? Is it destiny (niyati)? The rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;No, not even that.&rdquo; Niyati is derived from the root ni &ndash; yam + ktin, and means that which controls the subsequent actions. As one sows, so shall one reap. The amount of reactions to be undergone by the unit entity is equal to the total actions previously performed. Destiny is the totality of unrequited reactions of actions performed. Its reactive momenta are called sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. In this observable world the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra-ridden unit entities cannot go beyond destiny&#146;s influence. Destiny keeps them so tightly in its grip that they think it is the controller of their fate (bha&#x301;gya-niyanta), as though it had already determined their path of progress. But destiny cannot be the absolute factor, for if you do not exist, if you do not act, destiny cannot exist either. Being dependent upon your doership for its existence, it cannot be the supreme controller.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now another question arises: Is this cosmic creation accidental? The rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; there is no such thing as an accident. Behind every event that takes place in the universe there is the law of causation. Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;abha&#x301;va&#x301;t ka&#x301;ryabha&#x301;va &ndash; there is no effect without a cause. Truly speaking, whatever we take to be an accident is nothing but an incident whose preceding cause we are unable to see or understand properly. So the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; is meaningless and to call this universe an accidental creation is simply to camouflage one&#146;s ignorance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Are the five fundamental factors the primary cause of this universe? Has consciousness evolved out of matter?&rdquo; &ldquo;No&rdquo;, says the rs&#x301;i, &ldquo;Matter or the five fundamental factors cannot be the absolute authority.&rdquo; None of them has the power or capacity of self determination &ndash; each one of them has to proceed through clashes and conflicts at the behest of some unseen power. Even in the very crude sphere these five elements have to proceed according to individual or collective human intellect. A little analysis will reveal that the five elements have no authority or doership in any of their conditions. They are always preoccupied with activities. An entity with functional obligations can on no account be the primary cause or absolute controller.&ldquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Is jiiva&#x301;tman then the supreme factor?&rdquo; &ldquo;No&rdquo;, says the rs&#x301;i, &ldquo;not even that.&rdquo; Jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; is only a cognitive force (jin&#x32D;a&#x301;trshakti), not an authority. Cognizance is possible of a cognitive force, not of the creation. Since the attributes of a knowing entity ( jin&#x32D;a&#x301;tr satta&#x301;) are absent, it can never be the creator. The A&#x301;tman is the knowing entity, not the creating force, and so jiiva&#x301;tman also is not the absolute authority.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Is creation accomplished through the union and mutual cooperation of two or more of the factors like time, nature, destiny, accident, elements or jiiva&#x301;tman?&rdquo; The rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;No&rdquo;. With the exception of svabha&#x301;va or the Operative Prakrti none has any direct contact with Purus&#x301;a. Cosmic creation is not possible as the result of the union of nature (svabha&#x301;va) or Prakrti, or actional force (karma shakti) with the Purus&#x301;a, or jiiva&#x301;tman or cognitive force. The expression of the Karma-shakti (actional flow) in the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nashakti (cognitive force) of the jiiva&#x301;tman no doubt gives rise to the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling or the manifestation of the mind, but that petty ego, due to the smallness of its sphere of activity, does not have the capacity of creating the universe, nor is it able to contact the creative cosmic force. The microcosmic subjectivity (jiiva&#x301;tmabha&#x301;va) cannot accept the world of objectivity with complete indifference. Thus the contact of matter with jiiva&#x301;tman cannot be accepted as the absolute factor. The conjunction of matter with jiiva&#x301;tman merely transforms objects into vehicles of enjoyment. And the result of this enjoyment is invariably addiction. Jiiva&#x301;tman is aniisha ( one having no controlling power) and so it has to take shelter in others. This is why the microcosmic subjectivity (jiiva&#x301;tmabha&#x301;va) becomes partially or fully attached to different entities. This attachment is the greatest characteristic of an entity having no controlling power. Jiiva&#x301;tman is not iisha but aniisha &ndash; not the controller but the controlled entity, and thus cannot be the cause of creation. It is because of this aniisha that unit beings have to undergo the mental distortions of pleasure and pain, and become assailed by virtue and vice as a result of environmental influences and struggles. That which is constantly being buffeted and battered every moment cannot discover the absolute factor. The rs&#x301;i says that you cannot discover the primordial factor in this way. In order to find it you will have to reach the Cause of all causes (Adikaran&#x301;a) &ndash; the Supreme Cause which itself has no cause. This causeless factor is the final answer to all queries - the culminating point of all contemplation and deliberation. Theoretically, this Supreme factor is certainly difficult for the common people to know for they have to proceed backwards along the path of causation. But if sa&#x301;dhakas evolve their intellects from crudity to subtlety it will be possible for them to reach the non-causal Factor. The rs&#x301;i says,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Te dhya&#x301;nayoga&#x301;nugata&#x301; apashyan deva&#x301;tmashaktim&#x301; svagun&#x301;aernigu&#x301;d&#x301;ha&#x301;m<br>Yah ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;ni nikhla&#x301;ni ta&#x301;ni ka&#x301;la&#x301;tmayukta&#x301;nyadhi t&#x301;ishatyekah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The rs&#x301;is have realized this Supreme truth through the practical cult of dhyana (meditation). By withdrawing the vrttis to their causes and by moving from crudity to subtlety, they have realized the Supreme Purus&#x301;a and His emanent power, Parama&#x301; Prakrti. They have realized that the quintessence of all essence, the knowledge of all knowledge, is that Supreme Purus&#x301;a Himself. After attaining Him the necessity to look for any cause disappears. Moving towards subtlety only on the strength of their manifest power they have realized the Supreme Force (Parama&#x301; Shakti) the Supreme Operative Principle (Parama&#x301; Prakrti Tattva). The Supreme Purus&#x301;a that they have realized in their meditation and the Parama&#x301; Prakrti that they have attained in their contemplative vision are indeed identical and inseparable. Parama Purus&#x301;a through the medium of His Prakrti or Operative Principle is the Primordial Cause of the creation of the world. Truly speaking, had it not been for His Operative Principle He would not have been able to evolve the universe. Purus&#x301;a permits Himself to be influenced by this Attributional Force (Prakrti) and appears in the role of Sagun&#x301;a (Qualified Purus&#x301;a) but when this Attributional Force does not find expression, Purus&#x301;a cannot be qualified. The Supreme Consciousness (Purus&#x301;a), together with the Supreme Operative Principle (Prakrti) is the Absolute Authority of the manifested universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Time, nature, destiny and accident are born in Him and sheltered in Him. He alone is the Supreme Creator, the Supreme Shelter of all. The apparent cause of the factors we call relative truths (time, space and person) is the jiivama&#x301;nas (the unit mind) and the cause of this jiivama&#x301;nas is the Qualified Consciousness (Sagun&#x301;a Brahma) in conjunction with Parama&#x301; Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->No matter what the entities may be, and no matter what the mainstay of their lives, crude or subtle, all are created within Him and within Him all are destroyed. The flow of relativities goes on unabated through the media of creation, preservation and destruction. Where there is no such flow of relativities the question of life and death does not arise. Unit beings in quest of a support for the fulfilment of their wishes and desires, run after one or the other of these relative truths. They move practically within the vast Cosmic circle without recognizing its fundamental nucleus. In their limitless pursuit they lose all their mental resources immediately after attaining them. They are unable to recognize Purus&#x301;ottama, the nucleus of Eternal Peace. Drunk with desire for material objects they do not even attempt to recognize Him. In the hypnotic spell of their pursuit they remain smugly oblivious of the fact that on a certain auspicious dawn in the past they emerged from the original source with which they still have an unknown, yet intimate relationship today; that they still have the same A&#x301;tman as the Supreme Creator. Nevertheless, His limitless mercy continues to be showered upon them incessantly and indiscriminately. Only when they run to Him, attracted by His divine grace, enchanted by His sweetness and benevolence, will they attain real deathlessness. Whatever the unit can or cannot imagine He holds in His Macrocosmic mind ( Bhu&#x301;ma&#x301;ma&#x301;nas).<!-- /block --></p>

It is not that jiiva, jagat and Iishvara alone comprise His bearing. Transcendentally He abides as the Aks&#x301;ara (intransmutable), and as the Niraks&#x301;ara (perfect placidity, perfect objectlessness).

The manifest bearing metamorphosed through His psychic action, is called His Ks&#x301;arabha&#x301;va, and the non-manifest bearing that remains as the witness of all psychic metamorphoses is His Aks&#x301;arabha&#x301;va. The word Aks&#x301;ara means that which does not undergo any metamorphosis. In these two bearings of Ks&#x301;ara and Aks&#x301;ara consistency and coordination between both the subjective and objective realities is being maintained. Brahmic or Cosmic manifestation is the accomplishment of that coordination by the Supreme Being. But where there is no manifestation, there is no question of subjectivity or objectivity &ndash; there He is Niraks&#x301;ara. Niraks&#x301;ara is identical with Avyakta (unmanifest). But where ks&#x301;ara and aks&#x301;ara exists in combination, there the aks&#x301;ara, in His witness-ship of ks&#x301;ara, can remain in both bearings &ndash; one bearing (ks&#x301;ara) in the unit mind (khan&#x301;d&#x301;a-ma&#x301;nas) and the other (Aks&#x301;ara) in the Cosmic Mind (Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;a&#x301; ma&#x301;nas). The central point or the nucleus of the Cosmic Mind, the Aks&#x301;ara, which is vaster than the endless sea, is known as Purus&#x301;ottama. Purus&#x301;ottama is the Supreme Master (Parama Bharta&#x301; &ndash; Bharta&#x301; means feeder) of this ks&#x301;ar&#x301;aks&#x301;aratmaka or changeable and unchangeable world-entity. All the manifest objects (vyakta) look unto Him for their expressions. The expressible potentials of the unexpressed entities (avyakta) also get opportunities for their manifestation through His generosity. It is with the cooperation of the vyakta and avyakta and ks&#x301;ara and aks&#x301;ara that this Brahma Cakra or Cosmic Cycle is comprised of manifest and unmanifest, perishable and unperishable entities. And since Brahma Cakra is dependent on the Supreme Purus&#x301;a, we may say He is the sustaining force of the unchangeable character of Aks&#x301;ara, the Supreme Witness of individual minds. When His Supreme Stance is modified Aks&#x301;ara undergoes a slight qualification, but Purus&#x301;ottama as the witness of the individual minds remains unaffected. When the pleasure-seeking unit mind blindly runs after unit-objects, Purus&#x301;a also gets smitten by the same mental attributes. He appears to be as if in bondage. But when the unit mind shuns its attraction for mundane objects and accepts that Supreme Purus&#x301;a as its only pabulum, it gets an opportunity to become one with the Cosmic Mind, giving up its finitude. With the attainment of the witness-ship of the Integral Mind it becomes one with the Purus&#x301;ottama. In the absence of bondage of enjoyership (Bhokta&#x301;bhava) the unit mind attains emancipation from all kinds of fetters.<!-- /block --></p>

The microcosm is the shadow entity of the Macrocosm and so it is assailed by bondages of limitation. It is deprived of the bliss of freedom, for power abides in the original, not in the shadow, and is thus compelled to emulate what the original entity does. So one is Iisha (Controller) and the other aniisha (controlled). Both of them imbibe a dynamic self-created force which is Prakrti. Prakrti creates the bearing as bhoktrtva (enjoyership) and bhogyatva (enjoyability) in the microcosms. It is through Her grace that the microcosm preserves its finite existence. But the Macrocosm, the Blissful Entity, is not subject to this Prakrti, to the waves of Her binding principles (Pra&#x301;krtabha&#x301;va). Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is the composite of these three: microcosm, Macrocosm and Binding Principle. And Purus&#x301;ottama who abides as the witness of all three is not Himself the doer, although this heteromorphic universe is evolved out of Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The ks&#x301;ara-aks&#x301;ara distinctions are present in the body of this vast Brahma. Ks&#x301;ara is evolved by the influence of Prakrti; Aks&#x301;ara (or Hara) is not transmuted by Prakrti but is conjoined with Prakrti the Knowing Entity. Apart from these two (Ks&#x301;ara and Hara) there is another Conscious Entity, Purus&#x301;ottama, who transmutes Himself within His own imagination, who continues His imaginative flow through Ks&#x301;ara and Aks&#x301;ara. (which is beyond the domain of Ks&#x301;ara). In His imaginative flow Ks&#x301;ara changes its names and forms at every moment but the Aks&#x301;arabha&#x301;va, although constantly assailed by Ks&#x301;ara, undergoes no change and remains as the witness of ks&#x301;ara. Purus&#x301;ottama, however, remains unassailed by the combined flow of Ks&#x301;ara and Aks&#x301;ara. When sa&#x301;dhakas, in quest of Him, channelize all their propensities towards Purus&#x301;ottama, they become united with Him and attain His greatness. At that time all the bondages of finitude are ripped apart and the charms and illusions of the world lose their power of allurement. They then attain liberation.<!-- /block --></p>

All bondages are snapped. When one loses all attachment for pettiness the bondages which create pettiness also perish. With the dissolution of the unit-mind, that is, with the attainment of mental expansion, suffering also gradually wanes &ndash; even the bondage of life and death is broken, for life and death belong to the finite, and so does the fear of them. The Great Brahma is beyond the scope of life and death and so the one who becomes completely identified with Him also remains unassailed by their ceaseless play.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The occult power that Sa&#x301;dhakas first attain on the spiritual path after understanding Him a little is not the ultimate goal. Still higher than that, surmounting even that barrier, when sa&#x301;dhakas become free of attachment to occult powers, when even the residue of their existential feeling disappears is the state of excellence when one becomes Him after knowing Him. This state is called savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi or the determinate trance of absorption. In such a state the ego becomes infinitely pervasive. But the next stage, which is the absolute bearing, where the existential I-feeling is compelled to lose itself in His extraordinary radiance, is called nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi (state of total absorption) or Kaevalya (oneness). The word kevala means &ldquo;only&rdquo;. So the state in which there remains only one sentiment, only one bearing, when the pure Conscious Entity is beyond knowledge, knowable, and knower, is called Kaevalya or absolute identity with the Divine Essence. Only when sa&#x301;dhakas are absorbed in the state of total absorption in Him (Brahmabha&#x301;va) and lose themselves in ecstasy, do they attain Kaevalyasthiti (ensconcement in Oneness).

Wise people say that Brahma is the composite of these three bearings. Claiming its own authority the microcosm wants to enjoy the quinquelemental objects (which it forgets are the Macro-psychic creation) with the help of its unit-mind. The Controlling Authority is the coordinating link between the subjectivity and the objectivity. Its inspiration the microcosmic to dissipate its finitude. With the strength derived from sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the microcosms accelerate towards the Supreme Controller. When they attain oneness with Him, their quinquelemental objects of enjoyment become non-existent. In the absence of the enjoyer-microcosm and the enjoyable, the Controlling Authority merges in the non-attributional Brahma. Human beings should always remember that their entire existential faculty depends on the grace of this Supreme Controlling Authority. It is due to His grace alone that they get the opportunity to continue spiritual practice. They could never know Parama&#x301;rtha without His divine grace.<!-- /block --></p>

The cosmic sound is emanating every moment from the actional waves of the Cosmic Mind and thus finds expression in every action. Just as friction between two flints to produce fire, similarly, the friction between your body (as one flint) and your intuitional practice (as the other flint) enables you to visualize that divine effulgence and become unified with Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; in the form of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. In other words this divine effulgence was lying latent in both the body and on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, and through the constant friction of the intuitional practice bursts into blazing brilliance. He lies hidden in you and in you every minute particle of this universe in both His individual and pervasive associations.

<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the unit or collective body, Consciousness is first metamorphosed into Mahattattva and thereafter is subject to a series of gradual transformations. If we call this process anuloma vya&#x301;vastha&#x301; (descending order of metamorphosis) the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; should be described as pratilom vya&#x301;vastha&#x301; (ascending order of evolution. Through the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; a sa&#x301;dhaka proceeds from crude to subtle, from psychic to spiritual, from the mental sphere to the metempirical sphere of Consciousness. Here a question arises: When unit beings reach increasingly subtle realms, will the quinquelemental world become non-existent? I would say in reply that this quinquelemental world is not the creation of the unit mind, but is the creation of Macropsychic conation and thus much more powerful than the unit mind. So as long as the unit mind exists the quinquelemental world will certainly exist. It will still exist when the unit mind becomes pinnacled or apexed and merges in the Cosmic Mind, not as a relative truth but as various imaginative flows. But when the unit mind reaches the ultimate stage and dissolves in Cosmic Consciousness, it ceases to exist for the Macrocosmic mind itself loses its identity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The emergence of the five fundamental factors occurred due to the movement of the Macrocosmic mind from subtle to crude. In the process of crudification the cosmic mind-stuff (citta) was metamorphosed into the ethereal factor, which comes within the scope of microcosmic perception. The ethereal factor further condensed and crudified and was metamorphosed into the aerial factor, coming within the more direct perception of the unit mind. The aerial factor, becoming even more condensed and crudified, was transformed into the luminous factor, the medium of perception of the visual organ. The luminous factor, in the process of further crudification, was converted into the liquid factor, becoming a drinkable substance for living beings. And the liquid factor, in the process of even further crudification, was metamorphosed into the solid factor. In this descending order of movement, the crude manifestations of the Cosmic Mind can be perceived by a greater number of sense organs (indriyas) than the subtle ones. So in the process of withdrawal (pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra) one should first withdraw one&#146;s mind from those crude physical objects which are perceptible to a greater number of sense organs, and then direct it towards subtler objects, thus completing the process of bhu&#x301;ta-shuddhi (an important part of spiritual cult). The initial struggle that a sa&#x301;dhaka has to wage, standing firmly on the ground of yama and niyama, is the struggle against the static pressure of the five fundamental factors. It is the struggle to perfect pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

The impurities are bound to be removed. In a similar manner, human beings will have to remove their mental impurities with the help of the heat of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, after first washing the human mind with the holy water of yama and niyama (the first two limbs of the eight-limbed as&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga yoga). An intelligent person never misutilises or under-utilises any object. The impurities are not an integral part of your original stance, but are distortions created by Prakrti. To realize that original stance they must be removed. However, they are embedded in the mind, they are inseparably associated with it, they are the propensities causing pleasure (positive mental propensity) and pain (negative mental propensity). If these propensities lie dormant or are unexpressed, the mind is unable to maintain its existence centring around its Mahattattva or existential I-feeling, and when they are over-active they lead microcosms far away from the original stance.

You cannot understand the Supreme Entity with the help of your psychic factor because He is beyond the scope of the mind. And with the sensory organs, which are even cruder than the mind, it is even more impossible to understand Him. He is beyond the grasp of everything. The gross indriyas are the cruder manifestation of the distorted mind. This distorted mind (even though it is inherently subtle) often fails to understand or realize that Entity because the unit citta, created as it is by the static principle, is only able to perceive finite entities. But by ideating on unlimited Brahma one can become established in the cosmotheistic bearing, causing the static bondages of citta to snap and the citta to lose its existence. The moment this happens, the existence of the unit ahamtattva and mahatattva, the controlling faculties of citta, also become unsubstantiated, resulting in the entire microcosmic bearing becoming free from the bondages of limitations. With the dissolution of the unit mind there remains only the pure self. To attain or not to attain this pure self at this stage is equal for a sa&#x301;dhaka because after the dissolution of the unit mind, the Consciousness reflected on the unit mental plate does not get any base in the temporal factor and returns to the original Macrocosmic bearing, becoming one with Purus&#x301;ottama. That is to say, whenever sa&#x301;dhakas realize the unit soul, they discover that the unit soul and Brahma are the same. Once the impurities are removed from the mind, the separate existence of these two entities is lost.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->As long as the feeling of individuality exists, unit beings see the diversities in the multi-dimensional imaginative flow of the Supreme Entity. Their vision thus impaired by non-integral knowledge, they run in pursuit of these diversities and make themselves their slaves. Wherever there is a unit mind there will be spatial, temporal and personal factors. The One who is beyond the periphery of these three factors is eternal. He is the Absolute Entity, others are only relative truths. This endeavour to liberate the unit consciousness from the unit mind, the base of all relativities, is what is termed sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And in this endeavour one must free the self from the domination of the eight fetters (bondage of lineage, vanity of culture, false sense of prestige, hatred, doubt, shame fear and backbiting) and the six enemies (anger, greed, lust, pride, envy, enchantment). The degree of bondage on the human mind is determined according to the intensity of the propensities, which are of various types: some pertaining to physicality, some to reactive momenta, some to education, etc. The unit mind can only guide and control its propensities when its actions are original. In all other cases the mind is guided by the propensities themselves (which may be good or bad). The propensity through which one expresses one&#146;s psychic power depends in most cases (except in the case of original actions) on the influence of physical constitution, education and the environment. Hence, to maintain purity of the psychic propensities, the purity of the body, the reactive momenta and the environment is crucial. It is not altogether impossible for someone to be transformed into a virtuous person if his or her neighbours are good people. We can describe the collective endeavour of ideal neighbours as the purification of the body, education and environment with the help of the collective mind. We are perfectly aware of the fact that if education, the environment, etc., are uncongenial it becomes impossible for even honest people to be virtuous.<!-- /block --></p>

Such people shed copious tears whenever they preach the all-pervasiveness of God, yet strive to maintain their &ldquo;purity&rdquo; by keeping the so-called untouchables at a safe distance. Such people only eat food after first offering it to the Lord, yet are very concerned about the caste of the cook.

Does Jagannath make any discrimination between different countries? Is there any difference for Him between the river Ganges and the Jordan? All lands are His own land; everything is within His mind, created with His own atoms and molecules, and resonated with His sacred ideation.

Others&#146; vanity crumbles to dust before His vastness. He is constantly engaged in the divine play of creation, converting His vast mind into minute fractions, smaller than atoms. So tiny are His unit manifestations that none but He can claim minuteness. So vast is He as the Supreme Arbitrator of the sport of creation that none but He can claim His vastness. As Purus&#x301;ottama He lies covert as the witness of the subtle realms of all subtle entities, as calm and tranquil as the towering forest trees. He lies hidden in all entities in His individual and pervasive association and fills everything with His cognition. While measuring His minuteness you may think that the molecule is the smallest particle but on further analysis you will discover that you are wrong, for atoms are even smaller. And when you probe even deeper you will discover smaller particles such as protons, electrons, neutrons, etc. In the process of further analysis your mind will lose its capacity to function; for you can never discover the smallest particle, you can never measure His minuteness.<!-- /block --></p>

Thus you will discover the unbroken thread of causation. While following this thread your mind will get fatigued and will be compelled to stop thinking further, because at the end of the thread there lies the Supreme Cause, the Cause of all causes, the Supreme Brahma.

Artha cannot guarantee permanent security or lasting happiness.

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today I would like to say something regarding Macrocosmic excellence and vastness, and microcosmic limitations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Whatever we can think of and whatever we cannot think of in this vast universe, whatever we know and whatever we do not know of this vast creation, are all within the Macrocosmic mind. For Him there is nothing external &ndash; everything is being created, maintained and dissolved within His Cosmic Mind. This internal psychic world of Brahma appears to be an external world to the finite entities. They have no capacity whatsoever to properly understand the true nature of this vast external universe. The jiivas (finite entities) with the help of their indriyas (sense organs) receive the subtle tanma&#x301;tras (inference) from this vast external world. According to those inferences, and on the basis of the transformation of their mind stuff (citta), the finite beings try to understand the world. But the true form of the universe remains embedded in the Cosmic Mind. The form of the world assimilated by the unit mind depends entirely on the power of assimilation of the inferences and the proper functioning of the indriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The unit mind can be compared to a water bubble in the vast ocean of the Cosmic Mind. Although these microcosmic imaginations bear some resemblance to those of the original entity, they are not actually original or fundamental emanations. Rather, they are the inferential and nerve-carried reflections or shadows of the Macrocosmic imagination. What we understand by Miccrocosmic mind is only a transformed state of Macrocosmic Consciousness due to the influence of Prakrti. That&#146;s why Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, although He pervades the infinite time, space and individualities, is manifesting the troughs and crests of His psychic wave in and through the three relative factors. This is the reason why none of His manifestations are absolute truth: neither did they exist in the past, nor will they exist in the future. Even a statement regarding the present is not an undisputed axiom. So when properly analysed this expressed universe is nothing but a collection of temporary entities which are undergoing constant metamorphosis according to the sweet will of Prakrti. It would be more precise to call those temporary entities &ldquo;shadowy objects&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;original objects&rdquo; due to their impermanence and total dependence on the Macropsychic imagination. If the mundane objects are mere shadows created by the Supreme Objective Principle, then for the unit minds, this world, perceived as it is through the inferences, is the shadow of the shadows.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the practical world for the substantiation of one&#146;s shadowy existence other shadows cannot be ignored. Nothing of this world should be ignored, because even though everything is a shadow, it is nevertheless a shadow of Brahma (that is a spatial, temporal, or individual manifestation of His cosmic bearing) and not an inconsequential shadow of the relative world. Hence, to ignore this manifested world is out of the question. While trying to ascertain the proper relationship between the subject and the object, we conclude philosophically that we cannot ignore this manifested world. However, it is a fact that not only is the mind constantly preoccupied with objects which are merely shadows of shadows, but is proud of the apparent control it has over those shadows. If one tries to assess the real worth of the microcosmic existence in this world it comes to nothing more than zero!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Whatever the endeavour of the microcosmic mind it can never go beyond the periphery of the Macrocosmic mind. If the unit mind does try to expand its power of imagination beyond the periphery of the Macrocosmic mind it will reach the state of non-existence. There is nothing beyond or outside the Cosmic Mind. The hopes and aspirations, the pains and sorrows, the active endeavour and the inertness of the unit mind are all within the Macropsychic arena, creating temporary ripples within the vast ocean of the Macrocosmic mind. The sum total of the microcosmic restlessness does nothing more than to create a few ripples on the surface of the vast cosmic ocean. When the unit mind ideates on the Cosmic Mind and converts its finite objects of enjoyment (preya) into cosmic benevolence (shreya), then that finite unit being, who was a mere water bubble up till then, expands beyond its limited form and attains the identity of the ocean. That finite entity which initially thought of self-glorification ultimately forgets itself and becomes totally absorbed in the thought of the Cosmic Entity. It no longer proclaims its own greatness, but heralds the excellence of the Supreme Macrocosmic Entity. The unit beings, due to ignorance, look upon these numerous animate and inanimate entities as finite expressions of that Infinite Entity. Later, in the process of cultivation of knowledge and action, they begin to understand that they are the multifarious expressions of that Infinite Entity. Still later when they reach the pinnacle of devotion they see the Supreme Entity is everything. At that moment all feelings of discrimination evaporate, all concerns about real and unreal, propriety of action and impropriety of action, vanish completely from the mind. There remains only the singular urge to serve the Lord with utmost devotion. When the devotee surrenders his or her entire existential feeling at the altar of the Almighty, there remains no further differences, only an unbroken, sweet blissful ocean in which the Supreme Entity manifests Himself endlessly in His innumerable waves. The sweet relation between the devotee and the Lord provides an unending impetus to the ocean of joy. The Supreme Lord remains absorbed in His divine play with innumerable divine manifestations. What is playful for Him is meaningful for the unit entity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The Divine Entity has an infinite number of heads, an uncountable number of heads.&rdquo; Each entity which expresses intellectuality is one of His heads. No single head can be described as &ldquo;His head&rdquo; because His head is the totality of all heads. Similarly, the Supreme Entity has innumerable eyes which assist Him in seeing every entity of the universe in innumerable ways from innumerable angles of vision. You cannot do anything unknown to Him. Likewise with the help of His innumerable mental feet He moves throughout the entire moving universe. The instrument through which movement is performed is called caran&#x301;a (foot). He is the caran&#x301;a of the limitless objects of this universe. Of course, these countless heads, eyes and feet of His have no physical existence. When you want to see something in your mind you use your mental eyes. Brahma, with His mental eyes, is watching. His mental indriyas continuing the creation, preservation and destruction of this universe. Just as you can use your mental head to cook food and your mental tongue to enjoy its taste, in the same way Brahma is enjoying His creation internally &ndash; there is nothing outside or beyond Him. Most of His mental creations are external to you, but all the created objects, including you, are internal to Him. When you perform an action it is either psycho-physical or psychic, but in the case of the Supreme Entity every action is psychic. This quinquelemental world, however vast it may appear to you, originated from Macrocosmic mind-stuff (citta) surrounded by the static portion of His mind, and that&#146;s why it is circumscribed by limitations. This extremely vast Cosmic citta is not Brahma in His entirety; He is vaster than that. This great universe lies in a remote corner of His endless mind. So the rs&#x301;i says that Brahma exists within and surrounding the entire universe. As the Macrocosmic Ahamtattva (Cosmic doer-I) and Buddhitattva (Cosmic existential I) are not bound by the demarcating lines of the static principle, they are infinite; and His witnessing faculty which is inseparably associated with this infinite Macrocosmic mind is also infinite. But His Knowing Faculty is also not His total entity. The rs&#x301;i has expressed unequivocally that He is established in the Supreme Blissful Stance beyond the domain of the witnessing faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Some confusion arises regarding the meaning of the word dasha&#x301;ungulam&#x301; used in the above shloka &ndash; Some scholars have given a rather peculiar interpretation that Brahma resides at a place ten fingers above His universe. The actual significance of the term is best illustrated in the yogic cult. The non-attributional supreme rank of Parama Purus&#x301;a is located at the pineal plexus (sahasra&#x301;ra cakra), ten fingers above the pituitary plexus (lunar plexus or ajin&#x32D;a cakra, the location of mind as well as kut&#x301;astha caetanya). By trying to describe the location of the Cosmic Consciousness in relation to human physiology, the rs&#x301;i wants to convey that the cosmic excellence does not end in the mind. Of course, the mind is a powerful controlling entity &ndash; being the controller of the five fundamental factors of the human body it is the controller of the five lowest cakras &ndash; yet it is only located in a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra. The seat of Cosmic Consciousness is located ten fingers above the seat of mind at the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra. During sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; when the serpentine power (kundalini) pierces the pituitary plexus one attains savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi. Still higher, at sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii shakti becomes one with Parama Shiva, and one attains the non-attributional stance (kaevalya sama&#x301;dhi).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Suppose you are imagining Bhagalpur railway station within your mental arena. Not only can you see the travellers rushing through the station, you can also see their individual minds. The Macrocosmic mind (Sagun&#x301;a Brahma) knows whatever is happening in the entire universe for His cosmic imagination flows everywhere. He knows and understands every thought-wave, every idea of the innermost recesses of the unit minds in the universe. Apart from being the witness to all events He is also the witness to every microcosmic thought-wave, whether good or bad. He is also aware of every incident of the past, present and future. Time is a relative factor dependent on space and individuality. These relativities of space, time and individuality are created out of His Cosmic Mind, thanks to His grace, and will continue to be created in the future. As He is not limited by the demarcation lines of the time factor He is the witness of all ages. An ordinary person may not be able to detect the hypocrisy of a sinner who pretends to be a decent man, but the Supreme Entity is well aware of that hypocrisy. It is a futile attempt by the hypocrite to throw dust into the eyes of that Infinite Entity, the Witness of all.<!-- /block --></p>

Even the meanest of the mean, the nastiest of the nasty, and the most infernal insects are not deprived of His grace, are not beyond His controlling touch. Conversely, even the greatest of the great, the overlord of the sea-girt earth, and the most venerable and distinguished people are powerless before Him, behumbled by His awesome personality.

<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Whenever something is imagined the sensory and motor organs become activated by its inferential vibrations. In dynamic thought processes there is mental agitation: when you imagine accepting something, your mental hands start working; when you imagine seeing or hearing something your mental eyes and ears start functioning. Perhaps you know that after deep introspection the subtle mind takes over from the crude mind as the controlling entity of the physical body and indriyas. In sorrowful dreams people burst out crying, in happy dreams they laugh. The reason is the same in both cases: due to the temporary cessation of the functioning of the crude mind, the dreamers &ldquo;see&rdquo; the dreams with their mental eyes and take them to be the reality, and their minds get completely overpowered as a result. Just as in deep introspection or sleep people laugh, cry, sit, stand, sleep, eat and drink, etc. with the help of their mental indriyas, similarly Brahma, the author of this vast cosmic imagination moves everywhere within the universe, His vast Macropsychic arena, with His mental feet. He catches all the objects of this universe with His all-pervasive mental hands. He is the intellect, the intuition and the witnessing faculty of the innumerable created objects and hence we can say that He has His all-pervasive mental heads. Similarly, as the witness of all the macropsychic entities, He has innumerable mental eyes; and to hear their words, spoken or secret, and every loud or soft sound, He has His all-pervasive ears. He exists surrounding all objects with His own identity. You can keep nothing secret or private from Him - He knows more about you than you know about yourself. Behind all His pervasive faculties of knowing, understanding and hearing lies His Macropsychic stance. Hence, no temporal, spatial or personal factor, circumscribed by limiting bondages, can be accepted as Purnabrahma (Brahma in His entirety). The great mystic Ramaprasad has said,<!-- /block --></p>

For ideation on Brahma there is no need to spend even a cent. If the worship of Brahma was a very expensive affair then none but a handful of billionaires would have been able to do it. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the birthright of all people just like light, air, and water; the Infinite Entity is the common patrimony of all, not the private property of any particular individual.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In each indriya a particular principle is dominant, sometimes the sentient, sometimes the mutative, sometimes the static. During the Bhagalpur Dharma Maha Cakra I said that a merit or demerit in a particular indriya is determined by its capacity to assimilate inferences. Of all the, inferences, sound and touch are very subtle and so their receptors, the ears and the skin, are dominated by the sentient principle. The smell and taste tanma&#x301;tras are very crude and hence their receptors, the tongue and the nose, are dominated by the static principle. The remaining form tanma&#x301;tra, which is neither crude nor subtle, has the eyes as its receptor and is dominated by the mutative principle. Regarding the motor organs, the vocal cords and the hands are dominated by the sentient principle, the legs by the mutative principle, and the anus and genital organs by the static principle. To perform crude physical actions, or to assimilate the inferences of crude objects the importance of the indriyas is undeniable. As the Supreme Entity doesn&#146;t require to be associated with any external physical object, He does not require any sensory or motor organs. To create or destroy an image within His Macropsychic arena He uses His mental indriyas which have the qualities He requires to guide the whole universe with His mental power. Even though He doesn&#146;t have a single physical indriya, He possesses the qualities of all the indriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->He is the controller of those entities who are endowed with individual feeling or awareness and those which are not. Each land every object of this universe is floating on the crests and troughs of His psychic waves: the original wave emanates from Him only. He is the source as well as the controller of all waves. He provides impetus to all entities of His mental creation and so He is Iisha or Controller. Here a question may arise: Being the source of momentum for the created entities, why do some entities behave like gods, while others act like demons? Can He be accused of partiality? No, that is impossible. When everything is His mental creation, why should He be accused of partiality. Jiiva&#x301;tma or unit consciousness is His reflection and the unit mind is the reflecting plate or mirror. The clearer the mirror, the clearer its reflection of the Original Entity. If the mirror is dirty it will not be able to reflect the brilliance of the Original Entity, but for that He should not be blamed. His waves emanate from Him as usual but due to the defect in the mirror the vibrationtion cannot be properly reflected. So if the unit metal mirror cannot properly receive the impetus from Him, Parama&#x301;tma should not be accused of partiality. He is just like a magnet which attracts all pieces of iron towards it except the rusty ones. Some people respond to His call, some do not. That&#146;s why I say, &ldquo;O sa&#x301;dhakas make your [[minds]] free from impurities. Follow the path of cosmic ideation. You need not conduct any ritualistic worship or observe meaningless vows, or undertake hazardous pilgrimages. Just try sincerely to remove the dirt from your mind. When you feel the attraction of the Supreme Entity in every atom and molecule of your existence, you will realize that He is showering His grace equally on all&rdquo;.

Those determined to receive His momentum feel attracted towards Him, and, advancing along the path of effulgence, finally merge their existential-I feeling in the ocean of His cosmic effulgence. Those who realize Him in the form of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra&#x301;, advance along the path of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra&#x301; and finally become ensconced in Purus&#x301;ottama, the source of on&#x32D;m&#x301;kara, the nucleus of all emanations. The unit entities in which His divine expression are fully manifest are said to have attained the height of fulfilment physically, psychically and spiritually. They realize in the core of their hearts that the entire human life is a &ldquo;sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;&rdquo;. Each and every mundane action of theirs, such as eating, sleeping, dressing and even breathing, are an integral part of that &ldquo;sadhana&#x301;&rdquo;. But those who have not understood the Supreme Entity and His creation in this light will say, &ldquo;Well I don&#146;t steal, and I don&#146;t tell lies, so why should I do Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.&rdquo; They think that moralism alone is the highest goal in this world &ndash; but remember, moralism is not the goal &ndash; it is the starting point. If the Supreme Controller is disowned, the so-called morality of the moralist can be lost at any moment, and does get lost. Such people end up pretending to be moralists externally but internally become immoralists. This is the height of hypocrisy in the society. The different spheres of social life, such as education, industry and trade, commerce and politics are overcrowded with this class of human brutes, because of a lack of dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Those who are compelled to become moralists under social pressure, or those who put on a show of being moralists from the rostrum or pulpit, or in short stories, novels and poetry, are actually misguided fools, however intelligent they may think themselves to be. Inflated with the vanity of pedantry they lose all their common sense and behave like lunatics. And the worst thing about them is that to fulfill their petty narrow interests they hoodwink the innocent, simple, unwary, gullible masses. Internally they wish to become ministers to serve their selfish interests, outwardly they say they want to serve the society in the interest of the common people, Their one intention is to fill their pockets with money, but they publicly pronounce that they want to follow the gospels of Dharma. Oh human beings, beware of these impostors. Try to apply your power of discrimination to know who are your friends and who are your foes. You should never allow yourselves to fall victim to these political and religious traders. Remember that every individual has immense potentialities. Tap those potentialities and advance resolutely along the spiritual path. If you cannot stand erect on the solid ground on the strength of your spiritual power, no one can support you with a prop. You need not employ a paid agent to help you express your innate potentialities. Oh human beings, you alone are the proper judges of your mind.

The A&#x301;tman or unit consciousness does not lie hidden in humans and animals alone; it also lies within the trees and plants because they too have minds, they too have existential awareness.

In every action the presence of three factors is indispensable: the doer, the deed, and the instrument of deed. Parama Purus&#x301;a is immutable (Ajara) because the deed and its instrument originate from His, the doer&#146;s psychic body. As time space and individuality do not exist externally to Him, the vibrations in the state of existence or functioning remain unsubstantiated.

<a name="3..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->Do you know the nature of the relationship between jiiva&#x301;tma and Parama&#x301;tma? It is as if two friendly birds with beautiful plumes are sitting on the same branch of a tree. One is the Original Entity, Parama&#x301;tma, and the other is jiiva&#x301;tma, the reflection of Parama&#x301;tma on the unit mental plate. Whenever the unit entities do something auspicious with the help of the mind, the jiiva&#x301;tma, due to its contact with the mind, experiences its positive effect. So the rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;One bird (jiiva&#x301;tma) enjoys the sweet fruits of the tree while the other bird witnesses its enjoyment&rdquo;. Parama&#x301;tma, being the Original Entity, is not affected by the activity of the unit mind. He remains as the Witnessing Entity of all actions.<!-- /block --></p>

Due to the influence of reactive momenta the jiiva&#x301;tma has to undergo suffering, bent double under the tremendous weight of afflictions. It appears to be inseparably associated with the unit being&#146;s sense of individual identity. Although, the jiiva&#x301;tman is not the original author of actions &ndash; it is just the witness &ndash; it appears to be caught up in the cycle of action and reaction. Human beings call some jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; maha&#x301;tma (high soul), some punyatma&#x301; (pious soul) and some papa&#x301;tma&#x301; (wicked soul), but in fact it contains neither sin nor virtue, neither good propensity nor bad. It is forced to assume these epithets because of its supposed association with the psychic propensities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->But whatever might be the nature of one&#146;s jiiva&#x301;tma, the grace of Parama&#x301;tma is bestowed equally on all. He provides inspiration and momentum to all His created entities equally. That&#146;s why the rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;When the jiiva&#x301;tma comes to know the Supreme Truth through the guidance of the Sadguru and the grace of Parama&#x301;tman, the Original Entity, it attains the proper knowledge about its own self, then gets relieved of its microcosmic bearing&rdquo;. When the unit mind pursuing the path of intuitional science realizes the greatness of the Macrocosmic Mind it merges itself into the Macrocosmic Stance, ripping apart the bondages of virtue and vice, hope and despair. At that stage no grief, no distortion, can affect or contaminate it. When the microcosm totally surrenders itself to the Macrocosmic excellence the jiiva&#x301;tma also becomes free from microcosmic bondages and its separate individuality gets merged into the Macrocosmic vastness.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The excellence and subtlety of expansion are inseparable. Brahma is the most expansive entity, the all-pervading existence. His subtlety is unfathomable. Due to subtlety His identity cannot be perceived by the senses. It is not accessible to the extroversial mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The cruder the object, the less its capacity of expansion and vice versa. Thus the degree of expansion and subtlety of liquid is greater than that of solid. The aerial factor is even subtler than liquid. The ethereal factor is the most expansive and subtlest of all the five fundamental factors. That&#146;s why it is not perceptible to the indriyas. It is not possible to determine its size or fathom its subtlety, nor to make any measuring rod for that purpose. This ethereal factor, although one of the five fundamental factors, is almost beyond the scope of human perception (it requires a highly developed human intellect and continuous scientific pursuit for its perception) so how can a common person grasp something which is even more subtle than that?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I have said earlier that the subtler an object the less the capacity of the indriyas to perceive it. As the greatness of expansion depends upon the degree of subtlety of an object, the more expansive an object the more difficult it becomes for the indriyas to perceive it. To grasp such an object requires constant endeavour and a refined intellect. That&#146;s why human beings try to understand subtler objects with the help of their minds. What is beyond the perception of the crude physical organs, the eyes or the ears, can often be perceived with the help of the internal ears or internal eyes, or the introversial mind. Wherever the extroversial mind might work in the internal mind or in the external world, it cannot go beyond the periphery of the ethereal factor and is thereafter forced to return to its own abode.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Human beings are constantly coming in contact with an entity beyond the periphery of the five fundamental factors. That entity is the human mind. Although the mind cannot be perceived by the indriyas, with a little introversion its existence is substantiated without doubt in individual life. However hard a so-called pandit (scholar) may try to convince you through powerful logic that you have no mind, you will not accept it because mind is a natural entity for you. You do not require any logic from any outsider to understand your own mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There is another entity which is even subtler than the mind &ndash; the Cognitive Faculty (Purus&#x301;atattva or Bhahmatattva). Being subtler than the mind, it is beyond the capacity of the mind to grasp it. But in the process of sadhana, when the mind becomes so subtle and expanded that it loses its individual existence, the Supreme Cognitive Factor can be recognized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The rs&#x301;i says,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Rco aks&#x301;are parame vyoman yasmin deva&#x301; adhi vishve nis&#x301;eduh<br>Yastanna veda kimrca&#x301; karis&#x301;yati ya ittadvidusta ime sama&#x301;sate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->While discussing a subtle entity one is continuously reminded of the ethereal factor, the subtlest factor of this perceivable world. That is why people loosely describe Brahma as being &ldquo;like ether&rdquo; or &ldquo;beyond ether&rdquo;. This Supreme Entity who is as subtle as ether (in fact, He is much much subtler than that) is called Aks&#x301;ara because He is not transmuted from the Original Stance. Conversely, the entity or entities which have been transmuted and are undergoing various transmutations are called ks&#x301;ara. Only the Supreme Entity, Parama Puras&#x301;a, is A&#x301;ks&#x301;ra. The various emanations of the Supreme Entity which are subject to constant change are known as devatas (mythological gods or dieties). These devatas or divine emanations lie embedded in the cosmic body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Brahma is the source of infinite energy. Whatever has been created, or is being created, or will be created is a vibrational flow emanating from Him. The seed of all emanations lies embedded in Him. The controlling faculties of the vibrational flows are called devatas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->These devata&#x301;s, or divine emanations, have no absolute or separate identity. The manifestation of this relative universe is caused by their collective expression. The sound created by the vibrational expression of each devata&#x301;, in which its potentiality of expression lies, is called its acoustic root, and the totality of these acoustic roots is called on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra or pran&#x301;ava. Hence on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is the seed of the cosmos.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Those who worship the various deities in pursuit of artha (mundane wealth) and not Parama&#x301;rtha (Supreme wealth) do so because those deities are the controllers of the transient wealth of the universe. Those who worship these deities to attain Brahma will be sadly disappointed for it is impossible to attain the infinite through the worship of the finite. The one who declares that a particular deity is Brahma may have an element of devotion, but must be totally devoid of rationality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Dyotate kriid&#x301;ate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divih<br>Tasma&#x301;ddeva iti proktah stuyate sarvadevataeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So devata&#x301; is a particular vibrational flow whereas Brahma is the ocean of universal flows, the ocean of divine nectar. It is totally unnecessary for a spiritual aspirant to worship any particular deity. The rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;For one who has not realized Brahma, ritualistic worship, the study of the scriptures, religious pilgrimages, charitable activities or scriptural recitation are all meaningless&rdquo;. Such ritualistic observances devoid of cosmic ideation do not deserve to be called anything less than ostentatious public displays, or pretentious demonstrations of intellectual vanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Only that person who remains free from all superstitions and moves towards the Supreme Entity with genuine devotion, and one-pointed ideation on Him, and whose inner soul runs unhindered towards the cosmic soul, attains Him, attains everything in life, and attaining Him gets merged in Him. Merging in the ocean of nectar, one also becomes nectar. Hence the Vedas declare, &ldquo;Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati&rdquo; (one who knows Brahma becomes Brahma).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->This imperishable Parama Brahma is the paramount topic of the Vedas. Many people think that the Vedas only teach the worship of Brahma, but it discusses so many other subjects such as chanda (rhythm), mantra (holy chants), vyakaran&#x301;a (grammar), and a host of other rules and regulations, dos and don&#146;ts. Should we study all the Veda&#146;s teachings? In reply one can only say that one may accept the essence of something without accepting its non-essential aspects. If someone says &ldquo;I eat wood apple&rdquo; it doesn&#146;t mean that he eats its skin, seeds or gum. Similarly to eat a mango does not mean to devour its skin and stone but to eat the essential part discarding the rest. So to accept a scripture means to accept the essence which stands the test of rationality, and to discard the rest. Rational people should never declare that the teachings of the scriptures should be followed blindly. The rs&#x301;i says,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[Do not make decisions on the basis of scriptural study. For if your analysis of the scriptures is irrational it may undermine dharma.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The Vedas expound the science of metre, the rules of religious sacrifices and various other observances, describe vows and paraphernalia, and make certain pronouncements about the present, past, and future. They also expound the science of intuitional practice. An intelligent person should reject the inconsequential portion of the Vedas and only accept the important part that is the description of intuitional science (Brahma-vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->According to the Vedas the Supreme Entity (Parama Brahma) is giving expression to this created universe with the help of His immanent principle, His divine Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Shiva, latent in the microcosm, is creating a world of imagination in collaboration with Prakrti. Similarly, the Supreme Entity, in collaboration with His immanent power, continues the cosmic flow of creation, the Macrocosmic conation, from which all microcosmic entities emerge. As microcosms are born out of the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; they are subject to Her spell as long they remain in the microcosmic stance. But the Supreme Entity, the Supreme Witness, is beyond the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; for He is the Lord of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Had He been under Her influence, the secret of salvation from Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; would have eluded Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; who continues this cosmic imagination for the exhaustion of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma&#146;s sams&#x301;karas is subservient to the Supreme Cognitive Faculty of Parama Purus&#x301;a because He is ensconced in the highest state of awareness. The Cosmic Imagination starts as a reactive expression from that supreme state.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;ntu prakrtim&#x301; vidya&#x301;nma&#x301;yinantu maheshvaram<br>Casya&#x301;vayavabhu&#x301;taestu vya&#x301;ptam&#x301; sarvamidam&#x301; jagat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Prakrti are almost synonymous. The etymological meaning of Prakrti is the &ldquo;entity who is creating diversities in the infinite cosmic body&rdquo;. Usually, when the sentient, mutative, and static principles remain in a state of balance, it is called Prakrti, and when balance is lost, due to the dominance of the sentient principle, it is called, Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. But when the balance is lost due to the predominance of the static principle it is called Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. So the rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;In reality Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Prakrti are almost the same. The entity who remains beyond their influence is the Supreme Controller.&rdquo; Both the concept of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are very subtle, too subtle for you to understand with the indriyas. But when (as a result of the combined association of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti) their existence comes down to the psychic level due to the crudifying influence of Prakrti, then your intellect, your subtle power of perception, can perceive their existence. The subtler the object, the less capacity the indriyas have of perceiving it. A subtle mind can only fathom a subtle object like the mind, but nothing subtler.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The crudest manifestation of the Cosmic Mind is the quinquelemental universe. Hence the rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;This vast quinquelemental universe is His physical body&rdquo;. His subtle and causal body and His stance as Purus&#x301;ottama are beyond the scope of perception of the indriyas. Microcosms can never fathom the extreme subtlety of these states of cosmic existence. To bring the vast cosmic body within the scope of perception is beyond the microcosmic capacity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;jagat&rdquo; is derived as gam (root verb) + kvip (suffix) and means &ldquo; a moving entity.&rdquo; Due to the extroversive (Sain&#x32D;cara) and introversive (Pratisain&#x32D;cara) flows of cosmic imagination everything of this universe is in a state of continuous flux. Most of the manifested universe cannot come within the scope of perception of the sense organs and the mind of microcosms. Some part of it can only be realized by the subtler layers of mind and intellect, while the subtlest portion can only be assimilated through deeply universalistic spiritual immersion. Materialistic philosophy does not want to transcend the scope of the crude perceiving mind, and there is no harm if it doesn&#146;t! The nature of an object depends upon the mental outlook of the subject. It is foolish to try to deny the existence of something which is beyond the scope of perception through vain intellectual debate. It is certainly not wise to say that something does not exist simply because it is beyond one&#146;s power of comprehension. If a blind man says that the world is colourless, will it lose its colour? A wise man can only say, &ldquo;I do not understand anything beyond this.&rdquo; So it can safely be declared that a materialistic philosophy is no philosophy because the totality of the universe is not within the scope of its purview.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->He is the Noumenal Cause of the universe. He shines in the various expressions of the fundamental factors. He is the flower, He is the honey, He is the bee. It is only due to the varying degree of influence of the static principle that He manifests Himself in these three different ways. With the help of Prakrti His Macrocosmic bearing is controlling the various manifestation of His own Self. He is playing with Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Whatever may be the apparent differences between one object and another, if one proceeds along the path of synthesis one will ultimately arrive at the Supreme One. Whether you call this entity small or vast, its depths are unfathomable. Countless unit expressions of finitude lie embedded in the singular identity of the ocean. The diverse expressions of this changing universe are embedded in the singular body of the universe and the diverse expressions of the celestial world are embedded in the infinite void. The same vast space you will see both outside and inside your citta. If you analyse the various symbols of the myriad of diversities you will discover that they are all merging in the Supreme Singularity. This is true in the case of the individual and the collectivity. He is the subject, the object and the connecting link &ndash; all in one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->What is the vast play of cosmic imagination? Does it originate from the noumenal causal factor &ndash; the collective creation of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti? Is it not a fact that the causal factor, due to the varying degree of influence of the static principles, is manifesting itself in countless ways? In reality, this causal factor is the Causal Mind of the Supreme Entity, and the countless finite emanations are the minutest expressions of His Citta. All the quinquelemental objects perceived in the universe today had their origin in a previous subtler stage. If we trace these subtler stages back to their original source will finally arrive at the Supreme Causal Factor. Prakrti (which is inconspicuous in Nirgun&#x301; Brahma) lies dormant as a causal factor in the initial stage of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. One who is asleep cannot said to be non-existent. That which is unmanifest is of course unexpressed, but the principle which causes its manifestation cannot be said to be non-existent. It does exist but in a subdued form &ndash; it&#146;s action expression is unsubstantiated, and is this incapable of giving a subjective bearing to Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Suppose a distinguished poet is sleeping. While sleeping is he devoid of poetic genius? No, but at that time the poetic talent remains dormant in a causal stage in his individual mind &ndash; his poetry and his faculty to compose are unexpressed. Since He is not expressing himself as a poet he does not deserve to be called a poet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a, under the influence of Prakrti, manifests the glory of His poetic expression along the path of Sain&#x32D;cara, and finally, in the introversial flow of Pratisain&#x32D;cara, merges Himself in His original stance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The creation of the universe has been continuing to originate from the Cosmic Causal Factor. The first perceptible form that the citta has assumed in the cosmic extroversial flow is the ethereal body. At this stage He doesn&#146;t have any physical body but exists in a virtual abstract form. Yet human beings with the help of the subtler sensory organ (organ of hearing), and by applying certain scientific methods, can assimilate the sound tanma&#x301;tra from the subtler ethereal body to some extent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Thereafter the aerial body is created with the application of a cruder force of Prakrti. The aerial body&#146;s sound tanma&#x301;tra can also be heard by the ears. The ethereal body, while being constantly formed out of His unmanifested cosmic potentialities is also being transmuted into the aerial body, without losing its inseparable association with the Witnessing Faculty. The aerial body is thus a cruder manifestation of His mind. In the further extroversive flow of Macropsychic manifestation, both within and without, there is a ceaseless clash of vital force causing subtlety to become increasingly crude. The intermolecular space decreases giving a concrete form to the Cosmic Mind in its metamorphosed form. The internal and external clashes increase proportionally. In the ethereal factor there is no difference between the internal and external forces, but in the case of the aerial factor there is greater internal clash. Although the molecules in the aerial factor are scattered far from each other there is something external to it &ndash; some external pressure &ndash; which it develops the capacity to resist.<!-- /block --></p>

It derives its luminosity from the intense clash of forces. It has an even greater capacity to resist the external factor. We can see the luminous factor in the various celestial bodies of the vast space which, although in most cases are not yet converted into solid or liquid, have assumed a particular shape. In the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara these luminous entities gradually get crudified into the liquid factor. Their intermolecular space further decreases causing greater internal conflict.

When it is transformed into the aerial factor it acquires the capacity to carry a greater variety of tanmatras (but not a greater quantity of tanmatras). Thus the aerial factor can carry two tanmatras, sound and touch. However, the sound tanmatra it carries is not as subtle as the sound tanmatra carried by the ethereal body. When the same aerial factor is converted into the luminous factor its total capacity for carrying tanmatras remains unaltered, but it acquires the capacity of radiating light and can thus carry the form tanmatra (as well as the sound and touch tanmatras). The sound tanmatra it carries is not as subtle as the aerial factor&#146;s sound tanmatra. As the process of crudification continues there is more internal clash (and less external clash) resulting in the increase of the capacity to carry an even greater number of tanmatras.<!-- /block --></p>

Under such circumstances the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a will have to act under its own initiative otherwise it will be difficult to maintain the balance between the two opposing forces. To help the individual structure to maintain a balance between the exterial and interial forces the Cosmic Mind creates a sub-centre or individual mind within that structure. When the life force, due to the complexity of the structure, takes the unit mind as the apparent source of its actual flow, that is called life or vital energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h). Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h is the collection of ten vayus. (That&#146;s why in Sam&#x301;skrta it is always used in the plural number. In modern Indian languages born out of Sam&#x301;skrta we use the word pra&#x301;n&#x301;a in the sense of pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h).

That is, they can regress.]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Those who move forward properly along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara or accelerate their speed through the process of sadhana are true human beings. The further the microcosmic body moves along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara the greater its structural complexity. To cope with this complexity the microcosm, out of its physical structure, evolves a more developed and capable psychic body. That&#146;s why we notice that the greater the complexity of the physical structure, the greater the protoplasmic and glandular complexities and the greater its psychic expansion. With the increasing complexity of the body and mind the human hopes and aspirations, pains and pleasures, sorrows and afflictions also increase. The boss running an office of a huge corporation requires far more psychic power than the boss running the office of a small company, for he has to shoulder greater responsibilities and run greater risks. A person who lacks the requisite psychic capability for his job is demoted. Similarly, if a human being is preoccupied with crude thoughts he will have to be reborn in a crude body for he is not utilizing his full potential. Human beings, the crown of creation, due to their heavy responsibilities, have more qualities than other creatures. The reflection of Consciousness becomes more distinct on a mental plate of a person whose mind is highly expanded. Such a mind overflows with bliss when it receives cosmic inspiration, and with the help of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; develops a greater power to realize the Supreme Entity. The day one gets the Supreme attainment marks the end of the Pratisain&#x32D;cara phase of the cosmic cycle for that particular microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->But not all physical entities are converted into Consciousness. Where the vital energy and mind are not developed the entity will have to follow the path of stagnation and can only be established in Consciousness after arousing the vital energy and mind. If it fails to do that, its physical structure will be controlled by the Cosmic Will. Undeveloped physical structures do not try to direct their self will against the natural forces, but human beings, due to the greater complexities of their physical structure, and the greater development of the energy and the mind, challenge the natural forces and sometimes, with the help of their developed vital energy and psychic power, can overpower them in both individual and collective spheres. If matter guided by energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;a) can be called Union Territories (such as Goa and Pondicherry) then the living sub-human creatures together with their vital energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;ah) can be called Indirectly Centrally Administered Areas whose budget is passed by the government; and the living beings endowed with more developed minds and lives can be compared to A-class States (such as India). Normally Direct Union Territories are considered part of the federal state and their civil servants are considered as the employees of that central government. However, under certain circumstances, these employees are accorded different rights and responsibilities. This is the same in the cosmic world too: inanimate matter, sub-human creatures, and human beings have their respective rights and responsibilities. The present state of Bihar is a part of India. The government of Bihar is a part of the Indian government, yet the praise and criticism for or against the government of Bihar does not directly concern the government of India. The government of Bihar will have to plan according to its own state exchequer not the central government&#146;s.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->The same thing applies to human beings with developed minds. When life evolves from matter the Macrocosmic Mind helps in the evolution of the human mind. But when that composite structure increases in complexity in the phase of Pratisain&#x32D;cara, guided by cosmic imagination, its mental capacity increases and proportionately it is accorded greater rights and responsibilities. When the unit mind takes responsibility for the authorship of action it must also take responsibility for the consequent praise or criticism. If the government of Bihar finds itself helpless in certain circumstances it can surrender it&#146;s entire burden to the central government. Similarly, the unit mind can relinquish its authorship and surrendering all its rights and responsibilities to the Supreme Entity, can become one with that Entity by merging the unit mind in the Supreme Mind. But when inanimate matter does not follow the path of living beings, [[it]] follows the path of stagnation. When unicellular beings moving along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara come in contact with other living beings they evolve into multicellular creatures. Through the same process these multicellular creatures can increase their multicellular complexities. When the intensity of the internal struggle increases the psychic body has to become stronger according to the intensity of the struggle. No matter how powerful a creature may be, if its physical complexities are less, its psychic and spiritual complexities will be proportionately less. That&#146;s why the mighty elephant and rhinoceros have to suffer the fate of being the slaves of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->As the psychic realm of a unit being develops its capacity for self expression gradually increases enabling it to struggle against obstacles and move towards a brilliant future. Human beings, due to their greater control over their propensities, try to express their desires and ambitions after due deliberation. But an undeveloped creature rushes immediately towards any object it sees which excites its greed. Human beings do not act like that, of course &ndash; they control their instinct of greed through proper and rational discrimination. And this discrimination is the result of psychic expansion which itself is the result of the reflection of the Supreme Consciousness on the unit mental plate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Thus humans reach higher stages of psychic expansion as they advance on the path leading to the attainment of the Supreme Entity. This expansion causes them to become established in the subtler world of cognition. Finally one glorious day they will either attain liberation by merging their individual minds in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma or salvation by merging their existential feeling in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. But if they remain preoccupied with petty thoughts they will be converted into sub-human creatures or even into the crude fundamental factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Thus there are three paths open to human beings: salvation (moks&#x301;a), liberation (mukti), and complete crudification. When the five fundamental factors do not get the scope of acquiring a mind in a physical structure they move towards even more crudity &ndash; the solid becoming more solid; the liquid becoming solid; the luminous becoming liquid and ultimately solid; the aerial factor becoming luminous then liquid, then solid; and the ethereal factor becoming aerial, then luminous, then liquid, then solid. As a result of the continuous crudification of the fundamental factors the physical structure becomes more condensed. This path of crudification is the path of degeneration. All the perceptible physical objects of the world are composed of the five fundamental factors. If the subtle factors within them crudify that is are converted into solid one day due to extreme condensation, their existence will go beyond the sense of perception, becoming extremely small. This process of contraction increases the internal clash within the material structure. When the internal clash becomes so intense that the structure can no longer maintain it&#146;s structural solidarity it is called jad&#x301;asphota. Jad&#x301;asphota converts all the fundamental factors into the ethereal factor, from which they again move within the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara evolving once more to their solid base where they again get the scope to become a living structure.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Take the case of this planet earth which is composed of the five fundamental factors.

Under these circumstances the planet and its atmosphere will gradually get condensed. It will become so small that it will become unrecognizable as a planet. When its internal factor reaches the nadir point of crudity it will appear to be non-existent outwardly. At this stage it will experience jad&#x301;asphota causing an immense explosion. That tremendous energy release converts the solid body into the ethereal factor. The celestial bodies of the universe which are unfit for human habitation are all moving through the process of jad&#x301;asphota and are hurtling towards a catastrophic explosion. This is the inevitable fate of each and every celestial body.

The controlling power of the cosmic cycle is called Purus&#x301;ottama. Shiva is not only the Purus&#x301;ottama or Parama Shiva of objects, He is the witnessing force of each and every molecule. He is also the power behind sight, and the driving force behind each action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->When He remains associated with the collective manifestation of the universe as its witnessing force that is His prota yoga, and when He remains associated with the individual microcosm as its witness, that is His ota yoga. Thus He lies covert in each and every entity in His individual and collective association. The human beings, after knowing the Supreme Entity, attain liberation from all fetters (pa&#x301;shas).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Entity in its movement from crude to subtle gradually becomes &ldquo;free&rdquo; from the influence of Prakrti and begins to imbibe the qualities of Purus&#x301;a. The subtlest portion of the citta is the hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a. Just above this layer is the all-blissful stance of the Supreme Entity. Both inside and outside the [[microcosmic]] structure, the Cosmic process of Pratisain&#x32D;cara is working. Thus He not only exists surrounding all the entities, but with the help of His immanent power, He stimulates His imaginative flow. Thus the material structure endowed with its so-called vital energy becomes increasingly complex and is converted into annama&#x301;ya kos&#x301;a, supported by pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h. It also acquires ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a as its activating force. In the next stages, with the help of the extroversive flow of the cosmic cycle, the manomaya kos&#x301;a evolves out of kamamaya, the atimanas evolves out of manomaya, the vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya out of atimanas, and the hiranmaya out of vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya. The hiranmaya kos&#x301;a finally merges into the Supreme Cognition as the witnessing force. This cosmic imagination is an action and hence it has a sound of its own. It is so subtle that it is extremely difficult for the ear to hear it, but not impossible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->There is diversity in the sound owing to the variation in the degree of subtlety or crudity of the vibrated object. The rhythm in which the vibrational flow of the cosmic mind vibrates the annama&#x301;ya kos&#x301;a of individual microcosms &ndash; veins, nerves, arteries, blood, lymph, etc. &ndash; is the initial stage of the divine cosmic sound. When this sound is heard in the anama&#x301;ya kos&#x301;a it resembles that of a cricket. When this cosmic sound vibrates the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a it resembles the sound of ankle bells. In the manomaya kos&#x301;a it resembles a flute (the mystic sadhakas of the Vaesnava cult describe it as the sound of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s flute); in atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a, the resonance of a gong; in vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a the buzzing of bees or the rolling of ocean waves; and in hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a, a prolonged on&#x32D;m&#x301; sound. Thus the cosmic sound is expressed in various ways according to the degrees of crudity or subtlety in relation to the fundamental factors. There are various physical and psychic expressions centring around the various degrees of cosmic sound. When one&#146;s mind is confined to a particular stratum one hears the sound peculiar to that stratum only. A person who lacks concentration of mind cannot hear any expression of the cosmic sound. In the field of spiritual practice the divine sound is expressed in a spontaneous way. When the existential awareness of living beings becomes concentrated with the cognitive bearing, it is not attracted to any sort of sound. Even the sound on&#x32D;m&#x301; of the hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a becomes non-existent in the non-attributional stance because every sound is a particular expression of a gun&#x301;a or principle (sentient, mutative or static principle), or as an expression of an action. A person who is emerged in the Cognitive Bearing does not need to make any psychic endeavour with the help of any acoustic root. He or she is free from bondages, from all fetters, having attained karma sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>

It is He who provides the impetus and inspiration necessary for spiritual progress, for movement along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara. And to attain Him one should not perform ritualistic practice.
