<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam (&ldquo;Blissful Discourses&rdquo;) series assembles all the known General Darshan discourses given by Ma&#x301;rga Guru Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti. General Darshan (GD) speeches, or discourses, were those given to Ananda Marga members, often as a part of the daily routine, in whatever locality Ma&#x301;rga Guru happened to be staying in at the time. Normally briefer and lighter in tone (though no less profound in their fundamental meanings) than the discourses given on the formal occasions of Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (DMC), these talks were sometimes delivered in a very intimate way to relatively small groups of Margis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Ananda Vacana&#x301;mrtam series was begun in 1978 with the GD discourses given by the author at that time; it then kept pace with the GD discourses that the author gave over the subsequent six years. Starting with Part 23, the series has included GD speeches given before 1978.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In this present volume, twenty discourses (most of them quite short) have been assigned to the appendix &ldquo;From the Notebooks of Devotees&rdquo; in the last pages of the book. These are discourses that were recovered in the form of typed discourse notes; or if recovered from an established magazine of the mission, then recovered in the form of an article that appeared to be a summary or approximation of the original discourse, but perhaps not an exact rendering. It was thought advisable to locate these discourses separately. Writers who wish to quote from these discourses should attribute the material to the &ldquo;A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 31 appendix&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Normally within each Ananda Vacana&#x301;mrtam the discourses appear in chronological order. Although in this volume the appendix has been separated from the main text, within the main text and within the appendix, respectively, the chronological order has been maintained.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate here &ndash; in addition to the original language of each speech, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if other than in this book, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the cases of some of the discourses published here, no written record was found of the language in which the discourse was given; but if the language could be clearly inferred from the location and other circumstances of the discourse, we have cited that language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the editors have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Eds.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Many readers are concerned that the author&#146;s speeches, as published, should adhere as closely as possible to the precise wording the author used in speaking. For this reason, in the case of discourses given originally in English, the editors have not altered pronouns and other terms which the author in his lifetime considered &ldquo;common-gender&rdquo; words. As the author once said, &ldquo;You know, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is not only masculine gender, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is common gender also. &lsquo;Man is mortal&rsquo; &ndash; here &lsquo;man&rsquo; means both male and female.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The author was a natural advocate of women&#146;s rights and on at least one occasion indicated that &ldquo;lopsided justice&rdquo; in language should be eliminated at some future date. In keeping with this guideline and with present-day trends, it is our policy in the case of translated discourses (where the published wording will necessarily be that of the translators) to use gender-neutral language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->According to the standard of intellect, microcosms can be divided into three broad categories: brutes, humans and devata&#x301;s [gods]. In our human society also, we find brutes in human structure, we find humans in human structure, and we find devata&#x301;s in human structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is our sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? What is our intuitional practice? Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is  a march from the stratum of brutality to the stratum of humanity, and from the stratum of humanity to the stratum of divinity. And finally this divine man, this divine entity, becomes one with the Supreme Lord. That particular point where the devata&#x301; merges with the Supreme Lord is the terminating point of all the marches in his life. So it is a march. It is something dynamic. In human life one must not support, one must not encourage, the static principle. Dynamicity is the law and the order of human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->You know, in ancient times, there was a great pandit. His name was Rohita. He was well-versed in all the sha&#x301;stras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is the meaning of sha&#x301;stra? Sha&#x301;s means &ldquo;to control&rdquo;, to do sha&#x301;sana; and tra means &ldquo;liberator&rdquo;. That which liberates you by controlling all your activities  &ndash; &ldquo;Don&#146;t do this, do that&rdquo; &ndash; through this sort of control &ndash; is sha&#x301;stra. It liberates you by auto-suggestion. Auto-suggestion means mantra, incantation. Manana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah mantrah parikiirttitah [&ldquo;A mantra is that collection of sounds which, when meditated upon, leads to liberation&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->So that Rohita was well-versed in all the sha&#x301;stras. And after returning from his gurugrha [the master&#146;s house], when his laokika father<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> asked him to do worldly duties, he said, &ldquo;Oh, I went through so many sha&#x301;stras, and I have come to the conclusion that there is no necessity of doing any work. We shouldn&#146;t do any work, we should always be engaged in jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nacarca&#x301; [cultivation of spiritual knowledge].&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Then his father said,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  &ldquo;O Rohita, he who moves forward, he who has developed the dynamic force in his body and mind, is really blessed. And the sweating body of that industrious man is the most beautiful body. That perspiring body has world-attracting charm, and Indra, the lord of the devata&#x301;s, always tries to make friendship with that man, with that industrious man. So, Rohita, move forward, move forward, move forward. Life is a dynamic force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If someone does not do anything, any work; if someone is afraid of work, then his fortune is &lsquo;sleeping&rsquo;. If someone is intellectually and physically sleeping, then his fate is also sleeping. But if someone wants to do something, then his fate also wants to move forward. If someone is standing, then his fate is also standing. If someone moves forward, then his fate also moves forward. So Rohita, do something, do something, do something.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;When you are sleeping in the slumber of ignorance, there is Kali Yuga in your life. If someone feels that he should do something, there is Dva&#x301;para Yuga in his life; and if someone becomes ready to do something, there is Treta&#x301; Yuga in his life; and if someone has started doing something, doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, there is Satya Yuga in his life. So Rohita, do something, do something. Life is a constant effort to restore an unstable equilibrium. Life is a fight. Life is moving forward. Life is a dynamic force.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->So this human life is a movement from the stage of brute to the stratum of humanity, and from the stratum of humanity to the stratum of divinity, and from the stage of divinity to merger with the Supreme Lord.

<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->But you know, when you are to move fast, your mind should be light; if the mind is heavy it will not be able to move fast. What makes the mind heavy? So many impurities of thought. Lord Buddha said:<!-- /block --></p>

You should give up all worldly thoughts, all base thoughts, all depraving thoughts, and make yourself light.&rdquo; To make oneself light means to free oneself from impurities. A magnet can easily attract a piece of iron, but if that piece of iron is full of impurities, that very magnet may not be able to attract that iron. So the Supreme Self, Supreme Lord, is always attracting you, but because of your heaviness due to worldly impurities, you are not being attracted by Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now how to free the mind, how to make the mind light, how to free the mind from worldly impurities? By rendering selfless service to suffering humanity without any restriction of caste, creed, religion or sex. So you as sa&#x301;dhakas [spiritual aspirants], you must remember that the dharma of your life is to move forward from matter to abstract, from abstract to soul, from soul to the Supreme Soul. This is the dharma of your life, and while performing this dharma, you are to render selfless service to all humanity. You must not forget this fact. If you are successful in rendering selfless service to the world, certainly you will make progress in your spiritual life.<!-- /block --></p>

These two belligerent forces are active in the human mind. A sa&#x301;dhaka will encourage the divine force, and a non-sa&#x301;dhaka will encourage the evil force. This fight is called deva&#x301;sura sam&#x301;gra&#x301;ma. The deva party is the divine force, and the asura party is the evil force. This deva&#x301;sura sam&#x301;gra&#x301;ma has been going on since time immemorial; and that&#146;s why spiritual practice, spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, is called sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;samara.

<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Dhritarastra said.&rdquo; Who is Dhritarastra? Dhrta means [&ldquo;controlling&rdquo;, &ldquo;controlling entity&rdquo;], and ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra means &ldquo;structure&rdquo;, &ldquo;framework&rdquo;. And who does [control] your physical structure? Your mind. Because of the mind, because of the existence of the mind, the structural solidarity of a body is maintained. If the mind leaves the body, the body will decompose, dissociate; its structural solidarity will be lost. So who is Dhritarastra? He who controls the ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra, he who controls the physical body: that is, the mind. Dhrtara&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ra uva&#x301;ca means &ldquo;The mind says&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;The question arose in the mind, in the human mind.&rdquo; Now do you know?

And after assembling there, what did they do, Sanjaya? Tell me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now, why does Dhritarastra ask Sanjaya? Because Dhritarastra cannot see. The mind cannot see; the mind is a blind force. Dhritarastra was blind. You know, Dhritarastra was blind, because the mind is blind, the mind is a blind force, the mind cannot see without the help of the conscience. The mind cannot see without the help of the viveka. The manah cannot see without the help of the viveka. The mana, the blind mind, asks the viveka (the viveka is sain&#x32D;jaya: sam + ji + al) the result of the fight between [good] and evil. Sain&#x32D;jaya means the power of discrimination. The power of discrimination between good and bad is called viveka &ndash; and this is sain&#x32D;jaya. The blind mind asks sain&#x32D;jaya &ndash; the mind asks the viveka &ndash; &ldquo;My party&rdquo; (that is, the party of the blind mind) &ldquo;and the Pandu party &ndash; after assembling on Dharmaks&#x301;etra, Kuruks&#x301;etra, what did they do?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, who are the members of &ldquo;my party&rdquo;, that is, Dhritarastra&#146;s party? That is, who are the supporters of Dhritarastra? Who are the supporters of the blind mind? Now you know, there are ten indriyas in the human body, caks&#x301;uh, karn&#x301;a, na&#x301;sika&#x301;, jihva&#x301;, tvak, va&#x301;k, pa&#x301;n&#x301;i, pa&#x301;da, pa&#x301;yu, and upastha. These are the ten indriyas of the human body, the ten [organs] of the human body. Five are sensory organs, and five are motor organs. Caks&#x301;uh, karn&#x301;a, na&#x301;sika&#x301;, jihva&#x301;, tvak [eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin] &ndash; these five organs are sensory organs. And va&#x301;k, pa&#x301;n&#x301;i, pa&#x301;da, pa&#x301;yu, upastha [vocal cord, hands/arms, feet/legs, anus, genitary organ] &ndash; these five organs are motor organs. There are ten organs. And each and every organ can function in ten directions. So the agents of the mind can function in ten times ten, a hundred directions. So Dhritarastra had one hundred agents, one hundred sons. These one hundred sons were the party of Dhritarastra. They are the supporters of materialism, they are the evil force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava&#x301;shcaeva. They are fighting against whom? Against the Pandavas. What is the meaning of pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava? In Sanskrit [pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;, from the] root verb pan&#x301;d&#x301;, means &ldquo;spiritual knowledge, sentient knowledge&rdquo;. Pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita means &ldquo;he who has acquired spiritual knowledge, he who has acquired sentient knowledge&rdquo;. Pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; means &ldquo;I am Brahma.&rdquo; This firm determination, this stance of &ldquo;I &ndash; Brahma,&rdquo; this firm determination, is called pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;. And he who has acquired pan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; is called pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita &ndash; and he who wants to acquire this knowledge is called pan&#x301;d&#x301;u &ndash; and pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava means &ldquo;pertaining to pan&#x301;d&#x301;u&rdquo;. The stages that you will have to go through in your spiritual practice are pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava. In your spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, you are required to exalt your kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, the &ldquo;coiled serpentine&rdquo;, from the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra to the pineal gland. And in this process of exaltation, this &ldquo;coiled serpentine&rdquo;, this kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, will have to pass through five important plexi. These five important plexi are the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra, the sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra, the man&#x301;ipu&#x301;ra cakra, the ana&#x301;hata cakra, and the vishuddha cakra. These are the five plexi controlling physicality, controlling the physical world. The mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra is represented by Sahadeva, the sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra is represented by Nakula, the man&#x301;ipu&#x301;ra cakra is represented by Arjuna, the ana&#x301;hata cakra by Bhima, and the vishuddha cakra by Yudhisthira. And above that is the site of the mind. What mind? The sentient mind. When the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii reaches here [mid-point between the eyebrows], a person attains the qualified stance, savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi. So to attain this stance of savikalpa, the  kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, that is, the jiiva shakti, the sleeping divinity, will have to pass through these five stages. So these five stages are the Pain&#x32D;ca Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava [Five Pandavas].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->So on the one side this kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii passing through five cakras; on the other side, the one hundred agents of Dhritarastra. They are fighting against each other. This fight is the fight of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;samara. And where is this fight taking place? On Dharmaks&#x301;etra, Kuruks&#x301;etra. What is dharmaks&#x301;etra? Your physical body is dharmaks&#x301;etra. Without this physical body you cannot practise dharma. After leaving this physical body, you will not be able to follow dharma, to do dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. So your physical body &ndash; this body &ndash; is dharmaks&#x301;etra. That is, this fight is taking place within this body. And kuruks&#x301;etra? Kuru means, in Sanskrit, &ldquo;do&rdquo; &ndash; it is the imperative mood, second person, singular number, of the root verb kr. Kuru means &ldquo;do&rdquo; &ndash; anujin&#x32D;a&#x301; [imperative]. [And ks&#x301;etra means &ldquo;field&rdquo;.] Kuruks&#x301;etra means the field which is always saying, &ldquo;Kuru, kuru, kuru&#8230; do something, do something, do something, do something!&rdquo; Ks&#x301;etra-kuru &ndash; &ldquo;the ks&#x301;etra of deeds&rdquo;. So kuruks&#x301;etra &ndash; this universe is Kuruks&#x301;etra, this world is Kuruks&#x301;etra. And your body is Dharmaks&#x301;etra. And this war between the Pandavas and the Kaoravas, the one hundred Kaoravas and the five Pandavas, is taking place within this Dharmaks&#x301;etra and within this vast Kuruks&#x301;etra. This fight will never come to an end! In individual life, when the Pandavas win, you will attain salvation, but in collective life, such a salvation will never come, it will go on forever&#8230; In your individual life, you will do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and attain salvation. And with your spiritual force, with your intellectual force, with your physical force, you are to serve society, you are to render selfless service to suffering humanity.<!-- /block --></p>

A man, Mr. X, may be treated as durjana for Mr. Y, but may not be treated as durjana for Mr. Z. Suppose in Mr. X the good portion, the merit portion, is ten degrees, and the bad portion, the demerit portion, is twelve degrees. Then the resultant is two degrees in favour of demerit: ten degrees merit and twelve degrees demerit, so the resultant goes in favour of demerit. Two degrees demerit is the resultant. Now another man&#146;s merit portion is fifteen degrees, and demerit portion ten degrees. So the resultant five degrees goes in favour of merit. So he has five degrees of merit, and the first man has two degrees of demerit. So when that five-degree merit man comes in contact with that two-degree demerit man, the resultant will go in favour of that five-degree merit man. So that bad man will be modified, rectified. He will become good on coming in contact with that five-degree merit man. So for that five-degree merit man, that two-degree demerit man is not a durjana, because the latter cannot deprave him. But for a man who has just one degree of merit, that two-degree demerit man may deprave him &ndash; so for him that two-degree demerit man is a durjana. Clear?<!-- /block --></p>

If everybody says, &ldquo;I won&#146;t come in contact with durjanas,&rdquo; then how are these durjanas to be rectified? In such a case, you should not contact the person singularly; you along with two or three of your friends should contact him. And those friends should have resultant merit, not resultant demerit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Suppose you have resultant one degree merit, and a friend has resultant two degrees merit; then the total should be three degrees merit: your one degree and his two degrees. So with these three degrees of merit, you will contact that two-degree demerit person. That person will be rectified. So before your combined strength, that man no longer remains a durjana. But when you are singular, then that man is certainly a durjana for you. Clear?<!-- /block --></p>

The intention was that by using this word sa&#x301;dhu, this word would work as a remembrancer, just to remind them, &ldquo;You will have to become a sa&#x301;dhu [virtuous person] and not a cheat. You are not to cheat the public &ndash; you are not to do black-marketeering or smuggling &ndash; you are a sa&#x301;dhu.&rdquo; So that commercial population used the title Sa&#x301;dhu.

For example, if you are to serve ailing persons but you are not serving ailing persons, then you are going against a vidhi. To go against a vidhi is called pratyava&#x301;ya.

<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->I think this word is also known here &ndash; pa&#x301;taka.

<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->To commit an ordinary offence is pa&#x301;taka. If one can atone for what one did, that is pa&#x301;taka. Suppose a man steals. Suppose five rupees were stolen. It is pa&#x301;taka, because after that, if you so desire, you can repay that amount and say, &ldquo;Oh, please excuse me.&rdquo; It has been atoned for. Pra&#x301;yashcitta &ndash; &ldquo;atonement&rdquo;. &ldquo;Please excuse me, take your money.&rdquo; This is called pa&#x301;taka, simple pa&#x301;taka.<!-- /block --></p>

No, no, you cannot atone for what you did. It is an unatonable offence. This unatonable type of offence is called atipa&#x301;taka. Now, pa&#x301;taka is atonable, and as soon as atonement is effected, you are a free man. But in the case of atipa&#x301;taka, the sha&#x301;stras [scriptures] say that he who commits it must sacrifice his life for the entire society, to serve society. He has no right to live in the society. He is to serve society from outside: this is the atonement. This is the prescribed atonement for an atipa&#x301;takii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Then the third one is maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka. This maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka is also atipa&#x301;taka, but the difference is that its effect is of recurring nature. Suppose a corrupt businessman uses papaya seeds [in the black pepper] &ndash; he invents a [new kind] of adulteration &ndash; papaya seeds. Now other businessmen will learn it from him, and the process will go on in recurring nature. So the particular businessman who invented this art is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii. That is, its effect will be of recurring nature. It will go on forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The sha&#x301;stra says that the proper atonement for such a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka is &ndash; what?

But that is not enough: that is the atonement for an atipa&#x301;takii. So what should he do? He should invent something new, and that invention should have a recurring nature of effect. Its effect should be of recurring nature. Because his misdeed had its effect of recurring nature, his good deed should also have an effect of recurring nature.<!-- /block --></p>

Just as it is the duty of a father to educate his children properly by his good conduct, an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya or a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya&#x301; should always instruct by his or her exemplary actions and words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In every period of history, some people are heard saying: &ldquo;Today&#146;s society is ruined, the people degenerated. Life was better in the old days.&rdquo; The same view is expressed in every era. Have human beings really lost their humanity? Don&#146;t they hold the highest position in the evolution of living things?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->All the psychological diseases of humanity are the result of not having bhu&#x301;madrs&#x301;t&#x301;i (Cosmic outlook) in life. The diseased persons do not consider others, but think only about themselves. They are busy thinking about their own families, employers, etc., and they forget everyone else. This is a terrible malady. But it is a mere expression and symptom of narrow-mindedness, the real root and reason for psychological disease. The cure is to reverse the trend of behaviour to rid the fallen human beings of narrow-mindedness. The medicine is one and only one: Brahmabha&#x301;va [ideation on Supreme Consciousness]. But just adopting the supreme goal does not immediately establish one in that. It is the work of the a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya to recognize if a person is on the right or wrong path and course of action. The a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya should give direction and guidance in every work, big or small. When he or she is to impart any duty to anyone, he should be strict, strong and exact, like a diamond. He or she should never consider social position, wealth, rank, etc. Only those who are established in Yama and Niyama [moral code] and practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; can be given any responsibility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Remember, Ananda Marga is a man-making mission. Both quantity and quality are important. Everyone should be free to join Ananda Marga, to take part in social functions, etc., but only those established in Yama and Niyama may be given any position to work in society. Just to satisfy someone and compromise [with] sin is unthinkable. We can in no case ever compromise with injustice. An employer and a worker may compromise after a struggle. But Ananda Marga is fighting for Satya (Absolute Truth) and unless and until we get total victory in both individual and collective life we must not stop the struggle. Compromising with injustice during battle is asatya [untruth]. Achieving only seventy-five percent Satya and twenty-five percent asatya is no victory. Quinine suppresses the symptoms of malaria, while the disease still remains in the blood. But the disease must be destroyed. Therefore, until you banish asatya you shall not stop your battle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Society is the collective name for those who want to move ahead together. The struggle against sin must be waged individually as well as in a well-unified way in collective social life. There is a story in the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a. In it, the demons defeated each of the gods individually, but then the gods united all their individual strengths and formed a tremendous collective force, thereby routing and destroying the demons. It is a very good story and there can be practical application of its meaning in every collective endeavour. It is the duty of an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya to develop this great collective force of society by awakening the masses to unite and destroy the evil, demoniac forces existing in society. The struggle between good and evil forces goes on. Sound an urgent clarion call in this battlefield of life. A&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas must give such inspiration to the people. You know, a son must remove the debt of his deceased father &ndash; he is morally bound to do so. Similarly, you are to purify society by purging it of sin. It is more than an obligation, it is your bounden duty. You must do this or total destruction is inevitable. To take leadership in society you must be established in Yama and Niyama in just such a strict way.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I must never ignore or neglect the present tense. That is, I must always remember where I am and what I am to do just at present. But what is the present?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->We know that there are three tenses &ndash; past, present and future. What is the present tense? What is the future tense? Actually there is no such thing as the present tense. When I say something, you do not then hear it. You hear it after a small gap. What is the gap? The time taken by the air to carry the sound to your ear. And when you hear, it is past for [me]. So when I say it, just when I am saying it, it is future for you, because you hear after a short gap, and when you hear it is past for [me].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Then what is necessary? You see even a very sensitive organ takes some time to adjust or to digest very long and very short waves, that is, [inferences]. So when we find a little difference between past and future we say it is present. Here between my saying and your hearing there is a very little gap and human organs fail to differentiate that gap from saying and actual hearing. We say it is present tense, actually there is no present tense. But Lord Shiva said, you should [live in] the present tense. The actual meaning of this sentence is you should always be mentally present in the present tense. That is, you should never ignore or neglect the present tense.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is the import? Human existence [is] physical, human existence [is] psychic, human existence [is] spiritual. Amongst these three, the physical one is very crude; the psychic one is less crude, you may say more subtle; and the spiritual one is the subtlest. So this existence of the present tense is more prominent in the physical stratum than in the psychic, and more prominent in the psychic than in the spiritual. Actually in the spiritual there is no difference amongst present, past and future, and that is why one who has established oneself in the aspects of spirituality finds no difference amongst past, present and future, and becomes sarvajin&#x32D;a&#x301; &ndash; omniscient. One sees everything, knows everything. But on the psychic level there are differences, and on the physical level the differences are still more prominent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Here Lord Shiva says that in the sphere of crude physicality you should pay due respect to the physical world. I said it is objective adjustment, but whatever you are doing or whatever you will be doing in the physical sphere you should have proper adjustment. You should maintain proper equilibrium. This adjustment or equilibrium should be with your psychic stratum. In the psychic stratum the existence is less crude and more subtle, and because it is more subtle the time gap is less prominent. Physically it will take much time, because one&#146;s psychic structure, one&#146;s psychic body, is more subtle than one&#146;s physical body, and that is why the time gap is less prominent. And our spiritual movement, our spiritual progress, starts from the psychic world, the psychic level &ndash; starting from the psychic arena and culminating in the supreme spiritual point. So here the time gap is very unimportant. Movement is towards the Supreme Entity, towards the spiritual goal where there is no importance of the temporal factor and no importance of the tempus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->A person must move from the psychic towards the Supreme Entity, where there is no importance of time, but in one&#146;s physical structure one is to do so many worldly deeds, so many worldly duties. One has duties concerning food, duties concerning shelter, duties concerning medical needs, duties concerning education, and so many things. And in all these duties, all these activities, in the crude physical stratum, there is the value of space and person and so on, if a person wants proper advancement. If a person wants proper utilization of all his or her mind, there must be a proper adjustment, a proper equilibrium, between one&#146;s physical movement and physical activities and one&#146;s psycho-spiritual movement, psycho-spiritual advancement, and psycho-spiritual progress; and that&#146;s why I said in human life there should be &ndash; what? Subjective approach through objective adjustment. If only the subjective approach is there and there is no objective adjustment, there equilibrium will be lost. The entire human society will become degraded and destroyed. And if there is only physical activity and no spiritual advancement, human existence will be rendered to the status of brutes or plants, which is not at all desirable. So a spiritual aspirant must always remember the subjective approach through objective adjustment. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Macro-propensitive equipoise&rdquo; is only used in reference to the Macrocosm and not the microcosm. Propensities are the pabulum of the human mind, they are its expressed sentiments. The resultant of these vrttis, or expressed sentiments, is the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra of the mind concerned. Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras have a momentum whose inherent force causes the unit body to propel to the force of momentum activating therein. This reactive momentum is the causal factor for all the later consequences which the unit body will have to undergo. One must always be careful to form pious momenta. But one must also be careful, while reaping the consequences of past reactions, that in this duration no further reactive momenta be created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Three Aspects of Propensity<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Resultant propensity consists of three aspects &ndash; physical [desire], psychic urge and spiritual [longing]. The last one causes neither a good nor a bad reaction; here is a balanced state. The propensity created by psychic urge can be either elevating or degenerating. If the tendency herein will be directed towards subtler states, the propensity will be elevating, and if directed towards cruder states, it is degenerating.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The propensitive equipoise is a characteristic only of the Macrocosmic Entity, since in It lies everything, nothing is beyond or external to It. Hence it remains unassailed. But microcosms have an external world and get assailed therefrom due to incoming vibrations, to have an unbalanced state.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Propensities are the pabulum  of the unit mind, it cannot exist in the absence of these propensities. The microcosmic psychic body gets reflections from external physicality and thus from propensities as its pabulum. Thus an internal projection of the physical world is the mental pabulum. Nothing is external to the Macrocosm, everything is within it, and so the Macrocosm needs no pabulum. This is the fundamental difference between microcosm and Macrocosm. In addition, whatever the Macrocosm creates, it is new, while [the creations] of the microcosm are mere reflections of the external physicality. Truly speaking, therefore, propensities of the Macrocosm cannot be termed as propensities, but as sam&#x301;kalpa. The entire Cosmos is His sam&#x301;kalpa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There is a perpetual equilibrium in the Macro-propensitive equipoise, though activation is a continuous event, comprising within all the three phases. The vibrations of the Macrocosmic psychic body cause creation, the acoustic root of which is a. Due to creation or  variegations in creations, there is clash and cohesion, which results in dissociation and association of words, and vyain&#x32D;janas<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> are formed. The consonants of Latin are different from these vyain&#x32D;janas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The first letter created in the Macrocosmic body during the formation of vyain&#x32D;janas is ka; this ka is the acoustic root. This universe has thus been created with acoustic root ka. To serve the ka-deva means to serve the entire manifestation of the Cosmos. That is why they who serve and look after that which has manifested in the Cosmos are known as ka&#x301;pa&#x301;lika.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Creation and Emergence of On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The vibrations of the Macrocosmic psychic entity create this Cosmos, and this is accomplished with the help of the Creative Principle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->During the operation of the Creative Principle, the bodhicitta is formed in the first phase. The metamorphosis of svara [vowel] into vyain&#x32D;jana is due to the operation of the Creative Principle. When the Creative Principle reflects in the Supreme Self, there is a light which is termed as effulgence. This effulgence is an event both in the microcosm and the Macrocosm. In the microcosm this is personal effulgence, and in the Cosmos it is Cosmic effulgence, or Brahmajyoti, which is omnipresent. When the spiritual aspirant is able to visualize this effulgence, he or she visualizes the universe as Cosmic effulgence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When the Creative Principle creates a stir in the Transcendental Entity, sound is also created, and this sound is on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. In Buddhist Tantra this has been termed as prabha&#x301; svara shu&#x301;nyata&#x301;. It is said to be shu&#x301;nya, or vacuum, because herein exists no physicality, and ipso facto, psychic expression cannot operate, and the only entity is spirituality. That is why Shankaracharya said that the Shu&#x301;nya of Buddha is the same as Brahma [Supreme Consciousness].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Non-Propensitive Desideratum the Goal<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->When the microcosm moves towards the external world with the help of the Creative Principle, it is said to be pravrtti, and when the trend is from physical to psychic and from psychic to spiritual it is said to be nivrtti; and when there is a balance it is sam&#x301;vrtti-bodhicitta, which cannot be the goal of the microcosm. The Supreme Desideratum is the goal of the microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Microcosmic tendency is propelled either by pravrtti or nivrtti, it cannot be sam&#x301;vrtti, since dynamism is inherent in the microcosmic entity. The Vedas, therefore, ask human beings to move on and on, because dynamism is life. To one who is engrossed in spiritual darkness, it is Kali Yuga; to one who has awakened and desires to get up, it is Dva&#x301;para Yuga; to one who has gotten up it is Treta&#x301;; and to one who has marched on the spiritual path it is Satya Yuga. Dynamism being inherent in human nature, sam&#x301;vrtti is not possible. One will have to adopt the path of pravrtti or nivrtti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The path of nivrtti is non-propensitive, and its last point is the Non-Propensitive Desideratum, which is the supreme goal of humanity. To achieve this, one has to withdraw the mind to one point,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and then the pointed &ldquo;I&rdquo;  shall be merged into the Cosmic ocean which is the desideratum. When the merger has been accomplished, there is no need of any help from the Creative Principle. The effulgence expressing in the bodhicitta does not exist either. This is the state of Nis&#x301;kala Brahma. Everything has been merged into It, which is the Supreme Desideratum. He is a Supreme Progenitor and we are His progeny. He is the Supreme Desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Supramundane Heritage and Supramundane Desideratum.&rdquo; I wrote long ago that the supreme law of human unity is that human beings have come from a common source and they all will return to the same culminating point, the same destination. No one is an exception to this rule. If due to confusion arising from superiority complexes, people think otherwise, they will land in trouble because there is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Here the Veda says that all the created objects have come from one source, all are established in one and the same structure, all will have to move towards one and the same destination. And that One is Brahma: He alone is to be realized.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..6"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Out of this Supreme One, all have emerged. Hence this Supreme One is called brhat. The word brhat literally means &ldquo;One who is very vast, who is beyond the scope of all limitations, who is immeasurable and unfathomable.&rdquo; The Himalayas are very large, no doubt, yet they can be measured in miles. As they come within the scope of measurement, they cannot be called brhat in philosophical terminology. We may say that the Himalayas are visha&#x301;la-very large-but certainly not brhat, immeasurably vast.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->From the word brhat the word Brahma has come. Brahma literally means the Entity who is Himself very vast, and whose ideation makes others vast like Him. Brhattva&#x301;d Brahma Brm&#x301;hanatva&#x301;d Brahma. Brm&#x301;hanatva&#x301;d means making others vast. He himself is very great, and hence he is called Brahma; but this is not enough. Besides that He has the capacity to make others equally great like Him, and that is why He is Brahma. The &ldquo;many&rdquo; have come from the &ldquo;One&rdquo;, and finally merge back into the &ldquo;One&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now the fundamental question is, why have the &ldquo;many&rdquo; come from the One? Why is One metamorphosed into many? This is something beyond human imagination, because the mind functions within a particular periphery and with a particular upa&#x301;dhi. When the internal or external projection of the mind does not find a physical base, and the mind loses its capacity to think, it may be said that there is something beyond the scope of the mind. The state where the mind cannot reach, is called the metempirical state, the anavastha&#x301;dos&#x301;a of mind. Where the mind is non-existent, how can it perceive or conceive anything? It cannot.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Feelings of joy and sorrow lie within the mental arena. But those feelings which transcend the arena of mind are called a&#x301;nanda&#x301;nubhuti, the feelings of bliss. Philosophers do not find any answer to the question of why the singular Brahma is metamorphosed into many. A philosopher, a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;ni, has no answer to this question. No one can know the answer because the original stance of Brahma is beyond the periphery of mind. All argumentations, all logic, lie within the scope of mind. Hence the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis fail to find the answer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The karmiis or people of action also try to find the answer, but their capacity is still more limited, for karma or action is the change of position of an object. Now the question is, where can the relative change of position of objects take place? Only within the scope of the quinquelemental factors; it is difficult to go beyond that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the mental sphere such a change of place can indeed occur but for such a change of place, there must be a witness or a measurer as well to give an idea of time &ndash; the temporal factor. Hence karmiis cannot know on the physical level why Brahma created the manifested world. In the same way, they cannot get the answer in the mental world either because the mind cannot function outside the ectoplasmic structure. Hence karmiis are helpless in this regard. When the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis and karmiis failed to provide the answer, the poet Rabindranath wrote:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->[The question arose in my mind. The first morning sun put the question to the new arrival: Who are you? There was no answer. The last setting sun repeated the last question on the banks of the western sea, in the silent evening, Who are you? And again there was no answer.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Bhaktas or devotees are simple and straightforward; they like to steer clear of complications and intricacies. In their characteristic simple way they say:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Sa va&#x301; es&#x301;a tada&#x301;dras&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; na pashyaddrs&#x301;t&#x301;mekra&#x301;t&#x301;<br>Me ne santameva&#x301;tma&#x301;nam suptashaktirasuptadrk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..19"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;My Lord was alone. You know how troublesome it is to be all alone. Anyone who is forced to remain alone for five years together will either die or become mad. In the same way my Lord was all alone when there was no universe, no expression &ndash; only a state of complete vacuity. No one can imagine what a terrible situation it was! Hence, to break the monotony, to remove the dullness of loneliness, He started to create the universe to play with His own children.&rdquo; There is no other reply besides this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Thus the Supreme Cognitive entity became metamorphosed into many-the One Universal Father, the One Supreme Progenitor, continuing His divine sport with His innumerable children. To some people, this divine sport is very painful, while to others it is extremely sweet and pleasing. But this is His liila&#x301;, a great drama. In a drama, some people must play the parts of unhappy people, and some must play the roles of happy ones, otherwise the drama becomes dull and boring. Likewise this world too is a great drama. Parama Purus&#x301;a is directing a great dramatic performance, and according to His sweet will, He may call anyone and take them in His vast macrocosmic body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->During the enactment of a drama, all the characters, the dramatis personae (some are acting as great scholars, some fools, some as extremely happy and some as wretched beings) should bear in mind that they are simply playing the roles allotted to them. They should always think, &ldquo;In reality, I am neither very happy nor very miserable, I am not an erudite scholar nor a fool. I am merely acting a particular role-be it Emperor Shahja&#x301;ha&#x301;n or Aurangzeb.&rdquo; If people remember this, they will neither be afflicted with sorrow nor elated with joy. This is what is called cosmic inheritance, cosmic heritage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->All have come from one and the same Entity; no one is inferior, no one is small, mean or untouchable. No one is born high or low: all are bound by fraternal and sororal bonds. If people support casteism, it should be understood that they do not accept the Universal Father because the children of the same Father cannot have different castes. So one who believes in casteism does not believe in Parama Purus&#x301;a; and conversely, one who believes in Parama Purus&#x301;a does not believe in casteism. This is all hypocrisy. Those who were extremely cunning, balkanized human society into numerous fragments merely to promote their self-interest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Upon emerging from Brahma, human beings began their long evolutionary journey. But where can they go? They cannot go outside of the Entity beyond whom there is nothing. If Parama Purus&#x301;a says in anger to anyone, &ldquo;I don&#146;t like you, you scoundrel-get out!&rdquo; Then that person can say, &ldquo;Oh Lord, you want me to get out, but kindly tell me where to go? There is nothing outside You. So wherever I go, I shall remain within You. You are infinite. If you cannot tell me where I should go, then please change Your name. If there is anything outside You, then You are not infinite.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The poet Vidyapati also said, &ldquo;Adi ana&#x301;ndika na&#x301;tha kaha&#x301;yasi ab ta&#x301;ran&#x301;a bha&#x301;ran&#x301;a tumha&#x301;ra&#x301;.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are the Lord of the beginning and the Lord of the end also. I am somewhere between the beginning and the end, and so You are also my Lord. Thus it is Your duty to save me, to redeem me, to protect me from danger. You are bound to do that.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In the world of thought, two forces operate &ndash; the centrifugal and the centripetal. Similarly, regarding the immanent power of centripetal Parama Purus&#x301;a, it has been said, Shaktih sa&#x301; Shivasya Shaktih. Shakti, the Supreme Creative Principle, operates in two ways-vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301;. The force of avidya&#x301; repulses and the force of vidya&#x301; draws the entities towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is how Parama Purus&#x301;a is continuing His perpetual divine sport. That means that none of the entities can go beyond Him, for they are all moving around Purus&#x301;ottama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..26"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe brhante<br>Tasmin ham&#x301;so bhra&#x301;myate Brahmacakre<br>Prthaga&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; prerita&#x301;rain&#x32D;ca matva&#x301;<br>Jus&#x301;t&#x301;astatastena&#x301;mrtatva&#x301;meti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->All the created objects are revolving around Purus&#x301;ottama. Some are rotating at a greater distance with a long radius, and some are moving at a shorter distance with a short radius. The nature of the ideation and inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of entities varies from one to another, and accordingly the physical structures of individual entities also vary. And all the entities with their respective mass and wonts are revolving around the nucleus. This movement continues as long as they think, &ldquo;I and my Lord, I and the Universal Father are separate entities.&rdquo; As soon as they think, &ldquo;No, I and my Lord are not separate entities &ndash; just as the ocean and its drops of water are not separate entities. The drops of water are part of the ocean&rdquo;-then they are no longer misguided. They rush towards Purus&#x301;ottama and merge in Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->This becomes possible only when people get the opportunity and proper training due to His grace. Muktya&#x301;ka&#x301;unks&#x301;aya sadgurupra&#x301;ptih. Whenever anyone develops an intense desire to merge in Him, Parama Purus&#x301;a immediately arranges to impart lessons how to move towards Him, how to merge in Him. That is, Brahmaeva Gururekah na&#x301;parah. No one else except Parama Purus&#x301;a knows how to become one with Him. This is why in the form of preceptor He teaches the sa&#x301;dhakas seeking liberation. Besides this, there is no other way of returning to Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->I used the term &ldquo;desiderata&rdquo; in plural number. But the nucleus of the cosmological order is one, not more than one. So the term &ldquo;desideratum&rdquo; should be used in singular number because the Supreme Goal is one, not many. In order to reach the Singular entity, the aspirant must proceed with single-minded devotion, ekabuddhi. To proceed with divergent mental flows means to invite trouble, to risk annihilation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Now, all the microcosms originate from Him and finally return to Him. Their existence during the intervening period also comes within His scope, for He is continuing His divine sport with His microcosms. They will have to constantly remember that howsoever small they may be, they are the fragments of the Infinite One.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->With a small brain in a small cranium of the human body, a human being thinks. How much capacity can the brain possess? People sometimes do acquire non-cerebral memory (the memory of past lives) in the new bodies, but under ordinary circumstances people retain their memories of the past in the brain of this body. Anubhu&#x301;tavis&#x301;aya&#x301;samprasmos&#x301;a smrtih: perception is carried out through the nerve fibres. And with only a few nerve fibres, how much capacity do human beings possess? Katat&#x301;uku bal dhare ma&#x301;nava&#x301;r kata bal dhare vidha&#x301;ta&#x301;. How powerless is a human being, and how powerful is the Supreme Lord! There is no comparison.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->A person has a small brain with a little intellect and a little memory. Those who got their Master&#146;s Degrees only ten or twelve years ago will not be able to answer a single question if they are asked the same today. There &ldquo;pass&rdquo; certificate is their only capital, nothing else. Such is the small capacity of the poor human beings! Whereas Parama Purus&#x301;a possesses infinite knowledge and infinite wisdom. Where was the seed of intellect that found manifestation in different microcosms? It was certainly hidden in Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. His cognitive faculty is metamorphosed into physical objects, which in turn, through clash and cohesion, evolved into microcosms which gradually develop their latent intellectuality and finally become intellectual giants. Hence, with limited human intellect, it is futile to enter into useless debate on Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Sahasra&#x301;ks&#x301;a: How far can human beings see with their two eyes? Not very far. But can anyone hide anything from such an Entity who can see everything of this universe, in whose mind the entire universe is vibrating-the Entity who is always hearing each and every secret word hidden in the innermost part of everyone&#146;s mind? Hence it is better not to dare to compare Parama Purus&#x301;a with the unit living beings, the Macrocosm with the microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Sahasrapa&#x301;da: If you want to go physically to Calcutta from Siliguri, it will take at least some time. But it will not take any time at all to go from the Siliguri in your mind to the Calcutta in your mind; and in this universe everything is within the Cosmic Mind. This whole universe is His mental world, and so He does not take any time at all to move from one place to another within His mind. And thus it is said that He has innumerable legs and does not have to go from one place to another, because He is present everywhere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Sah bhu&#x301;mim&#x301; vishvato vrtva&#x301; atyatis&#x301;t&#x301;haddashaungulum: He is lying covert in each and every particle of this universe. Not only that; He is also residing in the arena ten fingers above the pituitary gland. He is equally present in the subtle expressions, in the psychic and astral worlds lying above the quinquelemental factors. And He is also above even that. The pituitary gland is the location of the human mind; mind is controlled from that point. So Parama Purus&#x301;a is both above the physical, and above the mental world as well. And even the spiritual world is also within His grasp.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Whether He blesses someone, or grants salvation to someone, entirely depends on His grace. No one has anything to say about it, nor has anyone any justification to say anything. For the justification does not exist within the ambit of the small minds of the microcosms, and beyond their minds they can know nothing. Thus He controls everything from sahasra&#x301;ra cakra (related to the pineal gland); this is the location of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The distance between the pituitary and the pineal gland is ten fingers; hence it is said, atyatis&#x301;t&#x301;haddashaungulam; that is, He resides ten fingers above the pineal gland. Obviously in this universe there is nothing which is not within His control.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Pure shete ya&#x301; sah Purus&#x301;ah: The Supreme Entity is lying covert in you. If you are awakened by dint of sadhana He will also be awakened, and then the unit being will become one with the Supreme Being. The Cosmic Consciousness knows everything; He does not need to study books to learn or understand anything. Some may question how he can be so well versed in all branches of knowledge. Human beings always read and forget; in fact they learn only to forget. But how does Parama Purus&#x301;a remember so many things? Here lies the difference between human beings and the Supreme Entity; He does not learn only to forget; in fact He does not even learn &ndash; He just knows. Everything is within His mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->What is the knowing faculty? Knowing means subjectification of external objectivity, and as there is nothing outside of Him, so the question of subjectivisation does not arise at all. For Him everything is internal; He does not know things by turning the pages of books to see what is written therein. As everything is within His mind, He already knows everything. Tatra niratishayam sarvajin&#x32D;abiijam: rtambhara&#x301; tatra prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;: Whatever was and whatever will be in future is all known to the Supreme Cognitive faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Uta&#x301;mrtatvasyesha&#x301;na yadanena&#x301;tisoham: Does the Supreme Consciousness reside in heaven or Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha above the seven realms of existence? No. He is omnipotent: He is in Vaekun&#x301;t&#x301;ha as well as in the lowest hell. In fact, any place where Parama Purus&#x301;a is non-existent, cannot itself exist. Hence to substantiate the existence of anything, the presence of Parama Purus&#x301;a is essential. So if so-called sinners complain that Parama Purus&#x301;a does not look at them, they are mistaken. He does look at them &ndash; He is with them. The moment those sinners will say with tears in their eyes, &ldquo;O Lord, please, take me in Your lap.&rdquo; He will immediately lift them upon His lap and brush the dust off their bodies and say, &ldquo;I am cleansing all the dirt and dross of your sins.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Hence under no circumstances should anyone think that Parama Purus&#x301;a can remain far away from them, because He cannot remain away from His created beings at all-it is contrary to his very nature. I have already said numerous times that if anyone ever complains that Purus&#x301;a is showering His grace on such-and-such person but not on me, it is wrong to say so. Those who complain thus are in fact holding the umbrella of ego on their heads. The Supreme Entity is surely showering His grace on all, but those who hold the umbrella of ego on their heads cannot be drenched by the rains of His grace. What is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the systematic endeavour to remove this umbrella of ego from over one&#146;s head.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->The main thing is that the fundamental essence of humanity is that all have come from the same source and that is Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence no artificial distinctions should be recognized among human beings. To recognize such distinctions means to impair the underlying unity of the human race, to act against the cosmic unity of the human race, to act against the cosmic will &ndash; to act like a demon in human form. Such demons should have no place in human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->The existence of living beings is within the vast Macrocosmic body of Parama Purus&#x301;a, not without. So whatever Parama Purus&#x301;a has given to the human race for its collective use should be utilized by all human beings. To act contrary to this is to act against the Cosmic Will. To fatten oneself beyond all proportion by exploiting others is neither good for individuals nor for the collective body. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Supreme Desideratum of all humanity. To help all human beings bound by these cosmic bonds of fraternity and sorority to move towards their Supreme Goal and not allow anyone to lag behind &ndash; here lies the supreme fulfilment of human life. This Parama Purus&#x301;a is the ultimate goal of existence, and only to attain Him have human beings come onto this earth. If they fail to do so, then they do not deserve to be called human beings. Hence life devoid of dharma is worse than animal life.<!-- /block --></p>

A person who sleeps too long spends half of his or her lifetime in sleep only. So how will he or she find time to do noble deeds? Human life, after all, is not very long; and of that short span of life, if half is wasted on sleep only, then there will hardly be any time left for doing noble deeds. That&#146;s why it is said, a person who is given to too much sleep can never aspire to attain the peak of progress in life. Sleep is necessary for health, but many people wrongly think that the more one sleeps, the better it is for health. That is wrong. Human beings go to sleep because they want to work more.

Before starting any work, such persons think inwardly, &ldquo;Shall I be able to do it? Perhaps I shan&#146;t.&rdquo; Out of this sort of hesitation or diffidence, a person develops inertia, the lack of mobility. There are still others who lack courage, who don&#146;t dare to take up any work, who hesitate to take the responsibility of initiating any work. This also leads to inertness. Again, there are some people who have the capability to work, who do not work due to lack of initiative. They sit inactive because of lack of self-confidence. A person who is a victim of this sort of inertness can never attain progress in life.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.9.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#9.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

It is a recognized fact, a recognized standard of veracity, that wherever there is effect there must be cause. This was propounded by Maharshi Kanada. He first said that where there is an effect there must be a cause. We may or may not know the cause, but the cause is there. At the same time you should remember that wherever there is effect, there must be the cause, but wherever there is cause there may or may not be an effect.<!-- /block --></p>

From a bad seed, from a weak seed, there will not be any sprout &ndash; but even if there is a very good seed, but that seed does not come in contact with earth, or air, or water, or light, in that case there will not be any sprout.<!-- /block --></p>

Now humanity bleeds. The future is dark. So we have come here to do something. I have come here to do something, and you have also come here to do something. My coming is significant, and your coming is not less significant. We have come with a mission; and our lives, singularly and collectively, are a mission. Not missions &ndash; ours is a collective mission. Here we all are one. We have come to do something. And that is the causal factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->And what will be the effect? The effect will be that the world will realize that humanity is one and indivisible, and no power in heaven  or on earth can destroy this glorious humanity.

<a name="11..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is called su&#x301;ks&#x301;ma, or &ldquo;subtle&rdquo;. What is subtle? Any object which does not usually come within the scope of the sense organs is subtle. When an object is so small or so vast that the human eyes cannot perceive it properly, it is called subtle. When a particular sound is so low or so high that human ears cannot perceive it, it is called subtle. Similarly, when an object is so sweet that our tongue cannot properly perceive its sweetness, it is called subtle. So it is said that anything which does not come within the scope of sense perception is called subtle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And this subtle object human beings try to bring within the scope of sense perception through a machine &ndash; a telescope or a microscope or something of the sort. And that object is called very, very subtle which does not at all come within the scope of perception, even through subtle instruments. Now the difference between a subtle object and a very subtle object varies from person to person, from place to place. For instance, there may be some subtle object today which is not perceivable even by machines; but maybe some new machine will be invented tomorrow by which we will be able to perceive the same object. Then that object will no longer be considered very subtle. But even in that case there will be something, some entity, which will still remain very subtle for those days. This is the inexorable law.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The word kalilam has a number of meanings in the Vedic language. But the general or popular meaning of the word is a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra &ndash; a structure, a base. What sort of structure?  A structure with which I am associated through inference. For instance, suppose a very bright light is emanating from an object. Light may be emitted from any object. But the very object which is radiating light and which you are trying to perceive &ndash; that very light-radiating object is known as kalila.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now Parama Purus&#x301;a is manifesting Himself in various forms even through that kalila.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now comes vishva. Vishva apparently means &ldquo;universe which is created&rdquo;: that which does not come within the scope of human perception but only partially.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now the degree of human comprehension of this universe varies from person to person. For a human being this universe is certainly beyond the scope of total perception. But a certain portion of this universe is certainly within his reach. Again, to a cow the world is unlimited, no doubt, but the cow fails to comprehend that this universe is unlimited, and that only that part of the universe where she grazes comes within her reach. So there is a variation between human and human and between creature and creature as to the degree of comprehension of this universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->That&#146;s why some persons spend their lives in quarrels over land, while others may prefer to spend their lifetimes delving into scriptures, while others might be more interested in earning money.  For these types of people, a very little portion of the universe is within their comprehension, whereas a vast portion of the universe remains untrodden and incomprehensible to them. Now [human] greatness or smallness is judged by how far a person has expanded his area of comprehension of the incomprehensible portion. You may find it a little difficult to understand this point. Suppose for instance a particular person has comprehended this earth; the solar system has come within the scope of his or her comprehension. In the case of a cow the arena remains quite limited; and if again a cow is tied to a stake, her arena may be still more limited. She does not know anything beyond that arena, nor does she want to know. She has no urge to know at all. In Bengal there is a popular saying that a cow which is tied to a fixed pole has a fixed quantity of grass to eat. Human beings who remain too preoccupied with terrestrial objects are in a condition no better than that of that cow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->For a person who is more evolved in intellectual erudition, the comprehensible portion of the universe goes on increasing. But the incomprehensible portion remains as large as before, because that is infinite. But a developed human being lives to reclaim the incomprehensible portion. For instance, when we fondle a little child, we think that the child is not merely a child, but rather Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself has come to me in the form of a child just to enjoy my fondling, love, and care. He has willingly come to me for that purpose. This is called madhuvidya&#x301;, and one should always remember to do it. And one who remembers to do it all the time is considered a great person in society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->So this is the explanation of vishva, the universe, of which part comes within the scope of human knowledge while another part remains inaccessible. So the universe never means the earth only.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[As Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.13.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#13.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> took His seat in the room in the Jamalpur Ashram, He said:] In the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata period we find two persons coming quite close to Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a &ndash; Arjuna and Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;. Both were greatly devoted to him. Now tell me, which of the two is the greater devotee of Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, and whom would you choose as the ideal of your life?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->[One by one, persons present there expressed their views. Some said that Arjuna was more devoted to Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a than was Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;, for he did all that the Lord asked him to do. Arjuna was the ideal of their life for he was a great karma yogii (yogi of selfless action) and the much-troubled world of today needed a karma yogii. A similar number were for Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;. Even being such a poor man and knowing that his childhood playmate Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a could shower riches on him, he never ever asked for even a little material help. Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; was a greater devotee than was Arjuna. Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; was the ideal of their life. When all had expressed themselves, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; said:] Devotion means unconditional self-surrender. The measure of devotion is the amount of this self-surrender. One who has more of it, is a greater devotee than one who has less of it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; paused and then said:] Arjuna and Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; were great devotees. But while comparing their devotion by this yardstick, we have got to say that Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; was a greater devotee than was Arjuna. You know the story in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata &ndash; Arjuna refused to fight when Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a asked him to do so. This shows that Arjuna did not have full faith in and complete surrender to Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Had there been complete surrender, Arjuna would have done as directed by Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. On the other hand, we notice a complete surrender by Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;. He never desired anything from Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, his sakha&#x301; [friend], who could have given him anything and everything. Howsoever he was, he remained content. Even when his wife forced him to go to Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to request Him to remove his poverty, he went to him but didn&#146;t ask for a thing. Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; was a greater devotee than was Arjuna.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; again paused and then continued (in reference to the second of the original questions):] Now whom should you take to be your ideal? Neither of the two &ndash; neither Suda&#x301;ma&#x301; nor Arjuna. You do know that neither of the two is perfect &ndash; so how to take anything imperfect as the ideal of life? Your ideal has to be perfect &ndash; so your ideal is to be the Lord and the Lord alone. No one else should be your ideal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And you should not pray to the Lord, &ldquo;Make me this, make me that; make me Arjuna or make me Suda&#x301;ma&#x301;.&rdquo; No, such should never be your prayer, for suppose the Lord wants you to become even greater than what you are praying to become? In such a case, you are creating a hindrance to your own welfare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What you must do is simply surrender to the Lord and leave everything else to Him and Him alone. Your ideal should be the Lord, and your effort should be towards a complete self-surrender. You should ask the Lord to make you what He wants. You should ask the Lord to take that work from You which He desires.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And if he finds that you have the potentialities to do His work, but you are lacking in self-surrender and you have not forgone your ego, then in such a case He will first create circumstances in which your ego will be forced to yield and surrender. After this only will the Lord choose you to be the medium for His work. You do know, similar was the case with Arjuna. Arjuna had the potentiality, but he also had some ego left in him. Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a first made him surrender by showing His vira&#x301;t&#x301;a ru&#x301;pa [Cosmic form], and then alone was Arjuna chosen to be the medium.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Vikranta grew up among such spiritual ideations, and by the time he was about twelve he left his parents and took to sannya&#x301;sa [renunciation]. This was a great blow to his father, the king of Kashi, for, he, the king, had planned great wordly things for Vikranta. He had planned to make Vikranta king after him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Once when the king was strolling by the palace where Madalasa lived, he heard the same spiritual lullaby being now sung to Alarka that Madalasa had sung to his first two sons. He thought, &ldquo;Madalasa spoiled [my first two sons]. I see she is doing the same thing with Alarka as well. No, I can&#146;t let this happen.&rdquo; Thinking thus, he rushed to Madalasa and said, &ldquo;Stop this now. I have had enough of it. From now onwards I shall look after Alarka.&rdquo; The king picked Alarka up in his arms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Madalasa then said, &ldquo;You have gone against the promise you made to me. I will therefore stay with you no longer.&rdquo; Madalasa prepared for her departure. Just when she was about to leave, she gave one ring to the king and said, &ldquo;Please put this ring on Alarka&#146;s finger as he grows up a little more. Please tell him that at any moment when he might be in great trouble, he should break open the ring, and therein he will get the right advice.&rdquo; Madalasa then left her husband&#146;s place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Alarka was then brought up under the care of the king. The king had gotten himself too involved in material pursuits. There was hardly any evil to which he had not gotten habituated. Naturally, under an evil care, Alarka as well developed evil habits. These grew in intensity as he grew. And when he became the king of Kashi after the death of his father, Alarka had hardly any time for the state and its people. He was too engrossed in his own entertainments. The condition of the state and its people deteriorated, going from bad to worse. The officers of the state ruthlessly exploited the people, as generally does happen in any state ruled by a king who finds no time to look after the affairs of state. All the people of the state wanted a change in the administration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Vikranta, the sannya&#x301;sii brother of Alarka, heard of the miseries of the people of Kashi.

I therefore request you to please march with your army to Kashi, conquer it, and hand it over to me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->[The king of Kaushala] was a moralist. He thought the proposal to be a wise one and attacked Kashi. As there was no one to support Alarka, Kashi was conquered without a fight. Alarka fled to save himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Vikranta then thought, &ldquo;I requested [the king of Kaushala] to attack Kashi only to give Alarka a good lesson. My duty is now over and I hope Alarka will now rule nicely.&rdquo; Vikranta returned to his own place.<!-- /block --></p>

Suddenly his eyes fell upon the ring given to him by his mother. He broke open the ring. Therein he found two pieces of advice written. The first was, &ldquo;Do not have any desire, but if that be not possible, then have the desire for moks&#x301;a [non-qualified liberation].&rdquo; The second was, &ldquo;Do not keep any type of company, but if that be not possible, keep good company, satsaun&#x32D;ga.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Some were for Vikranta, for, though he was a sannya&#x301;sii, he did not forget society. When needed, he came back to do his part of the duty. Some others were for Alarka, for he showed that a degraded man could rise. Many others expressed themselves for the king of Kaushala, for he represented &ldquo;Heart to God and hands to work.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->[Then those present asked Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;, who then said:] All three are the greatest of men. But the greatest character is the one who not only is great himself but also can inspire others in society. Of the three characters in review here, Alarka has such a characteristic. A great majority in society, and actually speaking almost all, do commit mistakes. They repent, too, and are always desirous of correcting themselves, of improving themselves. Alarka will inspire all such persons. These persons can get new hope in Alarka, thinking that if a man like Alarka could rise to great heights, why can&#146;t they? Alarka will keep encouraging them to rebuild their careers in a nicer way.<!-- /block --></p>

I think my share should be given to the honourable guest.&rsquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At this his wife said, &lsquo;What do you mean? I know well that you are very weak.

Lord, how fortunate I am, how blessed I am to have seen this great yajin&#x32D;a!&rsquo; And with great feeling, he rolled on the floor of the room.

<a name="15..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a concluded, &ldquo;He heard somewhere that Yudhisthira was performing a great yajin&#x32D;a.

Later on it will appear still further powdered down into its component subatomic particles (&ldquo;ions&rdquo; in philosophical language). And finally when the mind becomes maximally elevated, the sa&#x301;dhaka will perceive a solid object as the consciousness that it intrinsically is. At that stage the touch of a solid object will be like the touch of Supreme Consciousness, carrying with it the bliss of Supreme Consciousness. &ndash;Eds.</p>

Bengali consists of Sanskrit roots and many English, Japanese, Portugese, [Persian] and Arabic words. Tagalog is composed of Mandarin, Cantonese, Indonesian, Malay and Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>

Everywhere there is universal blending. There is no single original race or language anywhere in the world. So human society is a singular entity.

<a name="27..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Let us treat the two topics of today&#146;s discussion, guha&#x301; and satsaun&#x32D;ga, separately first, bringing them together in the latter part of our thoughts. The word guha&#x301; has two meanings. The first interpretation from Sanskrit into English is &ldquo;cave wherein God resides&rdquo;. For too long yogis in every corner of the world have taken this interpretation too literally, and, thinking it to be the only way to obtain union with Supreme Consciousness, have turned their backs on society and spent their lives hidden deep in caves. Everything being a part of Parama Purus&#x301;a must mean that this world is also a part of the same; to deny one part of Him is to deny the whole; and a person&#146;s obtaining something that he or she has denied is a very unlikely occurrence. Therefore any attempt to obtain Him by leaving the world is indeed a very foolish endeavour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Someone may very well present the age-old argument that in a society so materially oriented, there are too many things to distract our minds, while in solitude contemplation of the Great is a much easier endeavour. This is folly again, because any mind that is swayed from contemplating Him by social distractions will no doubt find itself admiring the different rock formations in the cave of its seclusion, a more subtle and perhaps a more dangerous veil than the one supposedly left behind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->We must always bear in mind the fact that when Parama Purus&#x301;a wants us to attain Him, then and only then will we get Him. And what determines when we are ready for Him to take us? He looks to see if we truly love only Him down to the depths of our hearts. In each and every moment of our lives He is testing us to see if we have reached this degree of devotion, or whether there is still in fact some wordly desire that diverts our thoughts from Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The second meaning of guha&#x301; is &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Parama&#x301;tman [the Supreme Soul] is lying in the cave of your own heart, your own &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness. So that makes everything very simple! We only need to come to know ourselves by intense sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and know His manifestations by selfless service, and then our love for Him will surely grow to boundless proportions. Parama Purus&#x301;a, seeing the degree of our devotion, will have to take us to Himself &ndash; success is surely ours.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Yes, satsaun&#x32D;ga, I am coming to that now. Sat means &ldquo;Truth&rdquo;, that which is unchangeable, the Absolute. Only He is unchanging, so He alone is Truth. Saun&#x32D;ga means &ldquo;company&rdquo;. So satsaun&#x32D;ga means &ldquo;the company of Parama Purus&#x301;a&rdquo;. But a second meaning is also there. This term is also used to describe the company of good people. The first is internal, the second external. As we said above, internal satsaun&#x32D;ga is given through our growing love for Him, and this, if the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; be done faithfully, is an eternal satsaun&#x32D;ga. But external satsaun&#x32D;ga must be sought out by us, by our careful choosing of the company we need. Time spent with others who are also actively seeking His internal [satsaun&#x32D;ga], will give very much momentum to your own sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Of course your own ideation is of great importance here. &ldquo;When a pickpocket sees a saint, he sees only pockets.&rdquo; But together with the internal longing, the external presence [of spiritual people], aided by the natural attraction He has for all of His creation, will no doubt lead us to our Self-realization. Then we will be called guha&#x301;n, &ldquo;one who dwells in the cave of his own heart, the cave of God&rdquo;. So a good person in good company has in fact already achieved Him. He or she just has not let it be known yet.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_title>The Four Stages of Meditation</div>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="29..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The first stage of meditation is the stage of difficulty. All the activities of the mind are directed towards the citta, the crudest layer of the mind. The meditator has many difficulties, both inside and outside. The meditator feels internal difficulties because his or her uncontrolled thoughts are racing about like wild animals. One gets a few seconds of control over one&#146;s thoughts, and then they go rushing off again, dashing about like untrained horses. There are many external obstacles also, because the beginner&#146;s friends and relatives may oppose his or her meditation. They are afraid the person will become detached from the world and his or her family and friends and leave them and become a monk or nun. So these internal distractions and external pressures test the patience and determination of the person beginning spiritual practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The second stage is the beginning of success. All the mental activities are now directed towards the aham, the next higher layer of the mind. This is a much less difficult stage, and sometimes it is very pleasant. The thoughts which were like wild horses before have been trained to some extent. Occasionally, and for brief periods of time, the mind is controlled. During this time the meditator enjoys a taste of spiritual ecstasy and bliss, and tears of happiness may roll down his or her cheeks. In this stage also, the external pressures are reduced, since the person&#146;s friends and relatives realize they cannot discourage the person from meditating, and finally accept his or her spiritual practices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The third stage is the stage where some mental and spiritual powers develop. [All the mental activities are now directed toward the mahat, the highest layer of the mind.] In this stage the meditator gets control over his or her mind and some of his or her sense or motor organs, and this control gives the person some mental or supernatural power. This is a sign of great progress, a great step forward, but it is a very dangerous stage also. The meditator may become intoxicated by the new power of his or her mind, and may be tempted to abuse it (use it wrongly). Someone may anger the person and provoke that person into using his or her power wrongly, and this will bring about the person&#146;s spiritual downfall. The misuse of any kind of power is bad; even misuse of physical, worldly, power brings about one&#146;s downfall and degradation. Power corrupts its owner, and absolute power corrupts a person absolutely, unless there is also some strength to control the power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The meditator should pray for Supreme Consciousness Himself and nothing else. Meditators should not ask for worldly power, even if by their meditation they develop the strength to control that power. If Supreme Consciousness is so powerful that He can grant worldly power and the spiritual strength to control that power, why not pray for Supreme Consciousness Himself? Spiritual powers may be pleasing to some people, but actually they are just what the meditator is due to receive, coming in another form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There is an interesting story to illustrate this. Once a magical dried hand of a monkey was given to a spiritual aspirant, as a boon (spiritual gift) for his good deeds. This hand would fulfil three wishes. For his first wish, the man asked for a fortune of fifty thousand dollars &ndash; and suddenly there was a knock on the door. A man appeared with the money! The man and his wife were overjoyed! But then they found out that the money was the insurance payment on their only son who had suddenly died in an accident. The man was very clever, and so with his second wish he asked that his son be [brought back to him]. There was a clattering sound at the door. The man opened the door, and there stood the skeleton of his son, tapping at the door! The man was terrified, and grabbed the monkey&#146;s paw and shouted at it to drive the skeleton away. The skeleton disappeared &ndash; but the third and last wish was finished and the power of the hand was exhausted. The man had received fifty thousand dollars, but he had lost his son.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The fourth and last stage of meditation is when all the mental activities are directed from the mahat, the highest, purest and most subtle layer of mind, to the Supreme Consciousness within. In this stage the meditator realizes his or her true self, and merges his or her individual mind into the infinite ocean of bliss, Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The topic of discussion is dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. What is dharma? What is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? Dharma means &ldquo;nature&rdquo;. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; means &ldquo;to complete the journey&rdquo;. Each and every being which has been created in this universe has to complete its journey. Every [ion], every cell, every being which is born will have to complete its journey, because there is an ever-increasing attraction between the unit and the Cosmic, between the jiiva and God. This continuous journey has been going on since the creation of this universe. Whether you like it or not, still you have to continue the journey. To continue this journey is known as dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->We are all born in this universe. We are all grateful to the Almighty, because He has given us the chance to know Him, to realize our nature. That is the course of our journey. How can we forget the path? The path of knowing Him is so beautiful. It is not only for us, it is for animals also; they are also proceeding on the path. None of them are left behind.  Each one of us is moving towards that supreme nature according to our individual dharma, according to our individual nature. Each one of us is motivated by our sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, our reactive momenta. Every human being is being subjected to the reactions of his or her actions.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.30.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#30.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->So sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra is motivating you, is propelling you towards or away from Him. If you forget the true nature of yourself then you are being propelled away from the Supreme Entity, from the Divine Being. But if  you follow your nature then you are being propelled [towards] the Supreme Entity. It is up to you to select which path you want to go. The selection depends completely on you; but this is not the case for animals. Animals do not have the developed ego, whereas you have the total ego. [You know what you should do; still you do not always do it.] Your dharma, your nature (in Sanskrit dharma means &ldquo;to hold, to uphold&rdquo;) is to know that Supreme Entity. That is the nature of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So today [your] nature is not being upheld properly. You are not following yourself; you are not following your true nature. There are two aspects of your nature: one which is not relevant and one which is relevant. The one which is not relevant is the nature of animals. [We have all evolved out  of that.] We are all [possessed of] animal qualities. But that does not mean you have to follow that animal dharma; you do not have to. Even though you have come from that, you have to overcome that animal tendency. Eating, sleeping &ndash; all these qualities are there in the human being; they are not to be discarded, but to be overcome. We have got to overcome them by our true nature. Our true nature is to know ourselves thoroughly, to know who we are, where we have come from. So we need to have that energy. We need to have that momentum to know Him; that is known as sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;; that is known as intuitional practice &ndash; the intuitional practice or the meditation which gives you the momentum, the spiritual momentum, you need to go towards that Supreme Entity. First of all we all have got to know [our] dharma; [our] basic nature is important. You have to know your true nature. Once you [know] it, once you know the true nature of yourself, then you want to perform your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;; then you want to perform your spiritual practices. It is because you do not know your nature that you do not do your spiritual practices. Once you start knowing your nature, once you start knowing your dharma, then you will never stop performing your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. [Then you will have] to fulfil your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; because you know what you are, you know what you want to do, you know what you want to become. Becoming and knowing is an important part of the human being. First of all know; know what you want to do. Once you have known about what you have to become, then you will become what you want to become.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[You are being propelled] now by your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is an important aspect of human [existence]. But dharma is that which protects your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Without dharma there is no sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, without sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; there is no dharma. The two are interdependent. They move together. So you have to be a dha&#x301;rmika. You have to follow your true nature. By following your true nature you become a true spiritual aspirant. By becoming a true spiritual aspirant you know God in yourself. You know that truth in yourself. That is what your life is to be.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It is truth that is going to save you. It  is not untruth that is going to save you. Truth alone will live. In Sanskrit we say Satyameva jayate &ndash; &ldquo;Truth alone will be victorious.&rdquo; Truth is begotten only through dharma. [Where there is] lack of dharma there is no truth. Where there is no truth there is no victory. So the victory of all human beings is possible only through dharma, only through spiritual practices. It is our duty to perform dharma. It is our duty to perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. It is your duty to inspire yourself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Inspiration comes from inside. [Sometimes] we need inspiration from outside; but that inspiration is not lasting. It is momentary. But in order to inspire yourself you have got to know yourself; by knowing yourself you are inspired always. Inspiration from inside will stand for all time; it will inspire you for all time. That alone is going to help you. And by inspiring yourself you are inspiring others. So be an example. Be a true aspirant by becoming yourself what you are; [and by becoming what you are,] you show others what they have to be. So in order to know everything you know one thing. That one thing is dharma. That one thing is the supreme truth, and that truth is hiding in your heart. You have got to know that truth inside yourself. That is why sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; has to be performed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In order to perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you have to observe moral precepts. Without morality, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is [impossible]. Morality is given to you; it is for you to follow; it is up to you to follow; by observing morality, you follow dharma. By following dharma you practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. By practising sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you know yourself totally. The purpose of all creation, the purpose of all human beings, is to know what we are; that is why we are all born in this world. The very purpose of our human existence is to know what we are. There is no other purpose in this universe &ndash; remember this point.  Remember always that the very purpose of our creation is to know Him, the [Supreme] Entity which is in front of you all the time &ndash; even if you forget many times because we are not following our true nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Having forgotten our true nature, we have strayed away from the path. So we have got to know our nature. We have got to know that inner self. Knowing one&#146;s self is the true dharma, our true nature. The inspiration comes from inside, it comes always. So do your spiritual practices. Observe the moral principles. Become yourself an example; and that is possible by doing your spiritual practices in a regular manner, in a regular way. That is why you are all here today. The very purpose of your presence, the very purpose of your action, is to know yourself; is to inspire yourself all the time by your internal entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->You cannot be inspired by others all the time, you have got to be inspired by yourself. That means you have to follow dharma; you have to follow the path. Because He is always inside of you; He is always outside of you also. The Supreme Truth is hiding; you are chasing Him and He is hiding behind you. And again you are chasing Him and again He is hiding. It is like a hide-and-seek game. And He is happy about that. You are chasing Him and chasing Him and chasing Him and He is hiding [from] you, and you want to chase Him again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->He is like the mother and the baby. The mother hides behind the door and the baby wants to know &ldquo;Where is my mother?&rdquo; And the baby chases the mother; the mother again goes back behind the door. The baby wants to know where the mother is; the baby cries a little bit; the mother shouts, &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; [and] the baby is laughing. This is the same game He is playing with all of us. He is hiding inside your heart. You open your heart and then you know Him.  Again He wants to hide. He hides a little bit; now you open your heart still more. So you are to go on opening your window, go on opening your mind, more and more, then you will know Him totally. So in order to open yourself up, the only way is to know your nature, is to know your dharma. To know your dharma, to know your nature, thoroughly, you have got to perform your spiritual practices. There is no second way. There is no second path for a human being. Spiritual practices alone are going to help you, nothing else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In order to perform spiritual practices you have to follow everything [given by your preceptor]. So try to follow all you have been asked to and try to follow all the disciplines which you need to. Then you will know Him. By knowing Him you will know dharma. By becoming one with dharma you will have completed the true journey of your life. The true journey is completed by knowing Him thoroughly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So know Him today, not tomorrow. This day is the most beautiful day. This day has been opened to you; opened to all human beings on this planet. No one has been deprived. Everyone has been given the chance  equally. No one can say tomorrow, &ldquo;Oh Lord, You gave a chance only to that person, not to me.&rdquo; No one is higher, no one is lower. All are equal in the eyes of God. No one is deprived; everyone has been given the opportunity to know Him. So it is for us to grab the opportunity and try to become one in Him. That is why we are all here today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So the very purpose of our human creation is to follow the true dharma; is to maintain spiritual practices in this very life, and to become one in Him. So dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;  [means that] by following dharma we follow our sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, we follow our spiritual practices. By following the spiritual practices we become one with Him. That is the final victory. That is the final goal of all human beings on this planet. Men, women, everyone, we are all marching towards that unique goal. That goal has to be realized. In order to realize the goal, you have to continue your spiritual practices. You should practise what you have been asked to. So do not forget your nature. Do not try to follow animal nature. [But at the same time] you have got to eat, you have got to sleep; that is [your] nature too. Having proper restraint over your animal nature, try to follow the true human nature; the true human nature is to know yourself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->So from this day you have been given the chance. Do not waste your time anymore. Do not waste your life anymore. Take it, this opportunity, and try to know that Supreme Consciousness which is in hiding. By knowing Him you know the whole universe; you know everything. That is the final goal of all of us. So dharma has to be practised in human life. Not tomorrow &ndash; today. Whether you are a family person or [a single] person, everyone will have to perform dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Dharma has to be performed; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; has to be performed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->We have been graced by Him. Grace has been showering on you. It is like a continuous rain that He has been showering on you. In order to feel His Grace,  you have to remove the little bit of ego which is unnecessarily covering your head like an umbrella. It is your duty to punch a hole in the umbrella. Punch it with courage. Make many holes in the umbrella; then you will be drenched by the rain of His grace. Once you realize His grace, then you are in Him, you are totally absorbed in Him, you have become one with Him. That is a total victory. That is the final victory for all of us.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->And let His Grace be always with you, because He loves [all] His sons and daughters equally. His love is perennial. It is always there. It is for you to tap His love. It is up to you because the chance has been given to you. Now it is for you to realize that and open everything. Then you will be able to enjoy the complete love and devotion which has been showering on you for time eternal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So do not forget your life; do not forget the path; the path is very noble, very beautiful, and it is for you to know that, it is for you to realize that, so do it from today. Do not leave it for tomorrow, tomorrow may not come for you. Who knows? The sun may not rise for you tomorrow. No one can say who is going to live from today till tomorrow. It is up to Him to decide. So as long as we are here today, let us try to take [advantage] of this opportunity and do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and follow dharma; thereby you will know Him, [you will complete] the beautiful journey of knowing Him. So let us know Him today. In this way we will be able to provide paths for human beings to come. Animals also are marching ahead to know that Supreme Entity. So it is our duty to make the way, to pave the way, in order for everyone to come on this path. Realize Him. Realize that Supreme Being within you. This is your dharma, this is your path; and let this path be yours, and victory will surely be yours.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Those who have attained this superconscious level of awareness develop the true discrimination, the ability to transcend the illusion of life and discern the eternal which underlies all the changing forms. The result of true discrimination is vaera&#x301;gya [non-attachment]. Those who are established in non-attachment realize that everything of this universe is the manifestation of the Supreme. They cannot hate or neglect anything of this universe. The universe is changeable, while Supreme Consciousness is unchangeable, true and absolute. But non-attachment does not mean to leave all pleasures and remain in a state of indifference to the world. It does not mean to leave everything and go to the seclusion of a mountain cave. Those who are truly non-attached do not deny the world (worldly life), they embrace it, for they feel the touch of the eternal hidden within all the changing forms of their lives. They are with everything. They are paramaham&#x301;sa.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.31.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#31.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>

It is the third stage of the superconscious mind. One who experiences this stage of mind reaches very near the Infinite Self within, and such a person&#146;s desire for supreme union becomes unbearable. Such a person has an intense desire for God. In this stage of mind there is a complete reflection of Supreme Consciousness. When the spiritual aspirant reaches this stage of mind, his or her mind becomes one with that subtle causal mind, and as a result his or her mind becomes one with the Supreme [or Cosmic] Mind and becomes an all-knowing mind. Then the person becomes an all-knowing personality and attains complete spiritual awareness. The person experiences a divine current of the supreme happiness. He or she attains the fullest expression of humanity: divinity. This is the aim of life. One can reach this stage of mind through dhya&#x301;na [meditation in which the psyche is directed towards Consciousness]. Beyond this fifth layer of mind, there is Supreme Consciousness, the Supreme Spirit, the absolute reality, where all logics and reasonings and conflicts of the lower mind are dissolved and everything becomes one. Be spiritually aware; be great by your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, by your service and by your sacrifice. Be as great as He (the Supreme Entity).<!-- /block --></p>

(Your first movement is your physical movement, the movement of the nerve fibres, of the nerve cells. The second movement is your psychic movement.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->(3) The third movement is your psycho-spiritual movement, that begins in the psychic sphere and moves toward the spiritual self.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->[(4) And the fourth movement is spiritual movement.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Regarding psychic movement and psychic progress, this psychic movement is not only a movement of human beings but a movement of all living beings, of all animals and of all plants which move psychically. In this psychic movement, human minds can move from one point to another, one projection converted into another projection, one psychic matrix transmuted into another matrix or matrices. In the case of plants, however, this psychic movement is nothing but inborn instinct. In the case of [un]developed animals also, the movement is nothing but inborn instinct. They move by instinct, there is no autonomous thinking. In the case of [under]developed animals, there is a small touch of autonomous thought; in the case of humans, they can think anything and everything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->This is the speciality of human beings &ndash; autonomous thinking. And when this is strangled, impeded or restrained by something internal or external, the impeding entity is a dangerous entity for human progress. When human psychic growth is stopped in this way, the restriction that has impeded human ideas or thinking or human projections can be called dogma. The progress of human society must be always free from all types of dogmas; otherwise human progress will move forever backwards. Human progress will be blocked forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The third human progress, as mentioned, is psycho-spiritual progress. What is psycho-spiritual progress? We obtain pleasure from our spiritual progress or through our psychic approximations or through different types of psychic projections, either internal or external. Depending on the subtleness of the object of projection, the more blissful or happy one will be. In this way, each and every human being must strive for this psycho-spiritual progress. This is the special realm of human beings. No animal can make this psycho-spiritual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->But the best progress is spiritual progress. When the psychic body of the intellectual person directs itself towards this spiritual progress, this summit, this goal of human propensities; when it marches towards knowledge and finally becomes one with the highest wisdom within the kingdom of eternal knowledge;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.32.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#32.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> this is spiritual progress. A spiritual aspirant must always remember that within himself or herself there is a happy blending of progress in all the four spheres: physical, psychic, psycho-spiritual and spiritual.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Recently I said, perhaps in Israel or in Turkey, that among these four types of progress, the physical and the psychic are objective in nature and the psycho-spiritual and spiritual are subjective in nature. That is, in human beings there are two important options of progress: the objective and the subjective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In this world, you require food, medicine, shelter, education and so many other things; a healthy economic structure, a life free from exploitation; things for the healthy maintenance of your physical body and to maintain the proper order of the objective level. You cannot ignore, you cannot deny, your necessities. You should carry out your duty in this objective sphere, and at the same time you must not forget that you are a glorified human being. You have to elevate yourself to the excellence of human glory, to the greatness of humanity. In this way, your progress in the psycho-spiritual sphere must go forward without barriers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In this kingdom of psycho-spiritual movement, human beings cannot tolerate any barriers. Also you should remember that your original source is the Supreme Father. He is the Causal Matrix, the Supreme Origin, the culminating point of all your movements.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->In this way all your energies, all your tendencies, must be goaded towards that Supreme Entity, Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Father, who created everything. Therefore I must say that yours should be a happy blending of objective and subjective worlds. Ours is a subjective approach with objective adjustment, towards the subjective goal of the Supreme. This is the blissful blending of the objective and subjective worlds. If this blissful blending is achieved, a human society will be created. There is no alternative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->A subjective approach is the important question, but while you move towards the subjective end, you must maintain an adjustment with the objective world. There is no alternative. And this goal, when human society will be established in this supreme idea in the very near future, will produce a more constructive human society according to a plan.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.32.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#32.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The humanity of the universe will unite; and we await anxiously that happy moment.<!-- /block --></p>
