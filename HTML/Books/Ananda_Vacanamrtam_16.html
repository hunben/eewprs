<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Shreya&#x301;n svadharmo vigun&#x301;ah paradharma&#x301;t svanus&#x301;t&#x301;hita&#x301;t;<br>Svadharme nidhanam&#x301; shreyah paradharmo bhaya&#x301;vahah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[It is better to follow one&#146;s own human dharma, even if it lacks in some qualities, than to follow the dharmas of other beings. It is better to die as a human being than to live as an animal.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What exactly is meant by svadharma? Since the Giita&#x301; speaks of it, it must have a special meaning. The term is highly significant because it has been said regarding the Giita&#x301;, Ya&#x301; Bhagavata&#x301; giita&#x301; sa&#x301; Giita&#x301; &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Whatever has been sung or said by Bhagava&#x301;n Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Himself is considered as the Giita&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Svadharma means &ldquo;one&#146;s own dharma&rdquo;. But what exactly does the term dharma mean? Dharma is derived from the root verb dhr plus man. It means &ldquo;that which provides support to the inner qualities, the intrinsic traits&rdquo;. In other words, that which provides support to the essential qualities and the specific traits of an entity is dharma. Every object in this manifest world has its own dharma. For instance, water has its own dharma; fire has its own dharma; oxygen and nitrogen also have their own respective dharmas. And it is by virtue of their dharmas that different objects can be distinguished from one another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If an object loses its capacity to burn, it can no longer be called fire. Similarly, if the thirst-quenching property is absent in an object, it is not water. Each elemental object carries its own identity through its dharma. We can recognize and identify an object with the help of its qualities and external traits. Thus svadharma means one&#146;s essential nature, own traits.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->It has been said in connection with the explanation of dharma: Dhriyate dharma itya&#x301;huh sa devah Paramah Prabhuh &ndash; &ldquo;Whatever maintains its hold over other entities and sustains the existential structure of those entities is called dharma. This dharma is the highest goal of all living beings.&rdquo; So under no circumstances should one&#146;s own dharma be discarded. Wherever the question of dharma is concerned, no compromise should be made with anything that goes against dharma. To move ahead with undaunted spirit to the final destination, the Supreme Goal, is human dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->As stated earlier, each and every being of the universe has its own dharma. Even trees and creepers have their own dharmas. The dharma of trees and creepers is to seek certain goals, that is, to collect nourishment, to develop physically, to multiply through seeds and saplings, and then to get lost in the abyss of darkness so as to be born again. The life of animals is similar; the only difference is that animals are a little more developed than trees and creepers. They have one additional quality or trait, and that additional quality is the ability to move from one place to another. Plants cannot make such movements. So plants and animals have some common qualities, but animals have an extra quality, that they can move. That is why animals are said to be movable, while trees and plants are immovable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->What is meant by the dharma of human beings? One dharma of humans is jaeva dharma [the dharma of living beings], which plants, animals and humans, all three, all have in common. As animals, humans also have another quality, namely their movement from one place to another. This quality is also one of their traits. It is a dharma that they share with [animals]; but the dharma that human beings have in addition to this is their Bha&#x301;gavata dharma. The life of animals and plants is wholly given to their senses. They have nothing beyond their physical needs and comforts. But some human beings are conscious of having one more dharma &ndash; Bha&#x301;gavata dharma. The basic idea or controlling idea of human beings&#146; Bha&#x301;gavata dharma is that they will move ceaselessly and uncompromisingly towards the highest ideal, towards Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Humans&#146; future is always bright. Never is it clouded with darkness. Because human beings&#146; guide is the most radiant and most brilliant Entity in the universe, and the final goal of their life&#146;s journey.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Being, the most effulgent Entity, is always present before you. Hence the future of anyone, whether sinful or virtuous, is always bright. One&#146;s future can never be bleak. Hence people should continue to move without pause  towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, maintaining a little adjustment with the jaeva dharma or animal dharma in them &ndash; this is human dharma. People have a physical life and also a mental life, but their speciality is their tireless movement towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is exactly what the Giita&#x301; wants to convey by saying that Bha&#x301;gavata dharma is the svadharma of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the Giita&#x301; it has been said, Shreya&#x301;n svadharmo vigun&#x301;ah, meaning that &ldquo;one&#146;s own dharma [is right] even if it is lacking in some gun&#x301;as [qualities].&rdquo; The word gun&#x301;a means a binding rope. In fact the individual qualities or attributes that all beings possess are their binding characteristics. Every entity, animate or inanimate, possesses certain characteristic qualities. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the original source of all these qualities. But He Himself is gun&#x301;atiita [beyond all qualities]. There is no power that can bind Him in the bondages of gun&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Prabhumiishamaniishamashes&#x301;agun&#x301;am&#x301; gun&#x301;ahiinamaheshagan&#x301;a&#x301;bharan&#x301;am &ndash; &ldquo;O Lord, You are the Supreme Lord of all beings, the final controller of all manifestations and creations. But there is no  being that can control your movement or course of action. Your capabilities are infinite, but if anyone tries to count those infinite qualities, they will never finish counting. You are greater than the great, higher than the high, and still more powerful than the most powerful. No one can plumb the depth of Your being. Your personality is boundless and unfathomable. Your countless qualities defy all measurement.&rdquo; That is why He is said to possess infinite qualities. &ldquo;So there is no other alternative but to call You quality-less.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The poet Padmadanta, when asked to write a eulogy on Parama Purus&#x301;a, wrote:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..17"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In order to write anything, paper, pen and ink are essential. Moreover, a competent writer is also needed. These days, many people use fountain pens, but in just the recent past, ink tablets were available in the market. These tablets were dissolved in water to produce ink. &ldquo;To enumerate the qualities of Parama Purus&#x301;a, an ink tablet the size of the Himalayas will be needed. No tablet smaller than the Himalayas will do. Not only that. For writing you need an ink-pot to contain the liquid ink. Now, even if the vast ocean be the ink-pot, it will never be possible to enumerate the infinite qualities of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The next thing you need is a pen&#8230;&rdquo; Surataruvarasha&#x301;kha&#x301; lekhanii &ndash; that is, &ldquo;only the trunk of the Pa&#x301;rija&#x301;ta tree in the Nandan Ka&#x301;nan of Indra, the king of the gods, will serve as a pen.&rdquo; &ldquo;And lastly, only the entire lithosphere of the earth can serve as paper.&rdquo; But who will write, after all? Who will do the job of writing? Likhati yadi Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; svarvaka&#x301;lam&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;if the mythological goddess of learning, Sarasvatii, starts writing and goes on ceaselessly&rdquo; &ndash; tatha&#x301;pi tava gun&#x301;a&#x301;na&#x301;miisha pa&#x301;ram&#x301; na ya&#x301;ti &ndash; &ldquo;even if all these things are done, the qualities of Parama Purus&#x301;a can never be fully described.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Bha&#x301;gavata dharma is the dharma of human beings &ndash; the human svadharma. I would not call either Hindu Dharma or Islamic Dharma or Christian Dharma real dharma, but only reflections of dharma.

<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The word bhaga plus the suffix matup gives us bhagavata; and the first person singular form of bhagavata is bhagava&#x301;n. What does the word bhaga mean?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->[Bhaga is a collection of six attributes: aeshvarya, viirya, yasha, shrii, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and vaera&#x301;gya.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The word bhaga implies six divine powers or abilities, or a collection of six kinds of Tantric powers or manifestations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The first one is aeshvarya. This aeshvarya in turn includes eight occult powers &ndash; anima&#x301;, laghima&#x301;, mahima&#x301;, pra&#x301;pti, pra&#x301;ka&#x301;mya, iishitva, vashitva and antarya&#x301;mitva. Thus aeshvarya is an occult power acquired through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Through regular practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, these eight powers can be attained. The being who possesses these eight powers is called Iishvara. In other words, Iishvara means the lord of these eight sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;-acquired powers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Together with aeshvarya comes commanding authority, viirya. An impressive personality is necessary in order to perform benevolent deeds. This is the second bhaga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Then comes yashah (fame) which is of two types, positive and negative, yasha and apayasha. The virtuous people sided with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, while the evil ones joined hands with Kansa. That is, society became polarized at that time. Some people ardently sang His praises, while others became His fierce antagonists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Next comes shrii. The real meaning of shrii is &ldquo;charm&rdquo; or &ldquo;fascination&rdquo;. In other words, one will possess irresistible attractive charm. The word shrii, however, has other connotations also. It is a combination of three letters &ndash; sha, ra, ii. Sha represents rajogun&#x301;a; ra is the acoustic root of energy. A person who possesses this ra, that is, who is vigorously active; and who at the same time is under the dynamic influence of rajogun&#x301;a [i.e., possesses sha]; is sha + ra = shra which, when ii is added to it, becomes shrii in feminine form. One of the charms of life is this shrii. That is why since ancient days, the practice of using the word shrii before one&#146;s name has been a custom in India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Then comes jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. The word jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is derived from the root verb jin&#x32D;a&#x301; plus the suffix anat&#x301;. The subjectivization of external objectivity is called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. The world of objectivity is external only to the microcosmic mind; to the Macrocosmic Mind there is no external world. Because whatever exists, exists within His mind. Hence for Parama Purus&#x301;a everything is but His own Self. But for the microcosmic mind, this subjectivo-objectivated mind is transformed into subjectivized mind, and in a subsequent stage the subjectivized mind becomes subjectivity. And in the final stage, this very subjective mind becomes merged in Parama Purus&#x301;a and becomes one with Him. This is called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nakriya&#x301; [cognitive activity]. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is the fifth bhaga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The sixth is vaera&#x301;gya. Vi &ndash; ran&#x301;j + ghain&#x32D; = vira&#x301;ga; and vaera&#x301;gya is derived from vira&#x301;ga. The root verb ran&#x301;j means &ldquo;to colour&rdquo; something. When a person is not affected or swayed by the colour of any object whatsoever of the world, that person is said to have attained vaera&#x301;gya. He or she moves among various colours, yet no colour of any object can spread its influence over the person&#146;s mind. This is vaera&#x301;gya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->This world, the creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a, is full of colourful variegation. But He Himself is a colourless Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..31"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->S&#x301;a eko&#146;varn&#x301;o bahudha&#x301;shaktiyoga&#x301;d varn&#x301;a&#x301;naneka&#x301;n nihita&#x301;rtho dadha&#x301;ti;<br>Vi caeti ca&#x301;nte vishvama&#x301;dao sa Devah sa no buddhya&#x301; shubhaya&#x301; sam&#x301;yunaktu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..32"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->[The Entity who is one and without a second, and one without any colours; who has created the colourful quinquelemental world for reasons unknown with the help of His many powers; in whom this entire universe dissolves; is no other than Parama Purus&#x301;a. Let that Entity guide our intellect along the path of supreme righteousness.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->So vaera&#x301;gya is the sixth bhaga, The collection of these six attributes is called bhaga; and one who possesses bhaga is bhagava&#x301;n. The word bhagava&#x301;n is the first person singular form of bhagavata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Hence it is evident that Bha&#x301;gavata dharma is really ma&#x301;nava dharma [human dharma]. For each human being this is his or her svadharma [individual dharma]. Shreya&#x301;n svadharmo vigun&#x301;ah &ndash; &ldquo;Even if one&#146;s svadharma is vigun&#x301;ah &ndash; even if one&#146;s svadharma is without qualities &ndash; it is beneficial.&rdquo; You know that svadharma is in fact quality-less, because Bha&#x301;gavata dharma is outside the jurisdiction of qualities. Hence svadharma must also necessarily be without qualities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The word vigun&#x301;a can be interpreted in two ways: (1) &ldquo;that which remains after qualities have been removed&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;something that has become quality-less&rdquo;; or (2) (where vigun&#x301;a means a special gun&#x301;a) &ldquo;any object that possesses a special gun&#x301;a [quality]&rdquo;. Another such word is vilaks&#x301;ana, which can mean either &ldquo;one whose mark of identity is no longer present&rdquo; or &ldquo;one having a special mark of identity&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->So far we have been speaking about svadharma. Now comes the question of paradharma, the dharma of other beings. Paradharma means the dharma of trees and plants, of animals &ndash; but not at all the dharma of human beings. The shloka [couplet] from the Giita&#x301; says that paradharma, however pleasant or comfortable, is not beneficial at all. Rather, svadharme nidhanam&#x301; shreyah &ndash; &ldquo;even if you meet death following your own dharma, Bha&#x301;gavata dharma, that will be more beneficial.&rdquo; Human beings must live like human beings and human beings must die like human beings &ndash; not like undeveloped entities such as plants and animals. In no way should people surrender at the altar of animal dharma or plant dharma, but should stick to ma&#x301;nava dharma, to Bha&#x301;gavata dharma, even if that results in death. This is the essence of the shloka.<!-- /block --></p>

The word jagat [&ldquo;universe&rdquo;, &ldquo;creation&rdquo;] is derived from the root verb gam + kvip. Gam means &ldquo;to move on&rdquo;. The creation is called jagat because to move on is its nature. Out of the vast Macrocosmic Mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a has the physical world been born, and even the mind of the living being has come out of it. The Macrocosmic Mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a can be compared only with the ocean. The mind of a human being is just a small drop in that vast Mind. Or if the Cosmic Mind is a fire, then the human mind is a mere spark.<!-- /block --></p>

Na&#x301;sha [destruction] alone would leave the sinners a chance to regain fresh energy to torment the virtuous; but vina&#x301;sha [total annihilation] will leave no such scope for the sinners to rear their heads.

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You must have noticed that people in general suffer from various complexes. There are some people who are victims of a complex concerning their wealth, physical strength, or worldly success. That is known as a superiority complex. But the majority of people suffer from what is known as an inferiority complex &ndash; to think of oneself as inferior to, or as lesser than, other persons.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Physically-weak persons have one type of complex, while educated persons have another type. The poor have yet another type of complex. The attitude of the poor is like this: &ldquo;We are poor and downtrodden, how can we stand before the rich?&rdquo; People with little education think: &ldquo;We are not properly educated; how can we go before people who are highly educated and great scholars?&rdquo; All these are complexes of the mind. Some people have fear complexes. They think: &ldquo;Oh, what will happen next&#8230; what will happen next&#8230; I wonder what is going to happen next.&rdquo; This is nothing but a fear complex. Other people suffer from a defeatist complex. They think: &ldquo;I am sure to lose. I have no chance of success.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What does Shiva have to say in this context? He says that a sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual aspirant] should maintain his or her samatabha&#x301;va &ndash; what in English is called a &ldquo;balanced mind&rdquo;. Equanimity of mind should be maintained. Mental balance is natural, while a complex is unnatural. Suppose someone is proud of his or her riches &ndash; &ldquo;We are a rich lot&rdquo; &ndash; this sort of superiority complex is playing in their minds. But just think, how long is such affluence and pride going to last? Their wealth may slip from their hand at any moment. They will then become as poor as everyone else. Just imagine their position now, before those persons to whom they used to boast of their riches in the past!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->People must always bear in mind that &ldquo;Whatever I have acquired is all by the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. If He decides that I should not possess wealth, He will take it away at any moment He wishes.&rdquo; So no one should feel pride about anything under any circumstances.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Yet if one must feel proud, then perhaps one kind of pride may be cherished, and that is that &ldquo;I am the child of Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; Who is the source of all the wealth and prosperity of the world? What is the final cause of all these things? It is Parama Purus&#x301;a. &ldquo;I am the son or daughter of Parama Purus&#x301;a, who owns everything.&rdquo; This is the best kind of pride. Other than this, there is nothing to be proud of.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->What about the inferiority complex, that makes you think of yourself as inferior to others? You must have noticed that the minds of those who are less educated become a bit diffident: &ldquo;We don&#146;t have much learning.&rdquo; Again, those who are poor suffer from a similar diffidence. &ldquo;We are so poor, and have no one to turn to.&rdquo; But what causes such diffidence? Everyone on this earth is a child of Parama Purus&#x301;a; no one is big or small. All are related as brothers and sisters. As far as castes are concerned, no one is high or low. How can the children of the same Father be of different castes? All people are of the same caste. Everyone is by birth of the same caste as their father.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So keep away from those who discriminate in terms of caste; keep far from the reach of their noose. Why? Because those who believe in caste, do not believe in Parama Purus&#x301;a. If five people are of five different castes, then what is the caste of Parama Purus&#x301;a? Can He be of five castes? No, that is not possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So bear in mind that those who believe in caste, do not have genuine belief in the Supreme Father. How can people of five hundred castes have one and the same father? So I say those who believe in caste, do not believe in the Supreme Father, and those who believe in the Supreme Father do not believe in caste. The scriptures have this to say:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Can&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;lo&#146;pi dvijah shres&#x301;t&#x301;hah haribhaktipara&#x301;yan&#x301;ah;<br>Haribhaktivihiinashca vipro&#146;pi svapaca&#x301;dhamah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Even those who are popularly known as can&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;las [the lowest caste], can be superior to Brahmans if devotion to Hari [the Lord] is present in them, if they have deep love for Parama Purus&#x301;a. If, on the other hand, a Brahman has no devotion to Hari, that person is indeed lower than the lowest, in spite of having been born into a high family.&rdquo; This mental balance is very important.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->There is another type of complex in people, and that is known as a &ldquo;sinning complex&rdquo;. &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner; I have committed such-and-such sinful acts; Parama Purus&#x301;a must know that; I should not have done such things; if I go before Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> he may rebuke me severely. How can I go and stand before him?&rdquo; &ndash; such are the thoughts that pass through the person&#146;s mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->One thing all of you should remember. Moral judgement regarding virtue and vice takes place only in the material world. People hate a sinner; and perhaps they should. Similarly, if someone performs a virtuous deed, people regard the person highly. That also they should. But to the Supreme Father is there any distinction between a sinner and a virtuous person? All these are concerns of the mundane world. So far as the Supreme Father is concerned, they are meaningless. Take the case of a child walking on the road. It has a gold necklace round its neck, and costly ornaments decorating other parts of its body. It is such an attractive sight. The father of the child, holding it on his lap, is caressing it. The position of a virtuous person is like this. The &ldquo;ornaments&rdquo; we are speaking of are the person&#146;s virtuous deeds. They are not inseparable parts of the body. They have been earned or acquired from outside. Try to get the point.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->And what is the nature of sin? Suppose again that a child is walking on the road. Suddenly it falls into the gutter. Naturally its arms and legs will be covered with mud. Will the father despise his child in this condition? Other people on the road may be repelled. But what will the father do? He will immediately pull his child out of the drain, wash its arms, legs, and body, take it on his lap, and try to console it: &ldquo;What makes you cry, my child! Everything is okay now. You are all clean now. I&#146;ll dry you off with a towel.&rdquo; The position of those branded by society as sinners is like this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->For Parama Purus&#x301;a no difference exists between virtuous people and sinners. It is true, however, that to the world at large and to society such distinctions do exist. The whole world holds a virtuous person in high regard, and shuns a sinner. This is but natural, so far as society is concerned. But for God it is different. So the thought &ldquo;I am a sinner. How can I show my face to Parama Purus&#x301;a&rdquo; should never be allowed to enter your mind. One may feel shame and shyness before outsiders, but before God the question should never arise. Moreover, one thing of great importance you should always remember &ndash; shyness is a pa&#x301;sha, an external bondage. You will have to fight against that bondage. For this reason, you should always be very vigilant that no complex &ndash; be it superiority or inferiority &ndash; find a place in your mind. What is desirable is that you move ahead with courage, maintaining all the while perfect tranquillity of mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->There are some people in society who think: &ldquo;The spiritual path is thorny; how will it be possible for me to tread that path, since my past life was not that glorious at all!&rdquo; It is not good for anyone to have such a mentality. It is true, however, that sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is a constant struggle against avidya&#x301;. The force that carries people away from Parama Purus&#x301;a is called avidya&#x301; shakti. Undoubtedly avidya&#x301; shakti is very powerful. If any so-called sinner thinks, &ldquo;How can I fight against this formidably powerful avidya&#x301; shakti?&rdquo; my advice will be, no such thought should ever be entertained. Think of a person who is not a sinner, but a very good person. Is it possible for such a person to fight against this powerful avidya&#x301;? No, not even for that person is such a struggle possible. That person is also an ordinary human, like you. Yes, it is understandable that to fight against avidya&#x301; is extremely difficult for a sinner, but is it easy for a virtuous person? No, not at all. Avidya&#x301; is very powerful. How can a weak human being fight against it? One cannot.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->So you see, virtuous people and sinners are equal from this point of view. But from this point of view, whether a person is virtuous or a sinner, the person is a human being after all, and as such a child of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence no one should lose heart, nor feel afraid, under any circumstances. Because one whose mind is fixed on Parama Purus&#x301;a is gradually moving nearer and nearer to Parama Purus&#x301;a. They are moving gradually nearer and nearer to Parama Purus&#x301;a, which means that are gradually drawing more and more energy from Parama Purus&#x301;a. How then can one remain weak? With the strength of Parama Purus&#x301;a, they will gradually become strong.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->It is true that avidya&#x301; is extremely powerful. But remember, whose power is that power of avidya&#x301;? It has not come from any mysterious place. Avidya&#x301; shakti is actually the shakti of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Shakti Sa&#x301; Shivasya shaktih.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Avidya&#x301; shakti is under the control of Parama Purus&#x301;a. If you can give yourself in deep love to Parama Purus&#x301;a, then avidya&#x301; will begin to be afraid of you. Avidya&#x301; will realize that you are not inferior to her, nor are you an ordinary being. Moreover, knowing that you are closely related to Parama Purus&#x301;a in love, she will say: &ldquo;I will not go near that person.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Api cet sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ro bhajate Ma&#x301;mananyabha&#x301;k;<br>So&#146;pi pa&#x301;pavinirmuktah mucyate bhavabandhana&#x301;t.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[If even the most wicked people worship Me with a concentrated mind, I will liberate them from the three bondages (physical, psychic and spiritual).]<!-- /block --></p>

A person whose conduct is despicable, from the social standpoint, is called a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii; and when the person&#146;s behaviour is so bad that even the dura&#x301;ca&#x301;riis despise that person as a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii, that person is called a sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii. Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a says: &ldquo;If even a sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii worships Me with undivided devotion, worships Me with deep love and devotion, I will certainly liberate such a person from his or her earthly bondages. Hence there is no reason for anybody to get perturbed under any circumstances. There is nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo; For one who has reached the shelter of Parama Purus&#x301;a, victory is certain.<!-- /block --></p>
