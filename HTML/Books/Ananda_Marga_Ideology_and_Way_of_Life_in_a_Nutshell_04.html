<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s discussion will be on &ldquo;Vibration, Form and Colour&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Vibration<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->From where does vibration come? Whenever an action takes place, its character is established by the nature of its waves and these waves are but vibrations, flowing through different channels. The relative transposition of objects is what we call action. And this is why every action has vibrations due to its movement. Just as action is of many varieties, so is vibration. Every action has its own vibrations. The vibrations of two actions are not identical. Had they been so, there would not have been any difference between the two actions. Vibrations occur according to the shock that emanates from a cardinal point, according to the type of action that takes place at that fundamental point. Have you ever thrown a stone into a pond and seen the result? According to the velocity or strength you apply of that stone, its vibrations also differ accordingly in wave-length and character. Here one more thing should be clearly understood and that is that the cause and controller of these vibrations also imbibes vibrations: it is also a vehicle of energy and not an inert, passive entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->I will give you a good example of vibration in human body. Take, for instance, the case of anger. A great impact of a shocking provocation has taken place in your mind, as the result of which a great vibration or agitation has seized a particular portion of your brain. The next moment that agitation runs from your brain to your whole body through your nervous system with lightning speed. Then it can be understood that a paroxysm of rage has taken possession of your mind. As the result of this violent vibration in your nervous system, your face gets red and hot and your hands and feet tremble. None of your sensory or motor organs, particularly your motor organs, can function properly and your words become jumbled. Those who stammer a little in their speech, become conspicuously more stammering. People&#146;s judgment and intelligence with which they keep mean propensities in check, become dulled by the impact of these violent vibrations. A furious man, regardless of place, time and person, resorts to wilful and indiscriminate vituperation. As an aftermath of this excessive physical and cerebral excitement, his brain becomes hot. He cannot think whether for right or wrong. His body and his internal glands begin to feel limp and depressed. His appetite forsakes him. Does it not happen like this?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Since in every action and in every entity there is vibration, human beings receive tanma&#x301;tras (sensible or ultrasensible inferences) with the help of the vibrations emanating from an action as soon as it is performed, or from the presence of an object. Actually these vibrations themselves are tanma&#x301;tras, for they carry the subtle, characteristic essence of an action or object and convey it to the sensory organs. Then again the vibrations of tanma&#x301;tras of a sight or a scene which may sometimes be created by the motor organs, are received by the sensory organs of the perceiver. The various vibrations that we encounter in the world are divisible into five main tanma&#x301;tras: sound, touch, form, taste and smell. We perceive them with the help of our sensory organs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The perception of the difference in tanma&#x301;tras is due to the differences in the vibrations, without the senses of sound, touch, etc. would lose their distinctive features. The vibrational lines in a record are made in a special way. When you bring into play those mute vibrational lines with the phonograph needle, a stir in the atmosphere is created which is but the reappearance of the original vibrations, the vibrations of sound waves, not those of touch, form, etc. That is why you hear the voice of the original reciter or singer, or the sound of the instrumentalists. As the form-waves were not recorded in the record, you cannot visually see the forms and features of the instrumentalists during their performance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->There is a sweet smell in the flower but it would have appeared odourless to you, had not the smell-tanma&#x301;tras or waves been carried to the gates of your nose by the aerial vibrations. Then again you could not have sensed the existence of the airborne fragrance, had not sympathetic waves been created in your afferent nerves upon their contact with the fragrance-carrying breeze. Similarly you would not have sensed the sweetness of a delicious sweet, inspite of its contact with a particular region of your tongue, had not that contact created a particular type of vibration or sensation in your afferent nerves by means of your taste-organ.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The distinctiveness of vibrations or waves does not end here. After the contact of different types of things with the tongue, different types of contractions and expansions occur on different portions of the tongue and palate, as the result of which their respective vibrations are also different. It is because of these vibrational differences that chilli tastes pungent or hot, sugar tastes sweet and margosa tastes bitter. The interesting aspect of this is that we sometimes become confused and cannot distinguish one object from another if their vibrational differences are less. Such confusion sometimes arises between honey and molasses, among the seeds of tomato, chilli and brinjal, and between a genuine diamond and a fake diamond. In individual life many of you must have noticed that water tastes a little sweet after taking neem. Chemically, there is not very much difference between bitterness and sweetness. By the vibrational influence of the hydrogen in the water, the bitter vibrations of the neem are turned into those of sweetness and we think that the water is sweet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->All that is comprehensible and graspable in the world is but a vibrational play. Just as the tanma&#x301;tras of sound, touch, form, taste and smell are creating vibrations in our nerves by coming in contact with the gates of our sensory and motor organs, so our mind, being also similarly vibrated by these vibrations or waves, goes on transmuting the citta (mental plate) into the same forms of these waves. As a result we &ldquo;see&rdquo; elephants and horses, &ldquo;hear&rdquo; Puravi and Bhaeravii ra&#x301;gas, &ldquo;touch&rdquo; hot and cold, &ldquo;taste&rdquo; bitter and sweet and &ldquo;smell&rdquo; shiulii and rajaniigandha&#x301; flowers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now consider this vast universe. What is the characteristic of this universe? The universe is the psychic manifestation of the Macrocosm: His mind stuff is the universe, which we call the visible world. How did this Brahmic Citta come into being? The Citta is the static result of mental action. The apparently static or stationary entity that comes into being, as opposed to those entities influenced by the sentient (sattva) and mutative (rajah) forces, is created by the static force (tamah) of Prakrti &ndash; which, whether it is original or born of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (past momenta), is nothing else but citta. The characteristic of the static force is to give form, to create or evolve resultants, to bring inertness or staticity. So citta, the resultative place of he mind, is dominated by the static force and takes the form of objects in the external world or objects created by the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Wherever there is form, it is of momentary duration and of limited demarcation. The same holds true for the Cosmic Citta also. Hiran&#x301;yagarbha or the Subjective Entity of the subtle Cosmic Mind is superlatively vast and in this way evolves the different fundamental factors. So His mental plate is also limitless, but however great its manifestation, it does have a shape. There is an aura of thought-waves revolving around the Cosmic Nucleus or Purus&#x301;ottama, the nucleus of the Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, as the result of which energy particles are created. The five fundamental factors &ndash; ethereal, aerial, luminous, liquid and solid &ndash; are the sequential metamorphoses of these energy particles, so this quinquelemental cycle is the resultant of the Cosmic thought-cycle; but this thought-cycle, too is the resultant of pure consciousness. Every revolution of that cycle is the playful manifestation of Prakrti that produces vibration sometimes in consciousness, sometimes in thoughts, sometimes in energy and sometimes in the so-called inanimate objects. This though-cycle, evolved in the Cosmic Nucleus, Purus&#x301;ottama, is what is called the elliptical universe. All revolving material objects are controlled by both the centrifugal (avidya&#x301;) and centripetal (vidya&#x301;) forces; and as a result their totality looks somewhat elliptical. No matter how enormous the Cosmic Cycle is, it appears to be elliptical and thus it is called Brahma&#x301;n&#x301;da&#x301; (Brahma or Supreme Entity: plus an&#x301;d&#x301;a or &ldquo;egg&rdquo;). Within the Cosmic Cycle every entity represents a different vibration; those small or great cycles, which revolve in a concordant harmony, keeping intact all their rhythms and tempos, are all modulated and attuned to the vast universal vibration. Their microcosmic individual waves find their self expression and development in that very vast universal vibration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->How did this elliptical universe come into being? The Cosmic Citta is the material cause of the world. But the mind stuff or citta finds expression or takes shape only when it comes in contact with psychic vibrations. So we may say that universe is the manifestation of the Cosmic Citta, born out of psychic vibrations. All the tanma&#x301;tras of sound, touch, form, taste and smell that are composed of different kinds of vibrational currents resulting from the gradually crudifying expressions of the Cosmic Consciousness under the influence of the static principle of Prakrti. They are the analytic expressions of those universal rhythms or vibrations. Thus the visible world is created through the gradual crudifications of His thought-projection. The thought-waves, metamorphosing from subtle to the crude manifestations and then, on their way back to their nuclear origin from the crude to the subtle, assuming the mentally developed human form, are indeed guiding the thought-wave cycles towards their ultimate fulfilment. Since the world is His thought-projection, it may be said that this visible world is only His act of thinking and abides only in His imagination. Due to the vibration of Cosmic Citta these variegated forms have blossomed forth through newer and newer thoughts, forms and waves, following one another in succession.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->What is imagination? It is psychic action or sam&#x301;vedana. Every action or sensation is vibrative. This universe which is created as the result of the sam&#x301;vedana of the Cosmic Mind, must move in accordance with the vibrational law of the thought-process. The internal expression of the five tanma&#x301;tras takes place in the individual mind in a vibrational flow. Similarly, the vibrations of the Cosmic Mind, also create the tanma&#x301;tras which the unit entity receives or holds with its own sensory and motor organs and its pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya. (The five vital airs, e.g. pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, apa&#x301;na, sama&#x301;na, uda&#x301;na and vya&#x301;na). The unit entity receives from the outside world the various tanma&#x301;tras which pulsate in that very universal life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->What is the nature of this visible world? Each and every object is moving; none is immobile. Not a single entity in this universe is stationary. All are progressing, for none can be static even for a fraction of a second. Whether the mind likes it or not, whether the soul wants it or not, one has to run after things to come, leaving the present behind &ndash; this is Prakrti&#146;s inexorable course. No matter how dear a person may be to me, I cannot hold that person for ever. Death with its outstretched powerful fangs is fast approaching to snatch my dear one away from me with its vicious grip. No finite entity is capable of thwarting its onslaught, for all finite entities are subject to time and Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Only the essence of all His evolved entities &ndash; His characteristic Self that remains as the unexpressed witness of all is supratemporal, beyond the orbit of time. The real awakening of any entity depends on its ability to realize its characteristic self, and in such a state of awakening, the question of station or motion, progress or regress does not arise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I have already said that relative transposition of objects is action. An action imbibes motion, rhythm and vibrations, and out of these vibrations flow the tanma&#x301;tras. The vibrations which are excited in the mind through the intake of tanma&#x301;tras corresponding to one&#146;s vrttis or particular bent of mind, will be just opposite to those created by tanma&#x301;tras, which do not correspond to one&#146;s particular vrttis. The former will be pleasant and the latter will be painful. Generally the easier the intake of the impact of vibrations, the more pleasant is the effect and the more difficult the vibrational intake, the more painful or sorrowful is the effect. So the vibrational state in which the citta seeks to remain is called happiness (sukham) and that in which it does not want to remain is called grief (dukham). Even when the object of happiness or sorrow that comes to us as the result of the past reactive momentum of our previous lives, creates any great vibration, we are very often incapable of receiving it at all. Finding someone in such a serious predicament, we say &ldquo;The man&#146;s mind has received a serious shock. Will he be able to endure it?&rdquo; At times, as the result of a great shock and due to extreme tension in the nervous system, a person may even die of heart failure. Suppose someone&#146;s dearest relative has died. Naturally, this news will give her mind a great shock. If her mind possesses even a little strength to check the inroad of such a vibration, she will be able to bear it. We call a person &ldquo;tough&rdquo; who has greater power of resistance and endurance. Even if a person who lacks such power of endurance survives, even if her heart does not stop, her mind will readily stop functioning. We then say that the woman has become unconscious or is in a coma. Hysteria in women with weak minds and nerves is due to some extent to this vibrational shock; but we call it a disease, for here the weakness is rather excessive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Similar is the impact of happiness. This shock is also not easy to endure and absorb. If an abjectly poor man suddenly receives a lakh of rupees, the strong vibration of the news that arises in his mind, will violently agitate his whole nervous system. Such a highly vibrative news may even put an end to his life for his limited strength may not be able to bear such vibrational waves. Suppose while your mother is taking her dinner, you receive the news of her father&#146;s death, a great vibration will arise in her mind. If she is informed of this news suddenly, her limited strength may not be able to endure that violent vibrational force. In such a case the news should be disclosed to her gradually, by slow degrees, so that her mind will be able to gain sufficient strength to withstand the vehemence of that vibration. You may start with, &ldquo;No news from grandpa for quite a long time. I wonder how he&#146;s getting on.&rdquo; On hearing this, an ominous, premonitive vibration will arise in the corners of her mind but even this you should say after her dinner is finished. Then after a while, you may add, &ldquo;Maybe grandpa is very ill and that is why there is no letter.&rdquo; This will further strengthen her mind. Then you may say, &ldquo;Perhaps he is no more. No wonder, he was quite aged, wasn&#146;t he? But indeed his life is so precious to us.&rdquo; At last you break the news slowly and cautiously.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The power of enduring different kinds of vibrations varies in the same person in different conditions. So you should never suddenly break any news of great joy or great sorrow to anyone. First prepare the ground &ndash; create the right atmosphere for the mind and then bring the news to their knowledge. If you can gradually create the right type of waves, the strength to withstand the strain of the vibrations will come by itself. Thus, you should first tell the poor man &ldquo;If you get a hundred rupees, what will you do with the money?&rdquo; Then you give him a stronger dose: &ldquo;If you could get a thousand rupees in a lottery, what would you do with it?&rdquo; In this way you go on creating more and more pleasant vibrations in his mind &ndash; you go on habituating him to greater and greater shocks of happiness, and then at last you tell him he has won a prize of a lakh of rupees in the lottery. You will then see that as a result he can maintain his mental balance to a great extent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The stamina to stand vibrations differs in different people. Hence various degrees of happiness or sorrow are experienced by different people, and these differences depend on their respective mental constitutions. The subtle causes of these different mental constitutions are their acquired sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or reactive momenta, and the crude causes are their nerve cells, nerve tissues, glandular secretions, etc. The sudden vibrational impact on the body and mind makes the mind react violently, resulting in the cessation of the cardiac functions. This also explains the death of a person struck by lightning. The sudden contact of the eyes with an extremely dazzling radiance often results in the total impairment of vision. If we look directly at the brilliant sun for a few moments, our visual power becomes temporarily stunned and we cannot see anything for some time. Similarly, when some very high pitched or loud sound strikes the eardrum, the power of hearing may be destroyed. The sensitivity of every organ may be suspended by the impact of any violent vibration; this stupefaction, if the intensity of the vibrational impact is very great, may even become permanent. Yet sometimes powerful vibrations may help stimulate and restore the power of organs which have not been functioning for years. You must have heard of a person who had been blind or deaf and dumb since his childhood, regaining the lost power of his impaired organs in his latter years either by stroke of lightning or by being suddenly informed of an extremely happy or sad news.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In this visible world you receive tanma&#x301;tras in accordance with your strength and ability. When the tanma&#x301;tric vibration is more powerful than your strength or capacity, you are unable to receive it. Similarly, when the vibrational momentum is more slow and slack than your power of perception, you cannot receive it either. If people whisper in a soft voice, you cannot hear them &ndash; there you become deaf. Then again, if there is a very loud noise somewhere nearby, you cannot hear that either, for your hearing has been stunned &ndash; here too you are deaf. Your system may easily endure petty mental afflictions and in that case you do not cry before people. Then when you are filled with extreme grief you become so dazed and bewildered that in this case, too, you do not cry before people. You have seen a child suddenly stops crying in the midst of intense suffering. We call it &ldquo;choked in crying&rdquo;, for the child is unable to endure the violent sorrowful vibrations. You can tolerate a small pain with a smiling face and people cannot detect your hurt. An intense pain stuns you into unconsciousness and then, too, people are not aware of it. You are able to utter pathetic cries of &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; only in the intervening state to embellish your plight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->You cannot perceive the essences of ultra-subtle and ultra-crude entities: it is beyond your mental capacity to receive their vibrational waves and that is why, you cannot normally detect their existence. There are many birds and reptiles that can receive the premonitive vibrations of an event before its actual materialization. A frog detects the pre-indication of rains long before many other living beings do: it catches the premonitory vibrations beforehand and keeps croaking the announcement of the forthcoming happiness to the four winds. Normally humans, however, cannot know anything before the rain actually starts, for the requisite subtle mechanism to receive the pre-rain vibrations is not well developed in them. So for forecast they have to take recourse to meteorology and use a special type of scientific instrument.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->A crow has a natural premonitive instinct regarding storms. An owl and to some extent a dog can sense beforehand the possible occurrence of an earthquake or some other unforeseen natural calamity of great magnitude. Such power of apprehending phenomenal vibrations exists not in ten or twenty but in innumerable species of birds. Such a power is indeed of paramount necessity in their rigorous struggle for survival. Such a power did exist, too, to some extent, among the prehistoric people. But today, in this age of so-called civilization, human beings, having become extremely ease-loving, have lost that power through misuse and lack of necessity; just as their tails, their ability to move their ears and their capacity to hold things with their feet have disappeared. Now the hairiness of their bodies and the strength of their teeth and nails are also becoming extinct. The greater the preoccupation of creatures with the struggle for existence, the necessarily greater must be their power of premonition or prescience of impending danger, or else their existence will be effaced from the surface of the earth &ndash; this is the law of nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Those creatures that pulsate in the darkness of the deep sea are blind due to the darkness; and hence by natural law, just as their bodies possess the power to radiate light, so as weapons some of them possess sensitive spines, some have glandular poison jets and some have attractive voices. With the help of these, they compensate for their lack of visual perception of form-vibrations and preserve their own existence by their subtler reception of other tanma&#x301;tras or vibrations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The capacity of an instinctively wicked person to absorb vibration differs somewhat from that of an average person. The amount of beating that might endanger the life of average people, may be easily borne by those who are instinctively wicked. Very often they remain quite unconcerned about the bleeding that pours out of their cuts and wounds &ndash; rather they feel relieved from such bleeding. Such people can also perceive the premonitory hints of nature. In other words in such matters their ways, to some extent, correspond to those of the sub-human creatures. Yet to attain such power even a virtuous person has to perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practice most diligently.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Living beings receive the vibrations of tanma&#x301;tras according to their respective mental and physical constitutions. Take, for instance, a very tiny particle like an atom. From this also form tanma&#x301;tras or vibrations emanate, but human eyes normally cannot perceive these extremely minute vibrations. So human beings have to bring them within the scope of visibility of their sight organs with the help of a microscope or other such instruments. Thus apprehending the vibrations of these minute entities is beyond the capacity of the human sensory organs. Remote sounds or inarticulate vocal expressions may not be normally heard by your ears; for this you will have to take the help of a microphone or a loud speaker, because perceiving these sounds is beyond the range of your ear-organ. There are several tiny creatures that produce faint noises: they are hovering all around you, yet you cannot hear their sounds. You cannot hear the sounds of Calcutta with your crude acoustic power, but through a radio you can receive them very easily, for your radio receiver has a far greater power than yours to receive distant sound-waves. You receive from the aerial vibrations what had been received by the radio receiver and then transmitted by it again into the ocean of air. So it is clear that there are distinctive differences in the vibrational reception of different instruments, and humans and animals receive tanma&#x301;tras according to the respective capacities of their different sensory mechanisms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Form<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->A diagram can be made of every kind of vibration which you can normally see with your eyes or with the help of a particular instrument. For example, when sound-waves are recorded in a phonograph record, you can see those lines on the record with your crude eyes. Then when these soundwaves are again vibrated in the air by the phonograph needle, you can then apprehend the sounds with your organ of ear.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Does only what you see with your eyes have a form and not anything else? No, not at all: all vibrations have forms. Every tanma&#x301;tra has a form and this form is the resultant of its vibrational expressions. Viewing this vast Cosmic Citta, which we call the Universe, we exclaim in awe, &ldquo;Oh how vast&rdquo;. This, too, has a form &ndash; this, too, is the resultant of vibrations. Because of its vastness this Cosmic Citta is sometimes called formless, for its form has no limit. It is limitless not because it has neither beginning nor end, but because every infinitesimal fraction of it is flowing through innumerable forms, through countless vibrational expressions towards the inconceivable glory of the ocean of forms. It is a passing show &ndash; a panorama of transient phenomena &ndash; a changing reality. This vast vibration of the Supreme Spirit, this inconceivable expression of the Supreme Exultation &ndash; this thought-projection of the metempiric Entity, your ordinary organs have no power to apprehend. Your sight-organ cannot apprehend the vibrations of this Super-form nor can your crude ears receive its vast sound waves. Where there is vibration, there is sound. The universe is His imaginative thought-projection which is also vibrational, and so it has a sound also. But the amount of self-development that is required to perceive that supramundane sound is generally lacking in human beings. As long as they are aware of their individuality, they cannot receive the vibrations of the Great in the fullest measure, since all the powers of individuals are more or less limited. You can feel any object by touch but you cannot say, &ldquo;I am touching the Supreme Brahma.&rdquo; You do not have that sensory capacity, for the power that is required to touch Him is not so developed in you.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The vibration of the vast Cosmic Citta that has been flowing pauselessly through eternity is called On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. You have been hearing so many kinds of sounds and yet you are unable to perceive that eternal sound which is the seed of all sounds. To apprehend these sound waves, an extremely powerful instrument is necessary: the acoustic mechanism in your body at present is too pitifully weak for the purpose. Your instrument of hearing should be immeasurably more powerful than any radio-set that receives soundwaves from the air. Since your weak instrument is quite incapable of apprehending that sound, you are doubtful about the existence of such a phenomenon. But in order to receive the vibrations of the Infinite, you will have to identify your citta or mind and all your organs with that Infinite. Then alone will you be able to merge yourself in the Supreme Vibrational Exultation, surging through your theopathic trance. It is only when your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling and His, become one, that you can know and hear His mind &ndash; that you can experience His sound with every molecule of your being. Then your unit-mind will merge in the Cosmic Mind. In that auspicious moment when your &ldquo;I&rdquo; and the Cosmic &ldquo;I&rdquo; will meet in the supreme reunion, all your egotistic frivolities, fevers and frets will cease. An inexhaustible stream of symphony will then flow blissfully in the great void.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Now the question may arise whether the different varieties of sound that arise in the universe are the same or different from those of the Cosmic Mind. Are your footsteps, when you walk, the mute witness of your silence or are they the expression of your motivity? What you eat is also sonorific. Every small or great action of your life, every clash of vrttis (desires), every venous vibration is eloquent of a language. Tranquil mountain ranges, flowing streams and river, dense forests &ndash; none are mute, none are silent. They are all absorbed in an inexpressible sonorific meditation. Only those who have ears can hear them. None of these sounds is distinct from that Cosmic Sound, from that boundless sonic manifestation. All are Its inseparable flows. All are manifestations of one and the same On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. And yet due to our analytical minds we perceive these different manifestations to be different types of sounds. Consider, for instance, a village market place. What do you hear from a distance? A medley of howls, is it not? But as you approach nearer to the village, you will notice that the cacophony of sounds becomes differentiated into various meaningful sentences or words: &ldquo;Give me a kilo of brinjals.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your potatoes are too small,&rdquo; and so on. The some total of all these utterances becomes a howl. Just as all the sounds of the market place have been blended and united into one roaring soundwave, similarly all the sounds of the universe are merged into one On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, the unified form of all sounds. As every action is vibrative, so every expression of the Cosmic Citta is vibrational. Among all the vibrational tanma&#x301;tras, the subtlest is the sound tanma&#x301;tra. That is why the sound tanma&#x301;tra is the first stage of crudification of the subtle mental sphere into the crude physical world. On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is the initial manifestation, the first supersonic expression of the Cosmic Citta; thus, it is called Shabda-Brahma or Sonic Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Among the vibrations in this created world, colour occupies the position of secondary importance after the sound tanma&#x301;tra. All forms in this universe are chromatic and the distinction between objects is indeed discernible through colour, for colour indicates the attributional difference. The three binding principles of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, sattva (sentient), rajah (mutative), and tamah (static), are also colour. Whenever there is an excess of sattva in any particular entity, the vibrations emanating from that object will be sentient. If you perceive those sentient vibrations with your eyes, or through any other means, you will find that they have created a white colour on your mental plate or Citta. Thus, the vibration of colour indicates the attribute or quality of an entity. Sattva is white, rajah is red, and tamah is black. The greater degree of purity, the more predominance of sattva and proportionately whiter in colour. That is why in India whiteness and purity are often used synonymously. What is this white colour? White is not a colour; it is the combination of all colours. And what is black colour? Black is also not a colour; it is the absence of all colours. That is why black is the symbol of inertness, for it is the colour of the static principle. It is due to the absence of any vibration or one&#146;s inability to apprehend them that an object appears black. In darkness we see everything as black.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->A difference in forms means a difference in colours.

This white colour is composed of the seven component colours: violent, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red.

<a name="1..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->The human mind is partial to appearances or forms of tanma&#x301;tras and it is colour that impresses it most. You may recall that when your mind is attracted to any object, it is form that attracts you most. The science of chromatics is a wonderful science. The ploy of colours determines the affinity between object and object, animal and animal and between human and human. Due to this chromatic affinity we are attracted to an unknown person, even though we are not at all acquainted with him. You must have noticed in your individual lives that you like some people immediately without any apparent reason, and you hesitate to associate with other people, in spite of their widely publicized praise. Behind this experience is the same chromatic play, which you feel but cannot explain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->I have already told you that the sentient principle is white. So the people in whose minds white vibrations are flowing we call Sattvagun&#x301;ii or sentient (also known as vipravarn&#x301;a). The mutative principle is red. So those people whose minds are filled with red vibrations we call Rajogun&#x301;ii or mutative. Due to the greater crudeness in the mutative principle, the Rajogun&#x301;ii mind is more partial to crude activities than the sattvic one. Such mutative people are popularly considered to be of the Ks&#x301;atriya Varn&#x301;a or warrior temperament, possessing energy and valour. The sentient principle is cognitive, and the mutative principle is energetic. Vaeshyavarn&#x301;a, the temperament of the business class is concerned with activities much cruder than those of the Vipra and the Ks&#x301;atriya. Here the Citta or the mental plate is dominated by yellow vibrations, which are created by the combined influence of the mutative and static principles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Those whose Citta is predominately influenced by the static principle, naturally possess a greater degree of inertness than others: they have neither the knowledge of the sentient persons nor the valour of the mutative ones nor the capacity for activating things of those dominated by the mutato-static principles. This static inertness or crudeness is black. Those whose minds are predominately black are popularly known as shu&#x301;dras or the labour class. Thus all the colours are related to one&#146;s mental waves, and according to these waves a person is called a Brahmin, Ks&#x301;atriya, Vaeshya or Shu&#x301;dra. But it should be emphasized that any person can achieve Vipravarn&#x301;a by means of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (spiritual practice). In order to change the form and colour of the vibrations, it is necessary to change the mental tendency. From the Pura&#x301;nas we know that the King Vishva&#x301;mitra was a Ks&#x301;atriya in the early part of his life, but he attained Bra&#x301;hminic qualities through Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Lord Krs&#x301;na&#146;s father, Vasudeva, was a ks&#x301;atriya. His relative Nanda of Gokul, was a Vaeshya for he earned his living through dairy farming. Still another of his relatives, Garga Muni, who christened Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was a Vipra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->The indication of colour is most glaring in the form-tanma&#x301;tras. But it is not found only in the form-tanma&#x301;tras. Whenever there is vibration there is tanma&#x301;tra, and there is colour as well. If the proper instrument is used the colour and the subtle form of every vibration can be detected. Where there is a line, a form must necessarily be there. According to the rhythm of the vibration, sound must also be present. Any variation in the rhythm will cause variation in the sound and colour as well. The radiated vibration of an object in an object in the day will be quite different from that of the same object in the night due to differences in the light-waves, and so the object will appeal differently to your eyes. Why? Because it changes its colour. Since mundane vibrations are mainly dependent upon the sun, the vibrations of the human nervous system vary according to the presence or absence of the sun in the sky. Daylight imposes mutative influence on the human nerves and night-time imposes a static influence, causing the inertness of sleep in the body and mind. The periods of sunrise, sunset, moon and midnight (the sandhya&#x301;s) bring about a sentient transparency in the Citta. Thus, it is clear how great is the vibrational influence of the variability of colour, sound and mood, and people are naturally disposed to such influences. Ladies are not inclined to choosing expensive saris or cloths at night, for the colour is not then properly discernible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->We apprehend phonic as well as alphabetical difference quite accurately due to these vibrational differences. Short, long or galloping intonations are merely degrees of vibrational differences. The differences in Svaravarn&#x301;as (vowels) and Vyain&#x32D;janvarn&#x301;as (consonants) are also totally dependent on the difference in their vibrational characteristics. In the Sam&#x301;skrta language, the letters of the alphabet are called Varn&#x301;as or colours and all the consonants end in the first vowel &ldquo;a&rdquo;. So you see that Varn&#x301;a-Paricaya (the first book of the alphabet) literally means &ldquo;acquaintance with colour&rdquo; and this colour is, of course, the colour vibration. The Giita&#x301; also says that the four Varn&#x301;as or castes are evolved from the differences of attributes of activities. The differences in attributes account for the differences in activities and the differences in activities account for the differences in colours. With the change of attributive activity, the colour will also change. Hence the distinction of Varn&#x301;a or caste in social life is not an unchangeable or inviolable institution. The varn&#x301;a has evolved according to one&#146;s activities and by changing one&#146;s activities one can change the caste.<!-- /block --></p>

You are endeavouring to realize that endless flow of joy, to evolve your own consciousness to that blissful state. How can you apprehend that endless blissful flow through a particular limited object? In the worship of idols the tendency of the human mind is extroversial, and in this way human beings gradually degrade their minds from the awareness of that Infinite Supreme Entity. Their extroverted minds run after the crude, and as the result of this persistent pursuit of crude objects, they themselves gradually become crude. Discarding all vagaries of pleasure and pain, human beings have to progress from the mortal world towards immortality, towards the touchstone of Absolute Bliss &ndash; and when this is attained, everything is attained. Their movement should be towards the calm tranquillity of the soul, forsaking the humdrum of external life. But they will never be able to attain this as long as they involve themselves with idols, apprehensible through the indriyas or organs. They will proceed more and more towards crudeness and negativity, enmeshing themselves deeper in worldly bondages, and ultimately reach a state of oblivion &ndash; instead of attaining the ultimate goal of introversion of the evolutionary flow.

<a name="1..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->Can you bind God to an image made of clay, rocks, metal or wood, infusing life into it by chanting mantras for show? Though the image is but a small thing, the temple is much larger and yet Brahma is far greater than even the temple &ndash; He is beginningless and endless. The image, the temple all are within Him. How can anyone confine Him in a crude form? Such idolatry will lead you to sufferings. Until you practise intuitional science sincerely your troubles will never cease. So you see, idolatry is not only accepted in the Pura&#x301;n&#x301;as as the proper way to worship; rather it has been opposed by them as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Some people say that in the first stage they will worship an image for concentration of mind and then gradually give up the practice later on. Such an approach is not correct, for they will eventually become attached to the image and it will be very difficult to remove the resultant Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra (acquired momentum) of that attachment. You must have noticed at home how attached you become to your cats and dogs after having kept them for some time as your pets. Imagine, then, how difficult it will be for you to give up that image which you have worshipped as your beloved Lord with all the sweetness of your heart. So from the very start it is best not to indulge in image worship. Just as a flood after it recedes leaves behind a mark on the river-bank, so the staunch idol worshippers, too, find it painfully difficult to remove the impression of that Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra, even when they learn the introversial worship of Brahma and attain the ability to reach Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi. You will find this in the biography of a recent great Sa&#x301;dhaka who had to face a similar difficulty. One should avoid this predicament from the very start.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->Yet, only opposition to idolatry is not enough: the worship of Brahma should be done scrupulously, or else you will later regret and bemoan the futility of your life with the last drop of your tears at your last hour. You should make your life worthwhile through your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. How much can your worldly friends and relations do for you? After your death your relatives may perhaps ask, &ldquo;How much money has he left behind?&rdquo; Your friends may go to the crematorium and indulge in flattering reminiscences about you. Your husband or wife may cry for you for about ten or twelve days and then regain their normal composure. Your lot will be only a profound sigh &ndash; a record of the futility and frustration of your life. So do not waste your time lest you later have to repent.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->People may ask, &ldquo;We are ordinary people. If we always keep ourselves absorbed in the thought of Brahma, can we properly attend to our worldly duties?&rdquo; To this my reply is, of course you can, and you will do them still more beautifully. In the worship of Brahma there is a method by which easily and perfectly every worldly duty can be performed. For the ideation on Brahma a person does not have to become a hermit in the forest. Only go on behaving rightly and properly with every manifestation of Brahma in this universe &ndash; remove or rectify the mental disease of the criminals and reform their characters, cure the sick of their sickness, and arrange for their medicines and their diet. Just remember only this: that you have to behave properly and reasonably with every entity of this world. Pay special attention to the word &ldquo;properly&rdquo;. By &ldquo;proper behaviour&rdquo;, I mean that in which there is neither anger or jealously, neither attraction nor aversion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->You exist in a vast, limitless ocean of rasa or essences. A never-ending, radiant wave of manifestations is surging within and without you and radiating through all the ten directions &ndash; the indescribable vibrational expressions of small and great, accented and unaccented, eternally flowing thought-waves. Behave properly and reasonably with every expression, with every manifestation of the Cosmic mind. But always remember the One, Who is the essence of all these diverse vibrational manifestations. Train yourselves in the ideal of the lily, which blossoms in the mud and has to keep itself engaged in the struggle for existence day in and day out, parrying, bracing and fighting the shocks of muddy water and the force of storms and squalls and various other vicissitudes of fortune; and yet it does not forget the moon above. It keeps its love for the moon constantly alive. It seems but a most ordinary flower: there is nothing extraordinary about it. Yet, this most ordinary little flower has a romantic tie with the great moon. It has focused all its desires on the moon. Similarly, perhaps you are an ordinary creature &ndash; perhaps you have to pass your days in the ups and downs of worldly existence &ndash; yet do not forget that Supreme One. Keep all your desires inclined towards Him. Always keep yourself merged in His thought. Go deep into the mood of that Infinite Love. By this your worldly activities will not be hampered in any way.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->No matter what circumstances you are in, never lose sight of the Infinite One. Degradation is impossible for those who have accepted the Supreme Being as the Ideal of their lives. Indulging in mean thoughts only engenders crude vibrations in the Citta, as the result of which you will have to take rebirth in lower species in order to suffer the lowly Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras created by those crude vibrations. Thus you must arouse higher vibrations in your Citta. Even a man of King Bharata&#146;s calibre had to take rebirth as a deer because at the time of his death he was deeply anxious about a fawn. Thus regardless of what you are at present or what you may possibly become in the future, do not digress from the ideal of the Great in any circumstances: do not stray even a step away from the path of realization of Absolute Bliss. Ananda Marga or the path to eternal bliss is the only path for you.<!-- /block --></p>

If your love for Him is genuine, you will ever remain in an Elysian exuberance. Pain will then mean nothing to you, nor will happiness either.

<a name="1..100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->The attraction between one object and another is always chromatic, pertaining to ra&#x301;ga or colour. The word ra&#x301;ga is derived from the root ran&#x301;j which means &ldquo;dyeing&rdquo;. Anura&#x301;ga means to dye one&#146;s mind with the colour of that Infinite Entity. Nothing will result from dyeing one&#146;s clothes with saffron colour only for show. Dye yourself within. People of some particular religious creeds think that dyeing their clothes or bodies with a particular colour is a part of spiritual Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But remember that is all useless, unless you are dyed within as well. Can a person become a shu&#x301;dra only by wearing a dark dress, or a vipra by donning white garments?

Behind the external show of virtuousness of many so-called sa&#x301;dhus exists a pharisaic state of mind. Preserve the true dignity of the word, Sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->That is why I say that you must bring about a revolutionary change in the flow of your judgment and thought, and see how, after overcoming your fascination with external colour, your mind becomes tinged with the His glorious colour. In Ananda Marga Sadhana, the method of withdrawing the mind from degrading tendencies, and absorbing oneself in the colour of the Great, is called Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra Yoga (the yoga of withdrawal) or Varn&#x301;a&#x301;rghyada&#x301;na (the offering of colours). All people have a particular attraction for one or another object or activity and as soon as they become attracted to an object, then their minds become coloured with the colour of that object. You can withdraw your mind from the colour of that object and dye yourself in His colour by offering Him the captivating colour of the object that has attracted you: this is the real Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra Yoga. The word Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra means &ldquo;to withdraw&rdquo; &ndash; to withdraw the mind from its object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->The main object of the Spring Colour Festival (Vasantotsava) is not playing with external colours; it is meant to offer Him the colours of different objects which have dyed the mind. When this practice of offering your own colours &ndash; your own attachments, becomes natural and easy, you will then merge in Him. Then you will have no need for any colour, for you will become colourless &ndash; you will go beyond the reach of any colour. Your unit-ego will become one with the Cosmic Ego. Whichever way you look you will see only Him in His ever-surging glory. There is no &ldquo;I&rdquo; nor &ldquo;you&rdquo;. By an everlasting, mutual pact the final curtain will have fallen on all clashes of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;you&rdquo;. At that stage, if you call Parama Brahma as &ldquo;I&rdquo;, you are right in calling Him so; if you call Him as &ldquo;He&rdquo;, you are equally right; and if you call Him as &ldquo;you&rdquo;, again you are correct. The extent of your attainment of Him will be proportionate to your self surrender.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph -->Remember, you have to offer your own identity &ndash; not money, rice plantains or other crude objects. The give-and-take of crude things is a business transaction. If you want to attain the bliss of Brahma, you must offer your own self. If you want to have the Great &ldquo;I&rdquo;, you must give away your own little &ldquo;I&rdquo;. You have to give the full sixteen annas, (the full rupee). Giving fifteen annas and holding back one anna will not do. You must completely surrender. To attain that Infinite One with the help of your mental concentration and strength, you have to surrender yourselves. But, remember self-surrender does not mean suicide. On the contrary, your soul will have its full expression. Your existence will not become contracted, for contraction is inert in principle. Hence in the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of self-surrender the ego is expanded, not contracted. In the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata, when Duhsha&#x301;sana was pulling the sari of Draopadii, she was tightly holding the cloth to her body with one hand beseeching lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a with the other. &ldquo;Oh! My lord, save me!&rdquo; But the Lord did not then come forward to save her from shame. When Draopadii found no means of escape, she then released her hold on the cloth and appealed to the Lord most piteously with both hands out-stretched, crying, &ldquo;O Lord, I surrender my all to you. Do what you think is best&rdquo;. And the Lord immediately rescued her. That is why I say that you will have to dedicate yourselves to His feet wholly and unreservedly. You will earn godliness in proportion to the extent that you surrender yourselves, and finally, after merging that acquired godliness of yours in His Entity, you will attain eternal bliss.<!-- /block --></p>

I will tell you something from the story, which discusses mainly para&#x301; and apara&#x301;, introversive and extroversive knowledge, and shreya (supreme benevolence) and preya (mundane pleasure).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Naciketa the son of King Va&#x301;jashravas, had been to Yama, the god of death, to learn Brahma Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na or any Intuitional Science.

<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Shreya and preya are both completely opposite in principle. But inspite of their being at variance, their dual influence are sometimes discernible on the human mind at the same time. The mixed influence of these two agitates the human mind simultaneously, and those who, without having discerned the implication of this agitation, get caught up in the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of preya distract themselves from their Parama&#x301;rtha or spiritual goal. &ldquo;Artha&rdquo; means that which causes the cessation of pain. This cessation is of two kinds &ndash; one is the momentary or temporary and the other is permanent. In temporary cessation, the possibility of the recurrence of pain has not been extinguished; with the removal of the temporary cause of the cessation, the previous state of pain comes back again. That which causes momentary or temporary cessation is called artha, and that which causes its permanent cessation, which destroys pain at the root or consumes it with seed, is called Parama&#x301;rtha. Preya or extroversive tendency gives human beings artha or temporary pleasure and relief, but keeps them away from parama&#x301;rtha, from spiritual bliss. But shreya is essentially benevolent, for it relieves pain forever and thus it is called Parama&#x301;rtha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Preya is a matter of mental enjoyment only, not a means for the expansion of one&#146;s soul. Suppose, some one is hungry; in such a case, Preya of food will help appease his hunger pains momentarily, but will they be appeased permanently? Today after eating some sweets one&#146;s hunger may be satiated for the time being, but tomorrow you will find that hunger is its hungry self again. Try giving a certain amount of money to a person who is &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; for money. Will his greed cease? He will achieve only a temporary satisfaction, and he will continue to nurture this &ldquo;hunger&rdquo; in his mind. Similar is the case with crude medicines: the patient is cured temporarily but not permanently. There are but few ailments that, once gone, never return.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So, you see, preya is that which provides the wherewithal for apparent happiness. Even a wise man, inspite of his knowledge that such fleeting happiness is only short-lived, still runs after it, because human beings in general are not far-sighted. They are concerned only with the near future. Inspite of having a presentiment of some misfortune in the distant future they prefer to keep themselves absorbed in the oblivion of the present and the dreams of the near future. Such is the nature of human beings: they prefer to grab anything good or bad that comes their way, leaving the consequence for the future instead of proceeding firmly and assiduously to successfully attain some long-range goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Consider government servants for instance. If they go on discharging their duties honestly, their promotion is ensured; and in this way they will benefit not only themselves, but the government and the masses as well. But for lack of proper moral education and mental strength, many such government servants have failed to resist the temptation of taking bribes out of greed, for their temporary pleasure. They do not consider their good name and future prospect, which they treat as something remote. Rather they try to harm those who are honest and conscientious workers, considering them to be fools or enemies. Only those who are very much afraid of possible suffering run after temporary happiness. It is the weak-minded people that adopt preya sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; on account of their cowardly minds. This fear of approaching sorrow is the root of all evils, the only stumbling block in the path of advancement. If you try to give neem (margosa) to a boy suffering from worms, he will refuse to take it. Although he knows that the neem will cure him of his worms still he will not take it, because he is afraid of its repulsively bitter taste; yet he will gladly take sugar, for it gives him momentary pleasure. Sugar is his preya. He does not care that this very sugar will aggravate his disease. The road to preya is an easy one and that is why human beings run after it, stretching out their longing hands to grasp it with ease. But this preya, which is one attained with little or no difficulty, will one day recoil on them with the fiery scourge of a thousand scorpion stings.<!-- /block --></p>

Evidently they get some pleasure out of it. Gossip-mongers are generally lazy people: they never have the opportunity of enjoying the pleasure of working, for they themselves do not work. Hence, they seek to fill the void of their minds, to some extent, by maligning others. They are the champions of preya, for they fear the slight difficulties that the practice of shreya entails. These cowards only unleash their own mental pretensions before the public, glossing over their own hidden faults with the colourful language of slander. The climax of their cowardice occurs when any one of them is asked, &ldquo;Did you say such-and-such things?&rdquo; They reply without the least hesitation, &ldquo;Not I &ndash; someone else said so &ndash; I don&#146;t remember who.&rdquo; Here, too, the only reason for their falsehood is the fear of suffering, lest their role in the slander be revealed and they have to suffer some disagreeable consequence.

Those objects of preyas which are enjoyable by the unit mind, are fragmentary. Such attraction for fragmentary objects of pleasure is called ka&#x301;ma or mundane longing. And the attraction for the integral One, for the Great &ldquo;I&rdquo;, is called Prema or Divine Love.

<a name="2..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Sensual objects are naturally crude and mean; and those who take these as their goals in life, naturally become crude and mean as well &ndash; they gradually turn into brutes. Often a man who appears to be a gentleman of refined taste, integrity, charm and position, is actually a rogue, a liar and a swine: although he seems to be a man from his outward appearance, he is actually a depraved brute. In modern society you will find a horde of such types. In a meeting a man delivers a lofty, heart-rending lecture, on the upliftment of the masses &ndash; all the while ruminating in his mind about the prospect of becoming a minister and gaining fortune. You will encounter many people who are not farmers or labourers themselves but shed a flood of crocodile tears for the woes of farmers and labourers, carefully hiding their own selfish motivations. These knaves who used to drench their breast with tears for the sufferings of the common masses, forget them in a trice the moment they get a powerful position &ndash; and then their true colours are revealed. Those who were deceived can then easily understand how terribly dangerous and vile are their deceivers&#146; minds. The Yama has said, &ldquo;Many people in this world harbour in their hearts such base and crude desires and merge their minds in their sensuous pursuits.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Attraction towards material objects is called ka&#x301;ma or passion. Here ka&#x301;ma does not mean the desire of any particular organ. Some psychologists have maintained that the sexual urge, a particular expression of ka&#x301;ma is the root cause of all types of mundane attractions and activities. This statement is wrong, for attraction is the characteristic of all unit entities and such attraction will certainly not always be sexual. Those psychologists that give undue importance to sexual lust, betray their own vulgar and licentious mentality. As I have already said, not each and every attachment or attraction is born of sexual desire. Each unit being is vulnerable to attraction but the cause of this attraction is the imperative urge for self-preservation. It is only because of this urge for self-preservation that unit beings run after crude, subtle or causal expressions. And this urge for self-preservation, too, arises due to the desire for happiness in every living being. So it is clear that behind every attraction between one entity and another, which we call by the name of ka&#x301;ma, lies the pure desire for attaining happiness. Happiness is the ultimate desire of life, not lust. It is not a matter of sexual or sensual passion at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Propelled by this urge for self-existence or desire for happiness, one who gives indulgence to ka&#x301;ma, and runs after crude, subtle, or causal expressions (in other words, becomes a preya sa&#x301;dhaka) is a fool, because none of these crude, subtle or causal expressions can impart lasting peace or protection &ndash; for the simple reason that they are all fragmentary parts. For the sake of their self-existence if people give indulgence to preya, preya will eventually be unable to sustain them and their pyre of passion will reduce them to ashes. Those who seek final beatitude and eternal shelter, should strive for the achievement of spiritual perfection, then the urge for self-existence or happiness will find the ultimate consummation. They will live eternally; they alone will be truly immortal; they alone will establish themselves in deathlessness. The rhythmic peculiarities of the crude and subtle causes, the recurrence of birth and death &ndash; none of these will be any longer of importance to them. They will attain final emancipation and become established in the Infinite Entity of Supreme Shreya or Bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->There are some psychological causes behind the &ldquo;endearing&rdquo; attraction of one object for another, although the basis of all these causes is the desire for happiness and self-preservation. Why is there so much attraction between the hearts of a brother and a sister? The reasons are: living together in one environment for a long time, sharing the same kind of food and the same type of education in the family, sharing the bond of the same parental affection. The absence of any of these causes results in the lack of heartfelt attraction of the children for their parents or for each other. The tender affection for the parents or brothers or sisters of a girl who lives for a long time in a hostel or in a distant country away from her parents, is somewhat diminished; for in this case, her natural preya or desire for happiness and self-preservation, is not fulfilled by her family environment. That is why wise parents generally do not like to educate their children by keeping them in hostels.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->I have already said that the desire for happiness does not depend on &ldquo;endearing sentiment&rdquo; alone; rather the attraction of an &ldquo;endearing features&rdquo; or a pleasing form confuses the general mass even more. The attraction of a pleasing form cannot be so easily eradicated by discriminating judgment as the &ldquo;affectional attraction.&rdquo; It is for this reason that many knaves in the gard of sa&#x301;dhus are being worshipped in today&#146;s society. Their bestial mentality that is well-hidden behind their ashes, matted locks, tiger-skin and kuan&#x301;dala, the common people cannot and do not want to discern. They merely remain awe-struck at the sight of a sanya&#x301;sii&#146;s saffron gard. When to speak of ignorant people &ndash; even so-called intellectual and refined people under the spell of superficial charm, very often become involved in crude, antisocial activities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->It is only when the Eternal Entity that lies behind superficial charm and affectional feeling, is recognized that really lasting attraction or divine love comes into being. In divine love the affectionate feeling is not merely enjoyed as an emotion but its essence is realized; and the veneer of superficial charm will not just impart an external dye to make a so-called yogii but, when its essential colour is realized, will transport sa&#x301;dhakas to profound spiritual meditation by dyeing their minds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->So you see, preya or ka&#x301;ma remains busy with finite units only, and thus, the ego, who is the enjoyer of such fragmentary units, must be the small ego. It is impossible to develop such an ego which remains always absorbed in these units. Even people of wisdom, of high social status &ndash; even so-called intellectual and accomplished scientists and philosophers who are always concerned with earning high respect for themselves or saving their own prestige &ndash; even they pursue sensuous or fragmentary objects for the gratification of their egos. Perhaps they deliberately refuse to realize that these petty objectives of their egos will infuse their minds with meanness, as a result of which all their egoistic respect, prestige and status will ultimately be pulverized into dust.<!-- /block --></p>

Why do people prefer preya to shreya? Why do they deliberately adopt the worship of animality? The reason is very easy to discern: it is due to their gradual evolution from animal life by which they have today attained the stage of the human species. But the accumulated sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of their past animal lives are still present in them, inspite of their attaining human status. These sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras repeatedly superimpose animalistic tendencies on their minds; and it is due to the vibration of these sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras that people are impelled towards animal propensities, towards preya; the irresistible attraction of crude gratification is leading them astray. In their human bodies they repeatedly reveal their animality through their thoughts and actions. An animal is not a thoughtful creature, for consciousness is not clearly evolved in it. Being irrational it has no discriminating judgment regarding vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301;. Yet the experience it has accumulated through its sensuous animal life is that of preya, not shreya &ndash; that of avidya, not vidya&#x301;. Human beings understand preya through the empirical knowledge of their past animal lives, but shreya remains absolutely unknown to them. Naturally people with weak minds would prefer to hold on to their familiar ways of life; they do not want to run the risk of embarking upon an unfamiliar path. So even those who know both shreya and preya very often follow preya due to their mental weakness, for the road to preya appears to be smooth and easy &ndash; a veritable highway, reinforced with concrete.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The followers of the path of shreya will naturally have to fight against their sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of preya, their animal propensities.

Whenever a person does something, there results a clash between two opposing forces and in this clash when the operative or actional force wins, then alone the action materializes. People sit down for rest after being tired of a long walk. What is the reason behind it? Their struggle with the opposing forces eventually dims their actional forces. Similarly, the avidya&#x301; force declares war on those whose desire or inclination is towards vidya&#x301;; this gives rise to a hostile tendency in the recesses of their minds, against which they have to struggle. At home the husband, wife or the other members of the family become dissatisfied with them, and create various obstacles. In the field of their activities the opportunities arise for depravity, meanness, bribes etc., and they have to maintain their self-control. The locusts of desires come swarming in to destroy the very bud of their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. So they must carefully avoid such temptations for their own safety. But those whose movement is truly towards vidya&#x301;, who are determined to follow the path of vidya&#x301; by sacrificing their all, will eventually become immune to all obstacles.

<a name="2..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->I have already said that without obstacles there is no action, and the victory of the operative energy over obstacles is the materialization of action. These obstacles are not solely the lot of sa&#x301;dhakas on the path of vidya&#x301;. Those who follow the path of depravity or avidya&#x301;, and run after preya are also confronted with obstacles, which issue from the force of vidya&#x301; as a warning to desist from such base activities. Those who steal for the first time, find their hands feet trembling and see nightmarish visions even after the commission of theft. Why does this happen? It is because the force of vidya&#x301; keeps dinning into their minds that the act which they are going to do or have done, is extremely base and low, and that its consequences are disastrous. But afterwards when the constant cultivation of avidya&#x301; makes that force take a strong root in their minds, then they smother the obstacles of vidya&#x301; in the first stage. And so after some time the experienced thief&#146;s hands and feel do not tremble anymore, nor does he see frightful hallucinations of the dreadful consequences of his acts. The intermediate condition between an immature thief and a mature is there just the same as the intermediate condition between a struggling spiritual aspirant and one who has attained the divine goal. Thus, those who are on the path of preya weave a web of rationalizations in their minds to support their activities. With this mental attitude behind their tall talks, they produce their materialistic philosophies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Just as in the constant pursuit of avidya&#x301; a force of invulnerability is created against the influence of vidya&#x301;, similarly in the constant sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of vidya&#x301;, sa&#x301;dhakas gain immunity to the influence of avidya&#x301;. Those who are reared in the cradle of materialistic ideologies, feel shy or ashamed at first to sit in meditation in the presence of others. Overwhelmed by the influence of avidya&#x301;, they think, &ldquo;People may perhaps think that I, an ultramodern boy or girl, am emulating the pre-historic mode of worship!&rdquo; There are many who may try to conceal their devotion from others and there are many who try to maintain their position among their friends by feigning skepticism &ndash; and then mentally beg God&#146;s forgiveness. But inspite of such an attitude of shame, after a few days of regular spiritual practice, they will acquire the strength to overcome the influence of avidya&#x301;; and finally casting aside all the vagaries of shame and shyness, they will then be able to freely express their genuine devotion to God.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Now the question may arise in your mind; why do some people seem to disregard the stumbling block of shame from the very first stage of their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? This is due to external pressure or internal urge. Suppose someone&#146;s son or husband or wife or nearest relative has suddenly died, or he or she has lost an enormous wealth or had a providential escape from a dangerous calamity. Such a person, regardless of what others say or think, throws all consideration of shame, fear, prestige or insult to the four winds and turns into a strong-willed sa&#x301;dhaka of shreya within a very short time. This has a negative side also. Suppose someone is faced with starvation. Goaded by need he starts stealing openly, regardless of the consequences and shamelessly takes refuge in avidya&#x301;. And if those who, knowingly or unknowingly commit such a crime, then receive abundant materials for their enjoyment, they too, become shameless sa&#x301;dhakas of preya like the aforementioned thief. The collection of the thoughts and desires of this type of shameless preya-sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; form the Charvaka and other materialistic philosophies. In order to hide their own weakness they call the devoted and godly people weak or mentally diseased. Incidentally, the word &ldquo;godly&rdquo; and &ldquo;god-fearing&rdquo; do not have the same meaning. Behind godliness is a soul-stirring sentiment &ndash; an ardent zeal to realize one&#146;s true Self; and the reason behind the fear of God is the important attempt to escape from the consequential suffering of one&#146;s misdeeds. Yet the latter is still superior to the atheists, because at least for fear of divine punishment they refrain from sinful acts. The greatest advantage of the theists is that they do not endure the pangs of internal clash. But no matter how brazenly sceptics indulge in tall talks or sharpen the edge of their verbal weapons to win in an argument, there is always a fight going on in their minds. Reading a few pages of a book or listening to the eloquences of a few speakers, they seek to violate their own nature. With their fragmental external knowledge they try to struggle against the indivisible Supreme Entity, and in the end, being defeated, the say, &ldquo;If He does exist, then why can&#146;t we find Him?&rdquo; Yet all the while their inner selves lament within them:<!-- /block --></p>

Hence na&#x301;stika pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita or &ldquo;atheist-pandit&rdquo; is a contradiction in terms. The Vedas have said that these materialistic apostates never walk a straight road. How can they? Straight forwardness in life is achieved only through sincere and dedicated sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In such atheists there is a clash between good and bad going on within them day in and day out in which the bad always emerge victorious, for their souls do not nurture the good. In order to satisfy their sensual desires they very often pretend to be pious. While pointing out the faults of others, they also have to project consoling hopes of comfort and good cheer to people or else no one will fall into their trap. But this constant inculcation of two opposing tendencies brings about an ugly distortion in their minds. The incongruity of their internal and external expressions ultimately turns them into crude beasts in human form. They scramble and scuffle madly among themselves to grab leadership in different spheres of life, and consider the ability to lead people their sole monopoly. But those who are misled by them into their vociferous trap progress from one darkness to another; for how can those who are blind themselves show the path to another blind person? How can a dull and inert mind awaken consciousness in another?<!-- /block --></p>

Behind human desires the sweetly benevolent inspiration that the soul imparts, leads human beings to consciousness, not crudeness. That is why the wise try to develop their wisdom and intelligence more and more. No one wants to remain a fool: not even a simpleton wants to be called an idiot. To acquire true wisdom, judgement is necessary and judgment involves discrimination. The proper applications of this discriminating judgement is wisdom. This is why the discriminating people take Brahma, the ultimate stage of their consciousness, as their objective. But the ignorant or foolish ones who do not utilize their discriminating judgement but are tempted on to the path of materialistic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for their temporary enjoyment, eventually become crude themselves. The Yama said, &ldquo;Allured by the paraphernalia of enjoyment these fools do not understand nor do they want to understand, the Supreme Entity. They cannot even imagine a subtler world beyond this material quinquelemental world and so they totally deny it. Those who take the crude as their objective, have to come again and again into this material world in crude forms to enjoy and endure the crude. Trudging along a dark path they are gradually transformed into matter. Thus, they come under my sway again and again, for it is impossible for them to redeem themselves from the cycle of birth and death.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

They deliberately refuse to understand that their existence is completely transient, subject to time, space and person. They deliberately refuse to turn their eyes towards the original causal entity of the world, in whose body the rhythms of changes appear and disappear. Matter resides in energy and energy resides in thought; energy begets matter and thought begets energy. Rejecting this simple, obvious truth, their palsied minds cannot face all problems with courage. Thus, they become avidya&#x301;&#146;s slaves by worshipping transience as eternity, impurity as purity, sorrow as happiness, and self-ignorance as self-consciousness. Truly speaking, any molecule, atom, electron or proton which is taken to be the fundamental stuff of this world, are but the manifestations of energy, for matter is nothing but bottled-up energy. But energy is not an original entity either; it is simply consciousness under the bondage of Prakrti. Hence for the true comprehension of the essence of matter one must accept the theory of Brahma composed of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. Whether He is considered in His all-pervasive aspect or in any of His individual aspects, His Macrocosmic State manifests the same characteristic that is manifest in His individual aspect also.<!-- /block --></p>

With a feeling of scorn for the world, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is an impossibility. You may become superhuman in the eyes of the people &ndash; you may even achieve the reputation of a renunciate by rejecting this visible world that is all around you &ndash; but still your mental thirst will remain unquenched, and your heart will never be satisfied.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Why are human beings afraid of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; why do they hesitate to seek introversive knowledge? Let me tell you the reason. Human life is the result of evolutionary progress from animal existence. Energy is expressed through the clash of belligerent forces, and through these clashes the various so-called &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; entities of this quinquelemental world such as sand, iron, stone, etc., are transformed into self-activated entities like primitive plants and unicellular protozoa. Indeed through these clashes they attain the power to gradually convert their passive energy into active mental energy. We encounter the manifestation of this mental energy in some particular plants and organisms. Where life is averse to struggle, no progress is possible. That is why in some countries we find pre-historic creatures of undeveloped intellect that are alive even today; and elsewhere creatures of developed intellect have come into being out of the dust of those very pre-historic carcasses. The intellect of a monkey is not in the same category of that of an earthworm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Through these clashes animality has attained humanity. It is the residual momentum &ndash; this credit balance of the balance sheet of our pre-human struggles with animality &ndash; that has made us the possessors of human minds. That is why the momentum of animality can understand only in terms of material enjoyments, for that momentum does not imbibe the untasted joy of consciousness; and the attainment of that joy is inspired by the human soul, the subject of the mind &ndash; such an inspiration could not be properly utilized by the animal mind, but may be used to better advantage by the strong human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->Thus it is the empirical knowledge of previous animal life that leads human beings to material enjoyments on the one hand, while the more developed inspiration of their soul seeks to lead them to consciousness; and thus a constant clash is going on in the human mind between crudeness and consciousness, between vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301;. Human beings are normally afraid of struggles; so it is hardly surprising that materialistic-minded people are averse to such struggles in the beginning.<!-- /block --></p>

Then again, out of this small group that has understood, only a very few may retain in their minds what they have understood. Lastly, only one or two persons of this last group may practice in their daily lives what they have learnt and understood. This is only due to the clash between vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301; in the mind, and in this clash the triumph of avidya&#x301; or the extroversive force means running from the introversive bent of vidya&#x301;. It is because of the sam&#x301;skaras of animality that the introversive momentum is rare in the average human mind. The sensuous desires of avidya&#x301; continue to infiltrate into every thought process. Such a situation continues for a long time in a sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The answer is very simple. The guidance must come from true human beings, not from those inferior, sub-human creatures, who are manifesting animality in their human frames. Who is a human being or &ldquo;nara&rdquo;? Nara means purus&#x301;a. Who shall we call purus&#x301;a? One in whom consciousness is prominent, in whom the manifestation of the soul is in greater degree, is alone the purus&#x301;a. Those who have not performed the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of that purus&#x301;abha&#x301;va or Consciousness are not fit to teach others. Even if they do, their students will not be able to carry out their instructions properly, for their words are not able to touch their students hearts. How can such people teach? In their very own minds there is a stormy clash going on. They have not attained the serene calmness of the Great Sea. Some of them quarrel over the corporeality or incorporeality of God, some waste time in arguments whether God is white or black, some present a plethora of millions of gods and try to convince others from the pages of the scriptures of the might and power of these different gods, the various amounts of rewards for their worship and the dangerous curse of not performing such worships. Some want to shed human blood over the type of music or procession that is performed or over the type of food eaten, or over the question of untouchability regarding the use of food. They will try to convince others that these are the genuine ways of God and religion. These lowly sub-human creatures masquerading as human beings, take advantage of human sentiments and weaknesses and place all types of obstacles in the path of human progress. Their utterance, however, do not and cannot touch the core of anyone&#146;s heart. With their lack of the universal vision, they remain extremely remote from Consciousness. They always seek to disintegrate the One into many fragments. That is why they want to see humanity divided into nations of British, Soviets, Indians, etc., or into many creeds of Hindus, Moslems, Christians, or A&#x301;rya Sama&#x301;jists. Normally the words of those who are fanatic Britishers cannot move the hearts of those who are not British; and the words of those who think of Hindu interests certainly do not sound sweet in Moslem ears.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->When people are initiated by those who have realized the divine Truth, they are around to universalism. They cease to regard any entity of the universe as separate from themselves. Every entity of the world is the limited manifestation of the one Cosmic Consciousness. Whom will you fight against, or whom will you flee from? You are undecaying, immortal and birthless. When you are established in your own true self, none of the belligerent unit entities can stand against you, nor can your mind be disturbed by their limited forms. Such an all-embracing Cosmic Sentiment cannot be inculcated in others by sub-human individuals with narrow views. That is why some people created divisions between human beings by combining religion with politics, with patriotism, or with idle metaphysical speculation. Under the pretext of preserving their religion and establishing peace, they encourage the genocide of millions of innocent people in the name of jihad or religious crusades. Propagating discrimination and discord in the name of religion, certain groups ruthlessly exploit the ignorant masses. They may keep some people blinded and confused for a long time but they cannot misguide the majority of people for long. People are already beginning to realize the truth, and they will realize still more in the future. Ananda Marga is sounding the clarion call for the sleepers to wake up. Those religious fakes will be compelled to quickly withdraw from their hypocritical role of religious hegemony, and at the time of their withdrawal they will have scandalization or malicious propaganda as their sole capital to fall back upon. You all know, where reasoning fails, vilification becomes the sole stock-in-trade. When you hear abuses from these frogs-in-the-well, you can take for granted that the grey matter in their frenzied brains have no functional residues left and that they have come to you only to convince you of their helpless and fey condition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->Brahma is the unarguable entity. He is beyond all arguments, for only an object which the mind can hold within its small compass can be the subject of argument. Your mind can comprehend such qualities like what is dark and what is fair, and thus you can also argue on such points. But regarding that Consciousness where your mind ceases to exist you certainly cannot say whether He is dark or fair. Brahma is unarguable, because He is beyond the ambit of mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->If someone says that God came and told him, &ldquo;Thou art my dear Son&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thou art the last Prophet&rdquo; &ndash; these statements may command respect from the credulous but to those of discriminating judgment they will not be acceptable, for the one who appears in person, will immediately come within the scope of argument and logic and will naturally have a shape. On this point, there will be no correspondence with the Nira&#x301;ka&#x301;rava&#x301;da or the doctrine of shapelessness or incorporeality of God. Human beings are conscious beings. As long as their mental apperception is functioning, they should not accept anything that is illogical or fallacious. Where mind does not exist, what will God say, and who will be there to listen to Him? Sound can only be received by a crude organ, otherwise it is audible only in the internal waves of the Cosmic Mind. Something which is formless is not perceivable by the organs and so His voice cannot be heard. The Cosmic Mind is devoid of duality and so there is no scope for anybody&#146;s hearing anything about the Nirgun&#x301;a or Objectless Brahma, whether &ldquo;It is&rdquo; or &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; or &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. His disciples did, of course, ask him, if He existed: Buddha was speechless. When they asked him, &ldquo;Does He not exist then?&rdquo; Buddha remained speechless again. With the result some people assumed that Buddha wanted to say that God did not exist, and then again some inferred that He did exist. But those who were real intuitionalists understood that He was an Entity beyond the scope of the mind &ndash; beyond the purview of &ldquo;Is&rdquo; or &ldquo;Is not.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Scriptures and mythologies are like stacks of bricks: they are only arranged in layers, bearing no significance or intrinsic value. How can they describe or explain that ultimate entity which is beyond the scope of the mind? Here both the teacher and the disciple are helpless, because this subject, which is beyond the domain of any academic discourse and discussion, is simply inexplicable and inexpressible. Whatever is said and discussed comes within the scope of the mind and so it is a relative truth &ndash; true today, false tomorrow. That is why a teacher becomes mute when he or she is asked to explain Brahma Vijna&#x301;na or the intuitional science and consequently the disciple, too becomes deaf. So Krishnacharya says that the best metaphor to describe this profound mystery is the soundless communication between a deaf and a dumb person for this intuitional science is so extremely subtle that the mind or the senses cannot adequately express it.<!-- /block --></p>

Those who have realized even a portion of true knowledge, even a semblance of the Truth, are not deluded by the false logic: arguments cannot distract them from their goal. For example, those who are convinced that ghosts are the play of the sub-conscious mind, are not afraid of them, nor do they ever experience any theophanic or demonical paroxysm or trance. But ignorant persons who believe in the existence of ghosts or various gods, develop such type of sentimental momenta or sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras in their minds. When, either due to their intense concentration or in their weak moments, the activity of their crude mind is temporarily suspended that sentimental momentum is manifest in their minds&#146; eyes and they think that they are really seeing such-and-such spirit or god, or that a spirit or god has directly spoken to them. When the subtler kos&#x301;a or layer of the mind is self-hypnotized, they think that they themselves have become such-and-such spirit or god: this is a temporary paroxysmal demonomania or theomania. But such superstitious sam&#x301;karas cannot disturb the minds of those with developed knowledge, who have realized that spirits and gods are the visionary products of mental weakness due to ignorance; and so they will not see spirits nor be possessed by them. No matter how much they hear the tales of ghosts, they will never believe in their existence. Story-telling &ndash; the emotionally excitable language of the story-teller &ndash; may temporarily thrill them and make their hair stand on end &ndash; but nothing more than this. Similarly, there are many people who become terrified of ghosts, seeing extraordinarily strange things like a cat suspended in the air or bones being thrown by sorcery or black magic. But those who know that these are all merely but the plays of the atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a or the astral mind, do not become at all disturbed; rather they try to expose these antisocial criminals to rectify their nature. Planchette (&ldquo;ouija board&rdquo;) also falls in the same category: it has nothing to do with spirits.<!-- /block --></p>

No matter how much sin or virtue you may commit or earn, it cannot be eternal and so you cannot endlessly enjoy or suffer the consequence of your sinful or virtuous actions. The unit entity is activated only by the help of a unit and since that activation or process of action cannot keep itself concerned with one unit alone for a long time, no action can be the cause of boundless pleasure or boundless pain. Hence the pursuit of transitory objects cannot give you everlasting happiness. Brahma is an eternal Entity: It is impossible to attain It only by paying lip-service to Brahma-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. When the mind is all the while absorbed in external transactions. &ldquo;So know Naciketa&#x301;, that the rank of Yama &ndash; whatever I have not attained through the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of virtue &ndash; is not eternal.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

Thus, Patna&#146;s existence is not an absolute truth. Similar is the case of Yama. When does the Yama or the controller exist, when the system of control is in force, or even if only a certain number of things are under control. So, if the Yama or controller exists, two or more entities &ndash; control and the controlled &ndash; will also have to exist.

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of my discourse today will be: Intuitional Science as described in the Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a-Yajurveda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The perceptible world is constructed with the cooperation of five fundamental elements. Ether (Vyoma) is the subtlest of these five elements. Due to its extreme subtleness the Vyomatattva is able to prove its existence only through its sound-Tanma&#x301;tra. In order to understand this Vyomatattva or its sound-waves or its sound-radiation, a special type of Scientific instrument is necessary. Except this Vyomatattva the remaining four elements you can easily make out with the help of your crude organs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Consciousness or Purus&#x301;a, however, is subtler than all the five elements. How can the senses apprehend this Conscious Entity, when they cannot easily catch the subtle Vyomatattva? The Consciousness or Purus&#x301;a-Entity is beyond the scope of mental or supramental sphere, for the object of the mental or supramental sphere is matter &ndash; the five elements or their semblances. That is why, you are unable to reach the Parama Purus&#x301;a or the Cosmic Consciousness with the help of your mind. Your mind will have to come back disappointed repeatedly, if it tries to reach Him, for He is beyond the reach of your imaginative power. You cannot get to Him through any common knowledge. Yama said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Yato va&#x301;co nivartante apra&#x301;pya manasa&#x301; saha;<br>A&#x301;nandam&#x301; Brahman&#x301;o vidva&#x301;n na vibheti kutashcana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The attainment of Brahma is not possible through mind, nor is it feasible through words. Frustration awaits both of them, if they are employed to attain Him. With the establishment in the Brahmic Bliss, mind, intellect, words &ndash; all get lost, for He is the self-same Happiness &ndash; the bliss absolute. One has to be established in Him through the exultant force of one&#146;s consciousness. After reaching Him, mind being non-existent, the six enemies (lust, anger, avarice, delusion, pride and envy) also cannot remain there. The Sa&#x301;dhaka then becomes free from all fears.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Tandurdarshaugu&#x301;d&#x301;hamanupravis&#x301;t&#x301;am guha&#x301;hitam&#x301; gahvares&#x301;t&#x301;harampura&#x301;n&#x301;am;<br>A&#x301;dhya&#x301;tmayoga&#x301;dhigamena devam&#x301; matva&#x301; dhiiro hars&#x301;ashokao jaha&#x301;ti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Consciousness is unseeable, i.e., He is not perceptible by the sight-organ. One cannot apprehend nor can one understand an extremely vast and extremely subtle thing through one&#146;s organs. Molecules and atoms are not apprehensible to man&#146;s organs due to their being too subtle. In order to see them or understand them one has to take the help of Scientific instruments. Similarly the Supreme Consciousness is not visible (He is, however, not invisible), that is to say, one has to take pains to &ldquo;see&rdquo; Him. Just as intellectual and scientific vision is necessary for seeing molecules and atoms, similarly spiritual vision is necessary for seeing the Supreme Brahma, i.e., He is attainable only through spiritual knowledge. Hence in order to attain Him you have got to do upavas&#x301;a, which means worship.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The word, Gu&#x301;d&#x301;ha means deep. He is deep. With superficial sentiment or thought it is impossible for you to know Him. To know Him you have to go deep inside &ndash; you will have to be introspective. External sight will not do. The one that you see as an ordinary man by your external sight, is actually a conscious entity, if you see him with your internal sight. The one that you see to be an animal or an inanimate object by your superficial sight, is really a sentient entity, if you apply your internal sight. That is why, I say, in order to see Him, one has to go deep into the seen object. He is deep &ndash; very deep and its is due to this intrinsicality that He abides in all the entities in an immutable form. While going to see Him in this state of supreme unicity, all distinctions of superficial objects thin away into air. In reality, the first and the last word of spiritual Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to see the synthesis of many in One in a single form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Physics is characteristically analytical. So the investigation or research on matter is carried out externally. But in the sphere of investigation and intuitive comprehension of what is characteristically unific or synthetic, there is no other alternative than to take recourse to introspection. This Purus&#x301;a Entity is inherent and permanent in all objects and so to &ldquo;see&rdquo; Him one has got to establish oneself in the subtlest of the subtle, deepest of the deep sphere. He abides in the innermost recess or the fundamental intellect as its Supreme Knower. He is the vital Entity of that cavity &ndash; that sense of ego, which is within you and that is why, He has been called &ldquo;caverned&rdquo; (Guha&#x301;hita). In order to know Him you will have to proceed in a straight and simple way into the inner realm, making your thought subtler and yet subtler.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->When one attains intuitional knowledge, all one&#146;s troubles and woes disappear. Do you know why? Mind is the perceiver of pleasure and pain, but Brahma is even above the supramental stage. In order to attain Him you have got to outstep the limit of your mind and along with it you will have to leave behind all the pleasurable and sufferable junks of your distorted mind. He is ancient &ndash; He is beyond the scope of time. To Him the spatial, temporal and personal reputations are of no value, for each of these is a particular manifestation of the mind. You cannot possess Him through your worldly erudition or by the stamp of your degrees and diplomas for all worldly knowledge is subject to, time, space and person. Being spontaneous or self-manifest in spiritualism, He is not dependent on any second worldly entity. To achieve that Brahma who is the supreme goal of spirituality, one has to take recourse to spiritual sacrifice (Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;). Not with the eyes of others &ndash; not with the spectacles of others, you will &ldquo;see&rdquo; Him within you with your own &ldquo;eyes&rdquo;. You will move inward, not on any other vehicle but by virtue of your own inspirational propulsion. A calm and collected individual, who is a genuine spiritual aspirant, attains Brahma in this very manner and with the attainment of Brahma one goes beyond the reach of pleasure and pain &ndash; one does not have those mental distortions like pleasure and pain. He attains a state which is called the state of supreme bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Etacchrutva&#x301; samparigrhya&#x301;mattyah pravrhya dharmyaman&#x301;umetamapya;<br>Sa modate modaniiyam&#x301; hi labdhva&#x301; vivrta sadma naciketasammanye.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->What is the result of learning this intuitional science from a competent preceptor? By dint of this intuitional science man learns to understand thoroughly what is temporal and what is eternal. The scriptures call this power of understanding the eterno-temporal discrimination (Nityanitya&#x301; viveka). You will accept only the eternal and shun the temporal. It is on the strength of this intuitional science that man knows what is mortal and what is immortal, i.e., who or which is liable to destruction and who or which is established in indestructibility. With the help of this Nitya&#x301;nitya Viveka &ndash; this discriminating judgment about mortality and immortality, man pursues the path of virtue. What is the dharma or the characteristic of the living beings? It is the endeavour to attain happiness. Why does a living being crave for happiness? For self-preservation. Why do you eat and drink? To keep yourself alive &ndash; to attain happiness. From this you very well understand this too, that to love whatever little is lasting within your present entity &ndash; whatever is its essence, is your dharma. This dharma or sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; teaches you to keep your subtlest self aloof from all transitory objects, as the result of which your eternal self gets healthy nourishments - gets more and more developed on the path of progress. That is why, this true sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the self is defined in the scriptures as the path of nourishment (pus&#x301;t&#x301;ima&#x301;rga). He who does not understand or recognize this true dharma or characteristic, verily regards the body as the sole factor. I don&#146;t criticize those mentally undeveloped creatures, who regard their bodies as the summum bonum of their lives but for human beings to entertain such thoughts is nothing short of paying the mind a left-handed compliment. The funniest part of it is that such a person flouts the mind with the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->A display of such a perverse mentality we come across in the Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka philosophy. To them the transitory body is the supreme entity. The materialists are reluctant to give any importance to the mind in their philosophy. Not only that, they very often even hesitate to clearly admit mind&#146;s apperception or self-consciousness. Yet these materialists sometimes want to publicize themselves as pragmatists or behaviourists. They want to say that they will not tread the path of logic and reasoning, for in that path people &ldquo;make a day of night and a night of day&rdquo; - &ldquo;We are simple, toiling folk. We want to pass our days in peace with food to eat and clothes to wear and behind this simple demand the Supportology (!) or Practicology (!) that exists is our philosophy.&rdquo; Even by making such observation they get caught in their own net.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the practical field the utility of things is determined by the mind. The feasibility of the codes of procedure and conduct is also determined by the mind. &ldquo;To live in peace with food to eat and clothes to wear&rdquo; is also done for the satisfaction of mind. And above all, no matter what &ldquo;logy&rdquo; or &ldquo;ism&rdquo; is propounded, the supporting doctrine &ndash; the Supportology (!), must depend on imaginativeness (mental sanction). Every mental disease or every spiritual disease is not Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da or illusionism. Even by keeping contact between the earthy world and the human mind, spiritual philosophy can be established. Ananda Marga is a philosophy of this type.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Some of those that are comparatively imaginative regard Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a or the crude mind as the Ru&#x301;h or soul. Some identify the astral minds like atima&#x301;nasa, vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya and hiran&#x301;yamaya kos&#x301;as with it, but the real preceptor, possessed of the knowledge of the divine truth, from whom you will learn the Brahmic or intuitional knowledge, will make you understand that the soul is a lot subtler than these Kos&#x301;as or shells of the mind, each of which is mutable and so evanescent or transitory - the soul alone is eternal. So the happiness that you will get in the worship of the spiritual knowledge, will be permanent happiness, and that is why it is called A&#x301;nanda or divine bliss. A&#x301;nanda is not to be had from transitory objects. The transitory or temporal objects will come and go; sometimes they will make you laugh and sometimes they will make you cry. No matter how endearing the temporal things be, one day they will surely and undoubtedly leave you in the lurch, and abjectly beggarly. But He will not make you wail He is an eternal, non-evolutive, immutable Entity. The Yama said, &ldquo;O Naciketa&#x301;, the broad gateway to the realm of God lies open before you. One who has acquired a thorough knowledge of mortal objects, has verily acquired the knowledge of the both the perishable and the imperishable ones.&rdquo; With the development of mental faculties as one proceeds from the transient happiness to permanent happiness or A&#x301;nanda, one gets more and more inclined towards his mental happiness in preference to the physical joy. For the love of country or many such subtle happinesses, a person makes no bones to lay down his life. These are actually the signs of preponderance of the human mind. The happiness of cats and dogs is purely physical. In such receptacles as their mental happiness cannot have the priority. Beat them and then call them to eat some delectable food, they will come running after it. But human beings are reluctant to stand the least dishonour or any little blow to their mind. A person who serves you under circumstantial pressure and keeps your mind constantly humored by his sycophancy, is actually at heart not very pleased with you. He constantly tries to escape the bondage of slavery. You cannot conquer human mind through circumstantial pressure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Through As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga Yoga, as laid down in the Ananda Marga, a Sa&#x301;dhaka, conscious of his/her body and self, can gradually awaken the dormant mental power and with the help of this developed mind he/she can eventually establish himself/herself in spiritual self. In this seity &ndash; in this characteristic self he/she gets real A&#x301;nanda. So, I say, learn the intuitional knowledge from a proper preceptor. You cannot learn this through empirical knowledge. Intuitional knowledge cannot be gained from books. For this one has to go to a preceptor with devotion and reverence. Try to awaken your latent devotional sentiment. It will come to you, if you so wish. Once the devotion is awakened, you shall get divine mercy without doubt.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->With the attainment of only a wee bit of divine grace the ego starts disappearing from the crude human body, the Nitya&#x301;nitya Viveka gets awakened and this discriminating judgment establishes the sadhaka in the Brahmic Consciousness. Remember, in the path of meditation devotion is the paramount factor. Wherever there is devotion God&#146;s mercy is there &ndash; it has got to be.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Physical attachments are very difficult to give up, they die hard. Preservation of the crude body and attachment to the body are not one and the same thing. But where the preservation of the body is not jeopardized, or does not stand in danger, even then people are surprisingly attached to their physical body. At the time of an earthquake a mother runs out of the house, leaving her sleeping child in bed and then half way down when the thought of her child arises in her mind, she runs back again to save her child. The quicker the mother&#146;s remembrance of her child, the less her attraction for her own body. A mother who is above such attraction will think of her child first and take it away along with her. Through proper Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; alone one is able to conquer such bodily and all sorts of attachments. All bondages of sensuous attractions of those that have been able to awaken their subtle selves through Ananda Marga As&#x301;ta&#x301;ungika Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, are bound to be resolved.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->What is Supreme or Parama Brahma? How does He look like? This you cannot know through the so-called, ritualistic religion. Shra&#x301;ddhakriya&#x301; or post-obit ceremonies and rituals for the souls of the dead, Sha&#x301;ntikriya&#x301; or ceremonious propitiation of deities and evil planets, ceremonial fasts, sacrificial fire or oblation (Yajin&#x32D;a) and various other social and popular extroversive, ritualistic functions and ceremonies with flowers, Bilvapatra (Aegle folia), water of the Ganges etc. &ndash; none of these can attain you Brahma, for these ceremonies are external and showy. How can you reach the Life of your life, the Soul of your soul with these showy and superficial paraphernalia? Three entities eventually emerge, wherever these rituals take place &ndash; religious ceremony, the fruit or reward of such a religious ceremony and persons who organize the religious ceremony. For the sake of crude, external, material gains the authors of these so-called religious ceremonies; perform these rituals. Really speaking, the word, Dharma, should not be associated with these ceremonies. Dharma is the spiritual meditation that a sadhaka does for the attainment of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, the source of Infinite Bliss. And how about Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma? Although I cannot but call the effort for the attainment of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma also dharma in the popular language, yet He is actually not conformable to dharma? Then is He conformable to adharma &ndash; the negation of dharma? No. He is not that, too, He does not come under any of the two categories. Dharma and adharma are both attributive (subjectivated and objectivated sentiments). All attributive sentiments fall within the scope of mind &ndash; fall in the net of causality. Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma is beyond the ambit of causality. He is above Dharma and Adharma. He is none of whatever had ever been created, or of whatever have been or will be created. Each of these is the objectivated manifestation of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, but in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma exists neither antecedence nor impedence, neither gain<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> nor loss<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> &ndash; nor accumulation either (there is no question of creation of the third as the result of the union of the two)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->. Naciketa&#x301; prays to Yama, &ldquo;O Lord of Death! I want to get established in the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, who is beyond all attributes &ndash; beyond to-be and not-to-be. Please tell me something about Him.&rdquo; Yama replies,<!-- /block --></p>

Although one may try to explain the state of Sagun&#x301;a, yet there is no feasible way other than the use of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra to explain His initial expression &ndash; indeed there is no other choice. On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra as a term of expression is a wonderful unifying link between Nirgun&#x301;a and Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. In the written language only a dot (.) is used for Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. <span class=Bengali>&#x0993;&#x09AE;</span> (om) is used for the sonic manifestation of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma and the phonic sign ([BENGALI CRESCENT SYMBOL]) is symbolic of the expression which is just about to take place.<!-- /block --></p>

One who has known and heard this on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, echoing in the vast sky as the Macro-sonic phenomenon and the mental sky as the micro-sonic one, has indeed caught the very essence of essences right in the palm of one&#146;s hand. Here one should bear in mind that when On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra stands for sound, to know it then is to hear or pronounce it. When On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is pronounced or sounded in the Brahmic Mind itself, it is then meaningless for the Sa&#x301;dhaka to pronounce it during his meditation of On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra.

Once Ra&#x301;ma and Laks&#x301;man&#x301;a were sailing in a boat towards Mithila across the Ganges. So far as the story goes, the boat turned into gold with touch of Rama&#146;s feet. When the boat reached the other end of the bank, the wife of the boatman came to know about this miracle. Down she brought all the woods and timbers from the house and started turning them into gold by bringing them into contact with Ra&#x301;ma&#146;s feet. Noticing the foolishness of his wife the boatman counselled her, &ldquo;Look here, how long are you going to toil like this? Act wisely. Take refuge under those feet, which have such miraculous power. If you do so, you will be able to turn any worldly object into gold at will.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

His worm-eaten mental flower shall not be worthy for worshipping the Lord. Entertaining no desire for sensuous happiness a man has to surrender oneself to the waves of the inscrutable Supreme Fountain-head, Brahma.

Death occurs to relative entities, not to consciousness. No birth is possible for the one, which is immutable, i.e., which has no second existence, and such an impeccable entity cannot be anything but the soul. The natural tendencies of worldly objects are: The death of one brings about the birth of another, the renunciation of one form begets the formation of another, the loss of one means the gain of another. In this endless process of building and re-building of the successive order the one that remains, we call, new or the new-born.

<a name="3..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->This A&#x301;tma&#x301;, or Soul, which is indestructible &ndash; which is immortal &ndash; is smaller than the molecule or atom, smaller than the small ultra-microscopic. Due to its smallness you cannot feel it with your sensory power. In the language of science, if you take molecule as the English equivalent of An&#x301;u, you will find a series of other things, even smaller than the atom, like proton, neutron, electron, etc., which are too subtle for your senses to grasp. Apprehension is possible only through the power of imagination. If you further try to analyse them, your imagination will stop functioning or will be compelled to get engrossed in a deep reverie. On the last Pha&#x301;lgun&#x301;ii Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301; (the full-moon of the month of Phalguna) I told you that the apprehending capacity of your organs for the small and the big things was limited. The organ concerned can apprehend only a particular wave-length, i.e., from one particular point of movement to another particular point, neither more nor less. Just as the soul is the molecule of the molecule on one hand, similarly it is greater than the great on the other. This being ultrasensual, you cannot apprehend it as it is. Just as you cannot see things properly in a dim light, similarly a blazing light dazzles your vision and you cannot see either. The soul abides in your mental horizon as the knower of your world of imagination and as the certifying witness or your existence. If you direct your sentimental entity towards Its great sentiment, then your emotion or thought, being on the higher plane, loses its pettiness. Your existence then is hardly distinguishable from It. If you direct your sentimental entity towards Its micro-atomic sentiment, then also your mind goes out of action. If you cherish the sentiment of attaining Him, you will have to be devoid of all sensuous desires by carefully and deftly bringing under control the selfish, individualistic frivolities of your mind. In such an event you attraction for the finite objects will disappear. You will bask in the sunshine of Macrocosmic favour. Your mind will then be installed in the super-celestial region of abiding tranquillity beyond the pale of weal or woe. Then alone you will be free from grief &ndash; then alone you will realize that Grand Glorious Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

In your mind you go out to London or America in a jiffy. But who actually goes there? Your objective mind of course &ndash; the mind, which is His object. Along with the mental travel to and fro, His knowership also remains, does it not? Now you understand that, inwardly and on His own, He goes on traversing distant and yet more distant countries. When the mind sleeps i.e., when the organs are inactive and all epithymetic actions (desires) are also at a standstill, He is supposed to be asleep also in the mind, isn&#146;t He? Well, does He have any movement? Yes, of course He has His movements. He is the Omneity &ndash; the all knowing seed. Even without an object He maintains His Supreme Existence. So you see, you cannot bind him with a single strand of quality. He imbibes different contrary attributes. Your mind, however, cannot have two contrary qualities like the refulgence of pleasure and the shadow of pain simultaneously. His mind being free from any singular bondage. He alone has been able to become the ultimate refuge of all kinds of contradictory objects. He is the wonderful conglomeration of pride and non-pride. The Yama said, &ldquo;None but I can attain Him&rdquo;. Yama means controller. The Yama is the prototype of restraint. Really speaking, without &ldquo;Yama&rdquo; or regulated sadhana, it is impossible to attain Him. A&#x301;tma or Soul is not attainable by one devoid of control. You will certainly realize the significance of this observation after you have pursued the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for some time. But then I have already told you many a time and I repeat again that restraint does not mean running away, giving up everything. Adequate and proper use of everything is what is called restraint. You can honour adequately every obligation of domestic life but you must never lose your head. When the animal instinct of hunger is there, you must eat but you must not invite a disease by taking excessive food out of greed.<!-- /block --></p>

He has neither a body nor a receptacle. It just cannot be nor is there any need for it. But how about these countless fragmentary manifestations which do have their bodies and yet they are His manifestations and are all within Him? Yes, that is the reason why He is the possessor of countless bodies, being bodiless Himself. The spiritual entity is not subject to any time, place or person, but the finite unit entities are their cooperative creations. He, being beyond their purview, i.e., outside the scope of mind, is absolutely free from all sorts of mental modifications of pleasure and pain. So one who identifies oneself with Him after attaining Him, becomes free from all sorts of pain. His mind gets stilled. He merges in the Macrocosmic Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>

So the existence of every created thing in this world has its value &ndash; has its mundane as well as spiritual utility. None is useless &ndash; none is a burden on the world. Knowingly or unknowingly all are working together as one beautiful team and one mind for the collective good of all. All are beaming in their self-surging glory. The giver knows the efficacy of charity, since the receiver is there. The advanced person is getting an opportunity to serve, since the backward man is there. He has evolved so many forms as per necessity. In each of these forms we see the different contours of His love, get scope for learning many things and are getting impetus to move towards Him. His radiance is being refracted through the veins and venules, molecules and atoms of every evolved object. Treating every microcosmic tendency as His own object for the good of the world, He has been afflicting Himself day in and day out with the painful affliction of their lives &ndash; suffering for them, and His diverse, manifested organisms are bowing down in reverence to His glory. All the loquacity of these ignorant beings is getting silenced before His exalted greatness. What a non-sa&#x301;dhaka regards as his or her wealth, son, husband etc., are in the eyes of a sa&#x301;dhaka, but the waves or the brilliant, activated expressions of the Cosmic Sea, wherein the sa&#x301;dhaka feels himself/herself consciously installed. He knows that the very Sea, in which or on whose breast those expressions are waking up and dozing off, is to him the Truth itself &ndash; has been making the beauty of his soul more charming every moment by encompassing him form all the ten directions.

You must have noticed, there are many people in our society that constantly keep track of great men and run up to them soliciting, &ldquo;Give us some advice. Tell us something about religion.&rdquo; Such religious discourses will cut no ice, if not substantiated by sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. It is wrong to think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is realizable by man through empirical knowledge or through study of a few dozens of philosophical books, rather, there is a greater possibility of one&#146;s receding from the path of spirituality. In such a case vanity becomes the chief characteristic of his nature. Brahma or the Supreme Entity cannot be attained through tall religious overtures to the human society nor through interesting recapitulations before it as to which and which great man said such and such things &ndash; as to how they walked, or through writing volumes of books. Do not entertain such silly ideas that you can hit the bull&#146;s eye so cheaply by dint of your intellect, for you shall not achieve Him through such shady means. To attain Brahma you shall have to do Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual meditation. You should make Him the only goal of your life. For this you require integrity, devotion and singular and earnest love for Him. He is not attainable without reverence and unflagging and unflinching devotion. When the devotional depth will come, love, too, will be out-brimming with high sentiments - will be full and over-flowing. When love will reach its completeness &ndash; its saturation point, self-immolation will become easy and simple. In that state alone will come your final realization of the Supreme Consciousness. Where &ldquo;I&rdquo; is, &ldquo;He&rdquo; is not&#8230; where &ldquo;He&rdquo; is, &ldquo;I&rdquo; is not. Remember, devotion is the pre-requisite of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Maturity of devotion is love and maturity of love is He.<!-- /block --></p>

When your longing is towards the crude, you will undoubtedly become crudified yourself. Your mind will leap from one crude desire to another - will run form one object after another in a wild pursuit. Such is the way of the materialistic, isn&#146;t it? But an aspirant, being in the midst of all and making the right use of everything, proceeds towards the supreme goal.

<a name="3..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma (or the Supreme, unsubjectivated Pure Consciousness) is your supreme goal. Even Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (the Subjectivated Transcendentality) is devoured by Nirgun&#x301;a. The Brahma-Sa&#x301;dhaka knows that Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, who is a composite of cognitive faculty and operative principle &ndash; a combination of introversive consciousness and introversive force, eventually turns into food for the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. That is to say, with His death all His feelings and emotions also disappear and so death serves as ghee (clarified butter) for the ultimate food of the Nirgun&#x301;a. Just as flour alone does not make a good food by itself and it requires ghee to make eatable, similarly the ghee-like death makes the Consciousness-cum-principle like food delectable and palatable to the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. So I say that this death too is a benevolent system. When the overall sentiment (the subjectivated and objectivated state) of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma merges in the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, that is to say, when a Sa&#x301;dhaka attains salvation, soleness or absolute identity with the Divine Essence, i.e., final liberation, all the onus of his ego lightens. Prakrti, the xylem or the root or plastic cause of creation, can no more throw him into the pit of pleasure and pain. So in order to attain Him &ndash; whom you cannot attain through empirical or worldly knowledge anyhow &ndash; get busy and be up and doing from this very moment and get proper guidance from a proper preceptor.<!-- /block --></p>
