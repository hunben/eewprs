<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Kos&#x301;a means A&#x301;dha&#x301;ra or base. Are the Saptaloka (seven spheres) and pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a (five sheaths) separate from the A&#x301;tman (soul)? Is the relation between them that of the container and the contained? If we say; &ndash; Eko Brahma Dvitiiya na&#x301;sti. (There is only one Brahma and no other), then of A&#x301;dha&#x301;ra and A&#x301;dhrta, which is Brahma and which is not? If either the container or the contained is considered as Brahma does that mean that the other is not Brahma? If it is argued that Saptaloka and Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a are the base of Brahma, then the existence of some other entity outside of Brahma has to be acknowledged. For instance, suppose there is a person in a house. The house and the person exist separately. The house is the container and the person is the contained. Hence, the house is separate from the person. In the Pain&#x32D;cakosa&#x301;, A&#x301;tman is the contained and the Kos&#x301;a is the container. Clearly the container must be bigger than that which it contains. There is nothing bigger than Parama&#x301;tman; hence it cannot have a container. Should we then consider that the Saptaloka and the Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a do not exist? Yes, for the Saptaloka is included in Brahma. Their aggregate is Brahma. The Jiiva is included in the Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a. There is a subtle difference between the Jiiva and Brahma. In the Jiiva there are two types of &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling &ndash; one is its mind created by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and the other is [[its knowledge-filled state &ndash; the reflected expression  of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; Himself &ndash; that is, its (the jiiva&#146;s) jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;.]] Jiiva&#x301;tman is the real &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling of Jiiva or unit soul. Of the seven spheres, Brahma is unaffected only in the Satyaloka and in the remaining six Lokas, Brahma is affected by Ma&#x301;ya. It can also be explained in this way, that the six Lokas are created within Brahma which itself pervades the expressed universe as imperishable Brahma. Brahma has no base. Excepting Satyaloka, the remaining six Lokas are created within Brahma, in the very midst of Brahma. Is it the case then that the light is different from its original source? The Saptalokas are its evolution &ndash; these are the manifestation of Brahma &ndash; the relationship is not that of the container and the contained. The difference between the Jiiva&#x301;tman and Parama&#x301;tman exists only so long as there is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling of the unit soul. (Jiiva bha&#x301;va).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is the relationship between Jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;n and Parama&#x301;tman? What is Jiiva (unit soul?) The base of the physical body is the Kos&#x301;as. Here, the base is bigger than that which is based upon it. The Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a is bigger than the Annamaya Kos&#x301;a. Then the Manomaya Kos&#x301;a is bigger than the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a. The Atima&#x301;nas Kos&#x301;a is bigger than even the Manomaya Kos&#x301;a. The Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya Kos&#x301;a is larger than this. The Hiran&#x301;maya Kos&#x301;a is bigger than the Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nmaya Kos&#x301;a and the biggest of all is the Satyaloka. All of these aspects are limited to the unit soul and all of them are its bases. Now, what is the relationship between the base and the based? The relationship is that of a subject and an object. For instance, the physical body is the object of enjoyment and the mind is the enjoyer. That is, our body is the object of enjoyment of our mind and the mind remains attached to it. The body is the base of the mind and the mind is intimately attached to its base.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Mahattattva is the pure &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling of the subtlest state of the mind. Every Jiiva has this &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, and where the A&#x301;tman assumes special &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling it becomes Jiiva&#x301;tman.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Where the A&#x301;tman remains as the knower &ldquo;I&rdquo; of Shyam Babu, it is called Shyam Babu&#146;s A&#x301;tman. In every living being all the spheres &ndash; right from the Ka&#x301;mamaya to the Hirammaya kos&#x301;a &ndash; are to be meditated upon. The knower behind the meditative power of the mind is the A&#x301;tman. The relationship of the A&#x301;tman and the mind is that of a subject and an object. The mind is the thinking subject of the body and the A&#x301;tman is the knowing subject of the mind. Then, are there really innumerable souls and what is the difference amongst them? The difference is that a soul is taken in different aspects due to the difference in its objects. When there is a singular knowing entity (Sagun&#x301;a Brahma) behind all minds, then taking the collective view Brahma is the knower of all the knowers in the perishable and imperishable states (i.e. within or without the influence of Prakrti) of the Jiiva. Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is the knower, the perishable and the imperishable. He who is absolutely perishable and absolutely imperishable is Brahma. The fragmentary or reflected perishable, or fragmentary or reflected imperishable is Jiivabha&#x301;va. Nirgun&#x301;a is neither perishable nor imperishable. It&#146;s beyond these. It is absolutely liberated. Does Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (Collective Imperishable) have no influence over the unit imperishable? Most certainly it has.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Prakrti is mutable and Purus&#x301;a immutable. Brahma is overpowering and as the controller He is called Ishvara or Purus&#x301;ottama. By being absorbed in Him, people get liberated from worldly attachment. How is liberty attained? What is the object of a Jiiva (unit soul)? Suppose I am Ram or Shyam. Now Ram and Shyam look upon the world with their own respective viewpoints. The mind takes the shape of its object. When the mind makes Him its object, it is transformed into Him. By suffusing itself with Cosmic feelings it attains infinitude and sees the entire universe contained in Him. It has been said in the scriptures: &ldquo;Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati.&rdquo; (The knower of Brahma becomes Brahma.) When the unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; is transformed into the collective or Cosmic &ldquo;I&rdquo; then the Atman attains oneness by fusing into the soul of the collective &ldquo;I.&rdquo; That is, it unifies or becomes one with the A&#x301;tman of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In day-to-day life a person maintains his existence in the physical state. Crude matter forms the object of enjoyment of the mind. On account of the crude matter being its object of enjoyment, the mind itself becomes crude. Humankind&#146;s primary concern regarding food and clothes is the concern of Ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a and inevitably the mind is in association with crude objects. In such circumstances, how can there be any opportunity for self-elevation? Animals are constantly associated with crude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;ha&#x301;rnidra&#x301;bhayamaethunain&#x32D;ca<br>Sa&#x301;ma&#x301;yametad pashubhirnara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;m<br>Dharma hi tes&#x301;a&#x301;madhiko vishes&#x301;o<br>Dharmenahiina&#x301;h pashubhih sama&#x301;na&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The mental tendencies of appetite, sleep, fear and sex urge are found among humans and animals. So what is the difference between the two? The distinction between humans and animals is that humans have a sense of Dharma. Human beings practise Dharma, but animals do not. A person who does not pursue the path of Dharma in spite of being endowed with the human form is just like a beast.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Human beings advance from subtle to the subtlest or degenerate from crude to the crudest, according to their own propensity. Many isms are based on the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a. In one socio-economic theory, the economic factor is the only factor. But the Ka&#x301;mamaya is only one Kos&#x301;a. Even trees also possess Ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a and that is why they derive their vital energy from the earth, water and air. Where the Annamaya Kos&#x301;a dominates, all the remaining kos&#x301;as are dormant. The mind identifies itself with crude objects and therefore has no &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. For this reason, the A&#x301;tman is also devoid of perception. While the mind is sleeping in the dormant or latent state, it does not permit the Jiiva&#x301;tman, which is but a reflection of Parama&#x301;tman, to reveal itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Confinement to the Annamaya Kos&#x301;a tends to crudify a person since it does not allow for psychic elevation. There is some scope for discussion of philosophical controversies, which have arisen with respect to the Mamomaya Kos&#x301;a, On account of mental difference, different philosophical thoughts have sprung up e.g. Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Christianity, and so on. Only in spirituality do we find discussions on subjects from the subtle to the subtlest, including the A&#x301;tman. The mind is the object of A&#x301;tman. To attain A&#x301;tman, blend the mind with its original subject. Unify the object with the subject. The relationship between them is the same as between you and your hand. There is only one way to self-realisation and that is to fuse the mind with the knower of the mind and eliminate the crude manifestation of the A&#x301;tman. How is this possible? It is only possible by the introversion of the tendencies, which can be achieved through knowledge and Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. It is not possible to be introverted until each and every cell (kos&#x301;a) is realized. When the mind realizes that the physical body is the vehicle of the mind, then you will know that there is progress in Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In other words it is necessary to have perfect conception of each kos&#x301;a and for this it is necessary to know where one kos&#x301;a ends and another begins. There are two minds &ndash; one immature and the other mature; one introverted, the other extroverted. Only the knowledge of these five Kos&#x301;as (pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;as) can be the perfect knowledge. Take a ripe mango, for example. Although the pulp and the seed of a ripe mango remain together they are in fact, separate. Ripeness means perfection.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->This is the difference between Dharma and Sectism. Dharma makes each Kos&#x301;a perfect and enables a person to achieve perfection in Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Only through the achievement of perfection are different portions differentiated from the original stuff. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is based on philosophy and supported by logic. In olden times people were under the impression that the world was comprised solely of matter and they never thought to go beyond the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a. Had they contemplated a little deeper, they would have realized that they were totally mistaken. Similarly, many modern philosophies are solely materialistic. Their propounders did not fully apply their minds and hence they cannot be deemed to be perfect philosophies. Only those philosophies which carry us to the highest levels of the soul by observing every current of the mind are the real philosophies. The rest are only academical logics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->What is sectism, mazhab or religion? Some people encourage us to worship idols, others encourage us to have a dip in the Ganges. All these things are created within the mind and are destroyed there. Happiness and heaven, afflictions and hell &ndash; all are mental conceptions in the physical world. They are all destroyed in the Mamomaya Kos&#x301;a. The proponents&#146; souls are confined to the Ma&#x301;nomaya Kos&#x301;a and they are &ldquo;Bhuktaye na tu muktaye&rdquo;, seekers of enjoyment and not the seekers of salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Some sects hold that happiness comes after death, but who will enjoy that happiness? The mind, of course. But where does the mind go after the destruction of its vehicle &ndash; the physical brain? Who will enjoy the pleasures? The A&#x301;tman pervades as an indivisible form, as an all-knowing entity. There is no A&#x301;tman in the grave, nor does the question of its waking up arise. In such sectism the Manomaya Kos&#x301;a is called the soul, however if there is only the soul, then there would be no fear of pain or pleasure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Anejadekam&#x301; manaso javiiyo<br>naennaddeva a&#x301;pnuvan pu&#x301;rvamars&#x301;at<br>Taddha&#x301;vato&#146;nya&#x301;natyeti tis&#x301;tha&#x301;t<br>tasminna&#x301;po ma&#x301;tarishva&#x301; dadha&#x301;ti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Ordinarily sectisms terminate in the Ma&#x301;nomaya Kos&#x301;a. Idolatry can elevate a person up to the A&#x301;tima&#x301;nas Kos&#x301;a, but no further. Many persons aspire to achieve happiness by devoting themselves to idolatry. They do not aspire to get absorbed in Paramatman and remain close to Him. Buddhism rises above this, since it also provides for the annihilation of samska&#x301;ra. Annihilation of the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feelng is called merging into the Supreme. Buddhism does not recognize the soul, but speaks of annihilation of the ego; but who will annihilate the ego? It is the ego which will obliterate the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. So egoism then, must be considered as the subtlest expression of mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The subtlest expression of mind is in the Hiran&#x301;maya Kos&#x301;a, which is the first expression of Mahattattva. Establishment in this Kos&#x301;a in a universal manner is Savikalpa  Sama&#x301;dhi. When after emerging from the Sams&#x301;kara, the Hiran&#x301;yamaya merges in attributeless Brahma, then this is called Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi. Those who have attained the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a will say that it is not proper to steal since, if we steal, others may also steal from us. This is the trend of thought of the materialists. Their thinking is distorted with selfishness. One should not steal for the sake of keeping the mind pure. That is the correct approach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;as shall have to be perfected, but how is it possible? They can be consummated only through the practice of Yama and Niyama. The Annamaya Kos&#x301;a is perfected through A&#x301;sanas (physical postures). Yama and Niyama Sa&#x301;dhana perfect the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a. The Manomaya Kos&#x301;a is perfected through Pra&#x301;na&#x301;ya&#x301;ma. Through Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra the Atima&#x301;nasa Kos&#x301;a is perfected. The Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nmaya Kos&#x301;a is perfected through Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; and the Hiran&#x301;maya Kos&#x301;a through Dhya&#x301;na. Only Dhya&#x301;na Sama&#x301;dhi gives access to the soul. Pious persons are those who are earnest in their efforts to perfect the Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a. Human existence consists of the five kos&#x301;as and spiritual practice is eightfold. This spiritual practice is Dharma. That which does not provide for the explanation of the Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a is not Dharma, but sectism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Why is As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga Yoga called Dharma? The purpose of Dharma is to attain perfect happiness and perfect happiness is the attainment of the soul, there being only partial happiness in each Kos&#x301;a. So long as the soul is not attained every Kos&#x301;a has to be perfected. Each Kos&#x301;a has to be taken care of. One Kos&#x301;a cannot be perfected to the exclusion of the rest. Where there is perfect happiness there is Dharma. Everything else yields only partial happiness and is therefore sectism. Sectism leads to preya (superficial and immediate gains) and only Dharma leads to Shreya (ultimate and real gains.) Everything else leads to crudeness. Dharma leads to Supreme Consciousness and only that which upholds and sustains the soul is Dharma. The Dharma of fire is to burn and the Dharma of living beings is to attain happiness. Where there is pursuit of Preya there is Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya. The happiness of heaven and the fear of hell are creations of the mind. Dharma has no fear since through Dharma one attains the original state. A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga alone is Dharma and all the rest are sectisms.<!-- /block --></p>

For this reason one must be indebted to Sagun&#x301;a Brahma.

Such a person awakens the sentiments of Dharma in the mind of the disciple through sweet sounding Kirtan, etc. If the Atima&#x301;nasa Kos&#x301;a of one person attracts the Manomaya Kos&#x301;a of another it is called Ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii or Paesha&#x301;cika (demonic Vidya&#x301;. When the Manomaya Kos&#x301;a of one person attracts the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a of another it is Bhuta Vidya or hypnotism. If the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a of one person attracts the Annamaya Kos&#x301;a of another, it is known as the force of physical attraction. Sagun&#x301;a Brahma graces the living beings with divine grace. You have been blessed. Use it properly and attain the state of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma by annihilating the barrier between the subjective and objective angles of vision. The highest object, the supreme attainment, is to attain the Nirgun&#x301;a state. The aspirant says:<!-- /block --></p>

Not only has the call come, but you are hearing it and it is vibrating in every cell of your body. Will you now lie in the corner of your house as an inert being and waste your time by clinging to old skeletons and bemoaning them? The Supreme Being is calling you in the roar of the ocean, in the thunder of the clouds, in the speed of lightning, in the meteor&#146;s flaming fires. Nothing good will come from  idleness. Get up and awake the clouded chivalry of your dormant youth. It may be that the path is not strewn with flowers and that inferiority complex will be attempting to hold fast your each advancing step, but even then you have to proceed onwards tearing the shroud of darkness. You will tear the thick darkness of despair as you advance in the racing chariot radiant with the Sun&#146;s brilliance towards the attainment of the Supreme state.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The word Bhakti (devotion) means worshiping. For worshiping, both the person who worships and the person who is worshiped must be present. Hence as long as there remains a difference between the devotee and God, there is the opportunity and necessity of Bhakti-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Bhakti signifies longing for the Supreme &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word &ldquo;Para&#x301;nurakti&rdquo; should be considered. Rakti denotes Raga or attachment. Anurakti means maintaining attachment with or being attracted by a particular entity after having understood its meaning. Anurakti is of two kinds. The Anurakti for the Supreme Brahma or Infinite Cosmic Consciousness is Para&#x301;nurakti. The Anurakti for Brahma under the sway of Prakrti or the Anurakti for the crude manifestations is termed Apara&#x301;nurakti. God is an object for Para&#x301;nurakti. When the aspirant considers the Supreme Brahma to be his or her own, it is termed Bhajana&#x301; or Bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The two varieties of Anurakti exist only on account of the introverting or extroversial actions of the mind; that is extroversion denotes Apara&#x301;nurakti, while introversion denotes Para&#x301;nurakti. The externalizing forces subordinate a person to the sense organs and render him or her crude. Such a person is divested of his or her spiritual force. Para&#x301;nurakti on the other hand releases a person from the grips of the Indriyas and through sublime meditations establishes him or her in the finer sublimated senses, in the infinite blessedness beyond the bounds of the Universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now the question arises as to whether Bhakti is natural or unnatural for the living beings. All the things we see in the manifested Universe, whether they be conscious or crude, have attraction for one another. This attraction is the Dharma of the created Universe and as a consequence the continuity of the thought projections of the Cosmic Mind is maintained. Therefore, I say that attraction is natural for everything. It is due to the attractions for one another amongst myriads of heavenly bodies oscillating in the infinite space that balance is maintained in the firmament. In every planet or sub-planet, there is the effort for self-preservation. People run and assemble at a place which yields good water, good fruits and fertile lands, because they find adequate materials for self-preservation. The bee flies around the flowers in quest of honey for the sake of preserving its existence. Every entity runs more towards that which is more lasting and secure and which will provide it with greater and longer safety. People run after money because they believe that they can maintain their lives under the shelter of money, that money alone can save them. They do not know that money can provide neither a permanent stability nor securely founded shelter. During the span of one&#146;s life money will come and go several times. At times its glamour will dazzle our eyes and at other times the lack of money will make one cry from hunger. Not only money, but all finite objects have this characteristic. One uses finite objects with the intention of enjoying only one of their portions, then sooner or later the residue will be reached. That which is finite cannot permanently remain the object of your enjoyment or your permanent resort. The existence of all these things is dependent on other things &ndash; bounded by the limits of time, place and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In philosophical terms the attraction for finite objects is called A&#x301;sakti and the attraction for the infinite is Bhakti. Ra&#x301;ga or Rakti means both the attraction for the infinite and attraction for the finite objects. &ldquo;Sakasmae parampremaru&#x301;pa&#x301;,&rdquo; that is, Bhakti is the symbol of love and this love is dedicated towards Iishvara, signified by the letter &ldquo;ka&rdquo;. In the vedic language the letter &ldquo;Ka&rdquo; means God. God is indescribable. God is the nucleus of the Universe and is supreme love personified.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. Where a change in Purus&#x301;a occurs on account of the influence of Prakrti, the mind comes into being. The senses and organs are the recipients and the vehicles of the workings of the mind; so the mind is the worldly knower or subject of all worldly acts. The mind is the object of the untainted knowing Purus&#x301;a, and Purus&#x301;a is its subject or knowing self. When the mind as an object merges into Purus&#x301;a as the subject, distinction between the object and the subject ceases to exist. This is the supreme state of the aspirant. However when the mind is guided by Avidya&#x301;, that is, when it a seeks enjoyment in the finite objects, then, that externalized energy of the mind is ultimately identified with the crude object. This is so whether this object is a creation of the mind itself or is taken from the crude quinquelemental world.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Pure Bhakti cannot be based on finite objects since the very existence of finite objects is derived from extroverted feelings. Nevertheless, I painfully observe that many people confine their love and devotion to finite objects and as a result they do not attain the pervasiveness which love confers. They do not realize that every tiny atom of this vast universe is a creative manifestation of Cosmic Consciousness &ndash; God&#146;s grand expression. They spend millions on the installation of idols and do not relent on seeing the afflictions of suffering humanity. They don&#146;t hesitate when killing in cold blood a young goat for the so-called satiation of a goddess.<!-- /block --></p>

The name and form of objects undergo changes with the change in time and place. The child changes into a youth, the youth into an old person, and the old person into a dead person. Wise people take every object of the world as the expression of one and single Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and are not be affected by pain or pleasure when they witness changes in the name and form of any particular object.

An aspirant is called Ta&#x301;masika when instead of being drawn to the Ra&#x301;jasika or Sattvagun&#x301;ii splendors, he or her practices Bhakti after having immersed their Tamogun&#x301;ii existence in the static force.<!-- /block --></p>

They are Sa&#x301;ttvika Sa&#x301;dhakas, in as much as they do not seek attainment of the Supreme. However, this Sa&#x301;ttvika Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is not a superior degree of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or the Supreme Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, because none of the above control the energies of the aspirant and direct them towards the adored, the Supreme Brahma. The aim of the aspirant is channelized in a different direction and he or she carries on with an inferior object. All the three such Bhaktas &ndash; Sa&#x301;ttvika, Ra&#x301;jasika and Ta&#x301;masika are Gaon&#x301;ii or inferior Bhakti. Where there is no object other than the Supreme Brahma, it is called Mukhya Bhakti. In Mukhya&#x301; Bhakti There the aspirant is free from the three gun&#x301;as. He or she is absorbed in spiritual practices to Nirgun&#x301;a Bhakti. In general then, Bhakti can be classified into many groups according to the object in view.<!-- /block --></p>

I do not know. I love Him just because I like to love Him. Should I not love? He is the life of my life the soul of my soul&rdquo;. This type of Bhakti is Nirgun&#x301;a Bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>

This attainment is known by the name of Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; Bhakti. This Bhakti also may be classed as Nirgun&#x301;a Bhakti, but due to the dormant vanity for wealth or knowledge, the supreme state is not attained. This is also called Pradha&#x301;nibhuta Bhakti. Pradha&#x301;nibhuta is the highest stage of Gaonii or inferior Bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>

This is the culmination of Bhakti, it is the highest pitch of Bhakti. If there is undivided knowledge with the object, then there exists one and only one entity, and that is why it is called Kevala&#x301; Bhakti. Kevala&#x301; Bhakti is not attained by baths, exercises or austerity.

This is the zenith of Ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika. They do not like to become sugar, rather they love to taste it and say that if they get transformed into sugar, then how would they realize the taste of sugar.

The word &ldquo;Go&rdquo; means the sense organs. Only the one who sustains and controls the Indriyas is Gopa or Gopa&#x301;la. The word Gopa&#x301;la also means &ldquo;giver of bliss&rdquo;. This Vrajbha&#x301;va is the proximal stage of Kevala&#x301; Bhakti. It is different from Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; Bhakti since there is no vanity for knowledge nor the show of riches.

Ananda Margis are aspirants of Ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika Bhakti, and therefore, they do not desire to terminate their journey in a state of Vrajabha&#x301;va, whatever else there may be in dualistic Vrajabha&#x301;va, there is no expression of due reverence for the wish of Brahma or His introversive phase of the creative cycle. Why do people fail to realize the nice opportunity which His grace has offered them? Why will they not merge their &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling into the immortality of the Supreme? By enjoying the bliss of divine attainment as a separate existence the unit mind and all the sense organs shall have to be controlled. Wherever the mind is with the Indriyas, there the apprehension of deterioration exists. That is why the Ananda Margis do not accept staying in Gopiibha&#x301;va.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Bha&#x301;va is that whereby the Citta or mind-stuff becomes purged and is chiefly dominated by Sattvagun&#x301;a. Where all the ten directions become brilliant with the rays of the sun of love and the taste or anurakti for the Lord gets enlightened, then the Citta develops oneness with Him. As a result of this Bha&#x301;va, human beings direct their natural attractive tendencies towards the adored. The adored, however is not outside them, but is the life of their life, the mind of their mind and the life master of their entire existence. When this feeling of devotion for the adored awakens the introversion of one&#146;s tendencies, then one becomes absorbed in this Bha&#x301;va. One attains the state of realizing the self. In Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava philosophy this running into one&#146;s own self is known as Hla&#x301;dinii Shakti because in this path there is a progressive refulgence of the light of mellifluous realizations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->When there is fear or feeling of crude propensities in the mind, there cannot be pure Anurakti or Bhakti. Devotion generated through fear is no Bhakti at all, rather it is but a lamentable state of mental crudeness. Some pray to the Lord for fear of hell and some for fear of torture and retribution in the next life. They hunger for emancipation from these fears. This betrays a lack of knowledge of the truth and you should not give encouragement to this inferiority complex. Those who accept or know the Lord as their own self have no reason to entertain any fear of Him. This fearless movement towards the Lord is termed Love.<!-- /block --></p>

Therefore the aspirant has to skillfully to transform passion into love. Do you love your son? No, no you don&#146;t love your son. You love Brahma in the form of your son. By loving your son as a son, you cannot love the Lord. Where there is the feeling of son, there is no Lord and where there is the Lord, there is no son.

The base or vitality of the mind is the collection of objects which have been contemplated, accepted or discarded. These objects in their basic states are external physical, but the mind enjoys them in their internal impression, as mental forms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The mind of a certain individual enjoys a particular finite object either for a long time or slowly according to its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. After enjoying a particular object just for a short time it wants to turn to another. The mind cannot forever enjoy any finite object because the finite objects have both a beginning and an end. In that eternal movement, that which has a beginning certainly has an end too. You will not be able to enjoy it for all time. The long hands of death certainly will snatch it away. People fail to comprehend this. They treat those things as pleasant which, according to sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, they retain in their mind for some time or which they enjoy slowly. They treat this slow speed as pleasure and call it happiness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The minds of some people remain absorbed in the thought of money for a long time. They surrender the fragrance of their lives at the altar of money. Others treat the achievement of fame or having a child as the principal object of their lives. They do not hesitate to lay down their life to have a son or to achieve fame. When the mind cannot enjoy a particular object for a long period, or enjoys it hurriedly, then such an experience is called a painful experience or pain. For example you cannot look at a decomposed corpse for a long time. Similarly, after a brief talk you will dispose as quickly as possible of a person who causes you pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Therefore, whether an object is pleasant or painful, its finiteness cannot be your permanent object. You and that object are bound to separate. The mind is needed for one&#146;s preservation and for its own preservation the mind needs a safe shelter, as can hold it throughout eternity. Human beings always crave for a safe shelter. Is it not so? Will you build your house on quicksand? No, you will construct your house on the firm foundation of solid earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->People always seek a solid base to preserve their mental potentialities till eternity and to give them vital energy in the struggle with temporal factors. Is there a solid base in this world? That which is finite cannot be the base of your life, because it will be used up and will leave your mind unsheltered. Thrusting you in the abyss of darkness, it will pursue its course on the unending path. Therefore, no one except Brahma, the beginningless, endless and infinite can be the object of your mind and the base of your life. How then in this manifested Universe, where there are multitudes of finite objects can we start a life based on Brahma? The answer is that you adopt Madhuvidya&#x301;. Instead of seeing the finite and superficial objects as finite look upon them as the finite expressions of the Infinite or the permanent. Then the attraction for Preya and love for Shreya shall all fuse into one.<!-- /block --></p>

Is it not so? The son is Preya, a finite entity. He cannot live till eternity. He will depart and make you weep.

<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->O Human beings, in that state, no finite object can colour your mind. You will be beyond all colours or Varn&#x301;a&#x301;tiita. Then you will be able to give proper treatment to any finite being that you may come in contact with. Give proper treatment to the expression of Brahma in the shape of your father by serving him and paying attention to his comforts. Give proper treatment to the expression of Brahma in the shape of the earth by cultivating it and increasing its fertility. If you give such proper treatment to the different objects, they will not be able to degrade your mind. This is called true Vaera&#x301;gya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Vaera&#x301;gya does not denote renunciation, desertion or escaping to the Himalayas after leaving one&#146;s spouse, child and family. Ananda Marga staunchly opposes such an escapist mentality. According to Ananda Marga, the practice of Dharma by means of Vaera&#x301;gya is a part of family life. Those who harbour the sentiment of running away and leaving everything behind are labouring under a defeatist complex. The thief, who for fear of the police, the debtor, who for fear of the creditor, the afflicted, who for inability to put up with afflictions, are all amongst those who take recourse to the so-called Vaera&#x301;gya. Such Vaera&#x301;giis do not have the fortitude to face the setbacks of this world. They try to hide their cowardice under tall talks. Even when they accept the order of the so-called Vaera&#x301;gya, the worldly attractions do not abate in their mind. Therefore, pursuing an incorrect interpretation of the term, they insistently practice Tya&#x301;ga (abnegation). Consequently most of them fall from their path.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Vaera&#x301;gya&rdquo; is derived from the word vira&#x301;ga. The word &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ga&rdquo; denotes attachment. The practice whereby we develop detachment from finite objects, i.e. the discipline whereby the mind is not influenced by the attractions of worldly objects is Vaera&#x301;gya Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The true Cosmic Entity is only revealed to people with this Vaera&#x301;gya. This Cosmic Entity alone is the basic shelter of the human beings. It is a strong foundation which shall not, at any time forsake them leaving him forlorn. In this very Cosmic shelter you can establish yourself fearlessly for all time to come.<!-- /block --></p>

Jiiva&#x301;tman, which is bound by its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, moves about in the universal waves subject to the changes of birth and death. It does not attain the supreme bliss of its original form. However, it becomes Parama&#x301;tman the moment it eliminates all its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and the efforts of the indwelling unit mind.

<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Two pretty and identical birds are dwelling in a single tree. One of them tastes the delicious fruit of the tree and the other witnesses it. This is a wonderful Vedic allusion. Here, the bird tasting the fruit is alluded to as the Jiiva&#x301;tman, and the bird which is only witnessing is alluded to as Parama&#x301;tman. The underlying meaning is that the unit soul is the entity which enjoys all the fruits and Parama&#x301;tman is the witnessing entity to all the actions and reactions in the world. Jiiva&#x301;tman is under the influence of Prakrti, it is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;dhiina or controlled by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, whereas Parama&#x301;tman, in whatever form He may manifest Himself is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;dhiisha or Controller of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Parama&#x301;tman is the only Supreme Entity. Sat and Satya are equivalent words. Satya is that which is unchangeable. Every finite object is transmuted by the influence of time, space and person, that is, it suffers from consequences, but Satya does not undergo changes in accordance with changes in time, place and person. There are different kinds of customs and rituals peculiar to different climates. On account of the changes in the climates none of these can truly be called Satya. An incident which one day appears as a reality and is considered true, may on the following day be found to be incorrect and far from the truth. Thus it is found that what appeared to a person&#146;s mind as a fact in the past is unreal in the present and what appeared, as unreal in the past assumes a real aspect in the present. Hence none of these worldly realities or unrealities are permanent truths. A single fruit is known in a particular place as a sweet fruit, while the same fruit in another land is a sour fruit due to changes in the soil. A particular object appears to the general public as white, but to the jaundice patient it appears yellow. None of the objects of the universe can be a permanent reality on account of their dependence on time, space and person. Brahma alone is the eternal reality beyond the influence of Prakrti, that is beyond the mind. His abode is certainly above the bounds of time, place and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In this manifested universe all the things that we treat as real at first sight are in fact relative truths. All of them bear Svaja&#x301;tiiya or homogeneous, vija&#x301;tiiya or heterogeneous and svagata or self-differentiations. Relative objects are only identifiable through these differences. A tree, for example, is heterogeneous or vija&#x301;tiiya to the houses, hills, rivers etc. and amongst the trees there are homogeneous or svaja&#x301;tiiya differences &ndash; the mango tree, jackfruit tree, palm tree, etc., and amongst the mangoes, there are differences in varieties &ndash; langra, bambai etc. And there are also self or svagata differences in the trunk, branches, leaves etc. of each mango tree. Parama&#x301;tman is a universal entity and is therefore above these three-fold differences.<!-- /block --></p>

But ordinarily people do not attain this state since worldly glamours keep their senses engrossed with different objects. In order to be free from the objects they have to undergo special processes. Where there is an object, the feeling of Brahma is not there. Humankind as a whole has to undergo certain disciplines in order to be free from the objective feelings.

It is only when these products of intellect present an impediment to the realization of happiness that people make an effort to realize the true knowledge. True knowledge is unchangeable.

The Indriyas work when the mind works; when the mind does not want to do anything, the Indriyas are also inactive. It is said in the Sha&#x301;stra:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Thus, the mind is behind all our activities, whether we direct it towards worldly objects or towards Brahma. No action is possible without the mind. The mind has infinite potentialities and controlling these infinite potentialities is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Though the mind is very powerful it has one serious shortcoming. It cannot think of two objects concurrently.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Whenever it thinks it has one single object. Nevertheless the speed of the mind&#146;s action is baffling. While concentrating on a particular work we may also hear others about us [[talking]]. This is due to the fast acting power of the mind, which leads us to believe that the thought currents of the mind are unbroken. For example, while witnessing the pictures in cinema, we also enjoy the dialogue. The activities of the mind can be understood by diligently applying the mind and we see that the mind can do only one thing at a time. Therefore worldly acts and meditation on Brahma cannot be done simultaneously. It is impossible that on one side humans will remain bound up with passion, anger, avarice etc. and on the other, will worship Brahma. The mind must be sanctified for the worship of Brahma. Apathy towards worldly objects through mental purification is not our goal. Living on this world we can[[not]] be apathetic with regard to the world. Our object is to act, but our actions will be such that they will not bind us to the object. Many persons ask: Since both good and bad are causative for bondage, then surely inactivity is to be preferred? No, this is not feasible. So long as we maintain our body we cannot be absolved from action. We must act, whether we will like it or not. Until death we will have to perform the act of respiration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->No attachment to worldly objects will be developed if we observe Yama and Niyama, since every item of Yama-Niyama is part of Brahma Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; through worldly deeds. Hence when you are able to perfectly observe the spiritual practice of Yama-Niyama, your mind becomes absorbed in Brahma &ndash; the ultimate goal of this spiritual practice. For example, suppose a woman is extremely occupied in earning money. For her nothing remains in the world except money. In the same way for the aspirant who is absorbed in Yama-Niyama Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and dedicated to the attainment of Brahma, there is nothing but Brahma. The life of the person devoted to earning money becomes like a desert because everything except money is alien. But the aspirants of Brahma cannot call anything alien since everything is Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->According to the beliefs of the human beings, Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is not practicable in normal life and it is necessary for an aspirant to sever connections with the home and members of the family. This is fallacious. How can a sa&#x301;dhaka devote himself to Brahma when he cannot even support the four or five members of his family? A person is associated with a family right from birth. Every family is beset with one problem or another. If instead of solving the problems, you leave your home and live in solitude, will you then forget about these problems? Furthermore, while in solitude you will have to think for your food and clothes. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is possible only through this physical body, and for the sake of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; it is useless to create unnatural situations by forsaking the home. We can practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; by practising restraint in whichever situation we are placed. The only thing necessary for practising sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is an ardent desire for it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->We should strengthen ourselves by remaining in normal situations and endeavouring to become superhuman. By developing superhuman powers we can awaken the element of eternal humanity amongst us. This eternal human entity alone is Brahma. In order to attain this power, meanness must be shunned, because this is the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for the Infinite. Feelings of differentiation are a great impediment. The feelings that a particular person is a Muslim, another a Hindu, yet another a Brahman and the fourth a Vaeshya come from mean thoughts. When every living being is a manifestation of Brahma, how can you know yourself, without shedding these differentiating feelings? No one is high and no one is low. Of course, according to one&#146;s virtues and vices one is happy, one is miserable, one is rich, someone is poor, one is a fool and another is erudite, but all human beings. Differentiating feelings are the principal obstacles in the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and an elevated position cannot be attained without annihilating them. There is a story in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Both Yudhisthira and Duryodhana had invited Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a to their respective houses for dinner. While on his way there, Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a entered the house of Vidura. At that time the great Vidura was not at his house. Vidura&#146;s wife was of very limited means and became nervous on the sudden appearance of Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. She did not know how to give a proper reception to Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and there was no food in the house except bananas. Therefore, after washing His feet she seated the Lord and began to skin the bananas, and feed Him as she inquired about His welfare. Meanwhile the great sage Vidura returned home. He saw the Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a sitting and his wife, fully absorbed in feelings, feeding Him the skins of the bananas. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was eating so happily, that it seemed as if He had never tasted a more delicious food. Vidura was greatly pained to notice the folly of his wife and asked: &ldquo;What are you doing? You are feeding banana skins to the Lord instead of bananas.&rdquo; Vidura&#146;s wife was taken aback and started apologizing for her faults. Vidura also implored. &ldquo;O Lord, Thou hast taken a good many banana skins; do kindly oblige this poor woman by taking a few bananas.&rdquo; But the Lord said, &ldquo;Vidura! My stomach is full now. These banana-skins had such an exquisite flavour that there could be no superior food. So long as your wife, forgetting all differences, was feeding me, &lsquo;I&rsquo; was there, but now that the difference between the banana and its skin has intervened, &lsquo;I&rsquo; is not there.&rdquo; This is a small story, but it is very instructive. There are no differentiations before the Lord. Lord Shankaracharya was an erudite scholar. He has over-thrown Buddhism and revived Brahmanya religion, but there was a lack of full harmony between his principles and practices. Once after having a dip in the Ganges at Kashii, he was returning towards the road and he saw an untouchable walking with a number of dogs. For fear of his body being touched he attempted to bypass them. Then the untouchable said: &ldquo;O Lord! Is this the result of your principle that there is only Brahma and nothing else? You are known by the name Brahmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ni. The feeling of differentiation is developed even by treating a pariah as mean.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Brahma resides within the feeling &ldquo;I am&rdquo; situated amidst the concealed intuition of the mind. Our existence is in him. He exists in the sun-rays. Due to Him the perception of the world is possible. Having created our ego and scattered innumerable toys around us. He has hidden Himself among them. When we come to see Him in all things created by Him, our ego gets lost.

This is also a differentiation. In India women were the authoresses of the Vedic verses. Therefore, this reasoning is not sound. Veda Vyasa was born into a fisherman&#146;s family and it is he who divided the Vedas into four parts: Rk, Yajur, Sa&#x301;ma and Atharva. Therefore, the idea that women and Shudras are not entitled to read the Vedas is quite fallacious. It is undesirable that any differentiating feeling should abide in the aspirants&#146; hearts. In the Ajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nabodhini Tantra it is said:<!-- /block --></p>

They earn an eternal abode above all weal and woe and they cannot entertain any feeling of difference. They see Brahma in everything. Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;avalkya says to Maetreyii &ldquo;The A&#x301;tman alone is the place for bliss. It is expedient to listen to it, to think of and to meditate on it. You will get its light by deep meditation on it. After one knows the A&#x301;tman, nothing remains to be known&rdquo;. It occurs in the Mun&#x301;d&#x301;akopanis&#x301;ad:<!-- /block --></p>

It is their Dharma to attain happiness and this desire is behind everything they do. Worldly pleasures, however, are born of attachments and do not give permanent bliss.

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject is &ldquo;Yajin&#x32D;a and the Fruit of Yajin&#x32D;a&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;Yajin&#x32D;a&rdquo; is formed by the root &ldquo;Yaj&rdquo; and the suffix &ldquo;na&rdquo;. It means actions. Whatever a person does, we can call it a yajin&#x32D;a. What is the origin of actions? Where is the unmanifested potentiality of action? The doer of an act is the mind. Before doing an act a person thinks of it and the thought gets manifested as corresponding vibrations or sensations in his mind. Those mental vibrations are then transformed into the actions in the external world. That is, when after thinking about doing an act, the hands and feet begin to move, then the action being done is called an act or kriya&#x301;. Vibration exists in the mind or Sublime level and an act exists both in the crude and sublime levels, because all vibrations are not necessarily transformed into acts. Whenever there is an act, then the existence of a precedent thought is a certainty. That is why Karma or Yajin&#x32D;a is called psycho-physical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Human beings cannot exist even for a moment without doing an act. Salvation means the eternal emancipation from this very Karma or Yajin&#x32D;a. Ordinarily Yajin&#x32D;a is of four kinds: Bhu&#x301;ta Yajin&#x32D;a, Nr Yajin&#x32D;a, Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a and Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a. Of these four Yajin&#x32D;as, the first three, namely Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr, and Pitr Yajin&#x32D;as, are psycho-physical, that is, both mental and physical, but Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a is one hundred percent internal. The origin of Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr and Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a is in mental vibrations and they take shape in the physical world. The actual origin of Karma, however, is in the arena of the mind. Suppose I donated ten rupees to a particular person. This is called Nr Yajin&#x32D;a. In the first instance I gave the donation mentally, and when this mental donation took the shape of a physical act, then I practically made the donation. As soon as the thought of giving the donation occurs in the mind, the physical act of donating flashes before the mind, that is, the act actually originated in the mental domain. Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a, on the other hand, originates in the domain of the soul and terminates in the soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->(1) Bhu&#x301;ta-Yajin&#x32D;a: Bhu&#x301;ta Yajin&#x32D;a means services rendered to any created entity of the manifested world. For example, watering trees, serving cattle, undertaking scientific explorations and doing anything for the sake of welfare. In Sam&#x301;skrta, Bhu&#x301;ta means that which has been created. It does not mean ghost or spirit. The Sam&#x301;skrta synonym of the English words ghost and spirit is &ldquo;Preta&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->(2) Nr Yajin&#x32D;a: Nr Yajin&#x32D;a is action for human welfare. In fact Nr Yajin&#x32D;a is a part of Bhu&#x301;ta Yajin&#x32D;a because human beings are also created beings, I will explain Nr Yajin&#x32D;a later on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->(3) Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a: Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a means remembering the ancestors and the sages. As long as a person possesses the physical body, he remains indebted to his ancestors. Those who are capable of working for their own emancipation, as well as of the society by virtue of the knowledge acquired through the austerities practised by the sages, are indebted to the sages. Sages are those who are helping and who have helped human society in numerous ways, such as the invention of new subjects. You enjoy the fruits of the inventor of railway engines. Is it not a fact that present intellectual currents originated from the fountain of their wisdom? Many people say that science is detrimental to civilization and an impediment to civilization, that the old world was indeed good. They forget that science also existed in the old world and, although it was very undeveloped, the people had adopted it according to their standard of wisdom and knowledge. We are progressing on the road constructed by them. We proceed and extend these roads by cutting down the jungles and the hills. Their bullock carts have given us the incentive for our railways and cars. We have converted the yachts constructed by them into submarines. That is why I say that there is no fault in the development of science. Time is also not to blame. The fault rests with us. Science does not tell us to use nuclear energy in destructive ways. To do so is to use science to establish our animality. Those who have invented destructive weapons with the help of science are not sages, because their Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; does not contribute to the welfare of humanity. On the other hand, those sages who have looked to the well-being of humanity certainly deserve our revered memory. To pay homage to them is Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->(4) Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a: I have already said that Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a is one hundred percent internal. The impetus for Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a comes from the soul and this impetus becomes operative in the mental province. The mind performs the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and the Karma also terminates in the province of the soul. That is, the ultimate goal of mental sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; lies in the province of the soul. Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a is a liberating sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and the remaining three, Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr and Pitr yajin&#x32D;a are both liberating and subjugating (Nivrtti Pravrtti).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Nr Yajin&#x32D;a is of four kinds: (a) Shu&#x301;drocita, (b) Vaeshyocita, (c) Ks&#x301;atriyocita and (d) Viprocita. To serve the world by the physical body, to make others happy by one&#146;s own sacrifice, or to alleviate the afflictions of others, for example by example by nursing the patients, comes within the scope of Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The services rendered by supplying food, money, etc. are termed Vaeshyocita seva&#x301;. Protecting others, even by risking one&#146;s life is Ks&#x301;atriyocita Seva&#x301;. Viprocita Seva&#x301; is to give expression of Adhya&#x301;tma yajin&#x32D;a by imparting the spiritual knowledge you have gained. Instil in others the earnest desire to follow the path of virtue &ndash; only then will you justify your existence as a social creature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301; is the backbone of society. Those who undervalue Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301; cannot render Vaeshyocita seva&#x301;. In the same way, one has to become a Shu&#x301;dra, in order to be eligible for rendering Vaeshyocita-seva&#x301;. Exactly in the same way, one has to become a Shu&#x301;dra, a Vaeshya and a Ks&#x301;atriya in order to be eligible to render Viprocita Seva&#x301;. Hence only those who possess these four qualities are Vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Although the excellence of all the different services is equal, Viprocita seva&#x301; is particularly glorious because it is directly related to Adhya&#x301;tma yajin&#x32D;a. But it must be remembered that the value of a particular service depends on time, place and circumstances. Suppose a wayfarer is in distress in a lonely place and is about to die. In this situation viprocita sermons are entirely useless. While Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301;, i.e. nursing will be of great value. What will you do for a man who is dying of starvation? Will you nurse or preach sermons? Food must be arranged for him. In this circumstance Vaeshyocita seva&#x301; is of great value. In another situation, some men are attacking a helpless person. In this case neither sermons nor nursing is needed, nor is food to be offered; there you will have to render Ks&#x301;atriyocita service. In this situation, Ks&#x301;atriyocita Seva&#x301; is of greater value and other services are entirely meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Shu&#x301;drocita service is meaningless to a drunkard, so is Vaeshyocita, because giving money to him gives impetus to the addiction to drinking and does not encourage him or her to give it up, If you give the drunkard a beating then he or she will leave the place and go elsewhere to get a drink. Therefore, a drunkard has to be treated firmly with Ks&#x301;atriyocita seva&#x301; and with Viprocita sermons. They must be emancipated from this bad habit by good counsel. The problem can not be solved just by simply inflicting punishment or enacting laws to close the liquor shop. In such circumstances the drunkard will seek to satisfy his or her bad habit in secrecy and consequently the whole society is affected. Thus we see that all the four types of services are important in particular circumstances. Still the effect of Viprocita seva&#x301; is stable whereas the effects of other types of service is not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->At the time of rendering service, you should feel that object of service is Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a or God and that you are a spiritual aspirant. With such feelings there is no room for conceit. Conceit causes the fall of human beings. To get rid of conceit we will have to regard the object of our service as Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->When you render service to anyone you must mentally address them with sincere devotion. &ldquo;O Lord, O Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a! Oblige me by accepting my services. You are merciful to me, and for this reason you have appeared before me as a living being to offer this very precious opportunity of rendering service to You.&rdquo; By maintaining such sentiments, conceit will not arise in you, nor will you be bound by the reactions of your actions. The principal cause for bondage to the fruits of actions is conceit or the yearning for fame. Suppose a certain man donates one thousand rupees to a particular institution. The next day he looks anxiously for his name in the newspaper. If his name does not appear in the paper, then with an air of conceit he brags amongst his kith and kin. &ldquo;I have donated a thousand rupees, but I do not desire recognition and therefore I have not published my name in the paper.&rdquo; The desire for fame exists in a concealed form in that man&#146;s mind. Clearly, he did not make the donation with the spirit of service. However, when you perform acts with the ideation that the person served is Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, there is no possibility of arrogance or the desire for fame growing in your mind. Then you will realize that through the grace of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a you have been given the opportunity of serving Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Our hands and feet are not ours, they are His, and by serving Himself with those hands and feet, He sports with Himself. Such an action is an action without attachment. Only in this way can one attain salvation from the bondage of Karma. You must feel that the person served is Brahma. The person served is a finite manifestation of Him. Never, even by mistake, take the object as a human being. A devotee in ecstasy says:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Wherever I look Hari is visible. To attain this stage is the consummation of the aspirant&#146;s efforts. By working with ideation of Brahma, you will gradually be able to perceive Brahma in everything. Why should ideation of Brahma or Hari be adopted?

<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The development of ideas in a person&#146;s mind takes place in three ways: direct imposition, indirect imposition and spontaneous idea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><b>Direct imposition</b>: Suppose you are playing the role of Sha&#x301;hja&#x301;ha&#x301;n in a certain drama. Though your mother tongue is Sam&#x301;skrta you speak in Persian. In that situation you have consciously thought, &ldquo;I am Sha&#x301;hjaha&#x301;n&rdquo;, and having influenced the mind accordingly, you behave in that manner. Here your own personality is masked by that of Sha&#x301;hjaha&#x301;n. This is known as direct imposition of ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><b>Indirect imposition</b>: Here you do not knowingly assume any idea, but are influenced and hypnotized by another person. You act unconsciously. Your personal exclusiveness is drowned in the currents of another&#146;s ideas. Under directions of a hypnotist, you will take sand for sugar and find it sweet as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><b>Spontaneous idea</b>: In this case, the ideas spring from within and only the true ideas get expressed. This occurs while you are in Iishvara Pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na. Initially the feeling of &ldquo;I am&rdquo; certainly exists in the aspirant&#146;s mind. He or she feels that &ldquo;I am practicing Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for a realization of Brahma.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In the method of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; prescribed of Ananda Marga, this feeling of &ldquo;I am&rdquo; having been developed and expressed spontaneously is then transformed into feelings of Brahma. This spontaneous idea is not easily understood by those who do not practice Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. For this very reason, more often than not, non-aspirants are overtaken with false apprehensions since they do not know the transcendental currents of happiness in which the Sa&#x301;dhaka is drifting. You don&#146;t have to take the idea &ldquo;I am Hanuman&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I am Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;. Adhya&#x301;tma yajin&#x32D;a is performed entirely in the mental arena and there is no necessity of any experiment or imposition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->But in Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr or Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a, experiment or imposition is necessary. One has to feel that the object of service is Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. If you do not adopt this feeling your efforts are in vain. It should be remembered that the reaction of an action is intimately connected with the action itself and when you perform an act you have got to bear its brunt.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->You are free to act, but you are bound to undergo the reaction. The moment you do an act you acquire the possibility of its reaction. Simultaneously with the performance of an act is being done, the seed for its reaction is also sown and its consequences have to be undergone. There is no escape from it. It is not within your right to get rid of it or to escape its fruits and consequences. You have a right only to the action. Just by wishing you may or may not do an act.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->What we call Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra is the reaction of Karma in potential forms, that is, it is the seed of the reaction to an action. The completion of a Yajin&#x32D;a lies in its offerings. Karma and Yajin&#x32D;a are the same and the accomplishment of the four varieties of Karma lies in offering one&#146;s dearest thing, that is, in offering one&#146;s own self. Ra&#x301;ma Yajin&#x32D;a signifies offering or surrendering unto Ra&#x301;ma. Vis&#x301;nu Yajin&#x32D;a has a similar significance. The word Vishnu means all-pervasive. For this reason the accomplishment of Vis&#x301;nu Yajin&#x32D;a lies in merging oneself into the Supreme Entity. Those who offer clarified butter in Yajin&#x32D;a are misguided. They think that by offering ghee in the fire, it will rain. Still today people are following such blind superstition. Science tells us that when ghee is offered in the fire, the ghee is burnt and the unburnt carbon particles evaporate in the form of smoke. Everyone knows that ghee is basically the chemical composition of hydrogen and carbon and that the water vapor generated by burning ghee is negligible. Therefore, what will be the magnitude of the cloud formed by burning even one thousand tons of ghee? It is an utter misuse of ghee. The proper use of ghee is to feed it to the weak so that they may have a good health. If you want rain you should perform Bhu&#x301;ta Yajin&#x32D;a. Scientific research comes within the purview of Bhu&#x301;ta Yajin&#x32D;a. Manufacture artificial clouds and make use of them wherever rainfall is needed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->O Sa&#x301;dhakas! Justify Ra&#x301;ma Yajin&#x32D;a by offering yourselves unto Ra&#x301;ma or Parama&#x301;tman. Accomplish your Maha&#x301;vis&#x301;n&#x301;u Yajin&#x32D;a by merging the arrogance of your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling in the all-pervading Parama&#x301;tman. For this you need not go begging from door to door. Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a is an internal affair and money has no use. Only in the case of Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr and Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a are crude physical things needed and not in the case of Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a. By this the mind gradually obtains enlightenment and there is no need to entertain the idea of Ra&#x301;ma or any similar idea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->It is necessary to adopt a special sentiment in the case of Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr, and Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a, the sentiment that you will not be attached to Karma because the arrogance of your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling will not have any opportunity to arise. By Lord&#146;s direction, you are serving Him, being a part and parcel of his manifestation. By maintaining such sentiments arrogance cannot arise. You know that the results of your actions will conformity to your intentions. If you submit the subjective feeling of your actions to the Lord, the reactions also appertain to the Lord. However, while taking this sentiment, one has to see that it is born out of love and not out of fear. Fear does not generate love. There is no service where love is absent and your Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr and Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a become meaningless. The sentiment must be surcharged with Prema or Love. What is Prema?<!-- /block --></p>

While rendering services you should think that you are serving for his or her comfort and well-being. This will make your service selfless and your love untarnished. Services rendered with a selfless motive are not without blemishes. You feed the hens for your benefit.

Such a person is not happy and this type of ritualism cannot be called real Karma. To serve others at one&#146;s sacrifice is called penance. In the absence of love any service or penance is for show and is therefore fruitless. All ritualistic devotion, sham penance, counting beads etc. are meant only for public show and true love and the Supreme goal are lost from sight. Brahma cannot be attained through actions, since the sweetness of joy is lacking in such ritualism. On the other hand the divine bliss is easily attainable to those who base their Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; on love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->One has to see appreciate how the consequences of actions are annihilated through service. Where there is the arrogance of &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, then the consequences exist with the actions. Where the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the doer then the same &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the receiver of the consequences. In detached actions the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is not the doer and is not therefore liable to reap the consequences. In an unattached action there is no bondage of the consequences because whatever the person does is consigned to Brahma, and therefore, the consequences of the actions are also consigned to Brahma. In other words, both the actions and consequences appertain to Parama&#x301;tman. You should regard yourself as an instrument of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a and go on doing your work in a detached manner. Where a person is suffering from pain, you may ask whether they are only reaping the consequences of their actions and whether in these circumstances it is proper for you to serve them. The answer is very simple. I should not even think that he or she is reaping the consequences of actions. My purpose is to decide the intention with which I will act. I will have to think that in the pursuit of a particular design, Parama&#x301;tman is suffering distress and in this way, He is giving me an opportunity to render service. Out of His grace He is obliging me by accepting my services. Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a&#146;s designs are inscrutable, so you must look upon the distressed with divine sentiments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Just as vibrations take the shape of actions, so too counter vibrations bear exact opposite consequences of these actions. The nature of consequences is shaped by the tune of the nature of the intentions to act or vibrations. Then in the physical world the consequences of such an action are treated according to the status of the doer, irrespective of the magnitude of the action and is in consonance with his or her mental endurance. If there be no pain from a cut in the hand, that is, if the mind does not feel the consequence, the action then is not punitive. For those free from a debased mind and accomplished in universality the question of unitary suffering of the consequences of actions does not arise, since such individual do not work with unit feelings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Where action yoga, penance or knowledge is affected with feelings of distinctions, arrogance is bound to come into play and individual distinctions are created. When an act is dedicated to Parama&#x301;tman, its consequences are also dedicated to Him. The unit is neither the doer nor the bearer of the consequences. What is it to you then?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Occasionally, an affectatious vanity is seen in the aspirant which is not meant for his or her personal end, but rather for the sake of Parama&#x301;tman. This is called Sa&#x301;ttvika vanity. The vanity associated with selfless service is not derived from the mean unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, but from the feeling of Universal &ldquo;I&rdquo;.

It is your beauty which has given comeliness to Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. Is it not that I receive the inspiration to act from you? You are the doer and You alone are the enjoyer.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->You should act precisely with this sentiment. The more a person works with feelings of detachment, the greater is his or her Godward speed and the more the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is annihilated. The Unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling will be completely annihilated by the time you are completely established in the divine feeling. Detached actions are the fight against the unit self and for the attainment of the Universal &ldquo;I&rdquo;. The Unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; will go on abating in proportion to the decline of arrogance. By the same proportion, the mind&#146;s sphere will get enlightened by refulgence of the Universal Self. That is why the followers of Ananda Marga must tread the path of action without detachment. Along with Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a, Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr, and Pitr yajin&#x32D;a also have to be performed and then the true sacrifice of the self in the fire of Brahma is accomplished.<!-- /block --></p>

Where there is no mirror of the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling or Mahattattva or Budhitattva, there is no Jiiva&#x301;tman as the reflection. After annihilation of the ego, the condition in which one lives, is the initial form. He alone is the life of lives, the soul of souls, namely the Lord. Genuine spiritual practice is that which does away with the mirror of Buddhitattva and enables Jiiva&#x301;tman, in the shape of the reflection to get absorbed in Parama&#x301;tman &ndash; the original entity. For this the inevitable requisite is detached action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Yajin&#x32D;a is performed to achieve emancipation from the consequences of action and to annihilate the Unit &ldquo;I&rdquo;. The fourfold services enumerated under Nr yajin&#x32D;a can be easily be performed by anyone. Every human being gets more or less opportunity for rendering services. If a poor man thinks that he cannot render Vaeshyocita type of service because he is devoid of money he is wrong. The charity of a few paise of the poor has the same value as a thousand rupees from a millionaire. Indeed the charity of these few paise is greater. Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a attached greater importance to a handfuls of grains from Vidura than to the sumptuous royal dishes of Duryodhana. Even so, everyone should render service to the world in accordance with their capacity and work for the welfare of the living beings to the best of their ability. Perform viprocita type of service by projecting your convictions to others as best as you can. Let every person perform the four kinds of service as much as possible. Adhya&#x301;tma yajin&#x32D;a is an internal yajin&#x32D;a and ultimately it terminates in Parama&#x301;tman, the original self. Therefore, your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; should be with a detached sentiment. All types of Yajin&#x32D;a begin and proceed in an externalized manner, but ultimately they will reverse their course towards the inner self and will gratify your innermost entity on the jewelled throne attained by your birthright. Remember, no one yajin&#x32D;a is inferior to another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->As long as you exist, you have got to perform Yajin&#x32D;a. The moment you cease from discharging duties, either due to incapacity or wrong choice you will fall into an abyss. You should not let this happen. It is your dharma to move from narrowness to vastness, from greatness to divinity. To allow yourself to fall into an abyss is against the characteristic of your existence. You long for eternal bliss and endeavour for eternal life. You are associated with that unending vitality in the blood circulation of your arteries and veins and in the rhythmic throbbing of your heart. You have been listening day and night the voice of eternal youth. Can you ever imagine remaining inert matter in an inactive state where there is no yajin&#x32D;a? Even in the state of supreme realization you will be infused with boundless knowledge. O human beings! be established in the radiance of divinity and the splendour of valour and chivalry, because yours is the path of revolution. Your path is not the path of extra caution and scheduled movement. You are the traveller of a rugged path. You are travellers of an impregnable path. You have to march ahead proudly with the flag of Marga upright. You have no time to stagger or to look behind.<!-- /block --></p>

This mistaken belief arises because people have no conception of the infinite, or have the capacity to conceive of it. If four is deducted from ten the remainder is six. Both four and ten are finite and the remainder six is also finite. However, if anything finite or infinite is deducted from the infinite the remainder is still infinite.

Giving shape to a thing after rendering it finite is effected by Tamogun&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the Aham&#x301;tattva, that is, wherein the state of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma only Sattvagun&#x301;a and Rajogun&#x301;a can exist, and no Tamogun&#x301;a, there can be no limitations giving rise to crudeness of physical forms. So the Mahatattva and Aham&#x301;tattva portions of the Cosmic mind are infinite, that is to say, the Cosmic mind is infinite. Is the Cosmic Citta, the crudest manifestation of the Cosmic mind, finite or infinite? When Citta has been created under the influence of Tamogun&#x301;a, it is undoubtedly bounded by the limitation of time. Just as with the idea of oneness. He acquires the form out of the five fundamental factors for specific objects, or for the sake of sustaining the existence, accepts or discards them, so also the entire Cosmic mind assumes a particular shape, the boundaries of which are formed by the unit mind. The only difference between the two is that the component of the unit mind is only the reflection of the Cosmic mind. This quinquelemental world is the crude manifestation of the Cosmic mind. The Cosmic Mind is the creator of the sublime form of the unit mind and forms the medium of the individual for feeling of pleasure or pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Though this quinquelemental world is very large and extensive, it is not infinite because it is simply the collective evolution of the Cosmic Citta, created by the help of Tamogun&#x301;a. Without doubt it is limited. Just as each of the planets, the stars and the heavenly bodies possesses a particular shape, so also their sum-total is not shapeless, because they are all the results of the mind-stuff of the Cosmic mind. One day the scientists will also understand this reality and recognize the validity of the sages&#146; words. This extremely vast Cosmic mind stuff, which resembles the oval shape of the solar world is known as Brahma&#x301;nda (An&#x301;d&#x301;a means egg).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Regardless of how vast it is, the visible universe is finite. But is the potentiality of the Cosmic mind also limited?  When the Cosmic mindstuff merges into the state of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, will the Sagun&#x301;a Brahma also attain Moks&#x301;a? No, it will not. Even though all the manifestations of the Cosmic mind-stuff are limited, the mind-stuff is not finite. The origin of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is beyond the limits of time. Whatever Sagun&#x301;a Brahma has done in the form of Praja&#x301;pati, since eternity and without beginning has accumulated never ending sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. The original actions of these reactions have not been performed by any individual finite mindstuff. Rather innumerable mind-stuffs have been formed and destroyed, and to suffer those reactions innumerable mindstuffs of Brahma will in the future be created and destroyed. In the limited mind-stuff of Brahma, regardless of how vast it is, all reactions have neither been expressed or pulsated nor can they ever be so. As His Citta wanes, His unexpressed or unvibrated samaska&#x301;ras to on creating new mind-stuffs in His Cosmic mind to making Him bear the consequences of His actions.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->For this reason I say that the present Cosmic Citta is limited, but the Cosmic mind-stuff is infinite and will continue throughout eternity. When we discover that the Cosmic mind is the innumerable expressions of the mind-stuffs in their totality, then we are correct in calling it infinite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Remember that your personality will also advance through transmutation like all other entities. The total extinction of the Cosmic mind will never occur. You have no cause to fear any final dissolution of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those who think that Brahma has something to gain by the attainment of emancipation by a living being are mistaken. What is the decease in the size, of the cosmic mind-stuff when one person attains supreme redemption? Again, that person will be created out of the unmanifested sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. For the sake of reaping His sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, Brahma continues to imagine and will continue throughout eternity. Brahma may be happy about the redemption of a unit living being, but it is no help to Him in attaining salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It is expedient for human beings to be ever grateful to Him, since by His grace He has equipped them with the requisites for sa&#x301;dhana. He constantly showers His grace without reservation even on those persons who make no effort for salvation and who gradually degrade themselves. Even though you calumniate Brahma and deny His existence, yet He will not be displeased with you. He will not thrust you on the path of destruction. His imposing countenance of forgiveness will for ever remain, and He will forever go on directing you to the ways of salvation.

His or her voice is choked by the influx of emotions and through lips zealous with sentiment, through the tilting body and tearful eyes, one and only one soundless voice recites.

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In ancient times when the desire to worship awakened in the minds of the primitive people for the first time, at that initial stage they took men of great wisdom and strength as the objects of their adoration. Before this they had been Nature-worshippers or physiolaters. When their mental hunger was no longer satisfied by the worship of mountains and rivers, trees and creepers, forests and seas, dawn and dusk, or thunder and lightning they took their first step towards the contemplation of God through the medium of hero-worship. As a result, a kind of incarnation doctrine came into being, ascribing full Brahma-hood to an aspect of manifestation. This practice was adopted in the name of religion, and was popular in society for many generations after. But the urges of the human heart are limitless. The desire to know their inner nature led human beings to the philosophical path, and as a result of philosophical dissertation and discussion their way of thinking gradually changed. They began to think how it was possible to attain the beginningless, indivisible, super-exultant self through such unit-worship &ndash; through the worship of the finite. When the realization dawned in their minds, they felt a great agitation &ndash; a mighty inner stirring in their hungry hearts, a longing to know the beginningless, endless, unmanifest, all-pervading Entity. How and what is that which the mind will apprehend with its entire being?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The first hint of Brahmabha&#x301;vana&#x301; or intuitional science was mentioned in the ancient writing of the Rgveda. That first seed grew into a huge tree in the Yajurveda with numerous branches and twigs. At that auspicious moment, human intellect saw through the radiance of its supra-mundane knowledge, through its clairvoyance, that whatever it wanted in the material world emanates from and belongs to the Supreme Absolute Bliss &ndash; all are but the unit-manifestations of the Supreme Entity. None of these are its whole self. But it cannot neglect these units, for they, too, are not outside it. They too, are an inseparable part of the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The common people could not grasp the deep Brahmatattva or Intuitional Theory, and so they tried to hold on to the superficial, extroversial trappings of religion such as sacrifices, rites and rituals, making them the medium for their religious expression. But wise and educated people realized that as a result of this worship of the crude, people with a developed intellect and consciousness would gradually revert towards crudeness and gradually be transformed into crudeness. We must however admit that it is not possible to give up the effort to attain the crude in the form of physical necessities. Nevertheless, having food and clothing and other physical needs cannot completely satisfy the hunger of the human heart. At different times human beings have gone without clothes or anything for years or voluntarily renounced the world when it proved antagonistic to the deepest urges of their heart. So it will not do for human beings to think only of providing themselves with the crude necessities. If anybody leads this type of life, they will never experience bliss &ndash; they will always feel inside them the aching void of the desert.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So human beings concluded after due cogitation: since it was not possible to give up the units and since they would have to go in for the &ldquo;whole&rdquo; after all, they would just as well forestall their attachment for the finite by always keeping awakened in their minds, even while making use of the units, a sense of their being the image of that very Supreme Spirit. The pleasure-ward trend of the attachment would then be diverted towards the Bliss-ward course itself. By ascribing divinity to everything and thereby eliminating the limitedness of its littleness, humans would realize and enjoy the Supreme Bliss. In the Va&#x301;jasaneyii Samhita&#x301; (Code) of the Yajurveda it is said, &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Isha&#x301; va&#x301;sysamidam&#x301; sarvam&#x301; yat kiin&#x32D;ca jagatya&#x301;m&#x301; jagat<br>Tena tyaktena bhuin&#x32D;jiitha&#x301;ma&#x301; grdhah kasyasviddhanam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This world is changing, moving. The word jagat (world) is derived from the root, gam-kvip, which means moving. This universe is the psychic manifestation of Brahma. All thought processes are moving and restive, and that is why this world, the psychic manifestation of Brahma. All thought processes are moving and restive and that is why this world, the psychic manifestation of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (the Subjectivated Transcendentality), is moving and restive. A thing that appears beautiful today is not necessarily so tomorrow. A sandesh (sweetmeat) that is delicious today will not be fit for consumption after a few days. Indeed one cannot even vouch for its shape still being intact. Every unit is in a state of change, and that is why the pleasure derived from unit objects cannot last permanently. So what should a Sa&#x301;dhaka (spiritual aspirant) do? He or she must ascribe divinity to every unit object. Everything is the manifestation of God. Whether it is land, home, river, mountain, respect, insult, day or night &ndash; everything is He and His manifestation as a unit. Make proper use of all objects thinking that they are His gifts to us. To enjoy or endure anything is to enjoy or endure Him. Avoid the attraction of the unit and make contact with the integral whole. When you are able to live this way, the desire to steal the property of others will completely disappear. In Ananda Marga there is a special process through which one can dedicate everything to God. The ascription of divinity to objects means the pursuit of the Infinite, leaving the finite behind. Are you feeding your son? No, no, you are feeding the son-like manifestation of Brahma. Are you tilling the field? No, no you are serving the finite manifestation of Brahma with your plough. Really speaking, the ascription of divinity to objects precludes their material enjoyment, as the objects then merge in the non-material Supreme Brahma. Thus the mind of one, who has established him or herself in real Vaera&#x301;gya (the renunciation of all sensual pleasures) can never become attached to finite objects. Even in their midst he or she remains beyond the reach of their attraction and gains eternal peace after death.<!-- /block --></p>

Otherwise a person who lives a long life will perform many actions, thus creating many reactions of greater sorrow to be experienced, and one will be a victim of the actional cycle life after life.<!-- /block --></p>

To establish oneself in Brahma is not possible through the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the mind, racing up and down at the beck and call of the senses. The person who busies himself with the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the mind instead of that of the A&#x301;tman&#x301; is, in fact running after darkness or an uncertain future.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Those who are sensually and materialistically inclined destroy themselves because through their actions they deny their own souls. Whether they profess to recognize the existence of the soul or not, their actions are certainly detrimental to their self-development. In this material world you may have come across many people who acknowledge the existence of Brahma, who say that they recognize the existence of soul, argue over it and are not afraid even to shed blood for the preservation of their religion, yet in their individual lives they are always chasing after sensual pleasures. They are of the above type. They gradually drift away from light towards darkness, regressing from a developed human life towards animal life. Although they have attained a human body, they have not shown any interest in behaving in a way that is worthy of a human being. The foremost duty of a human being is Brahma-sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or the worship of God.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Essentially the soul and the Supreme Soul are the same. It is the objects of the mind that are different. A person whose mind has accepted the Infinite as its object has indeed identified himself with the Supreme Soul. Now the question may arise; when the Supreme Soul is infinite in nature, how does the distorted idea of individuality come about, and what relation is there between the unit-soul and this observable world? The Dharma or characteristic of an individual is to advance from the finite towards the infinite, from a part to the whole. This characteristic emanates from the desire to attain happiness &ndash; for self-preservation. As long as the goal is not limitless, one cannot gain the eternal happiness of all the imaginable and unimaginable entities. The Supreme Soul alone is beginningless and endless, and that is why limitless happiness is only possible through the Supreme Soul. The pain of losing unit objects is far greater than the pleasure they give us. The suffering that one sees in the world is merely the pain caused by that loss. But a persons of wisdom are never affected by the pain of loss for they know that the cause of all suffering is one&#146;s own Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. These Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are the reactions resulting from one&#146;s actions, past and present.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra born of pleasure and pain or the consequential momentum that creates the state of microcosmic subjectivity in the Macrocosmic Consciousness and stamps the Integral Body with the seal of limited unit-hood, has got its rudimental cause in the Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras acquired by the Supreme Being in the state of bondage. Actually, it would be more accurate to call it the mental reflection of action and reaction instead of calling it the distortion of the Supreme Soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The individuality of the unit is not complete in itself. So until one merges in the Whole Entity, one&#146;s suffering cannot be alleviated. I have already said that the Sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s sufferings are caused by the Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which one created oneself. One should therefore not be afraid of experiencing these reactions or accuse Brahma of injustice on this account. Humans very often complain, &ldquo;God, so you had this in store for me. Is this my reward for so much worship and so much charity?&rdquo; Such complaints are foolish, even sinful. At the time of suffering a Sa&#x301;dhaka should reproach himself for his past misdeeds and refrain from evil actions in order to avoid more suffering in the future. Everyone should bear in mind that as long as the fire of woes is not extinguished &ndash; so long as the Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are not burned one has got to suffer. That is why I say you must not find fault with others because of your Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras; they are merely the reactions caused by your own mistakes and misbehaviour. Do you not see in the reflection the same wreath that you put around the neck of a shadow? Poet Vidya&#x301;pati said:<!-- /block --></p>

How can the all-pervading entity in whom everything exists, have movement? He is faster than the mind, as the motive force that exists in His psychic body, i.e. the motive force of His thought process, dictates the movements of all the entities of the world; it is from this that they get the impetus to move. The senses are not capable of understanding. This is because the movement of the senses is towards objects, and so-called motionless objects are merely external forms of His mental expressions, His efferent thought-waves. His Blissful Entity is resplendent in its original state beyond the sphere of the mind. It is because of the cognitive Entity that life and energy exist in the world and that all processes of creation are continuing in a planned way.<!-- /block --></p>

When a Sa&#x301;dhaka becomes well-acquainted with His Blissful Entity, we say that he or she is established in Brahma. At that stage there is both internal and external unity. The mind remains indifferent to worldly attractions and one makes real acquaintance with the Supreme Being. Although the body remains in the mortal world, the soul is merged in the Supreme Soul. The mind then becomes unrecognizable. Whose mind is it after all? Poet Cand&#x301;ida&#x301;sa has written, &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Thus goes the cycle of evolution from the subtle to the crude and from the crude to the subtle. The movement of the unit is from the crude to the subtle. The path comprised of the extroversial movement away from and the introversial movement towards Brahma, is called the Brahmic or Cosmic System, which is revolving under the forces of Sain&#x32D;cara and Pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Under the influence of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; (Introversive Force or Force of Macrocosmic attraction) the unit activates the centripetal or introversive momentum of His thought-process through his Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and by worshipping Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; (Extroversive Force or Force of microcosmic distraction) he extends the centrifugal or extroversive action of His thought-process and prolongs its duration. In Vidya&#x301; cognition predominates, whereas in Avidya&#x301; there predominates action (Vidya&#x301; is a Cognitive force, and Avidya&#x301; is an activating force devoid of cognition). Cognition and action should be balanced in the life of a Sa&#x301;dhaka, or else it will be difficult to move towards Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

People with calm and collected intellect, Sa&#x301;dhakas with developed intuition, who could very well understand such things due to their judgment, have made the above declaration with regard to Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301; i.e. salvation is not possible through the cultivation of only one of these two principles. For the attainment of salvation, there must be balance between Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301; to move forward. Although the movement towards Brahma must be introvertive (Vidya&#x301;), one should not give up Avidya&#x301; completely in relation to the practical world. This also has got to be made compatible with one&#146;s own spiritual way of life by ascribing normal and divine bearing to it. Here the balance between Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301; refers to the equitable conduct and behaviour during the period of material enjoyment.<!-- /block --></p>

In that bearing of His abides the splendour of all-fulfilment &ndash; the seed of all-knowingness. &ldquo;Tatra niratishavam sarvajin&#x32D;avijam.&rdquo; The Supreme Being has no crude body. He is absolutely faultless, pure, sinless, all-mighty, all-observing, all-knowing, self-controlled and Svayambhu&#x301; or self-creating. He is not comparable to anything or anyone &ndash; &ldquo;Na tasya pratima&#x301; asti,&rdquo;, i.e., He has no image. In Him there is unlimited forgiveness. From the very beginning He has been giving everything to the units and will continue to do so. Such, is the attitude of that Great Being. One who is dazzled by the superficial splendour of His creation and gets entangled in it through one&#146;s extroversial tendencies forgets the great, noble Creator behind this creation. Is it not foolish to forget the Lord of the creation for the created? Mother is cooking. The son suddenly cries for his mother. Mother gives him a toy, and the son is so fascinated by the toy that he forgets all about his mother. But when a son does not forget his mother and stop crying in spite of the toy in his hand, then the mother is compelled to embrace him and take him on her lap.<!-- /block --></p>

Scientists who are wholly and solely dedicated to the worship of Sambhu&#x301;ti and hermits who live in constant fear of destruction are both on the wrong path: they are not on the path of salvation.

In each of the five different stages of mind i.e. (1) Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a (Crude or Conscious mind), (2) Manomaya Kos&#x301;a (Subtle or Sub-conscious mind, (3) Atima&#x301;nas Kos&#x301;a (Supra-mental mind), (4) Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya Kos&#x301;a (Subliminal mind), (5) Hiran&#x301;yamaya Kos&#x301;a (Subtle-Cosmic Mind) &ndash; (the last three are collectively called causal or astral or unconscious mind) some sort of finite object directly or indirectly remains, and this object becomes the cause of bondage &ndash; &ldquo;Mana eva maus&#x301;ya na&#x301;m ka&#x301;ran&#x301;am bandha moks&#x301;ayo&rdquo;. In other words the unit attains salvation only when she/he empties her/his mind of all objects. Just as an iron sword can perform acts of cruelty or merely cut the rope tethering and animal, similarly, according to its objective tendencies, the mind can also be the cause of both bondage and liberation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->All unit objects are external. Love for such unit objects can never be lasting, for the mind always keeps hopping from one object to another. That is why I say, withdraw your love from the unit and merge yourself in the whole. Don&#146;t mistake the unit for the soul or God. The attainment of one&#146;s inner self is only possible through love for the Infinite. Don&#x301;t pretend to be inferior and as a result become lazy. Fill your heart with love of the Infinite, and your soul will be transformed into the Supreme Soul. No worldly happiness is limitless. Dedicate yourself completely to the blissful ocean of the Supreme Soul. Then alone will you realize what happiness really is. This path to attain happiness, this Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of self-surrender I call absolute devotion. Carry on performing your worldly duties with sincerity, and at the same time think about the pure self within you. Then alone will your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; be justified. The constant thought of your pure inner Self will certainly one day establish you in your original source, and this is the ultimate aim of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The Soul is by nature characteristically pure. The mind gets tied to Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (potential reactions) due to its actions, and that is why the unit becomes the slave of life and death. When all the Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are destroyed through spiritual Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and mental purification, one goes beyond life and death to the eternal region of immortality, where there is no difference between the soul and His Supreme Soul.

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Vedas are the unique manifestation of human intellect. The etymological meaning of the word &ldquo;Veda&rdquo; is knowledge. This knowledge is of two types. One type is subject to time, space, and person, and the other is the realization of the self, independent of all subjections. The former is called Relative Knowledge or Apara&#x301;jin&#x301;a&#x301;na, because it is related to objects, and the latter, spiritual Knowledge or para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Here the word, Veda, is of course used in the sense of spiritual knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Last Shra&#x301;van&#x301;ii Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301; I told you some thing from the Shukla-Yajurveda. Today I will tell you something from the Atharva Veda. Learned persons say that there is nothing important in the Atharva Veda. It is only a collection of mantras or incantations about ghosts and spirits, composed by people in prehistoric times. It is up to you to judge the veracity of the opinion.<!-- /block --></p>

What is the relation between Brahma and the world? Please tell me something about them.&rdquo; The sage replied:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Just as the spokes are attracted to the hub of a wheel, similarly every object in this universe is Brahma-centric and thus has kept up its individual existence. The nucleus of the Cosmic System is the source of all entities from the highest of created being down to the lowest insect. Rk. (Incantations), Yaju (invocations), Sa&#x301;ma (songs) or the individuals engaged in Viprocita or Ksa&#x301;trocita service (i.e. service befitting a Brahmin or a Ks&#x301;atriya) &ndash; all are dependent on Brahma, the source of their existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Praja&#x301;patishcarasi garbhe tvameva pratija&#x301;yase<br>Tubhyam&#x301; Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a praja&#x301;stiima&#x301; balim&#x301; haranti yah pra&#x301;n&#x301;aeh pratitis&#x301;t&#x301;hasi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word, Praja&#x301;, means evolved objects. Brahma is of course Praja&#x301;pati or the Lord of evolved objects for He is the controller of all of them. Praja&#x301;pati-brahma&#x301; moves about in the womb as the embryo and when it is born, the event, in fact, should actually be called the reflex birth of Brahma instead of His birth, because all created entities are merely manifestations of Brahma Himself. For instance, there is only one moon, but its reflection falling in the countless footprints of cows (Gos&#x301;pada) appears as countless moons. No new moons are created. The same moon is being reflected in several receptacles. Similarly one Brahma is manifesting Himself over an infinite number of units in countless mental receptacles. Brahma is Absolute Bliss. That is why the units or microcosms are always racing with the help of their sensory and motor organs towards their inner selves, i.e. towards the attainment of happiness. So it is said that knowingly or unknowingly the units are moving towards Him to attain Him, filled with inspiration from Him. (Several times in the Atharva Veda the word, &ldquo;Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;, has been used to mean Purus&#x301;a and the word, &ldquo;Rayi&rdquo; to mean Prakrti).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Here the word, Deva, means the carrier of sensations, i.e., organs and nerves. Through the organs and nerves the body expresses a sensation or feeling and that is why they are called Devas or gods of the microcosmic body. But these organs and nervous systems are completely dependent on the spine for their existence and functions. Sensation is transmitted along the spine and that is why without a spine the unit would be a motionless, inert, fleshy mass. The above Shloka declares that, what spine is to the unit, Brahma is to the universe. Without Brahma the universe would be utterly destroyed, the seed of the imagination would be completely obliterated. According to an ancient custom, the death rites in honor of the deceased used to be performed by using Svadha&#x301; mantra (i.e., an invocation chanted while offering a sacrifice to the spirits of the dead). That is why, it is said that Brahma, as the first and foremost point in order of succession, is as important to all mundane objects as the first recipient of obsequial oblations is to the subsequent ones. To the sages He is as sacred as the vow of truthfulness. By Rs&#x301;is or sages I mean those who have hastened the advancement of human civilization by inventing or discovering things through their Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practices. Such sages make the base of their lives on truth; without truthfulness intellectual expansion towards the Supreme is not possible. Let us here discuss the meaning of the word, Truth. People generally use four words, Satya, Tothya, Samyak and Rta synonymously or in an identical sense. But in reality there is a great difference in their meanings. The English equivalents of Tathya, Samyak and Rta are &ldquo;Fact&rdquo;, &ldquo;Correct&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; respectively. But in other languages &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; (Truth) has no equivalent. The Philosophical meaning of the word &ldquo;Satya&rdquo;, is unchangeable, i.e., that which has no distortion, that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person. Human life progresses through different stages &ndash; from childhood to adolescence, from adolescence to youth, youth to old age and old age to senility. It is through these changes that people progress. That is why human life or its receptacle, the body, is not Satya&#x301; or Truth. There is yet another philosophical meaning of the word, &ldquo;Satya&rdquo;, which is Citsvaru&#x301;pa (the Supreme consciousness) or Purus&#x301;a. In the field of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice the meaning of &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; is &ldquo;Parahit&#x301;artham&#x301; va&#x301;unmanaso yatha&#x301;rthatvam&#x301; satyam&rdquo; i.e., Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others. No matter what meaning of &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; we accept, a benevolent sage has got to be truthful. The creation of one who has not learnt to regard the blissful, unchangeable Entity as the ultimate goal is no creation &ndash; is a veritable negation of creation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->There is nothing inanimate or insentient in this world; everything is animate and sentient. In some places consciousness is condensed and in other places it is uncondensed. Where consciousness is condensed, we say &ldquo;animate&rdquo; or &ldquo;sentient&rdquo;, and where it is uncondensed, i.e., where the influence of Prakrti is more predominant, we say, &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; or &ldquo;insentient&rdquo;. The difference between this so-called sentience and insentience is that the so-called sentient, due to its consciousness being condensed, is capable of controlling itself, but due to the uncondensed state of consciousness the so-called inert or insentient is entirely dependent on the wishes of Prakrti, i.e., it is compelled to behave according to the thought-process of the Macrocosmic Mind. This may stimulate a question in our minds. If the so-called inert object is subject to the wishes of the Cosmic Mind, then the Cosmic Grace must necessarily have to be on it only. If the sentient is capable of thought by itself, why should Brahma think for it at all? There is hardly any ground for Brahmic mercy to be showered upon it. The world is crude, and that is why He has kindly regulated its course of movements, so that it may not be smashed to smithereens by the impact of a comet. But to a sentient person He has allowed discretion to take poison or nectar. Is this consciousness then a curse to the living? No. To Him &ldquo;animate&rdquo; and &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; make no difference. He has no partiality for one or the other. The insentient do not work by themselves, and so they are not vulnerable to punishment or eligible for reward for vices or virtues, but the sentient attain the good or bad consequences of their acts&#8230; they experience pleasure and pain. Let one suffer or enjoy according to one&#146;s deed. He stands by His duties, why shouldn&#146;t He? With the birth of a child He provides milk in the mother&#146;s breasts, affection from the father and love from friends. Aren&#146;t these His mercies? After the scorching summer of the month of Vaesha&#x301;jha come the showers of the rainy season. These merciful showers are also His. From such changes rocks, iron or gold do not perceive pain or pleasure. It is living beings who endure or enjoy them. It is through these showers for their enjoyment that various things grow, and through them they all feel and enjoy the self-same Bliss Absolute, which Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. And so He has not only forgotten you, rather He gives you compassion and mercy for no compulsive reason &ndash; much more mercy perhaps than you even deserve.<!-- /block --></p>

Concentrate on that On&#x32D;m&#x301;, His characteristic Self. You have come into the field of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in order to enter the kingdom of light beyond the shores of darkness. May your journey to the empyreal region be glorious and triumphant. Bon voyage to you.<!-- /block --></p>

Now the part of your consciousness which plays neither the role of a witness nor of being witnessed and yet remains as the knower of your observation, that subtle part or bearing, if taken in the Brahmic or theistic context, will be regarded as Purus&#x301;ottama.
