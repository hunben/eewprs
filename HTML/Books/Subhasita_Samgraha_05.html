<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is an effort to remove one&#146;s internal distortions &ndash; an endeavour to extract the gold from the alloy, so to speak &ndash; in order to become established in one&#146;s original stance which, for a jiiva (unit being) is &ldquo;Purus&#x301;a&rdquo; or A&#x301;tman (Cognitive Principle or Consciousness). The only duty, the only mission of a sa&#x301;dhaka (spiritual aspirant) is to a fight against the impurities and distortions that arise due to the influence of Prakrti. To liberate the Purus&#x301;abha&#x301;va from the bondage of the witness-ship of these distortions, they should not be cast aside but should be smelted in the fire of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and restored to their pure and original form. And once purified they will almost be indistinguishable from the witnessing Purus&#x301;ottama, When the witnessing Purus&#x301;a is relieved of the bondage of witness-ship of those distortions He, too, will merge in the Supreme Cognition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the unit or collective body, Consciousness is first metamorphosed into Mahattattva and thereafter is subject to a series of gradual transformations. If we call this process anuloma vya&#x301;vastha&#x301; (descending order of metamorphosis) the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; should be described as pratilom vya&#x301;vastha&#x301; (ascending order of evolution. Through the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; a sa&#x301;dhaka proceeds from crude to subtle, from psychic to spiritual, from the mental sphere to the metempirical sphere of Consciousness. Here a question arises: When unit beings reach increasingly subtle realms, will the quinquelemental world become non-existent? I would say in reply that this quinquelemental world is not the creation of the unit mind, but is the creation of Macropsychic conation and thus much more powerful than the unit mind. So as long as the unit mind exists the quinquelemental world will certainly exist. It will still exist when the unit mind becomes pinnacled or apexed and merges in the Cosmic Mind, not as a relative truth but as various imaginative flows. But when the unit mind reaches the ultimate stage and dissolves in Cosmic Consciousness, it ceases to exist for the Macrocosmic mind itself loses its identity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->So the unit mind should be withdrawn from the world of fundamental factors and focused on the Non-attributional Entity. When the mind is completely withdrawn from the relative world a sa&#x301;dhaka is said to have attained the original stance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The emergence of the five fundamental factors occurred due to the movement of the Macrocosmic mind from subtle to crude. In the process of crudification the cosmic mind-stuff (citta) was metamorphosed into the ethereal factor, which comes within the scope of microcosmic perception. The ethereal factor further condensed and crudified and was metamorphosed into the aerial factor, coming within the more direct perception of the unit mind. The aerial factor, becoming even more condensed and crudified, was transformed into the luminous factor, the medium of perception of the visual organ. The luminous factor, in the process of further crudification, was converted into the liquid factor, becoming a drinkable substance for living beings. And the liquid factor, in the process of even further crudification, was metamorphosed into the solid factor. In this descending order of movement, the crude manifestations of the Cosmic Mind can be perceived by a greater number of sense organs (indriyas) than the subtle ones. So in the process of withdrawal (pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra) one should first withdraw one&#146;s mind from those crude physical objects which are perceptible to a greater number of sense organs, and then direct it towards subtler objects, thus completing the process of bhu&#x301;ta-shuddhi (an important part of spiritual cult). The initial struggle that a sa&#x301;dhaka has to wage, standing firmly on the ground of yama and niyama, is the struggle against the static pressure of the five fundamental factors. It is the struggle to perfect pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Do you know what unit beings are? They are like impure gold. Put this impure gold &ndash; and its impurities are not unnatural &ndash; in the hands of an experienced goldsmith, and it will become pure and glittering after the impurities are removed through the application of heat and other processes. The impurities are bound to be removed. In a similar manner, human beings will have to remove their mental impurities with the help of the heat of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, after first washing the human mind with the holy water of yama and niyama (the first two limbs of the eight-limbed as&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga yoga). An intelligent person never misutilises or under-utilises any object. The impurities are not an integral part of your original stance, but are distortions created by Prakrti. To realize that original stance they must be removed. However, they are embedded in the mind, they are inseparably associated with it, they are the propensities causing pleasure (positive mental propensity) and pain (negative mental propensity). If these propensities lie dormant or are unexpressed, the mind is unable to maintain its existence centring around its Mahattattva or existential I-feeling, and when they are over-active they lead microcosms far away from the original stance. Those people can be called krta&#x301;tma (successful in their mission) who have freed themselves from these distortions, like pain and pleasure, and have thus become as pure as gold.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->It is only possible to understand the nature of Brahma with the help of one&#146;s individual self (A&#x301;tman). You cannot understand the Supreme Entity with the help of your psychic factor because He is beyond the scope of the mind. And with the sensory organs, which are even cruder than the mind, it is even more impossible to understand Him. He is beyond the grasp of everything. The gross indriyas are the cruder manifestation of the distorted mind. This distorted mind (even though it is inherently subtle) often fails to understand or realize that Entity because the unit citta, created as it is by the static principle, is only able to perceive finite entities. But by ideating on unlimited Brahma one can become established in the cosmotheistic bearing, causing the static bondages of citta to snap and the citta to lose its existence. The moment this happens, the existence of the unit ahamtattva and mahatattva, the controlling faculties of citta, also become unsubstantiated, resulting in the entire microcosmic bearing becoming free from the bondages of limitations. With the dissolution of the unit mind there remains only the pure self. To attain or not to attain this pure self at this stage is equal for a sa&#x301;dhaka because after the dissolution of the unit mind, the Consciousness reflected on the unit mental plate does not get any base in the temporal factor and returns to the original Macrocosmic bearing, becoming one with Purus&#x301;ottama. That is to say, whenever sa&#x301;dhakas realize the unit soul, they discover that the unit soul and Brahma are the same. Once the impurities are removed from the mind, the separate existence of these two entities is lost.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->As long as the feeling of individuality exists, unit beings see the diversities in the multi-dimensional imaginative flow of the Supreme Entity. Their vision thus impaired by non-integral knowledge, they run in pursuit of these diversities and make themselves their slaves. Wherever there is a unit mind there will be spatial, temporal and personal factors. The One who is beyond the periphery of these three factors is eternal. He is the Absolute Entity, others are only relative truths. This endeavour to liberate the unit consciousness from the unit mind, the base of all relativities, is what is termed sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And in this endeavour one must free the self from the domination of the eight fetters (bondage of lineage, vanity of culture, false sense of prestige, hatred, doubt, shame fear and backbiting) and the six enemies (anger, greed, lust, pride, envy, enchantment). The degree of bondage on the human mind is determined according to the intensity of the propensities, which are of various types: some pertaining to physicality, some to reactive momenta, some to education, etc. The unit mind can only guide and control its propensities when its actions are original. In all other cases the mind is guided by the propensities themselves (which may be good or bad). The propensity through which one expresses one&#146;s psychic power depends in most cases (except in the case of original actions) on the influence of physical constitution, education and the environment. Hence, to maintain purity of the psychic propensities, the purity of the body, the reactive momenta and the environment is crucial. It is not altogether impossible for someone to be transformed into a virtuous person if his or her neighbours are good people. We can describe the collective endeavour of ideal neighbours as the purification of the body, education and environment with the help of the collective mind. We are perfectly aware of the fact that if education, the environment, etc., are uncongenial it becomes impossible for even honest people to be virtuous.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In our practical life we call those people great who, knowingly or unknowingly, keep their unit minds engaged in cosmic ideation. But those people who attach excessive importance to the microcosmic ego, and thus begin to discriminate between objects and individuals, become a burden to society. You may have seen priests who after preaching eloquent and verbose religious sermons get themselves entangled in useless arguments with the laity over their sacerdotal fees. Such people shed copious tears whenever they preach the all-pervasiveness of God, yet strive to maintain their &ldquo;purity&rdquo; by keeping the so-called untouchables at a safe distance. Such people only eat food after first offering it to the Lord, yet are very concerned about the caste of the cook. This discrimination is the distortion of an analytic human mind and is the characteristic of those who want to keep their Lord at a distance out of contempt. As a result they will never attain Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->To attain Him, the unit mind, the base of all such discriminatory feelings, has got to be immersed in the cosmic flow. There is no other way. If someone argues that an arum dish rather than a potato dish should be offered in the temple of Jagannath because potato is non-indigenous it is the height of absurdity. Does Jagannath make any discrimination between different countries? Is there any difference for Him between the river Ganges and the Jordan? All lands are His own land; everything is within His mind, created with His own atoms and molecules, and resonated with His sacred ideation. Those whose preachings encourage such discriminatory feelings are the worst enemies of humanity. These are the people who in every age in the name of religion have caused blood to flow, and have injected the fear of heaven and hell, of ghosts and demons into the human mind. These are the people who made human beings lifeless puppets. And even today these vested interests are still trying to perpetrate discrimination in a thousand and one ways. It is said, &ldquo;One who knows Brahma becomes a Brahman.&rdquo; But this definition of a Brahman is inconvenient for them so they have declared that the son of a Brahman is a Brahman and the son of a Vipra is a Vipra, whether they merit the title or not. In this way they have cheated the simple, mute and gullible masses for centuries together. They do not have the key to salvation; no, they hold only one thing in their hands: the binding rope. They don&#146;t possess the spirit or the valour to sing the songs of human emancipation. Their eyes do not shine with the radiance of universalism, but squint with the greed and cruelty of vultures. Buddha was the first person to revolt against their cruelty and devouring greed. He declared unequivocally,<!-- /block --></p>

Human beings are considered low only because of their bad actions. But when they see Brahma in each and every finite entity, and act accordingly, they attain the rank of bra&#x301;hmin&#x301;, they become established in integral knowledge. A bra&#x301;hmin&#x301; is not a caste, it is not a rank; it is the vast Cosmic Entity established in universalism. Mahaprabhu Caetanya also sang the song in chorus with Buddha. He said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Those who ideate on Brahma can remove the bondages of limitations and establish themselves in an infinite, emancipated life. Such people do not bear the identity of either a Brahman or a so-called untouchable, although common people call their physical bodies those of Brahmans. To attain this supreme height of spirituality one needs a combination of devotion, knowledge, and action. Knowledge and action, however, play a secondary role and are important only as aides to devotion. When they are not used for the cultivation of devotion, they become an obstacle. Whatever actions you perform and however hard you try to know Brahma by cultivating knowledge, if you are bereft of ardent love for Brahma, you will ultimately discover that you have no balance left in your bank account. The attempt to surrender oneself through devotion forms the essential part of your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. That Supreme Birthless Entity who is beyond the three realms of time is the most sacred Entity (as He is beyond the periphery of time He is not bound by the limitations of creation, preservation, and destruction). He is the Ageless One, the Permanent One.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->One who can establish oneself in ideation on that Entity, one who can realize Him, will not be affected by bondages. To know Him and to attain Him is the essence of liberation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In crude analysis, the mundane entities of the world are all material. So, being nothing but crude matter, should you ignore their existence? What we see as crude matter, due to ignorance, is essentially a psychic manifestation created by the static influence on Cosmic Consciousness. When human beings look upon an object with a non-integral outlook, they either develop an attraction or a contempt for it; they treat such entities as mere relativities. But if they probe deeper they will discover that these so-called relative entities are the spatial, temporal and individual manifestations of the Supreme Entity. It would be wrong to treat the development projects of Saharasa district as something non-integral, for example. Saharasa district is a manifestation of Brahma, hence the service to Saharasa is Brahma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Brahma exists in all directions (pradisha &ndash; east, west, north, south, above and below) and all corners (northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest), and so to a Brahma sa&#x301;dhaka all countries are equally holy, all directions equally charming. He or she knows that whatever has been created in the universe, and whatever lies in the mother&#146;s womb, are all the manifestation of Brahma, and thus are equally venerable. Whatever has been created, or whatever is being created is all that Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->As Sarvatomukha (having faces in all directions) and Sarvatosa&#x301;ksii (the witness of all phenomena) He is always manifesting Himself in and through each idea. Puffed up with microcosmic vanity, never think for a while that you can do anything secretly. He maintains closest vigil over every action of yours, small or big. All your internal thought waves, auspicious or inauspicious, are being created, maintained and dissolved centring around your microcosmic existence in one part of His vast Macrocosmic mind. Hence not even the least portion of your thought process can remain secret for Him. If you disown Him under the spell of your ego He will laugh. And if you run to Him with ardent devotion, discarding your vanity, He will place you on His lap. With His all-pervasive bearing He is inseparably connected with each and every microcosm. Every secret thought lying within the most obscure corners of your mind is as clear as daylight To Him. If you steal something He will see it immediately. If the police arrest You He will Know it immediately. You know that you have stolen something, so He also knows. You know that the police have arrested you on a charge of theft, so He also knows. If you tell lies to the police to avoid punishment, He also knows that you are telling lies. If the dishonest police accept your bribe and release you, you know they have accepted a bribe, so He also knows. When the same dishonest policeman, while in uniform, tries to show off his dutifulness, you knew that he is an infidel creature in human form, so He also knows.<!-- /block --></p>

At first he increases the range of his psychic power with the help of a magic spell, causing the minds of the spectators within a certain radius to be vibrated with his thought waves. To use one&#146;s psychic power to influence restless human minds is a difficult task, so the magician uses a black curtain, an incandescent light or a glossy coloured mirror, and sometimes plays flute or tells his audience to clap their hands to make their minds temporarily concentrated. At that time, when the mind-stuff of the spectators is temporarily concentrated, he casts his magic spell. The spectators then begin to see things according to the magician&#146;s thought projections. In spellbound amazement they watch pigeons vanish, boulders appear from nowhere and so on while the magician stands still in one place imagining mentally and spreading his supremacy on their minds with the help of his magic power. The spectators, charmed with the magic show, laugh, cry and sing, but the magician, although he is a witness to their smiles, tears and songs, is not moved by the show, because it is the deceptive play of his magic.<!-- /block --></p>

He is the witness of all this, but remains unaffected, unassailed by the clashes and conflicts of His divine play using His infinite psychic power. He exercises His dominance on all.

To compare two separate entities they must possess certain common merits or demerits. For example, if we compare the Himalayas with the Vindhya mountains we can say the former are taller and covered with huge areas of snow whereas the latter are smaller, etc. Likewise, one can also draw a comparison between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean or between a well and an ocean, saying that an ocean is vast, the well tiny. But nothing can be compared with Parama Brahma, the beginningless and the endless Entity, because He is beyond the scope of the mind. He is vast, immeasurably vast. To demonstrate His smallness, you should compare Him with another entity of His size, but this is impossible for although He is so minute He is also beginningless and endless &ndash; no other tiny object can ever be without a beginning and an end. Hence idol-worship or of image-making in the name of Brahma are totally unwarranted. This vast entity lies covert in all the fundamental factors; He is right inside you lying hidden in your existential I-feeling. Through synthetic analysis you will realize Him as the knower of your existence, as the knower of your existential I-feeling. This Supreme Entity exists everywhere surrounding the entire universe. Where the universe is unmanifest He exists, and where it is manifest He also exists; where the universe is manifest He reigns supreme, where the universe is unmanifest He also reigns supreme. He is the witness of the undeveloped celestial bodies of the nebulae and milky way, and He is the witness of your developed intellect. Be it a nebulae or the human intellect, all are moving entities, none remains permanently. Only He is eternal. Only His divine sweetness pervades the past, present, and future. If one can know Him, if one can establish oneself in Him alone, one attains immortality.<!-- /block --></p>

Others&#146; vanity crumbles to dust before His vastness. He is constantly engaged in the divine play of creation, converting His vast mind into minute fractions, smaller than atoms. So tiny are His unit manifestations that none but He can claim minuteness. So vast is He as the Supreme Arbitrator of the sport of creation that none but He can claim His vastness. As Purus&#x301;ottama He lies covert as the witness of the subtle realms of all subtle entities, as calm and tranquil as the towering forest trees. He lies hidden in all entities in His individual and pervasive association and fills everything with His cognition. While measuring His minuteness you may think that the molecule is the smallest particle but on further analysis you will discover that you are wrong, for atoms are even smaller. And when you probe even deeper you will discover smaller particles such as protons, electrons, neutrons, etc. In the process of further analysis your mind will lose its capacity to function; for you can never discover the smallest particle, you can never measure His minuteness.<!-- /block --></p>

Thus you will discover the unbroken thread of causation. While following this thread your mind will get fatigued and will be compelled to stop thinking further, because at the end of the thread there lies the Supreme Cause, the Cause of all causes, the Supreme Brahma. He is the Universal Father, but Himself is self created (Svayambhu).

Artha cannot guarantee permanent security or lasting happiness. But in Brahma, the Entity who liberates one from all mundane ailments and the cycle of rebirth, lies the total cessation of all afflictions, the freedom from all ailments.

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today I would like to say something regarding Macrocosmic excellence and vastness, and microcosmic limitations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Whatever we can think of and whatever we cannot think of in this vast universe, whatever we know and whatever we do not know of this vast creation, are all within the Macrocosmic mind. For Him there is nothing external &ndash; everything is being created, maintained and dissolved within His Cosmic Mind. This internal psychic world of Brahma appears to be an external world to the finite entities. They have no capacity whatsoever to properly understand the true nature of this vast external universe. The jiivas (finite entities) with the help of their indriyas (sense organs) receive the subtle tanma&#x301;tras (inference) from this vast external world. According to those inferences, and on the basis of the transformation of their mind stuff (citta), the finite beings try to understand the world. But the true form of the universe remains embedded in the Cosmic Mind. The form of the world assimilated by the unit mind depends entirely on the power of assimilation of the inferences and the proper functioning of the indriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The unit mind can be compared to a water bubble in the vast ocean of the Cosmic Mind. Although these microcosmic imaginations bear some resemblance to those of the original entity, they are not actually original or fundamental emanations. Rather, they are the inferential and nerve-carried reflections or shadows of the Macrocosmic imagination. What we understand by Miccrocosmic mind is only a transformed state of Macrocosmic Consciousness due to the influence of Prakrti. That&#146;s why Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, although He pervades the infinite time, space and individualities, is manifesting the troughs and crests of His psychic wave in and through the three relative factors. This is the reason why none of His manifestations are absolute truth: neither did they exist in the past, nor will they exist in the future. Even a statement regarding the present is not an undisputed axiom. So when properly analysed this expressed universe is nothing but a collection of temporary entities which are undergoing constant metamorphosis according to the sweet will of Prakrti. It would be more precise to call those temporary entities &ldquo;shadowy objects&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;original objects&rdquo; due to their impermanence and total dependence on the Macropsychic imagination. If the mundane objects are mere shadows created by the Supreme Objective Principle, then for the unit minds, this world, perceived as it is through the inferences, is the shadow of the shadows.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the practical world for the substantiation of one&#146;s shadowy existence other shadows cannot be ignored. Nothing of this world should be ignored, because even though everything is a shadow, it is nevertheless a shadow of Brahma (that is a spatial, temporal, or individual manifestation of His cosmic bearing) and not an inconsequential shadow of the relative world. Hence, to ignore this manifested world is out of the question. While trying to ascertain the proper relationship between the subject and the object, we conclude philosophically that we cannot ignore this manifested world. However, it is a fact that not only is the mind constantly preoccupied with objects which are merely shadows of shadows, but is proud of the apparent control it has over those shadows. If one tries to assess the real worth of the microcosmic existence in this world it comes to nothing more than zero!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Whatever the endeavour of the microcosmic mind it can never go beyond the periphery of the Macrocosmic mind. If the unit mind does try to expand its power of imagination beyond the periphery of the Macrocosmic mind it will reach the state of non-existence. There is nothing beyond or outside the Cosmic Mind. The hopes and aspirations, the pains and sorrows, the active endeavour and the inertness of the unit mind are all within the Macropsychic arena, creating temporary ripples within the vast ocean of the Macrocosmic mind. The sum total of the microcosmic restlessness does nothing more than to create a few ripples on the surface of the vast cosmic ocean. When the unit mind ideates on the Cosmic Mind and converts its finite objects of enjoyment (preya) into cosmic benevolence (shreya), then that finite unit being, who was a mere water bubble up till then, expands beyond its limited form and attains the identity of the ocean. That finite entity which initially thought of self-glorification ultimately forgets itself and becomes totally absorbed in the thought of the Cosmic Entity. It no longer proclaims its own greatness, but heralds the excellence of the Supreme Macrocosmic Entity. The unit beings, due to ignorance, look upon these numerous animate and inanimate entities as finite expressions of that Infinite Entity. Later, in the process of cultivation of knowledge and action, they begin to understand that they are the multifarious expressions of that Infinite Entity. Still later when they reach the pinnacle of devotion they see the Supreme Entity is everything. At that moment all feelings of discrimination evaporate, all concerns about real and unreal, propriety of action and impropriety of action, vanish completely from the mind. There remains only the singular urge to serve the Lord with utmost devotion. When the devotee surrenders his or her entire existential feeling at the altar of the Almighty, there remains no further differences, only an unbroken, sweet blissful ocean in which the Supreme Entity manifests Himself endlessly in His innumerable waves. The sweet relation between the devotee and the Lord provides an unending impetus to the ocean of joy. The Supreme Lord remains absorbed in His divine play with innumerable divine manifestations. What is playful for Him is meaningful for the unit entity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The Divine Entity has an infinite number of heads, an uncountable number of heads.&rdquo; Each entity which expresses intellectuality is one of His heads. No single head can be described as &ldquo;His head&rdquo; because His head is the totality of all heads. Similarly, the Supreme Entity has innumerable eyes which assist Him in seeing every entity of the universe in innumerable ways from innumerable angles of vision. You cannot do anything unknown to Him. Likewise with the help of His innumerable mental feet He moves throughout the entire moving universe. The instrument through which movement is performed is called caran&#x301;a (foot). He is the caran&#x301;a of the limitless objects of this universe. Of course, these countless heads, eyes and feet of His have no physical existence. When you want to see something in your mind you use your mental eyes. Brahma, with His mental eyes, is watching. His mental indriyas continuing the creation, preservation and destruction of this universe. Just as you can use your mental head to cook food and your mental tongue to enjoy its taste, in the same way Brahma is enjoying His creation internally &ndash; there is nothing outside or beyond Him. Most of His mental creations are external to you, but all the created objects, including you, are internal to Him. When you perform an action it is either psycho-physical or psychic, but in the case of the Supreme Entity every action is psychic. This quinquelemental world, however vast it may appear to you, originated from Macrocosmic mind-stuff (citta) surrounded by the static portion of His mind, and that&#146;s why it is circumscribed by limitations. This extremely vast Cosmic citta is not Brahma in His entirety; He is vaster than that. This great universe lies in a remote corner of His endless mind. So the rs&#x301;i says that Brahma exists within and surrounding the entire universe. As the Macrocosmic Ahamtattva (Cosmic doer-I) and Buddhitattva (Cosmic existential I) are not bound by the demarcating lines of the static principle, they are infinite; and His witnessing faculty which is inseparably associated with this infinite Macrocosmic mind is also infinite. But His Knowing Faculty is also not His total entity. The rs&#x301;i has expressed unequivocally that He is established in the Supreme Blissful Stance beyond the domain of the witnessing faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Some confusion arises regarding the meaning of the word dasha&#x301;ungulam&#x301; used in the above shloka &ndash; Some scholars have given a rather peculiar interpretation that Brahma resides at a place ten fingers above His universe. The actual significance of the term is best illustrated in the yogic cult. The non-attributional supreme rank of Parama Purus&#x301;a is located at the pineal plexus (sahasra&#x301;ra cakra), ten fingers above the pituitary plexus (lunar plexus or ajin&#x32D;a cakra, the location of mind as well as kut&#x301;astha caetanya). By trying to describe the location of the Cosmic Consciousness in relation to human physiology, the rs&#x301;i wants to convey that the cosmic excellence does not end in the mind. Of course, the mind is a powerful controlling entity &ndash; being the controller of the five fundamental factors of the human body it is the controller of the five lowest cakras &ndash; yet it is only located in a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra. The seat of Cosmic Consciousness is located ten fingers above the seat of mind at the sahasra&#x301;ra cakra. During sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; when the serpentine power (kundalini) pierces the pituitary plexus one attains savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi. Still higher, at sahasra&#x301;ra cakra, kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii shakti becomes one with Parama Shiva, and one attains the non-attributional stance (kaevalya sama&#x301;dhi).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Suppose you are imagining Bhagalpur railway station within your mental arena. Not only can you see the travellers rushing through the station, you can also see their individual minds. The Macrocosmic mind (Sagun&#x301;a Brahma) knows whatever is happening in the entire universe for His cosmic imagination flows everywhere. He knows and understands every thought-wave, every idea of the innermost recesses of the unit minds in the universe. Apart from being the witness to all events He is also the witness to every microcosmic thought-wave, whether good or bad. He is also aware of every incident of the past, present and future. Time is a relative factor dependent on space and individuality. These relativities of space, time and individuality are created out of His Cosmic Mind, thanks to His grace, and will continue to be created in the future. As He is not limited by the demarcation lines of the time factor He is the witness of all ages. An ordinary person may not be able to detect the hypocrisy of a sinner who pretends to be a decent man, but the Supreme Entity is well aware of that hypocrisy. It is a futile attempt by the hypocrite to throw dust into the eyes of that Infinite Entity, the Witness of all.<!-- /block --></p>

In dynamic thought processes there is mental agitation: when you imagine accepting something, your mental hands start working; when you imagine seeing or hearing something your mental eyes and ears start functioning. Perhaps you know that after deep introspection the subtle mind takes over from the crude mind as the controlling entity of the physical body and indriyas. In sorrowful dreams people burst out crying, in happy dreams they laugh. The reason is the same in both cases: due to the temporary cessation of the functioning of the crude mind, the dreamers &ldquo;see&rdquo; the dreams with their mental eyes and take them to be the reality, and their minds get completely overpowered as a result. Just as in deep introspection or sleep people laugh, cry, sit, stand, sleep, eat and drink, etc. with the help of their mental indriyas, similarly Brahma, the author of this vast cosmic imagination moves everywhere within the universe, His vast Macropsychic arena, with His mental feet. He catches all the objects of this universe with His all-pervasive mental hands. He is the intellect, the intuition and the witnessing faculty of the innumerable created objects and hence we can say that He has His all-pervasive mental heads. Similarly, as the witness of all the macropsychic entities, He has innumerable mental eyes; and to hear their words, spoken or secret, and every loud or soft sound, He has His all-pervasive ears. He exists surrounding all objects with His own identity. You can keep nothing secret or private from Him - He knows more about you than you know about yourself.

<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In each indriya a particular principle is dominant, sometimes the sentient, sometimes the mutative, sometimes the static. During the Bhagalpur Dharma Maha Cakra I said that a merit or demerit in a particular indriya is determined by its capacity to assimilate inferences. Of all the, inferences, sound and touch are very subtle and so their receptors, the ears and the skin, are dominated by the sentient principle. The smell and taste tanma&#x301;tras are very crude and hence their receptors, the tongue and the nose, are dominated by the static principle. The remaining form tanma&#x301;tra, which is neither crude nor subtle, has the eyes as its receptor and is dominated by the mutative principle. Regarding the motor organs, the vocal cords and the hands are dominated by the sentient principle, the legs by the mutative principle, and the anus and genital organs by the static principle. To perform crude physical actions, or to assimilate the inferences of crude objects the importance of the indriyas is undeniable. As the Supreme Entity doesn&#146;t require to be associated with any external physical object, He does not require any sensory or motor organs. To create or destroy an image within His Macropsychic arena He uses His mental indriyas which have the qualities He requires to guide the whole universe with His mental power. Even though He doesn&#146;t have a single physical indriya, He possesses the qualities of all the indriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->He is the controller of those entities who are endowed with individual feeling or awareness and those which are not. Each land every object of this universe is floating on the crests and troughs of His psychic waves: the original wave emanates from Him only. He is the source as well as the controller of all waves. He provides impetus to all entities of His mental creation and so He is Iisha or Controller. Here a question may arise: Being the source of momentum for the created entities, why do some entities behave like gods, while others act like demons? Can He be accused of partiality? No, that is impossible. When everything is His mental creation, why should He be accused of partiality. Jiiva&#x301;tma or unit consciousness is His reflection and the unit mind is the reflecting plate or mirror. The clearer the mirror, the clearer its reflection of the Original Entity. If the mirror is dirty it will not be able to reflect the brilliance of the Original Entity, but for that He should not be blamed. His waves emanate from Him as usual but due to the defect in the mirror the vibrationtion cannot be properly reflected. So if the unit metal mirror cannot properly receive the impetus from Him, Parama&#x301;tma should not be accused of partiality. He is just like a magnet which attracts all pieces of iron towards it except the rusty ones. Some people respond to His call, some do not. That&#146;s why I say, &ldquo;O sa&#x301;dhakas make your [[minds]] free from impurities. Follow the path of cosmic ideation. You need not conduct any ritualistic worship or observe meaningless vows, or undertake hazardous pilgrimages. Just try sincerely to remove the dirt from your mind. When you feel the attraction of the Supreme Entity in every atom and molecule of your existence, you will realize that He is showering His grace equally on all&rdquo;.

If the Supreme Controller is disowned, the so-called morality of the moralist can be lost at any moment, and does get lost. Such people end up pretending to be moralists externally but internally become immoralists. This is the height of hypocrisy in the society. The different spheres of social life, such as education, industry and trade, commerce and politics are overcrowded with this class of human brutes, because of a lack of dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Those who are compelled to become moralists under social pressure, or those who put on a show of being moralists from the rostrum or pulpit, or in short stories, novels and poetry, are actually misguided fools, however intelligent they may think themselves to be. Inflated with the vanity of pedantry they lose all their common sense and behave like lunatics. And the worst thing about them is that to fulfill their petty narrow interests they hoodwink the innocent, simple, unwary, gullible masses. Internally they wish to become ministers to serve their selfish interests, outwardly they say they want to serve the society in the interest of the common people, Their one intention is to fill their pockets with money, but they publicly pronounce that they want to follow the gospels of Dharma. Oh human beings, beware of these impostors. Try to apply your power of discrimination to know who are your friends and who are your foes. You should never allow yourselves to fall victim to these political and religious traders. Remember that every individual has immense potentialities.

You are Unborn (Aja), She is also Unborn. You have no father but are the Father of this universe. She, too, has no cause, yet is the Mother of the universe. This unborn Prakrti, by whom You are activated, is not an entity separate from You because You are the composite of both; Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. Your name Brahma means the combination of both the Supreme Cognitive Faculty and the Supreme Operative Principle. According to the difference in the nature of the three principles of Prakrti, three colours are produced in the vast cosmic body; white, red and black. Innumerable finite entities originate expressing these colours related to the three principles of Prakrti. &ldquo;Though all the microcosms are the reflections of that Infinite Unborn One they worship Prakrti as Her slave because their minds are dominated by Ma&#x301;ya&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

One who has been able to merge in the Original Stance of Supreme Consciousness can easily recognize the constant metamorphosis affected by Prakrti on Purus&#x301;a.

It is as if two friendly birds with beautiful plumes are sitting on the same branch of a tree. One is the Original Entity, Parama&#x301;tma, and the other is jiiva&#x301;tma, the reflection of Parama&#x301;tma on the unit mental plate. Whenever the unit entities do something auspicious with the help of the mind, the jiiva&#x301;tma, due to its contact with the mind, experiences its positive effect. So the rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;One bird (jiiva&#x301;tma) enjoys the sweet fruits of the tree while the other bird witnesses its enjoyment&rdquo;. Parama&#x301;tma, being the Original Entity, is not affected by the activity of the unit mind. He remains as the Witnessing Entity of all actions.<!-- /block --></p>

Due to the influence of reactive momenta the jiiva&#x301;tma has to undergo suffering, bent double under the tremendous weight of afflictions. It appears to be inseparably associated with the unit being&#146;s sense of individual identity. Although, the jiiva&#x301;tman is not the original author of actions &ndash; it is just the witness &ndash; it appears to be caught up in the cycle of action and reaction. Human beings call some jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; maha&#x301;tma (high soul), some punyatma&#x301; (pious soul) and some papa&#x301;tma&#x301; (wicked soul), but in fact it contains neither sin nor virtue, neither good propensity nor bad. It is forced to assume these epithets because of its supposed association with the psychic propensities.<!-- /block --></p>

When the unit mind pursuing the path of intuitional science realizes the greatness of the Macrocosmic Mind it merges itself into the Macrocosmic Stance, ripping apart the bondages of virtue and vice, hope and despair. At that stage no grief, no distortion, can affect or contaminate it. When the microcosm totally surrenders itself to the Macrocosmic excellence the jiiva&#x301;tma also becomes free from microcosmic bondages and its separate individuality gets merged into the Macrocosmic vastness.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The excellence and subtlety of expansion are inseparable. Brahma is the most expansive entity, the all-pervading existence. His subtlety is unfathomable. Due to subtlety His identity cannot be perceived by the senses. It is not accessible to the extroversial mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The cruder the object, the less its capacity of expansion and vice versa. Thus the degree of expansion and subtlety of liquid is greater than that of solid. The aerial factor is even subtler than liquid. The ethereal factor is the most expansive and subtlest of all the five fundamental factors. That&#146;s why it is not perceptible to the indriyas. It is not possible to determine its size or fathom its subtlety, nor to make any measuring rod for that purpose. This ethereal factor, although one of the five fundamental factors, is almost beyond the scope of human perception (it requires a highly developed human intellect and continuous scientific pursuit for its perception) so how can a common person grasp something which is even more subtle than that?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I have said earlier that the subtler an object the less the capacity of the indriyas to perceive it. As the greatness of expansion depends upon the degree of subtlety of an object, the more expansive an object the more difficult it becomes for the indriyas to perceive it. To grasp such an object requires constant endeavour and a refined intellect. That&#146;s why human beings try to understand subtler objects with the help of their minds. What is beyond the perception of the crude physical organs, the eyes or the ears, can often be perceived with the help of the internal ears or internal eyes, or the introversial mind. Wherever the extroversial mind might work in the internal mind or in the external world, it cannot go beyond the periphery of the ethereal factor and is thereafter forced to return to its own abode.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Human beings are constantly coming in contact with an entity beyond the periphery of the five fundamental factors. That entity is the human mind. Although the mind cannot be perceived by the indriyas, with a little introversion its existence is substantiated without doubt in individual life. However hard a so-called pandit (scholar) may try to convince you through powerful logic that you have no mind, you will not accept it because mind is a natural entity for you. You do not require any logic from any outsider to understand your own mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There is another entity which is even subtler than the mind &ndash; the Cognitive Faculty (Purus&#x301;atattva or Bhahmatattva). Being subtler than the mind, it is beyond the capacity of the mind to grasp it. But in the process of sadhana, when the mind becomes so subtle and expanded that it loses its individual existence, the Supreme Cognitive Factor can be recognized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The rs&#x301;i says,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..8"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->While discussing a subtle entity one is continuously reminded of the ethereal factor, the subtlest factor of this perceivable world. That is why people loosely describe Brahma as being &ldquo;like ether&rdquo; or &ldquo;beyond ether&rdquo;. This Supreme Entity who is as subtle as ether (in fact, He is much much subtler than that) is called Aks&#x301;ara because He is not transmuted from the Original Stance. Conversely, the entity or entities which have been transmuted and are undergoing various transmutations are called ks&#x301;ara. Only the Supreme Entity, Parama Puras&#x301;a, is A&#x301;ks&#x301;ra. The various emanations of the Supreme Entity which are subject to constant change are known as devatas (mythological gods or dieties). These devatas or divine emanations lie embedded in the cosmic body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Brahma is the source of infinite energy. Whatever has been created, or is being created, or will be created is a vibrational flow emanating from Him. The seed of all emanations lies embedded in Him. The controlling faculties of the vibrational flows are called devatas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->These devata&#x301;s, or divine emanations, have no absolute or separate identity. The manifestation of this relative universe is caused by their collective expression. The sound created by the vibrational expression of each devata&#x301;, in which its potentiality of expression lies, is called its acoustic root, and the totality of these acoustic roots is called on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra or pran&#x301;ava. Hence on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is the seed of the cosmos.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Those who worship the various deities in pursuit of artha (mundane wealth) and not Parama&#x301;rtha (Supreme wealth) do so because those deities are the controllers of the transient wealth of the universe. Those who worship these deities to attain Brahma will be sadly disappointed for it is impossible to attain the infinite through the worship of the finite. The one who declares that a particular deity is Brahma may have an element of devotion, but must be totally devoid of rationality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Dyotate kriid&#x301;ate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divih<br>Tasma&#x301;ddeva iti proktah stuyate sarvadevataeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->So devata&#x301; is a particular vibrational flow whereas Brahma is the ocean of universal flows, the ocean of divine nectar. It is totally unnecessary for a spiritual aspirant to worship any particular deity. The rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;For one who has not realized Brahma, ritualistic worship, the study of the scriptures, religious pilgrimages, charitable activities or scriptural recitation are all meaningless&rdquo;. Such ritualistic observances devoid of cosmic ideation do not deserve to be called anything less than ostentatious public displays, or pretentious demonstrations of intellectual vanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Only that person who remains free from all superstitions and moves towards the Supreme Entity with genuine devotion, and one-pointed ideation on Him, and whose inner soul runs unhindered towards the cosmic soul, attains Him, attains everything in life, and attaining Him gets merged in Him. Merging in the ocean of nectar, one also becomes nectar. Hence the Vedas declare, &ldquo;Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati&rdquo; (one who knows Brahma becomes Brahma).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->This imperishable Parama Brahma is the paramount topic of the Vedas. Many people think that the Vedas only teach the worship of Brahma, but it discusses so many other subjects such as chanda (rhythm), mantra (holy chants), vyakaran&#x301;a (grammar), and a host of other rules and regulations, dos and don&#146;ts. Should we study all the Veda&#146;s teachings? In reply one can only say that one may accept the essence of something without accepting its non-essential aspects. If someone says &ldquo;I eat wood apple&rdquo; it doesn&#146;t mean that he eats its skin, seeds or gum. Similarly to eat a mango does not mean to devour its skin and stone but to eat the essential part discarding the rest. So to accept a scripture means to accept the essence which stands the test of rationality, and to discard the rest. Rational people should never declare that the teachings of the scriptures should be followed blindly. The rs&#x301;i says,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The Vedas expound the science of metre, the rules of religious sacrifices and various other observances, describe vows and paraphernalia, and make certain pronouncements about the present, past, and future. They also expound the science of intuitional practice. An intelligent person should reject the inconsequential portion of the Vedas and only accept the important part that is the description of intuitional science (Brahma-vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->According to the Vedas the Supreme Entity (Parama Brahma) is giving expression to this created universe with the help of His immanent principle, His divine Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Shiva, latent in the microcosm, is creating a world of imagination in collaboration with Prakrti. Similarly, the Supreme Entity, in collaboration with His immanent power, continues the cosmic flow of creation, the Macrocosmic conation, from which all microcosmic entities emerge. As microcosms are born out of the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; they are subject to Her spell as long they remain in the microcosmic stance. But the Supreme Entity, the Supreme Witness, is beyond the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; for He is the Lord of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Had He been under Her influence, the secret of salvation from Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; would have eluded Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; who continues this cosmic imagination for the exhaustion of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma&#146;s sams&#x301;karas is subservient to the Supreme Cognitive Faculty of Parama Purus&#x301;a because He is ensconced in the highest state of awareness. The Cosmic Imagination starts as a reactive expression from that supreme state.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..23"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;ntu prakrtim&#x301; vidya&#x301;nma&#x301;yinantu maheshvaram<br>Casya&#x301;vayavabhu&#x301;taestu vya&#x301;ptam&#x301; sarvamidam&#x301; jagat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Prakrti are almost synonymous. The etymological meaning of Prakrti is the &ldquo;entity who is creating diversities in the infinite cosmic body&rdquo;. Usually, when the sentient, mutative, and static principles remain in a state of balance, it is called Prakrti, and when balance is lost, due to the dominance of the sentient principle, it is called, Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. But when the balance is lost due to the predominance of the static principle it is called Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. So the rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;In reality Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Prakrti are almost the same. The entity who remains beyond their influence is the Supreme Controller.&rdquo; Both the concept of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are very subtle, too subtle for you to understand with the indriyas. But when (as a result of the combined association of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti) their existence comes down to the psychic level due to the crudifying influence of Prakrti, then your intellect, your subtle power of perception, can perceive their existence. The subtler the object, the less capacity the indriyas have of perceiving it. A subtle mind can only fathom a subtle object like the mind, but nothing subtler.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The crudest manifestation of the Cosmic Mind is the quinquelemental universe. Hence the rs&#x301;i says, &ldquo;This vast quinquelemental universe is His physical body&rdquo;. His subtle and causal body and His stance as Purus&#x301;ottama are beyond the scope of perception of the indriyas. Microcosms can never fathom the extreme subtlety of these states of cosmic existence.

Most of the manifested universe cannot come within the scope of perception of the sense organs and the mind of microcosms. Some part of it can only be realized by the subtler layers of mind and intellect, while the subtlest portion can only be assimilated through deeply universalistic spiritual immersion. Materialistic philosophy does not want to transcend the scope of the crude perceiving mind, and there is no harm if it doesn&#146;t! The nature of an object depends upon the mental outlook of the subject. It is foolish to try to deny the existence of something which is beyond the scope of perception through vain intellectual debate. It is certainly not wise to say that something does not exist simply because it is beyond one&#146;s power of comprehension. If a blind man says that the world is colourless, will it lose its colour? A wise man can only say, &ldquo;I do not understand anything beyond this.&rdquo; So it can safely be declared that a materialistic philosophy is no philosophy because the totality of the universe is not within the scope of its purview.<!-- /block --></p>

All the quinquelemental objects perceived in the universe today had their origin in a previous subtler stage. If we trace these subtler stages back to their original source will finally arrive at the Supreme Causal Factor.

The aerial body is thus a cruder manifestation of His mind. In the further extroversive flow of Macropsychic manifestation, both within and without, there is a ceaseless clash of vital force causing subtlety to become increasingly crude. The intermolecular space decreases giving a concrete form to the Cosmic Mind in its metamorphosed form. The internal and external clashes increase proportionally. In the ethereal factor there is no difference between the internal and external forces, but in the case of the aerial factor there is greater internal clash. Although the molecules in the aerial factor are scattered far from each other there is something external to it &ndash; some external pressure &ndash; which it develops the capacity to resist.<!-- /block --></p>

We can see the luminous factor in the various celestial bodies of the vast space which, although in most cases are not yet converted into solid or liquid, have assumed a particular shape. In the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara these luminous entities gradually get crudified into the liquid factor. Their intermolecular space further decreases causing greater internal conflict.

When it is transformed into the aerial factor it acquires the capacity to carry a greater variety of tanmatras (but not a greater quantity of tanmatras). Thus the aerial factor can carry two tanmatras, sound and touch. However, the sound tanmatra it carries is not as subtle as the sound tanmatra carried by the ethereal body. When the same aerial factor is converted into the luminous factor its total capacity for carrying tanmatras remains unaltered, but it acquires the capacity of radiating light and can thus carry the form tanmatra (as well as the sound and touch tanmatras). The sound tanmatra it carries is not as subtle as the aerial factor&#146;s sound tanmatra.

Under such circumstances the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a will have to act under its own initiative otherwise it will be difficult to maintain the balance between the two opposing forces. To help the individual structure to maintain a balance between the exterial and interial forces the Cosmic Mind creates a sub-centre or individual mind within that structure. When the life force, due to the complexity of the structure, takes the unit mind as the apparent source of its actual flow, that is called life or vital energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h). Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h is the collection of ten vayus. (That&#146;s why in Sam&#x301;skrta it is always used in the plural number. In modern Indian languages born out of Sam&#x301;skrta we use the word pra&#x301;n&#x301;a in the sense of pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h).

That is, they can regress.]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Those who move forward properly along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara or accelerate their speed through the process of sadhana are true human beings. The further the microcosmic body moves along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara the greater its structural complexity. To cope with this complexity the microcosm, out of its physical structure, evolves a more developed and capable psychic body. That&#146;s why we notice that the greater the complexity of the physical structure, the greater the protoplasmic and glandular complexities and the greater its psychic expansion. With the increasing complexity of the body and mind the human hopes and aspirations, pains and pleasures, sorrows and afflictions also increase. The boss running an office of a huge corporation requires far more psychic power than the boss running the office of a small company, for he has to shoulder greater responsibilities and run greater risks. A person who lacks the requisite psychic capability for his job is demoted. Similarly, if a human being is preoccupied with crude thoughts he will have to be reborn in a crude body for he is not utilizing his full potential. Human beings, the crown of creation, due to their heavy responsibilities, have more qualities than other creatures. The reflection of Consciousness becomes more distinct on a mental plate of a person whose mind is highly expanded. Such a mind overflows with bliss when it receives cosmic inspiration, and with the help of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; develops a greater power to realize the Supreme Entity. The day one gets the Supreme attainment marks the end of the Pratisain&#x32D;cara phase of the cosmic cycle for that particular microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->But not all physical entities are converted into Consciousness. Where the vital energy and mind are not developed the entity will have to follow the path of stagnation and can only be established in Consciousness after arousing the vital energy and mind. If it fails to do that, its physical structure will be controlled by the Cosmic Will. Undeveloped physical structures do not try to direct their self will against the natural forces, but human beings, due to the greater complexities of their physical structure, and the greater development of the energy and the mind, challenge the natural forces and sometimes, with the help of their developed vital energy and psychic power, can overpower them in both individual and collective spheres. If matter guided by energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;a) can be called Union Territories (such as Goa and Pondicherry) then the living sub-human creatures together with their vital energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;ah) can be called Indirectly Centrally Administered Areas whose budget is passed by the government; and the living beings endowed with more developed minds and lives can be compared to A-class States (such as India). Normally Direct Union Territories are considered part of the federal state and their civil servants are considered as the employees of that central government. However, under certain circumstances, these employees are accorded different rights and responsibilities. This is the same in the cosmic world too: inanimate matter, sub-human creatures, and human beings have their respective rights and responsibilities. The present state of Bihar is a part of India. The government of Bihar is a part of the Indian government, yet the praise and criticism for or against the government of Bihar does not directly concern the government of India. The government of Bihar will have to plan according to its own state exchequer not the central government&#146;s.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->The same thing applies to human beings with developed minds. When life evolves from matter the Macrocosmic Mind helps in the evolution of the human mind. But when that composite structure increases in complexity in the phase of Pratisain&#x32D;cara, guided by cosmic imagination, its mental capacity increases and proportionately it is accorded greater rights and responsibilities. When the unit mind takes responsibility for the authorship of action it must also take responsibility for the consequent praise or criticism. If the government of Bihar finds itself helpless in certain circumstances it can surrender it&#146;s entire burden to the central government. Similarly, the unit mind can relinquish its authorship and surrendering all its rights and responsibilities to the Supreme Entity, can become one with that Entity by merging the unit mind in the Supreme Mind. But when inanimate matter does not follow the path of living beings, [[it]] follows the path of stagnation. When unicellular beings moving along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara come in contact with other living beings they evolve into multicellular creatures. Through the same process these multicellular creatures can increase their multicellular complexities. When the intensity of the internal struggle increases the psychic body has to become stronger according to the intensity of the struggle. No matter how powerful a creature may be, if its physical complexities are less, its psychic and spiritual complexities will be proportionately less. That&#146;s why the mighty elephant and rhinoceros have to suffer the fate of being the slaves of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->As the psychic realm of a unit being develops its capacity for self expression gradually increases enabling it to struggle against obstacles and move towards a brilliant future. Human beings, due to their greater control over their propensities, try to express their desires and ambitions after due deliberation. But an undeveloped creature rushes immediately towards any object it sees which excites its greed. Human beings do not act like that, of course &ndash; they control their instinct of greed through proper and rational discrimination. And this discrimination is the result of psychic expansion which itself is the result of the reflection of the Supreme Consciousness on the unit mental plate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Thus humans reach higher stages of psychic expansion as they advance on the path leading to the attainment of the Supreme Entity. This expansion causes them to become established in the subtler world of cognition. Finally one glorious day they will either attain liberation by merging their individual minds in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma or salvation by merging their existential feeling in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. But if they remain preoccupied with petty thoughts they will be converted into sub-human creatures or even into the crude fundamental factors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Thus there are three paths open to human beings: salvation (moks&#x301;a), liberation (mukti), and complete crudification. When the five fundamental factors do not get the scope of acquiring a mind in a physical structure they move towards even more crudity &ndash; the solid becoming more solid; the liquid becoming solid; the luminous becoming liquid and ultimately solid; the aerial factor becoming luminous then liquid, then solid; and the ethereal factor becoming aerial, then luminous, then liquid, then solid. As a result of the continuous crudification of the fundamental factors the physical structure becomes more condensed. This path of crudification is the path of degeneration. All the perceptible physical objects of the world are composed of the five fundamental factors. If the subtle factors within them crudify that is are converted into solid one day due to extreme condensation, their existence will go beyond the sense of perception, becoming extremely small. This process of contraction increases the internal clash within the material structure. When the internal clash becomes so intense that the structure can no longer maintain it&#146;s structural solidarity it is called jad&#x301;asphota. Jad&#x301;asphota converts all the fundamental factors into the ethereal factor, from which they again move within the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara evolving once more to their solid base where they again get the scope to become a living structure.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Take the case of this planet earth which is composed of the five fundamental factors.

But when, due to the crudifying influence of Sain&#x32D;cara, the earth&#146;s environment will become uncongenial for habitation, unit beings will not get any further scope to advance along the path of liberation. Under these circumstances the planet and its atmosphere will gradually get condensed. It will become so small that it will become unrecognizable as a planet. When its internal factor reaches the nadir point of crudity it will appear to be non-existent outwardly. At this stage it will experience jad&#x301;asphota causing an immense explosion. That tremendous energy release converts the solid body into the ethereal factor. The celestial bodies of the universe which are unfit for human habitation are all moving through the process of jad&#x301;asphota and are hurtling towards a catastrophic explosion. This is the inevitable fate of each and every celestial body. But it is possible to increase longevity of a particular planet with the assistance of a highly powerful celestial body such as a comet or nebula.<!-- /block --></p>

That&#146;s why from the point of subtlety He is beyond conception. He is the manifestation of all visible objects such as the big and small entities, and all the subtle entities such as the atmosphere. He is the veritable Shiva, blessedness personified. Whatever He does, He does for all. Just as parents sometimes have to punish their children and cause them to weep to rectify their bad habits, similarly Parama Purus&#x301;a leads human beings to Supreme Blessedness through trials and tribulations. If once you can know Him, you will attain bliss.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->This creation which seems to be real to the microcosm is actually the psychic conation of the Macrocosm. Only He knows the secret of this phenomenon. Suppose you are thinking of Laheriasaral (in Bihar, India). Are you not inseparably associated with the Laheriasarai of your mind? Does not your individual identity lie in the atoms and molecules of that Laheriasarai? Is not the subject closely associated with the object? Certainly. Likewise His divine glory is inseparably associated with every molecule of this world of imagination. Just as you can build, preserve, or destroy the Laheriasarai of your imagination according to your own sweet will, likewise the Supreme Entity has the absolute right to play with His creation according to His Sweet Will. Hence He is rightly called Vishvadhiipa, the Supreme Lord of the Universe. Thus we see that on the one hand He is the Supreme Controller of the Macrocosmic thought projection, and on the other hand He is the universal life inextricably related with his entire creation both in the individual (ota yoga) and pervasive (prota yoga) associations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->The immense potentiality with which this vast creation is flowing lies embedded in that Supreme Entity. On the one hand matter, together with pra&#x301;n&#x301;a (energy), through the process of jada&#x301;sphota (structural annihilation) is moving along the path of Sain&#x32D;cara, on the other hand, the pra&#x301;n&#x301;ah (vital energy) of the living entities is gradually merging into the Supreme Entity as the culmination of the flow of Pratisain&#x32D;cara. <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->The as-yet-unexpressed mental potentialities of Brahma are presently moving towards the Supreme  Entity along the path of [[expression of sain&#x32D;cara either in a rapid or delayed movement]].  Thus unexpressed potentialities will continue to find expresson for eternity. [[ [The transition] from the unexpressed to expression results from the  initial impact of Prakrti&#146;s rajogun&#146;ii shakti, which follows the  stage where sattvagun&#146;a alone was influential.]] The degree of mutative expression within the cosmic cycle (comprising Sain&#x32D;cara and Pratisain&#x32D;cara) is not uniform anywhere, nor can it be.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->Due to the ever-increasing progress and the resultant greater psychic clash in the vast cosmic body, the intensity of the mutative vibration increases. Hence, it is not possible for all parts of creation to have a uniform temperature or a simultaneous death. When the energy of the material structure gets concentrated in its centre due to extreme crudity jada&#x301;sphota occurs. This releases vast amounts of energy within the universe thus maintaining the thermal disparity of the universe and the continued flow of the cosmic imagination. That is why the fear of some scientists that the universe will meet a thermal death is baseless. Partial thermal death may occur in part of the universe, but the total thermal death of the universe will never be a reality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->If the atmosphere gets too polluted, or if the release of energy from the sun decreases, this world may become unfit for human habitation. But in the universe as a whole there will never be lack of space for human habitation. People of this earth may settle on other planets which may not be included in our present solar system. Many of the planets, satellites, suns, stars and comets which are presently burning will be converted into beautiful, habitable planets. The very thought of thermal death is unwarranted &ndash; there is no sound philosophical reason to substantiate it. This vast universe comprising the stars, planets, satellites and other celestial bodies is the psychic imagination of the Supreme Entity. Those who separate themselves from that Supreme Entity cannot properly understand this diversity. So the gods and brahmars&#x301;is always remain united with Him because being united with Him is the greatest benevolence. The only duty of a person seeking liberation is to become one with Him. On attaining Him the bondages of fear and decay and death, of hatred and apprehension, etc. will be shattered beyond recognition.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->Just as the essence of clarified butter remains hidden in milk similarly, Parama Purus&#x301;a, as the Witnessing Force, is the fundamental essence lying hidden in all objects. The controlling power of the cosmic cycle is called Purus&#x301;ottama. Shiva is not only the Purus&#x301;ottama or Parama Shiva of objects, He is the witnessing force of each and every molecule. He is also the power behind sight, and the driving force behind each action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->When He remains associated with the collective manifestation of the universe as its witnessing force that is His prota yoga, and when He remains associated with the individual microcosm as its witness, that is His ota yoga. Thus He lies covert in each and every entity in His individual and collective association. The human beings, after knowing the Supreme Entity, attain liberation from all fetters (pa&#x301;shas).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Entity in its movement from crude to subtle gradually becomes &ldquo;free&rdquo; from the influence of Prakrti and begins to imbibe the qualities of Purus&#x301;a. The subtlest portion of the citta is the hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a. Just above this layer is the all-blissful stance of the Supreme Entity. Both inside and outside the [[microcosmic]] structure, the Cosmic process of Pratisain&#x32D;cara is working. Thus He not only exists surrounding all the entities, but with the help of His immanent power, He stimulates His imaginative flow. Thus the material structure endowed with its so-called vital energy becomes increasingly complex and is converted into annama&#x301;ya kos&#x301;a, supported by pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h. It also acquires ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a as its activating force. In the next stages, with the help of the extroversive flow of the cosmic cycle, the manomaya kos&#x301;a evolves out of kamamaya, the atimanas evolves out of manomaya, the vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya out of atimanas, and the hiranmaya out of vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya. The hiranmaya kos&#x301;a finally merges into the Supreme Cognition as the witnessing force. This cosmic imagination is an action and hence it has a sound of its own. It is so subtle that it is extremely difficult for the ear to hear it, but not impossible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->There is diversity in the sound owing to the variation in the degree of subtlety or crudity of the vibrated object. The rhythm in which the vibrational flow of the cosmic mind vibrates the annama&#x301;ya kos&#x301;a of individual microcosms &ndash; veins, nerves, arteries, blood, lymph, etc. &ndash; is the initial stage of the divine cosmic sound. When this sound is heard in the anama&#x301;ya kos&#x301;a it resembles that of a cricket. When this cosmic sound vibrates the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a it resembles the sound of ankle bells. In the manomaya kos&#x301;a it resembles a flute (the mystic sadhakas of the Vaesnava cult describe it as the sound of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s flute); in atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a, the resonance of a gong; in vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a the buzzing of bees or the rolling of ocean waves; and in hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a, a prolonged on&#x32D;m&#x301; sound. Thus the cosmic sound is expressed in various ways according to the degrees of crudity or subtlety in relation to the fundamental factors. There are various physical and psychic expressions centring around the various degrees of cosmic sound. When one&#146;s mind is confined to a particular stratum one hears the sound peculiar to that stratum only. A person who lacks concentration of mind cannot hear any expression of the cosmic sound. In the field of spiritual practice the divine sound is expressed in a spontaneous way. When the existential awareness of living beings becomes concentrated with the cognitive bearing, it is not attracted to any sort of sound. Even the sound on&#x32D;m&#x301; of the hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a becomes non-existent in the non-attributional stance because every sound is a particular expression of a gun&#x301;a or principle (sentient, mutative or static principle), or as an expression of an action. A person who is emerged in the Cognitive Bearing does not need to make any psychic endeavour with the help of any acoustic root. He or she is free from bondages, from all fetters, having attained karma sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->This Supreme Cognitive bearing is the final destination of all human beings. It is He who provides the impetus and inspiration necessary for spiritual progress, for movement along the path of Pratisain&#x32D;cara. And to attain Him one should not perform ritualistic practice. All that is required is to move towards Him with ardent love and devotion for Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What we belittle as matter is nothing but a varying form of energy. To maintain the inertness of matter the existence of energy as well as its application is undeniable. And this concentration of energy, being crude, expresses crude waves which are black. So the energy which causes inertness in objects is an expression of the static force of Prakrti on Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The influence of the sentient principle is the exact opposite, for it is effulgent and expressive. It is characterized by its excellence of expansion and subtlety. The characteristic of the static principle is to bind whatever is subtle within the limitations of forms and lines, thus bringing it within the periphery of sense perception, and within the scope of human conception. Thus, due to the static influence of Prakrti, the abstract is brought into the initial stage of matter (ether). Its nature is to give a concrete form to the absolute idea. When there is the unfoldment of the mutative and sentient principles they cannot give any expression to their limited ideas in the absence of a proper object, though they have the potentiality of expressing themselves. As they do not have any finite medium their expression cannot be manifested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Due to the bondage of the static principle, the expansiveness of the sentient and mutative principles, bound by the limitations of forms, appears as a material object. But since the characteristics of the sentient and mutative principles are unlimited, the static principle actually creates not a limited number of finite entities but an unlimited number of infinite entities. The characteristic of the static principle to bring the subtle within the periphery of finitude is the actual cause behind the manifestations of both actions and objects. These finite expressions of the practical world are the limiting actional expression of the static principle. Names, forms and other symbolisations have been ascribed to them by the doer-I.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The difference between objects is caused by varying degrees of bondage of the static principle. The indriyas (human sense organs) and their controller, the mind, accept the collectivity of these objects, bound by the limitations of forms, as the expressed universe. Where there is no staticity there is no awareness of creation. Because there are no limiting bondages, the very expression of the creation remains indistinct. That is, in the absence of the static inertness, nothing can be brought within the field of perception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Take the case of the precious metal gold. Whenever you say &ldquo;gold&rdquo; you refer to gold in general, the gold of the universe. To be of some practical use, the gold will have to be brought within the limitation of a certain form, such as a gold necklace, a gold bangle, or gold tiara. Women may get a certain pleasure by wearing these gold ornaments, but for the goldsmith has no practical use for them as ornaments. He is only concerned about one thing &ndash; gold. Likewise, due to the influence of the static principle, an infinite number of names and forms have emerged out of Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Singular Entity. Most people enjoy using these finite names and forms, but to practical spiritual aspirants they have no special importance. Sa&#x301;dhakas are only interested in the original substance and not its finite forms. Thus, their only object of ideation is Parama Purus&#x301;a. They only accept Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Singular Entity, as the goal of their lives, just as the goldsmith is only interested in the gold and not its different forms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->How can one shake off the influence of static inertness? How can one get freedom from the bondages of names and forms? Just as the goldsmith uses a hammer and process of melting (in fire) to extract the real gold from the various ornaments, similarly a practical spiritual aspirant will have to break the bondages of names and forms in this expressed world through the cultivation of knowledge (which is mutative), devotion (which is sentient). By virtue of the heat of the fire of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and the strength derived from sustained intuitional practice, a sa&#x301;dhaka can overcome the static inertness, the apparent cause behind the quinquelemental universe. Life and the world will become effulgent with the resultant unfoldment of latent consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Yada&#x301;tamastanna diva&#x301; naratrirna sanna ca&#x301; saincchiva eva kevalah<br>Tadaks&#x301;aram&#x301; tat saviturvaren&#x301;yam&#x301; prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ca tasma&#x301;t prasrta&#x301; pura&#x301;n&#x301;ii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->As soon as mental darkness is dispelled, one will see everything as effulgent in the light of knowledge. The entire universe will appear as an unbroken, infinite, radiant entity. There will be no difference between night and day, between real and unreal. Diversity will merge into singularity. All finite expressions will merge in the integral Macrocosmic Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This Supreme Conscious Entity beyond the veil of cimmerian darkness is called Aks&#x301;ara Purus&#x301;a (the immutable Entity). He is the One to be adored by all. He is the Universal Father. Out of His Infinite Cognition emerges everything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->To realize the all-pervasive Supreme Entity the static darkness has got to be dispelled from one&#146;s mind &ndash; there is no other way. Those who grope in the darkness of staticity are bound to differentiate between various objects, and will certainly be goaded to worship various finite objects. When one develops real love for the Supreme through unflinching sincerity and intense spiritual practice, the bondages of inertness gradually loosen and finally snap open. Those who take the finite to be the infinite, and ascribe Brahmahood to finite objects, ultimately degenerate into inert matter. They are psychologically unable to transcend the bondages of lineage, caste, community and state. They may deliver noble-sounding speeches, but in reality they look upon this world through the spectacles of meanness. To fulfil their selfish group interests they utilize their intellectual power and physical energy for internecine feuds and battles, mutual slandering and jealousy, and thereby vitiate the atmosphere of the entire universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Some intellectuals are in favour of respecting all religions. I say that such people cannot do anything to promote the solidarity of the human race, for most religions demand blind faith rather than rationality from their followers. &ldquo;Don&#146;t argue,&rdquo; they proclaim. &ldquo;Accept the teachings of the scriptures for they are the direct word of God.&rdquo; The cunning intellectuals of the past imposed the importance of blind faith on the minds of their gullible followers. They told them to obey the teachings, rational or irrational, otherwise there would be no respite from the endless suffering of human life, no other path to take them to the eternal bliss of heaven.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In most cases religions took advantage of human weaknesses, crippled the people&#146;s rationality, and sapped their strength, thus facilitating their exploitation by the religious traders. When the vitality and strength of the masses remains unexpressed, the exploiters will be able to exploit them in the economic and other spheres of life for a long time with relative ease. In the annals of human history it can be seen in all ages that the various exploiters were the patrons and the preachers of religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Dharma is altogether different from religion for it teaches human beings to advance while mercilessly smashing all obstacles that thwart human progress. Its inherent qualities are subtle analysis, ideological strength and the brilliance of valour. That&#146;s why the vested interests cannot tolerate it and use all their strength and machinery to oppose it. They claim they are protecting religion. The greater the conflict between person and person, between community and community, between state and state, the greater is their advantage. But when many people form a collective mind through sincere sacrifice and ardent practice while advancing towards the realization of oneness with the Supreme, it will be difficult to continue exploiting people on any pretext.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In fact the ignorance of Brahmava&#x301;da (intuitional science) and dharma has done enormous harm to the human race. In the modern civilized society the same thing should not be allowed to be repeated. By accepting the all pervasive and all-permeating Brahma as the primordial factor for the crude, subtle and causal worlds; by realizing Brahma as the nucleus of the enjoyer, the enjoyed and the enjoyment; and by keeping the Supreme Cognition fixed before the mind, human life should be rebuilt on a strong foundation. All spheres of life should be completely restructured. All feelings of differentiation &ndash; his god, her god, the Hindu&#146;s Hari and the Moslem&#146;s A&#x301;lla&#x301;h &ndash; should be abandoned and that Supreme Entity accepted from the core of one&#146;s heart. That Supreme Imperishable Entity is the final desideratum, the culminating point of all entities.

Now can you ever keep that Infinite Entity confined to a limited place or idea? Leave aside the temples, mosques and churches; even a continent, a solar system or the entire universe cannot confine Him. Dull-witted people, due to the influence of the static principle, wrongly ascribe Brahmahood to finite objects, and worship them.

If an object, however big it might be, is circumscribed by demarcating lines, one can easily create a miniature form to make it easier for the common masses to understand.

Those who claim that their god appeared before them and granted them boons, or prescribed medicine for their ailments after they performed a long dhara (sitting in front of a deity for a long long time, in the expectation of receiving a divine message) mislead themselves. Their visions of gods and goddesses are created out of their own mind stuff due to their mental concentration, and the so-called divine messages come from the vast fold of cognition of their own causal mind.

Intuition is the reflection of incoming perception, the reflection of psychic assimilation. But where intuition has not been awakened, no incoming perception is reflected on it and that is why an object is called matter.

However, as soon as an image is formed in the unit mind it is immediately reflected on the Cosmic Mind. That&#146;s why one cannot do anything unknown to Him. When a man steals something, the Supreme Entity will immediately come to know of the theft. When the police arrest him and he denies his crime, he knows that he is telling a lie and so the Supreme Entity also knows he is telling a lie. If the dishonest policeman accepts a bribe and lets him go, the man knows that the policeman has accepted a bribe, so Parama Purus&#x301;a also knows. Later, when that policeman suffers a major tragedy, such as the death of his son, his eyes fill with tears of bitterness, and he complains, &ldquo;Why has such a terrible misfortune struck me. I haven&#146;t done anything wrong.&rdquo; This complaint will immediately be heard by the Supreme Entity, who will ask the policeman in the core of his heart, &ldquo;Did I take the bribe?&rdquo; That Supreme Entity knows everything.

Theirs is a valiant and relentless fight against the obstacles created by avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; which try to detract them from the path of the attainment of Brahma, their supreme goal, their final desideratum, their polestar, the only ideal of their lives. In the social sphere they struggle not to reform society for the sake of reformation, but to combat the defects and inconsistencies in all walks of life which are detrimental to spiritual life and a stumbling block on the path of attaining the Supreme goal.

Thus they wage a ceaseless struggle against all kinds of defects and distortions with their two most important weapons: yama and niyama.

You should bear in mind that if there is devotion there is everything, and if there is no devotion, there is nothing. It is true that without knowledge one may be misguided, and without action one may become inert, but it is only through devotion that one can attain the Supreme Stance. Knowledge and action alone cannot lead one to the attainment of the Supreme Entity in practice (although in theory it may be possible).

This is your devotion. If a person lacks knowledge and action and calls Him on the strength of devotion it is not altogether impossible to attain Him, but that path is somewhat inconvenient. That&#146;s why I say that even though one&#146;s mission may be fulfilled through the devotion alone, it is better to complement devotion with knowledge and action.<!-- /block --></p>

Their fundamental goal gets obscured before their eyes. Those sa&#x301;dhakas who advance maintaining a balanced adjustment amongst the three will ultimately realize the Supreme Entity. Even those who want to remove the feeling of differentiation from the relative world and look upon the Supreme Entity with an integral outlook, need to develop their knowledge, action and devotion, yet in this case, too, devotion is more important than knowledge and action.

Many of those who have encouraged discrimination between human beings and caused the pages of the history books to be stained with blood are the same people whom society respects as pandits and activists. But such feelings of pettiness are absent in devotees for they love humanity out of deep devotional sentiment.

It is unassailed by the sexual differences of the quinquelemental bodies. The unexpressed psychic reactions (sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras) of the disembodied soul are guided by the Cosmic Mind and adjusted with a proper structure, at a proper time and a proper place, providing a congenial environment for the expression of the unrequited sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.<!-- /block --></p>

When there is dominance of sam&#x301;yojanii shakti in one&#146;s latent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, the disembodied soul attains a female body for its outward expression, and conversely where there is a dominance of vibha&#x301;janii shakti, it attains a male body.

Of course, even in the hermaphrodite the balance between sam&#x301;yojanii and vibha&#x301;janii shaktis is not perfect; there is a slight tilt in favour of one or the other.

Hence there are sexual differences among all developed creatures, without which the preservation of their different species could never be maintained.

Even if the mind thinks deeply about a person of the opposite sex, its own inherent sam&#x301;yojanii or vibha&#x301;janii shakti gets changed to some extent.

When they acquire certain objects they strive to keep them well within their vision. Finally, due to the extreme influence of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, they become so blindly attracted to those pleasurable objects that they cannot bear to be physically separated from them, even for a second.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->One&#146;s bhava [bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras] gets strengthened due to development of one&#146;s resolve and the increased desire to touch, see and cling to one&#146;s objects of desire. This process has been going on for millions of lives. The Cosmic Mind provides a base for the microcosm in a particular form and place in the subsequent life which gives the maximum scope for the expression of its own inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Thus a microcosm can be born on any planet throughout the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->It is said in the scriptures that the disembodied soul first accepts the [[sperm]] with the help of the Cosmic Mind and then, getting united with the [[ovum]], produces an embryo for the proper expression of its latent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. On the one hand the embryo acquires psychic nourishment, on the other hand its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are expressed internally. Until the mind acquires sufficient power to act according to its developed existential Ifeeling, it will have to undergo the torments of afflictions (bhava jantran&#x301;a&#x301;) internally as the doer of non-original actions. At that time it is not the doer. But as soon as the nerve cells acquire the capacity to work according to the developed I-feeling, it starts to perform original actions (pratyaya mulaka karma).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->Wise people say that the living being gets nourishment first in the father&#146;s body, then in the mother&#146;s womb, and finally on the earth after being born. Usually after the age of thirty-nine (of course, the period may vary slightly according to changes in time, space and person) its body begins to deteriorate.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->One acquires a physical body according to the nature of one&#146;s samskaras. A human being who behaves like a goat or a dog may be born as a goat or a dog in the next life, because such an animal body is the proper base for the congenial expression of the latent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Hence it is not at all impossible for a human being to be reborn as a hog, a worm, a tree, or even a piece of stone. One&#146;s destiny will be decided according to the nature of one&#146;s karma &ndash; this is an infallible law. In this regard, neither Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; nor Prakrti can do anything to help. But Parama Brahma out of His Infinite grace, will reconvert these ahalya&#x301;s (those converted into stone as a result of crude actions) into glorious human beings in the process of Pratisain&#x32D;cara, and provide opportunities for their movement towards the most exalted life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->To be more precise it is the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (reactive momenta) which are reborn. Philosophically speaking it is not correct to say that the a&#x301;tman (unit consciousness) is reborn, because A&#x301;tman is neither body, intellect, nor mind; it is just the witnessing entity, the subject witnessing the metamorphoses of its object, sometimes into another finite form and sometimes into an infinite form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;tman is not subject to either pain or pleasure because they are the psychic propensities of the mind. Of course, the desires and longings of the unit mind do affect the A&#x301;tman to some extent. And it apparently seems as if the A&#x301;tman is also involved in the vicious cycle of actions and reactions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->When, due to the grace of Parama Brahma, techniques of intuitional practice (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;) are imparted to the unit mind through the medium of a Guru, the way to emancipation from bondages is opened, and the unit mind begins to transcend all sorrows and miseries. By virtue of this sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one can also free oneself from the vicious cycle of karma, resulting in the A&#x301;tman getting immediate liberation from all mental bondages. Having relinquished the desire for finite objects in different places, in different forms, and in different ways, and having embraced the Supreme Original Entity, one attains the highest fulfilment. This attainment is achieved with the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a in the form of a Guru. Hence there is only one Guru: the Supreme Entity alone is the Universal Guru.<!-- /block --></p>

What sort of realization does one attain? One discovers the divine play of the Infinite Entity in each and every finite manifestation. One realizes that the Infinite Entity who is ever-present in His vast Cosmic stance is also ever-present in every molecule and atom. One experiences that the entire universe is vibrated and invigorated with His unending Cosmic flow. Every entity of this universe, big and small, every minute expression of pain and pleasure of the numerous microcosms lies within His vast Ocean of Cosmic Bliss. In this ever-playful universe He is the Supreme Arbitrator. One realizes that the Supreme Cognitive Faculty resides in His tumultuous Macrocosmic creation, and is thus the Supreme Desideratum of every finite entity. Sa&#x301;dhakas realize Him as manifested in His many forms, and merge their individuality in Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->Is there any place where He does not reside? He was residing in every place long, long before you even knew it existed, filling its space with His Cosmic bliss.

<a name="4..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->Behind this playful stance of the Cosmic Entity lies His eternal immutable stance, which is a passive witness to the ever-changing forms of His Macropsychic manifestation. When devotees see His mutable forms with genuine spiritual vision they realize that they are already ensconced in His immutable stance. This is the state of supreme realization. In this state the miseries caused by the binding fetters vanish and the sa&#x301;dhakas become illuminated by the sweet touch of the playful, blissful, immutable Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is the supreme spiritual fulfilment.<!-- /block --></p>

As a rule, one has to offer something to a person in exchange for an object. If you want to get rice, salt, oil, butter and so on, you will have to pay money. Similarly, to attain Him you are to pay with your existential-I, you are to surrender yourself completely unto Him. Those sa&#x301;dhakas who have accepted the Supreme One as their only goal in life can never worship Prakrti, because they know that the entity they long to attain is everything which exists, and which is yet to exist.
