<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Life is a movement from imperfection to perfection.  When inanimate objects become animate there is progress.  There is further progress when animate beings become multicellular metazoic organisms, more and more complicated structures.  The human being is the highest being, the being most perfect in structure.  The human being is thus a perfected animal.  But this is the beginning of progress for humanity.  Humans still have to achieve further physical, intellectual and spiritual perfection. Movement towards perfection &ndash; God &ndash; is a human&#146;s true nature (dharma).  Movement towards imperfection is against one&#146;s true nature (adharma).  The former is life, the latter is death. Human movement towards animality is therefore not life, it is death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->No movement is free from friction or obstacles.  Even when you walk, the force of gravity obstructs you.  Movement towards perfection is obstructed by all the forces of imperfection, of evil.  The sinful, the crude, the narrow, obstruct all movement for the expansion of the human mind.  But perfection being a God-ward movement, do not be afraid &ndash; move on.  Obstacles will go down the drain, where they belong.  You will progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The mission of human life is to move towards perfection, towards God.  This is one&#146;s duty.  In this struggle the forces of evil are bound to be defeated.  This has been the case all along, and history will repeat itself.  You have no right to rest until you have fulfilled your mission of being perfect, of being divine, of establishing yourself in perfection.  Rest is sin as it puts a stop to this movement.  Do not rest until you have reached your goal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->From the inanimate to the animate goes the process of evolution. Consider a piece of stone for instance.  It has neither the power of action nor the sensation of mind.  What is the reason?  It is because hitherto there has been no manifestation of mind in the stone at all.  Consider the trees and plants that are more animate than the stone.  There is activity in them.  They grow, draw the vital juice from the earth, maintain their species by creating seeds in their own bodies, and enjoy and suffer pleasure and pain when taken care of or hurt.  We see in them the manifestation of consciousness, for mind has awakened in them. Thus progressing on the path of mental development, we see in humanity its greatest manifestation.  Just as evolution takes place from the subtle to the crude, similarly the unit entity reverts step by step from the crude to the subtle, towards the same Absolute Consciousness from whence it came.  It is just like the waves of the sea, rippling back from whence they have come.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->(Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha II, 50)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The darkness of evolutionary night began to fade centuries ago when the first ape-like creature deserted his tree-branch kingdom and shambled out into the light of the plain.  He was guided by something he could not understand: something un-apelike and impossible for his comrades.  Somehow, somewhere in his seething body chemistry, something had changed.  In his brain lay the seed of humanity; in his strangely bright eyes, the dark shadow of a hidden dream.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Time passed slowly.  The new creatures developed and multiplied. The wonderful changes in their bodies and minds continued; their brains, nerves and glandular systems grew in complexity and specialization.  New behaviour patterns evolved and after some time, emotions and feelings unknown and denied to all previous forms of life found their means of expression.  The Dawn of Man was reached at that auspicious hour.  The waves of thought generated by that first human expression vibrate even to this day in the unconscious mind of every human being.  Everyone of us carries within him the hidden memory of that first sunrise, and even beyond it into the darkness of antiquity.  We are, by means of this primordial memory, which is part of our human heritage, intimately connected to all forms of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->(Supreme Expression 1, 328)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Humanity, standing as it does at the top of the evolutionary ladder, may sometimes feel proud and in a weak moment commit an act of meanness.  Yet one should always remain vigilant against this.  The evolutionary forces have not stopped.  The theatre of action has shifted to the psychic level.  Evolution is now expressing its power in the daily struggle of men and women everywhere to attain dignity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->You know, there is nothing disorderly in this Universe. Everything moves according to certain rules.  In this solar system of ours, the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving around the sun.  In this ethereal system, the earth is the nucleus, and the moon is moving around it.  Similarly, in the atomic system also there is a nucleus and electrons move around the nucleus.  In our cosmological order the Supreme Consciousness is the nucleus and so many animate and inanimate objects are moving around Him, knowingly or unknowingly.  Human beings move knowingly and other animals, other less developed living beings, and also inanimate objects &ndash; even some human beings &ndash; move unknowingly, unconsciously.  The radius of those who move unknowingly remains unchanged, or even, due to their mean propensities, their radius may increase.  But spiritual aspirants always try to lessen the length of their radius.  They come closer and closer to the Supreme, and when they come to the nearest proximity, they become one with the Nucleus, and that is the stage of Salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now, so many entities, so many individuals are moving around Him; they have so many physical structures &ndash; long, short, white, black, learned, illiterate &ndash; but the common goal is the Nucleus, the Supreme Consciousness.  There should be no shyness, no hatred, no complex in human beings because that Nucleus is the bigger &ldquo;I&rdquo; of everybody &ndash; that Nucleus is the Supreme Progenitor of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->(Baba in Fiesch, 35)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In this universe there is nothing beyond the Supreme Consciousness.  You always remain within His circle.  Imagine that a cow is tied to a peg with a rope.  The rope may be short or long, but the cow has to move around the peg.  Similarly, human beings are moving around the Cosmic Nucleus.  They go round without knowing that they are tied to a peg, without knowing Who is at the centre.  They think that they are everything, and that they know so much.  They think they are not ordinary creatures; this creates pride in them.  Then, while moving, suddenly a question comes in their minds.  They ask where they are going, from where is the inspiration to move coming?  When this realization, this question arises in their minds, then they know that they are moving around a peg, and that they have to go towards the centre, towards the Supreme Nucleus.  The day this realization comes they become spiritual aspirants and the radius starts decreasing.  When the radius becomes nil, then they merge into the Supreme Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Human beings will have to go on moving as long as they have the feeling that they and the Entity which has created them, the Supreme Consciousness at the Nucleus, are two different entities. When they realize suddenly on reaching close to the peg that they and the Entity which has created them are not different, the distance between the two will disappear and both will become one &ndash; they will merge in the nectar of Cosmic Consciousness. This is the ultimate aim of all beings, of plants, of anything which has life.  Therefore, the person who comes onto the path of spiritual practice early is wise &ndash; and also fortunate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->(&ldquo;Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; Bha&#x301;ratii&rdquo; June 1980, 32)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Now, the Supreme Consciousness is the Supreme Witnessing Entity. Whatever your individual consciousness is seeing or feeling - everything &ndash; is being witnessed by the Supreme Entity.  Suppose you are imagining a rhinoceros in your mind, and that rhinoceros is moving within your mind &ndash; whatever that rhinoceros is doing you are seeing; whatever that rhinoceros is thinking you are hearing.  Whatever the rhinoceros does, then and there it is being witnessed by you.  No activities, no thought waves of that rhinoceros are a secret for you &ndash; you know everything.  So whatever is being done in the universe is nothing but a mental creation of the Supreme Consciousness; everything is within His mind.  He is the Macrocosm, and everything is microcosm.  Each and every person is moving within His mind.  Everything is within Him, nothing is without.  So whatever is being done, He sees, He knows, He feels.  This universe is nothing but a mental projection of that Supreme Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Hence, because everything is His mental creation, so everything, everybody is His child.  He is not the ruler, He is not the administrator, He is not the boss.  He is the creator.  He is the generator, He is the operator, He is the destroyer.  When He withdraws His thought waves within Himself then nothing will remain.  You came from Him, you are moving within His mind, and finally you will become one with Him.  That is why I said, He being the generator, is represented by &ldquo;G&rdquo;; He being the operator is represented by &ldquo;O&rdquo;, and He being the destructor is represented by &ldquo;D&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;G-O-D.&rdquo;  He is the GOD.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->(Baba in Fiesch, 54)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->God is the controller of that vital force which keeps the organisms alive.  He is our friend Who saves us from the jaws of calamities by His affectionate and tender touch.  He exists everywhere.  He is present about us sometimes as sound expression, sometimes as thought or emotion, and then again sometimes as individual entities.  There is not a place in the universe where His Entity is not manifest.  What we apparently take to be a void is also full of His Entity.  He is even where the human intellect cannot reach, and where the imagination bounds back, thwarted and baffled.  In the planetary world, it is His glory that shines as the sun.  The backbone of the nervous system, the praising of the dead ancestors, the truth of the sages, the controller, the friend, the sun &ndash; are all these separate entities?  No, all is He, all is He, all is He.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->(Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha II, 25)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->There is one moon, but its reflections, falling in countless puddles of water, appear as countless moons.  No new moon is born.  The same moon is being reflected in many receptacles. Similarly, the one and the same Supreme Consciousness is being manifested as limitless individual entities, in countless mental receptacles, in countless minds.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Is He moving?  No, no, He is not.  He lies motionless like the stump of a tree.  Is He far away?  No, no, He is not. He is very close.  He is the Life of my life.  He is within you, within me. He is within and without all and at all places.  When a spiritual aspirant gets adequately acquainted with His Blissful Entity, we say that he is established in the Supreme Consciousness. At that stage both inside and outside attain unity.  Mind then remains aloof from the attraction of trifles, and real acquaintance is made with the Supreme Being.  While the body remains in the mortal world, the soul is merged in the Supreme Soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->(Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha II, 10)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Any energy is invisible.  We see the operation and action of electrical energy through lights, fans, etc.  Similarly, no one has ever seen the sun &ndash; only its action.  It looks round, but from a short distance it is simply something burning.  So electricity and the sun are to be felt only.  The same is the case with the mind.  No one can show his mind, nor can one see one&#146;s own mind.  One can only feel.  Similarly, the Supreme Consciousness is only to be felt and realized.  When the whole mind is filled with the feeling of the Supreme Consciousness you can hardly bear it &ndash; nor can you express the bliss. You feel it - you can only enjoy it!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->(A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam, 27)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The concept of God and Satan is defective.  If we accept the existence of Satan it means that there are two Gods, one God positive, and one God negative, i.e. Satan.  And that challenges the authority of the Supreme Consciousness &ndash; that cannot be.  So there is no Satan.  Everywhere there is the rule of the Supreme Consciousness; nowhere is the rule of Satan.  Satan is the centrifugal force that drives an aspirant, a human being, away from the Supreme Nucleus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->(A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam, 54)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Consciousness is the shelter of all entities, the only Entity who requires no shelter for maintaing His existence. This town of Patna is sheltered within the state of Bihar.  Bihar is within India.  India is within Asia.  Asia is within this planet.  This planet is within this solar system.  This solar system is within Him.  So nobody shelters Him.  He does not depend on any shelter.  His existence does not depend on the compassion of any second entity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Consciousness is there in you as the oil is in the oilseed.  Crush the seed through spiritual practice (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;) and you attain Him; separate the mind from Consciousness and you will see that the resplendence of the Supreme Consciousness illuminates your whole inner being.  He is there like butter in curd; churn it and He will appear from within.  Churn your mind through spiritual practice and God will appear like butter from curd.  He is like a subterranean river in you.  Remove the sands of mind and you will find the clear, cool waters within.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Consciousness has concealed Himself within your mind. He is hidden behind the curtain of your &ldquo;I-ness&rdquo;.  You need not go to the Himalayan mountains to find out the thing that is concealed in your own &ldquo;I&rdquo;.  Does one need a mirror to see the bangle on one&#146;s hand?  The Supreme, therefore, is within you. There is need only of removing the veil of ego.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->We have to wipe out this ego, this &ldquo;I-hood&rdquo;.  All burdens, all confusion, all considerations of respect or disrespect are connected with this &ldquo;I&rdquo;.  When someone does not agree with you, you file a suit in the court.  Why do you take such trouble? Only to vindicate your ego.  All troubles and frustrations are solely due to the unit ego.  The fact is that even after surrendering everything to God, the arch enemy &ldquo;I&rdquo; remains.  You will say, &ldquo;I have surrendered everything to God.&rdquo;  &ndash; I, I, I!  My friend, surrender this &ldquo;I&rdquo; also to God and then alone your surrender will be complete.  All the trouble is due to this &ldquo;I&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Now, when does a person feel that he or she should love the Supreme?  When one frees oneself from egoistic sentiments.  But one will say, &ldquo;They say God is gracious, but I am an unfortunate fellow.  I am not realizing His grace.&rdquo;  There are many persons who talk like this.  But you know, my sons, you know, my daughters, there is no partiality in Him.  His heavenly shower of Grace is for all.  He is for each and every creature, but one feels His Grace while another does not.  What is the reason: There is a heavenly shower of grace.  But suppose you are holding an umbrella over your head.  Will you be drenched by the shower? Oh, no.  He who wants to enjoy this shower of grace must remove the umbrella of ego from his head, and he will be drenched by the divine shower.  So a spiritual aspirant, a Yogi, must give up all his egoistic sentiments.  And in the next moment he will be in the proximity of the Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->In simple terms, what we have to do is to return home from where we came.  We have all come from the Supreme Entity, the Nucleus of the universe.  We have to return to the same destination.  The child has played throughout the day away in the fields, and now that evening has come, he returns home.  He thinks that his father must have returned home:  &ldquo;Let me return home and sit near him.&rdquo;  When one is tired of this world and worldliness, one yearns to go back to spirituality &ndash; one&#146;s home.  And what is our permanent abode, our home?  The Supreme Consciousness. Spiritual practice (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;), therefore, is the process of returning home.  It is a simple task.  It requires no scholarship, no knowledge, no intellectual faculty, no long and tedious lecturing.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->When a knower of truth merges in the Supreme Being, his petty sense of existence loses itself, and attaining unity with the Supreme Entity, he becomes Supreme himself.  Spiritual practice is the means for expansion of the soul, not for its annihilation; so absorption in the Supreme (samadhi) does not mean suicide but self-transcendence.  One who has known the Supreme Consciousness becomes Supreme himself, for the individual entity takes on the very form of his object of ideation.  One who has the Supreme as his object of ideation, becomes the Supreme himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->If a salt doll goes to fathom the sea, it will certainly melt and become the sea itself.  Similarly, if the knower of the Supreme Consciousness goes to fathom the Supreme, he merges in the sea of Consciousness and becomes Supreme himself.  Be constantly absorbed in the thought of the Supreme Consciousness and you too will become Supreme.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->The union of a spiritual aspirant with the Supreme Consciousness has been expressed with an excellent example.  A river, giving up its name and identity, completely merges in the sea and thereafter cannot maintain its own existence except as the sea. Similarly, a spiritual aspirant, after merging himself in the Supreme Consciousness, can no longer think of himself except as the Supreme.  Seeing the Ganges River, we can tell that is the water of the Ganges.  We can tell the water of the Yamuna River, or the water of the Sarasvati River; but once they merge in the sea, we cannot separate them, nor can we distinguish the one from the other.  Nevertheless they are all there.  They all have lost their respective name-entities in the entity of the sea.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->For each and every human being there are two &ldquo;I&#146;s&rdquo;.  The name of a person, say, is Solomon.  Then the name of his little &ldquo;I&rdquo; is Solomon and the name of his big &ldquo;I&rdquo; is that Supreme Entity.  The name of the little &ldquo;I&rdquo; is Mr. Joseph, but the name of his big &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the Supreme Consciousness.  The big &ldquo;I&rdquo; for all created beings is the same, but the little &ldquo;I&rdquo; varies &ndash; so many bodies having so many names.  The big &ldquo;I&rdquo; is one and indivisible: for the entire universe there is one big &ldquo;I&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->What is Yoga?  It is to become one with that Supreme Entity. When you become one with the Supreme you are getting everything, you are losing nothing.  You are losing only your little name, the name of your little &ldquo;I&rdquo;, and nothing else, and in return you are getting the Supreme &ldquo;I&rdquo;.  This is Yoga in the spiritual sphere.  Some people think that Yoga means a particular exercise. No, no, no. Yoga does not mean exercise; Yoga means unification.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->In order to realize the Supreme Perfection, a human being will have to give up his or her &ldquo;I-ness&rdquo;; that is to say, s/he will have to merge his or her petty &ldquo;I-feeling&rdquo; in the Great &ldquo;I-feeling&rdquo;.  What is this petty &ldquo;I&rdquo;?  It is like a pot full of water in a pond.  Now if the water of the pot is to be unified with that of the pond &ndash; actually, both the waters are intrinsically one &ndash; the pot intervening between the two waters has to be removed.  After the removal of the pot, there will remain no distinction between the water of the pot and water of the pond &ndash; both become one.  The cause of this apparent distinction between God and the unit being is this pot &ndash; the individual mind.  The long and short of the whole thing is that He is infinite.  If you want to realize His characteristic Self, you have to earn limitlessness yourself.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->Spiritual practice is the conversion of the small object into that infinite object.  Now, you think that &ldquo;This small body, this unit consciousness, is mine.&rdquo;  But when you think &ldquo;That vast universal body is mine,&rdquo; then you are the Supreme.  When this individual body and mind is yours, you know all the secrets of this individual physical body and mind.  And when this vast cosmos is your object, you&#146;ll know everything of this cosmos, you&#146;ll know everything of this infinite space.  So your spiritual practice is the practice of conversion &ndash; conversion of small into big.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->This process of conversion makes a person universal.  One&#146;s very existence goes beyond the scope of time, place and person.  At that time, one becomes omnipotent and also omniscient.  One knows everything without going through any book.  When an individual wants to acquire any knowledge, one will have to go through practical experiences, books, etc.  For the individual, there are so many worries and anxieties, so much optimism and pessimism, so many clashes and cohesions; but in the case of the Supreme there is no complex, no optimism, no pessimism; there is no question of clashes or cohesions, because in the case of the Cosmic, everything is internal &ndash; nothing is external.  Everything is within and nothing is without.  The entire universe is in the range of His mind, so there remains no second entity, no second individual.  Thus the question of any clash doesn&#146;t arise.<!-- /block --></p>

One is to convert one&#146;s small objectivity into the infinite objectivity. There is no other alternative.  Simply teaching the gospels of peace won&#146;t give you any peace.  You have to convert yourself from small into big.  Spiritual practice is the practice of increasing one&#146;s own psychic radius.  When it becomes bigger and bigger, the range of mind is bigger.  And when in this way the radius becomes infinite, the aspirant becomes one with the Supreme.  This becoming one with the Supreme, the Supreme Union, is called Salvation or emancipation &ndash; liberation of permanent nature.  Each and every spiritual aspirant should know this and attain liberation.<!-- /block --></p>

So Yoga is the path of progress, the path of development for each and every human being.  In individual life we should practice yoga, and in collective life we should encourage others to practice yoga.

The spiritual practice which liberates the aspirant from dullness or animality and expands one&#146;s self is Tantrik practice (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;). So, there cannot be any spiritual practice without Tantra. Spiritual practice means a practice for expansion, and this expansion is nothing but a liberation from the bondage of all sorts of dullness.

<a name="1..131"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=131 type=paragraph -->In short, whatever was created in the past is the original creation (sambhu&#x301;ti) of God.  The sum total of all creations is the Cosmic Order (Brahma&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a).  This includes the sun as well as the small ant which crawls on the earth.  Whether it is a dead star or a living star, whether it is a nebula or a milky way or a galaxy &ndash; all belong to one universal family.  The Milky Way is vast from one end to the other; an ant is a very small creature, but the role of both of them in maintaining the balance of the universe is equal.  If one ant meets a premature death, it will disturb the balance of the entire cosmos.  Therefore, nothing here is unimportant, not even an ant.  Suppose, an ant is sitting on the edge of a rock and it moves even one inch from east to west, and this disturbs the balance of the rock, it may cause a big earthquake &ndash; because after all, the ant is also His original creation.<!-- /block --></p>

We see their bodies only in the form of fossils.  Every age had its own flora and fauna and it disappeared with them.  Every tree and every creature of every age and stratum is His creation.  None is unimportant.  What is happening in the universe is the gradual death of one created being and the gradual emergence of another. Therefore, whatever will come, it will only be God coming in that form.  No one is insignificant, no one is small, no one is low. Suppose there is a drunkard, a fallen man.  You have no right to hate him.  You talk with him, persuade him &ndash; if necessary scold him for his regression.  All these efforts are alright, but you have no right to hate him.  Hating is not a courageous quality or a creditable tendency.  When every being is His own creation, how can you hate anyone?

The entire universe, consisting of all the realms, is so complex and vast, yet it does not require any more headache to God than a white ant.  Behind every created being there is a flow of energy from God&#8230; So a mammoth cannot move without His Grace, and a blade of grass also cannot move without His approval.  Nobody is unimportant, nobody is insignificant.  Each and every existence is valuable.  So you must not develop the psychology of helplessness or hopelessness, defeatist complex or fear complex, because the Supreme Father is always with you.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..158"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=158 type=paragraph -->Devotion means longing for the Supreme.  Now the question arises, is devotion natural or unnatural for living beings?  All the conscious or crude things we see in the manifested universe bear attraction for one another, and as a consequence, the continuity of the thought-projection of the Cosmic Mind is maintained.  It is on account of the mutual attraction of myriads of heavenly bodies oscillating in the infinite space that balance is maintained in the firmament.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..159"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=159 type=paragraph -->In this attraction, there is effort for self-preservation.  The bee flies around and around flowers in quest of honey, just for the sake of preserving its existence.  It can be seen that every entity runs toward that abode which is more lasting and secure and which can provide it greater and longer safety.  People run after money for the only reason that they believe they can maintain their lives under the shelter of money; that is to say, money alone can save them.  But they do not know that money can provide them neither permanent stability nor a securely-founded shelter.  Even during the span of their lives, money will come and go several times.  At times its glamour will dazzle their eyes, and sometimes it will make them cry, hunger-stricken.  Not to speak of money alone, all finite objects have this characteristic.  What is not infinite cannot permanently remain the object of your enjoyment.  It cannot be your permanent resort, since the existence of all these finite objects is dependent on others, bounded by the limits of time, place and person.  If the terrific speed with which the extroverted person runs after finite objects is introverted towards the Supreme Being of his or her life, s/he can attain the Supreme Consciousness, can achieve the Supreme State.<!-- /block --></p>

But if wise people take every object of the world as the expression of the one and single Cosmic Consciousness, then on seeing the changes in the name and form of any particular object, they will not be affected by pain or pleasure.

If He wishes you to achieve Him, you can get Him here and now.  What He sees is your aspiration for Him.  Remember it &ndash; that at every step of your life He is testing whether you have been able to arouse love for Him in your mind.  He is testing whether you want Him or worldly objects.<!-- /block --></p>

Had there been no intelligence in humans, they would hardly be different from other animals.  This philosophical consciousness will lead humanity to greater intellectuality.  And this constant pursuit of intellectuality leads one to its furthest limit, where intuition begins.  Hence in the realm of intuitional practice it is tremendously helpful.  This path of spiritual practice is not devoid of intellect or intuition, rather it is based on intuition.  It has no scope for superstition or blind faith.  It will facilitate the most all-round progress of humanity and manifest the highest human excellence.<!-- /block --></p>

From his gums comes blood and, thinking that the blood is from the bone, he thinks the bone is more delicious and so he chews even harder &ndash; the more blood, the more he thinks he is getting pleasure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..263"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=263 type=paragraph -->If human beings think some created thing to be their own, it is nothing but ignorance.  Someone thinks &ldquo;my&rdquo; money, &ldquo;my&rdquo; son, &ldquo;my&rdquo; house, etc. &ndash; they think they will become infinite by accumulating all these things.  In actual fact one day everything will go far, far away from them.  There will be nothing left which they can call their own.  To remember this fact, to understand this effect of the force of ignorance correctly, they will have to do spiritual practices, otherwise they will be unable to escape from the grip of this dangerous force of ignorance.<!-- /block --></p>

Whatever one does with the help of the motor organs, the action does not belong to the organs &ndash; without the witnessing Soul, the entire energy of the organs will be nowhere.  If the eyes of a dead man look at an elephant, still he will not see, because the action of seeing has not been witnessed by the Soul.  But human beings, due to their ego, think that they are the doers and get confused.  The spiritual aspirant will have to remember that the light of the Infinite is reflected on his or her mind &ndash; due to this, their organs are able to function.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..265"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=265 type=paragraph -->3) Desire for worldly pleasure:  Due to the influence of the force of ignorance, people think that by eating something they will feel comfort, by wearing something they will feel comfort, by acting in a certain way they will feel comfort.  Through many different objects, they desire and hope for pleasure.  Humans live to achieve Bliss and that is why they run after different objects.  They do not want to understand that, except the infinite Supreme Consciousness, no object can give them endless bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..266"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=266 type=paragraph -->4) Aversion:  This is the opposite of attachment.  Whenever people find an object painful, they try to substitute it with another.  Many fights in the world are due to this cause.<!-- /block --></p>

That day he also went, as he had been accustomed before, to the bar.  With great determination, he passed the pub and then he told his mind, &ldquo;Oh, mind, you are so great!  I will now give you a good prize. I will drink up to the neck!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..270"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=270 type=paragraph -->Struggle and war are not synonymous.  While war springs from hatred, struggle is a part and parcel of life.  War blackens everything; it darkens the future.  Let life be bright both individually and collectively.  Let us fight these divisive tendencies which want to make our life dark.  Light is beautiful because it is luminous.  When there was no creation, there was only one colour &ndash; black.  Lack of life is black.  After creation we see this beautiful play of colours.  Why shall we be lost in darkness?  All human beings want light.  One individual human is more luminous and more throbbing than that universal darkness. So human beings should always be optimistic.  The cimmerian darkness cannot retard your progress, cannot cover the light of the human heart.  The spirit of your heart must move on and on against obstacles.  Kick away your obstacles like pebbles from your feet &ndash; you are stronger than your obstacles.<!-- /block --></p>

To jeopardize the unity of the human race by creating factions is not the purpose of spirituality (dharma).  Those who encourage vested interests survive on the mental weakness of humanity and its dissensions, and that is why they become afraid at the wide spread of the ideals of spirituality and oppose it by all immoral means, such as abuse, wrong propaganda and falsehood.  Humanity must not be cowed down by this; it has to march ahead.

<a name="1..299"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=299 type=paragraph -->Prayer is also a mockery of the Ultimate Being or God.  Prayer is a solemn petition addressed to the Supreme Being for certain benefits.  On rational thinking, does not one&#146;s attempt to rouse the wish of God to fulfil one&#146;s needs appear to be a reminder to God to give one something which God had deprived one of?  This, in fact, casts aspersion on Him and His law and His sense of distribution of His gifts and blessings.  It is an insinuation, asking Him to reverse His law, to stop the process of reaction to one&#146;s action, which must have kept one deprived of what one now wants.  God&#146;s law is unchangeable and praying to Him to change it, is a waste of one&#146;s time.<!-- /block --></p>

It is contemplation of the omnipresent Cosmic Consciousness, and helps the devotee in the attainment of liberation from bondage and merger with the Ultimate Reality.  The purpose of devotion is to condition the mind to think that it is subtle and not crude, that it is a reflection of the Cosmic Consciousness.  Those who have read psychoanalysis and understand the efficacy of auto-suggestion will appreciate the inner motivation and efficacy of contemplation.  The true devotees do not flatter the Supreme Being; they do not ask for any favours.  The devotees&#146; tendency is merely to remind their minds of the ultimate goal so that their whole body, mind and soul strive for emancipation from the degrading influences which surround them.<!-- /block --></p>

Dogma is an idea with a rigid boundary line, which won&#146;t allow you to go beyond the periphery of that boundary line.  Thus dogma goes against the fundamental spirit of the human mind.

<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Today you have to create the Great Universe, and the guiding principle behind it will be that all humans are the progeny of the Supreme Progenitor, God.  Thus all are His children, all should live together &ndash; all will have to live together.  Black or white, literate or illiterate, small or tall, all are the children of the same Father and all will have to live together. There will be unity in the physical realm and also in the psychic realms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->But to strengthen this unity still further, there should be a common goal for all the children of the Supreme Father &ndash; the merger of all in Him.  All have come from Him, and therefore all will remain together.  But this is not sufficient.  All have come from Him, are in Him, and will merge in Him, therefore all people will have to live together.  For you, unity is the natural course, and division is unnatural.  You well know that the Cosmic Energy will not long tolerate what is unnatural.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So it is natural for human beings to live together and to make a Great Universe.  By not doing so, by mutual fight, all will be destroyed.  This is the law of the universe (Prakrti).  Thus you will have to remain united; you must create the Great Universe as soon as possible.  There will be peace and happiness in the universe, and with one indivisible ideology, humanity will march ahead.  Victory be with you!<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In our present environment there are many divisive tendencies splitting humanity into mutually belligerent groups. Spirituality must foster a natural affinity among people, to unite all humanity.  The approach to spirituality should be psychological.  Through rational analysis, humanity should appreciate its relationship with God and recognize the most benevolent kindness of that most beloved Entity.  Spirituality should lead human beings to that one Cosmic Truth from Whom they have derived their souls and who is their ultimate destiny.  That ultimate and absolute ideal is the Cosmic Ideal &ndash; an ideal beyond the scope of time, place and person.  It is the Absolute, without and beyond relativity.  It stands with Its own radiance for all time and for every entity of the cosmos, whether human being or less evolved soul.  The Cosmic Ideal alone can be the unifying force which will strengthen humanity to smash its bondages and abolish the narrow domestic walls of divisive tendencies.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Spirituality provides humanity with that subtle and tremendous power with which no other power can be compared.  Therefore, with spirituality as the base, a rational philosophy should be evolved to deal with the physical, psychological and socio-philosophical problems of the day.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As people become more generous and broad-minded, they rise above the feelings of casteism, tribalism, provincialism and nationalism, which evoke narrowness, violence, hatred and meanness.  Those who enter the field of social welfare with feelings of &ldquo;mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;yours&rdquo; actually create divisions in human society.  Those who wish to foster the welfare of living beings as a whole have to embrace universalism as the only alternative. If we look upon everything as our own, the question of &ldquo;mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;yours&rdquo; will dissolve; in universalism there is no opportunity for violence, hatred or narrowness.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Society is like a company of pedestrians going on a pilgrimage. Suppose one among them is attacked by cholera, do the rest go on their way, leaving him behind?  No, they cannot.  Rather, they break their journey at the place for a day or two, relieve him from the disease and help him to acquire strength in his legs. Or, they start out anew, carrying him on their shoulders.  If anyone runs short of his subsistence, others give him their own. Together, they share everything with all.  Together, they stream ahead, singing their leading chorus.  In their eagerness to go ahead with others, they forget their trifling differences which in their families might have lead to negative exchanges and court cases, even down to three generations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The essence of cooperation born of moving together, aims at widening or expanding the mental being of a person by striking down one&#146;s barriers of meanness again and again.  And hence, I reiterate that society is like such a batch of pilgrims gathering a strange power of mind in travelling together and with its help, solving all the problems of their individual and social life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The entire humanity of this universe constitutes one singular people.  The whole humanity is bound in fraternity: those who are apt to remain oblivious to this very simple truth, those who are prone to distort it, are the deadliest enemies of humanity. Today&#146;s humanity should identify these foes fully well and build a healthy human society totally neglecting all obstacles and difficulties.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->It must be borne in mind that as long as a magnificent, healthy and universalistic human society is not well established, humanity&#146;s entire culture and civilization, its sacrifice, service and spiritual endeavour (sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;) will not be of any worth whatsoever.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Lack of unity among the members of society, because of too much self-interest in the individual members, formation of sects for economic or social advantages, lack of understanding of others, not only brings the downfall of society, but also will wipe it completely from the face of the earth.  Instances of so many sects and empires disappearing altogether are not rare in the history of this world.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Nationalism is fast becoming outdated.  Not only has the national sentiment given humanity rude shocks in the world wars of this century, but the social and cultural blending of the present age also shows the growing domination of cosmopolitanism in world affairs.  Vested interests, however, continue to cause certain divisive tendencies.  Despite these obstacles, a social blending of humanity is in progress and needs a common constitutional structure to cement the solidarity of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->A world government is also essential to exercise effective control in certain spheres.  For example, there should be only one world military force.  The world government should form certain autonomous units (not necessarily national) to deal with problems such as education, food supply, and flood control.  The boundaries of these units may be readjusted to reflect the development of more sophisticated communication techniques.  Such development brings the remote parts of the world nearer and the world therefore grows smaller.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->It will have to be explained to all that there will be clash between different nations as long as national feelings exist.

<a name="2..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The one Cosmic Ideology will have to be preached; that one Supreme Father, the Cosmic Entity, is the goal of all living beings.  This spiritual sentiment will keep humanity united for all time to come.  It will form the entire planetary world and even the universe into a nation. Then there will be only one nation &ndash; a World Nation.  No other theory can save the human race.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->A language must also be evolved as the lingua franca of the world.  At present English is most suitable for the purpose and no national sentiment should be encouraged to oppose it.  But local languages must also be encouraged to help indigenous literatures develop and thereby contribute to world progress and the common family of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Every atom of this universe is the joint property of all living beings.  This has to be adopted as a matter of policy; and after its recognition, the idea that this is national and that is foreign, that a particular person is fit for the citizenship of a particular country while others are not or have no rights at all, cannot stand.  In reality, only vested interests appear intensely interested in such illusory matters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->All people are world citizens by birth.  Every human being has the right to go and settle anywhere and to live like a human being.  If any group of people of any country is not ready to accept this fundamental right of living beings, then it should be understood that their utterances for &ldquo;peace&rdquo; are only meant to cheat and bluff others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Humanity has a right to live not only in this small world, but also on every planet and satellite, meteorite, nebula and every particle of this vast creation.

<a name="2..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The human society is continually striving to arrive at a synthesis through analysis, some sort of unity through diversity. The natural obstructions of small clans, narrow communal interests, geographical distances and intractable customs and usages barriers &ndash; none of these obstacles could hinder the steady and silent movement towards a supreme goal.  That is why the policy of apartheid, the vanity of racial superiority, national chauvinism or regionalism &ndash; these relative doctrines or social philosophies could not thwart the progress of human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The outdated ideals of nationalism are crumbling to pieces today. The newly awakened humanity today is anxious to herald the advent of one Universal Society under a vast blue sky.  The noble and righteous people of all countries, bound by fraternal ties, are eager to assert in one voice with one mind, in the same tune, that human society is one and indivisible.  In this voice of total unity and magnanimity lies the value and message of eternal humanism.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->It is often heard that a particular country was never so united as during the war.  This is due to love of motherland, but more due to all the individuals having a common ideal &ndash; a goal to face the peril of war.  This common ideal is, however, very temporary, and disappears with the danger of war becoming less.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->In our Ananda Marga, the seed for a common ideal is sown from the very beginning of a child&#146;s life.  At the age of five, when the child has acquired only a preliminary understanding of his or her surroundings, s/he is given the ideal of Cosmic Consciousness.  The entire society of Ananda Marga is then founded on a common ideal &ndash; the goal being the Supreme Consciousness.  Such an ideal will not disappear like the common ideal for facing the dangers of war, and the unity in a society founded on an ideal of the Cosmic Consciousness will be everlasting.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->In our Ananda Marga, even in the economic field there is a common ideal, as the whole property of the earth is common property and is to be shared by all members of the society.

<a name="2..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Humanity has only one culture.  I am not prepared to admit that there are various cultures.  The dances, songs, pronunciation and ceremonial celebrations of different sections of humanity may have their local peculiarities, but these cannot be considered cultural differences.  The variations in local customs cannot be removed by legal force or by dictatorial rule.  If an attempt is made to destroy common practices, languages, and various local manners and customs in the name of national or human unity, violence and mutual distrust will result and collective life will be doomed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->I am in favour of social synthesis.  In my opinion, as people come more intimately in contact with one another, and the corners of the world come nearer, local customs will assume newer forms as a result of frequent interchange.  The flowers of different gardens will unite into a bouquet which will be more, not less, beautiful than the individual flowers themselves.  If different countries or communities are anxious to establish social blending through marriages, then social synthesis can be achieved within a very short time.  Its concrete reflections are already apparent to some extent in cosmopolitan cities.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->Members of one particular race considering themselves superior to others, also very frequently inflict injustice on the other portions of society.  The expulsion of the Jews from Germany by the so-called superior races has caused a tremendous amount of disruption in society.  In Ananda Marga the first step that a person takes is to forget one&#146;s race or sect and to no longer identify oneself with one&#146;s race, caste or sect, whether it was superior or inferior.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->In social functions based on racial considerations, racial prejudices figure very prominently.  In our collective functions, members of all races, castes or creeds take part as equals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The caste, race or nation is often the main consideration in arranging marriages.  In our Ma&#x301;rga, there is no such consideration.  These petty differences between human beings are not given any importance.  Humanity as a whole is considered as one family belonging to the race of human race.  In such a society, injustice due either to economic background, sex or racial considerations will be unknown.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->I often say that the caste system is hypocrisy &ndash; unreal.  If you analyse the caste of human beings you will find that the ancestors of every human being were monkeys.  In that case everybody&#146;s caste is monkey caste.  All this hypocrisy is to be given up.  Is it that the ancestor of a Brahman-caste human being was a Brahman-caste monkey and that of a Rajput-caste person a Rajput-caste monkey?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->Human society comprises various races.  There is no reason whatever to recognize one race as superior to another race.  The external differences in constitutions among these human groups cannot alter their basic human traits &ndash; love and affection, pleasure and pain, hunger and thirst.  These basic biological instincts and mental propensities equally predominate in human beings of all complexions in all countries and in all ages.  A mere rustic, illiterate, half-naked tribal mother of an unknown hamlet of Chotanagpur hills in India bears deep maternal affections for her young children; in the same way, a well-educated mother of a locality of New York pours out of her heart a great love for her own children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The subterranean flow of love and affection exists in all hearts alike.  Every person cries out in pain, everyone feels pleasure when there are occasions of joy and happiness.  Maybe in different geographical, cultural, social and other environments, the lifestyle of different human groups may vary; maybe, a few special psychic traits in those groups may assert themselves, but fundamentally, their mental existences flow along the same channels of ideas and consciousness.  Containing the same cosmic momentum and under the same cosmic inspiration, they all have set out for a tryst with the same Destiny.<!-- /block --></p>

Of course, according to one&#146;s virtues or vices one is happy, one is miserable, one is rich, one is poor, one is a fool, and another is learned.  But all are human beings.

Individual ownership has been created by selfish opportunists so that they might take advantage of the defects of this system in order to grow fatter in a parasitic way.

<a name="2..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->The aspiration to become rich by exploiting others is a sort of mental malady.  In fact, if the eternal hunger of the human soul does not find the real path leading to mental and spiritual wealth, it becomes engaged in the work of depriving other of their rights; it robs them of their material resources.  If any member of a family seizes food from a store by application of mental or physical force, he certainly becomes the cause of misery to others.  Similar is the case when a capitalist says, &ldquo;We have seized wealth by intelligence and labour.  If others have mental and physical potentialities they may also do it.  Who objects to it?&rdquo;  They do not want to realize that the volume of commodities is limited whereas requirements are common to all. In most spheres, abundance for one individual takes the bread out of the mouths of others.  It is a mental ailment not to understand this common necessity.<!-- /block --></p>

So after this inner seeing, this inner vision, you will come to the decision that we will remodel the socio-economic structure so that never is he compelled to steal under pressure of circumstances, because of being hungry for several days.  When I started Ananda Marga, I wanted the entire humanity to stand upon the strict code of cardinal principles, human values and spirituality, and when I saw everything internally I came to the decision that there are so many loopholes in the human society. Human beings came here about one million years ago but have not yet been able to form a well-knit social order. We require a strong social order. That&#146;s why I had to create another branch of philosophy known as PROUT, through which we are to remodel the social order so that nobody is compelled to resort to immorality for lack of food or clothes or other necessities of life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..196"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=196 type=paragraph -->The first cause of sin is: shortage of physical and psychic resources.  If there is lack of physical necessities, people are not able to follow the higher pursuits of life.  A person&#146;s discrimination is easily disturbed; with a little anger even an intellectual utters crude words.  Hence, due to a shortage of physical wealth, people become restless, lose their discrimination, and become brutal.  It is because of this that communism has tended toward brutality.  Likewise, if there is a dearth of intellectual resources and the intellectual standard of the people is not high, they may confuse dos and don&#146;ts.  An example is a riot in which an innocent little boy is killed.  The one who encourages the riot becomes the people&#146;s leader.  Because the intellectual standard of the people is low, they commit blunders prompted by these leaders and become beasts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..197"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=197 type=paragraph -->In those countries which are backward or where the socio-politico-economic consciousness is less, immoral, political pigs in the form of leaders misguide the people to collect votes. I say, they are political satans, political pigs.  There, shortage of physical and intellectual wealth causes people to become beasts and commit sins and crimes.  This is common everywhere in the entire world except for a few well-off countries, and even there this is present, but less prominently.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..198"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=198 type=paragraph -->The second cause is non-utilization of over-accumulated physical and psychic resources.  It is a mental disease to accumulate money.  Those who accumulate it do not do so in order to fulfill their needs.  Human needs are few, including food, shelter and clothing.  For instance, if a person has a fruit grove which yields 500 mangoes and there are only five family members, what will be done with so many mangoes?  There is very little chance of utilization in the case of over-accumulation.  If sadvipras are not vigilant, where there is over-accumulation, human beings will tend to misutilize wealth by indulging in baser tendencies. Therefore you will note &ndash; I am making it crystal-clear to you - that the wealthy businessmen and most of the idle kings and aristocrats of ancient times were generally wicked and mean-minded.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..199"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=199 type=paragraph -->The third cause is stagnancy.  This is the greatest burden, the greatest disease of the human society.  This sort of stagnancy is suicidal, for the sign of life is dynamism.  To solve this cause of sin, an intellectual approach does not work.  Dogmatic and traditional people do not listen to reason.  They have to be struck.  And those who do the striking are sadvipras.  The striking has to be done with a hammer.  Sweet gospels will not do.  They must be hit not with a hammer but with a sledge hammer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..200"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=200 type=paragraph -->Suppose sadvipras do not hammer them, what will happen then? Because of the unnecessary presence of stagnant individuals, the speed of others will be retarded.  Stagnant people commit suicide and become the cause of death for others.  Humanity wants to move ahead and these stagnant people block its way and obstruct its movement.  People will not tolerate these obstructions.  The duty of the sadvipras will be to hammer appropriately these stagnant people who are the burden of the society so that the path of human progress may be straight, pure, and well-constructed.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..202"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=202 type=paragraph -->One of the notable causes of the present-day crimes is the scarcity of honest people.  Those who are honest try to follow morality in their private lives, but at times are forced to desert morality under the unwieldy load of poverty.  In the course of time, they may have to go to court under the charge of theft.  Law has nothing to do with poverty which has goaded them to steal.  And if they are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, there is no provision in law for the maintenance of their families.  As a result, the children of such families will have no other way to live than to become pickpockets or have recourse to stealing; and their mothers, unfortunate as they are, will have to find their way leading to the underworld and to maintain their existence, embrace an ignoble and sinful life. After their release from jail, their husbands will be hated and spoken ill of by society and, out of sensitivity to such affronts, they will be forced to resort to stealing as their profession.  In this way hundreds of families are being ruined everyday.  Nobody feels their agonies or comes forward to sympathize with them.

In this mighty task of creation, the brilliantly luminous sun and the insignificant ant hold the same importance of existence, all these having combined to create the world family.

Hence, I suggest that the words &ldquo;penal code&rdquo; should be eliminated from the social life of humanity.  If anybody, whether a judge or a common citizen, takes some sort of requital against someone else, it should be corrective, not penal.  Then the offender, no matter how great his or her guilt, will have no cause for accusing anyone.  Regardless of flaws in the judgement, it will not harm him or her in any way.<!-- /block --></p>

One who possesses wealth commands respect and passes for a noble person.  Nowadays if you have no money you cannot expect to get honour.  The poor people belonging to all other classes have to woo the moneyed people just for the sake of earning a livelihood. Human values are taboo here.  Human beings are now but a medium of earning money.  The rich have purchased all the brains with their money.  They have bidden farewell to all their human values and at the same time they are busy playing a chess game with the lives of the other members of society.  Bereft of everything, the people toil around the clock to live from hand to mouth.  Those who are at the helm of society are absorbed in strife and suspicion, or in reckoning their loss and profit.  They have no desire to think of humanity.  In order to gratify their self-interest they are ready to chew the humans&#146; bones.  There is no room for mercy, sympathy, or fellow-feeling.  All are self-centered.<!-- /block --></p>

If power is given to an incompetent person, it will be equivalent to leading society astray in cold blood.  Sadvipras will install fit persons in power, and the social order which will be evolved by virtue of their leadership will give due importance to each and everybody. In this new society based on Neohumanism, every person will find his or her life worth living.  Human beings will get back their position of honour.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..324"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=324 type=paragraph -->Wise people say that in the past there had been so many crises in the human society.  Crisis is quite natural for something moving. Where there is movement there is struggle &ndash; struggle against the inertia of the earth.  In the past there had been crises in the course of movement, crises in different branches of civilization, crises in the realm of education also.  But nowadays, the entire human society is facing the crisis of civilization as a whole and particularly crisis in the field of existence.  Now, the human society has to decide whether to live or to die.  If the crisis of civilization as a whole and of existence is encouraged, humanity has no future.  The future is dark, the future is sealed forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..325"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=325 type=paragraph -->But as you know, I am not a pessimist.  I am always an optimist. And I want all my sons and daughters to be optimists.  I also want that they should struggle against this death signal of humanity and come out successful.  I am sure that you boys and you girls must be victorious.  It is your duty to save humanity. I hope you will be able to save humanity because just like me, you are also optimistic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..326"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=326 type=paragraph -->You should know that great or small, you people are few in number.  You few are the torch bearers of human society.  You are the pioneers, you are the vanguard of the human society.  So it is your duty to save humanity.  Those who are unable to shoulder their own bags and baggages, their responsibilities are to be shouldered by you.  You should know that the life of spiritual aspirants is a mission &ndash; their entire existence is a mission. And your mission is, what?  To save humanity from these crises. I hope, you will be successful.  I not only hope, I am sure that you will be successful.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..328"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=328 type=paragraph -->Some say that after thousands of years, there will be no humanity.  Beings from other planets may come and see their fossilized existence, to see that there were creatures on this earth named human beings who were educated, who were intelligent, who used to build palaces, buildings, cities, but who have now become extinct due to their internal disunity and infighting.  Do you want history to be written like this?  Then preach the gospels of humanity everywhere &ndash; save the dying humanity.<!-- /block --></p>

The dawn of a glorious new era is on the one side, and the worn-out skeleton of the past on the other.  Humanity has to adopt either one or the other.  You are the spiritual soldiers, you are the worshippers of life divine.  Hence I call upon you to adorn this crimson dawn deluged with glorious light.  Victory is surely yours.<!-- /block --></p>

The entire human society is anxiously waiting for you, for your service.  You will have to shoulder a great responsibility for this suffering humanity.  You know that humanity is bleeding, and you will have to save it.  You should remember that if you do not help humanity, who else will come and shoulder the responsibility?  It is you, you are to do everything.  You are the torch bearers of human civilization. You are the pioneers of the human march, you are the vanguards of the new civilization.<!-- /block --></p>

Powerful human groups are exploiting the weaker ones.  Under such circumstances, it is the duty of good people to declare war on the oppressors.  It will not be of use to sit quiet for an indefinite period in the hope that only moral preaching will be fruitful.  Hence, all good people will have to be united.  There should be a pauseless preparation for war against the oppressors.<!-- /block --></p>

In the same way, the eternal glow of the boundless &#233;lan vital of Cosmic Consciousness has been illuminating the life lamp of universal humanism since time immemorial, is illuminating and will do so in future even more intensely.  That is why I say, the future of the human race is not dark, rather it is strikingly resplendent.  So proceed on, ignoring the frown of darkness.<!-- /block --></p>

This is in no way indicative of the glory of human intellect and erudition.

When the ends are just and noble, success is inevitable.<!-- /block --></p>
