<div class=book_chapter_title>Ideology, Goal and Devotion</div>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The word ideology is termed as &ldquo;A&#x301;darsha&rdquo; in Sam&#x301;skrta. It means to follow an idea in the things that one has to do in his life. It has an impersonal element. But when one follows a personality, it is called as &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a.&rdquo; Suppose someone has an ideology to serve humanity, this service is an impersonal element. Social Service is not the name of man. Social service is not a thing with whom you can love or express your heart&#146;s sorrows and pleasures. You cannot make it the best of ideals, the ultimate ideal of your life. Therefore, social service is an impersonal entity and it is an ideology. I should do everything which is for my liberation and also for the welfare of humanity. This is ideology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There is another meaning of the word ideology. It means a mirror. When we look at it, we can observe ourselves. Similarly is our ideology. Every human being should follow his ideology. Human life is an ideological flow. Those people who have no ideology in life are not human beings. One can recognize other men to the extent that he follows his ideology. The life of man devoid of ideology is like an animal life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->To follow the ideology, we need effort and courage. There is no man in this world who is powerless. Whosoever has come on this earth has been graced with some amount of power. We are walking, talking, condemning, gossiping. We are wasting our time. Whatever we do we cannot do if we are powerless. When the time for work comes, some people say they do not have the capacity to perform the work. But when the time is not for doing a worthy action, they demonstrate much power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is not a single entity in this world that is powerless. Truly, as long as we have life, we have power. Whatever power you have, you must utilize it to the maximum. After you have done your best and there is still need for more power, then God will give you more. Only then do you have the right to ask for more power from God if you have already utilized your existing power. And, if there is still need for more, the Lord will give you what you need. The Lord commands us to utilize whatever power we have to the maximum. We can ask for more power if there is the need for it. Be rest assured that if you apply the power to good works, you will get more power according to your needs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->All powers come from God; whether it is physical, mental or spiritual. He is the owner; He is the master. This energy is the power of the Lord. The Lord grants these powers to those who are engaged in working for the welfare of others and are performing benevolent deeds. You will not have to ask for powers. You should leave this to the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The second important thing is courage. One should remember that courage comes according to power; in other words courage and power come together. A man who is powerless is also a coward. To establish yourself in the ideology you need two things. One is courage. So if you want to become powerful, you need not only ideology but also &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a.&rdquo; Even for courage and efforts, you need the help of the Lord. You cannot say that it is not necessary to make more efforts because God will give according to one&#146;s needs. This is correct, but we have to follow our ideology with effort and courage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->We should always respect our ideology if we are to become true human beings. The ideologist is a man who always acts according to his ideology. If by following the ideology, the older people become unhappy or condemn me, I will not care. If by following an ideology I die and die again, let it be. I will not care. I will stick to my ideology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Is&#x301;t&#x301;a. There are many meanings of this word &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a.&rdquo; One is the fulfilment of the goal. In other words, by ideating on Him, all sorrows of the mind and bad thoughts go away. That is called &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a.&rdquo; Ideology is an impersonal element. To go toward &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a,&rdquo; we need only love; whereas to follow an ideology we need courage and efforts. If we have love for our Lord, then we do not need anything else. We cannot get devotion by going to pilgrimages. The minimum requirement for getting devotion is the human mind. By simply exerting little efforts, you get development. If you desire devotion, you will get it. If you have love for the Supreme, you will get established in your &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->What is the relationship between &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo; and ideology? Without &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a,&rdquo; one cannot establish himself in ideology. To illustrate, we can quote this example: About thirty-five years ago, a war was going on between two countries, the citizens of which have the same religion (Buddhist). When the soldiers went to war, their mothers used to pray to Lord Buddha to save the lives of their respective sons. What will Lord Buddha do? Save this man or that man? Both have the same &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a,&rdquo; but both parties have totally forgotten their ideology. If they were established in the ideology, they would not have gone to war. So therefore, man should follow both the ideology and &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo;. One should be an ideologist and an &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;anist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo; tells us about our ideology. Man remembers his ideology from the &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo;. Man will remember his &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo; and follow his ideology. If somebody says that he has no &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo;, then he is a liar. He has no courage. Without establishing oneself in his &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo;, man cannot become an ideologist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Those who have no truth in their lives can never progress, can never become real men. Suppose somebody has no ideology in his life and for a moment forgets his &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo;, he will degrade. So the wise man will always remember that he has to follow the ideology and more important, the &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those who follow their &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo; know that for every quantity of love they have for the Lord, the Lord has double love for them. The Lord is great for them; as for the Lord, they are also not small. In a song, a devotee said: &ldquo;I am very small, O Lord, you are great&rdquo;. This should not be said. If a father possesses fifty Masters of Arts degree and his son doesn&#146;t know A-B-C at the age of 3-4, should the son be thought of as small and the father as great? No, this is only a family relationship. There is no question of small or great. There is the relationship of father and son only. Where there is the relationship between father and son, where is the question of big and small?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The Lord is the beloved one. The Lord is called Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. The word Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; comes from Sanskrit &ldquo;Bapra&rdquo;. It means Loved-Beloved. &ldquo;Bapra&rdquo; then became &ldquo;Bappa&rdquo;, and then it became Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. It took three thousand or four thousand years for &ldquo;Bapra&rdquo; to become Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. For unit beings, the Lord is the beloved One. (Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; Nam Kevalam). But for the lord the unit being is His Baba! When living beings will sing Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; Nam Kevalam then the Lord will also sing, Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; Nam Kevalam in His mind. The Lord has thousands and thousands of Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;. This is the relationship between the Lord and living beings. Devotees will always remember this but people who are only ideologists cannot feel this; their hearts are barren. For those whose hears are established in &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo;, their hearts are fertile and full of life. Those who are only ideologists cannot enjoy this sweet element. You have to become an ideologist; more importantly you have also to become an &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;anist.&rdquo; If you do not have &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo;, you cannot do anything. When you are singing Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; Nam Kevalam, the Lord is singing Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; Nam Kevalam. As the unit being is dependent on the Lord, so is the Lord on the unit beings. As in the family, the son is dependent on the father, the father is dependent also on the son. If there is no father, the son will not like it. Similarly, if there is no son, the father will not like it too. Without being a devotee, you cannot become an ideologist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Those who are established in their &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo; because of their love will reach the Lord. They will also know the secret cause of this universe. What they have to do, what they don&#146;t have to do, they will know all these things because they have surrendered their minds to the Lord. The intellectuals will complain they have not been graced by the Lord. They will complain that they have been doing spiritual practices but they have not reached the Lord. Devotees never complain. Only the intellectuals complain. Intellectuals complain because their hearts are barren. Devotees know that they have been graced by the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->So-called ideologists become philosophers. Their philosophy is barren. In the olden days, the learned people started contemplating why the Lord created this universe. &ldquo;What was the necessity of this universe? If there had been no universe, what harm would there be? We came into this world and we are suffering, we are experiencing pain. If we had not existed, what would be the difference?&rdquo; Many philosophers wrote many scriptures, but they could give no answer. The devotee considered the intellectuals stupid.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Suppose there is a big garden of mangoes and both the intellectuals and devotees arrive there at the same time. The devotees climb up the trees and begin eating mangoes to their heart&#146;s content. But the intellectuals only watch from a distance and start analysing how many branches the tree has, how many sub-branches, and so on. They engage themselves in counting and later they find there are no mangoes left; all have been eaten by the devotees!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The learned people cannot answer why the Lord created the universe. Devotees, however, have a plain reply. This is because devotees know their &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo; and love their &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a.&rdquo; If you love someone, you can know his secrets. The intellectuals think of the Lord from very far, while the devotees feel Him very near.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->If the Lord has any pain or pleasure, the devotee knows it. The devotee will say, &ldquo;O intellectual, you cannot know this thing which I know. When there was no universe, our Lord was all alone. If any person had been in His place, he would have become mad. So our Lord was all alone and He did not like this solitude. He had the power to see, but He could not see because there was nothing to see. He had the power to hear, but there was nothing to hear. He had the power to reprimand, but there was no one to reprimand. That caused Him a great deal of inconvenience. To free Himself from inconvenience our Lord became many from One. This is the cause of creation.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Surrender all to &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a.&rdquo; All living beings have different ideas in their mind and this will go on. The Lord is the nucleus and all units are moving around. Some are moving in ignorance. This cycle will go on as long as the units have not reached the Lord. If unit beings do not turn toward the nucleus, they will move on and on. A unit will only reach the nucleus when he turns toward the Lord. Finally after reaching the nucleus, he will feel the grace of the Lord. If there is no grace on him, then why is it that he is living in this world? This is the direct proof of the Lord&#146;s grace on him that he is living.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The Lord&#146;s grace is on every human being. Some, however, are not drenched with His grace because they have the umbrella of ego around their heads. They will not be drenched with this grace unless they remove this shield of ego. Only after they have removed this ego will they be blessed by the Lord.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->What must be done by the spiritual aspirant? The aspirant has to remove this umbrella of ego. If you remove the ego, you will become a devotee and surely you will reach the Lord. There is nothing more to be done. We have to do mental worship and not extroversial worship. You surrender your mind to the Lord and the Lord will be satisfied. Those who are ready to centre their minds on Him will be established in their &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a&rdquo;; they will be victorious. No power can stop them from this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The Lord is the owner of everything. He has created all the wealth in the universe. The devotees say, &ldquo;What can I give You? You are the Master of the Creative Energy (Prakrti). Whatever You wish, Prakrti will provide You. What, then can I give You? I am not a great devotee. Your great devotees have snatched Your mind, so I surrender my mind to You.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->A devotees desire and work is to become an ideologist and to follow his &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a.&rdquo; Devotees have been victorious in the past and they will be victorious in the future. Those who become ideologists will progress physically, mentally and spiritually if they will also become &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;anist.&rdquo; If they do not follow &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;a,&rdquo; they will also degrade. You must become ideologist and &ldquo;Is&#x301;t&#x301;anist.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Devotees never complain because they know that the Lord is with them always protecting them. You should remember that if you always sing &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; Nam Kevalam,&rdquo; you have a family relationship with Him. More than that, you have a relationship of Love with Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Where there is existence, there is speed, movement.  And this dynamism is always relative.  This movement is begotten by actions (karmatattva).  What is action?  Where the speed of the object together with its movement with the relativities is towards a desideratum (Laksyabhimukii), it is Karma.  The factor (Tattva) which enables an action to be accomplished is termed as Prakrta Shakti.  The action cannot be accomplished where these three factors such as space, time and person are not there i.e. before performing action these three factors (Tridanda) are indispensable for Prakrta Shakti.  Whatever is performed in the expressed world, is effected by Prakrta Shakti. This Prakrta Shakti gets its inspiration from the Sentient Principle, the action is accomplished by the Mutative and the existence of an action is by the Static i.e. action is the collective result of these three factors.  Where Prakrta Shakti performs actions without results, there she is known as Avyakta.  Where the action is expressed, where Prakrta Shakti is expressed (Vyakta), there Consciousness (Purus&#x301;a Bhava) is operated (Karmanvit) by it.  But where Consciousness is not operated by Prakrta Shakti i.e. Prakrta Shakti does actions but the result is not begotten, there Purus&#x301;a Bhava is known as Citi Shakti.  This is known as Citi Shakti only because Karma Shakti is vibrated (Pratisamvedit) by it.  Hence Purus&#x301;a Bhava is also known as a Principle which is Citi Shakti.  It is because in His absense Karma Shakti can&#146;t get expression.  This Karma Shakti or Prakrta Shakti is a principle within the Citi Shakti.  Where Citi Shakti is vibrator (Pratisamvedii), there alone action is expressed.  And where Citi Shakti assimilates (Grasa) Prakrta Shakti, there Prakrta Shakti is Avyakta (unexpressed).  Therefore the vibration (Pratisamvedan) is only due to Citi Shakti.  So the Citi Shakti is the Supreme Vibrator (Parama Pratisamvedii).  This is the law of the vibration &ndash; the vibrator vibrates the object but without vibrating when it engulfs (Grasa), there it is known as unexpressed.  Hence in the practical world we cannot get anything unexpressed because whatever vibrator is there is engaged in the work of vibrations.  Hence the supreme vibrator is only that unexpressed Consciousness (Avyakta Purus&#x301;a Satta).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When the speed of human intellect becomes pointed, there people search one in many.  Whatever they find behind that they search its vibrator.  Getting the same they try to find out the vibrator of the previous vibrator.  Like this when they attain Citi Shakti or Parama Purus&#x301;a, they find that Citi Shakti has not its vibrator as that is beyond time, space and person.  Therefore Citi Shakti and Parama Purus&#x301;a are known as Supreme Vibrator (Parama Pratisamvedii).  When we see the expressed world, there we see not the synthetic process but the analytic process.  In analysis what we find is the vibrator of one object, and so another one is the vibrator of the first vibrator, and so on and so forth.  From Sambhu this expressed universe comes to Bhaerava and then to Bhava. These all are vibrators and Prakrti is vibrated.  What is the idea (Bhava) in this vibration?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->About Prakrti it is told that she is Nitya Nivrtta &ndash; &ldquo;Prakrti sa nityanivrtta&rdquo;.  When Prakrti tries to be vibrated but instead she is engulfed, there she is Nitya Nivrtta, there she is waning, she is merging into Purus&#x301;a Bhava (Consciousness).   Though she is merging into Purus&#x301;a Bhava yet she is not being annihilated, for her being infinite.  The cruder the vibrator we get, the cruder the Prakrti tries to make it.  Actually Prakrti tries to make that her own but this makes the object still cruder.  So gradually it becomes crude from the subtle.  Behind this a principle works &ndash; &ldquo;Abhoga Samsargat Praptiresana&rdquo;.  You must remember it.  When near an object of enjoyment (Abhoga) another object reaches, a desire is begotten to get that object.  For instance a man when in town has dress, living as per the dress and living of the urban people and when in a village he has as per the villagers.  This is effected because of his desire begotten out of his association with people in town and villages respectively.  When some persons take tea, there you also get the desire to take the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Pratisain&#x32D;cara process there is a movement from crude to subtle and behind that there is only one vrtti (tendency).  &ldquo;Abhoga Samsargat Praptiresana&rdquo;.  With the association of the enjoyable object there is a desire to get it.  In this cosmic cycle (Brahma Cakra) everyone has his individual pabulum (Abhoga).  And after that they are running.  Those who have got several pabula, run after all of them and get exhausted and in the long run they get none.  Those who have got only one pabulum get the same very easily. Therefore it is told.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Ananyamamata visnormamata brahamasamgata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Instead of running after several objects, run after Visnu and get Him because there is only one pabulum here.  When more than one pabulum is there, the mind gets divided and none will be achieved.  This goes on.  When first of all from Sain&#x32D;cara comes Pratisain&#x32D;cara, when Citta comes into being, or Citta and Ahamtattva come or Citta, Aham and Mahat Tattva come, men run after their respective pabula.  This they do either because of inborn instinct or imposed Samskara or any other reason.  And according to Prakrta Liila several pabula are kept before man. He runs after them and forgets Parama Purus&#x301;a and gets away from Him and thus the Liila of Parama Purus&#x301;a goes on.  And when the movement towards the pabulum is stopped, men start moving towards the Nucleus of these pabula.  Running after the pabulum is known as Esana.  Because of this Esana the promptness for action (Karmatatparata) is begotten.  Hence in no case man should be freed from Esana.  Without Esana there will be disturbance.  One has only to see the type of Esana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The subject matter is &ldquo;Astitva and Shivatva&rdquo;.  Esana, aforesaid, has deep relationship with Astitva.  Where there is no Esana, there is annihilation of existence.  Hence the existence of Esana is essential.  It is said above that when a man runs after varieties, he gets none.  Sometimes a man thinks to be a Minister, sometimes a Secretary, sometimes a poet.  There are thousand and one desires.  Because of this Esana is not made fully.  A man gets exhausted after running after the material objects and ultimately there is no Karmasiddhi (success in action).  When Esana is indispensable for existence of life, a man has to see what kind of Esana should be made.  Behind this Esana is Karmatatparata.  These two go side by side.  Then what is Karma?  &ldquo;Karma Brahmeti Karma bahukurviita&rdquo;.  Karma is Brahma, therefore, do as much Karma as possible.  The real Karma is to move towards Brahma and that Karma is nothing but another name of Brahma.  It is His metamorphosis.  Hence taking Karma to be Brahma, go on performing actions.  The action which you will do in that stage, behind that will be the right Esana.  And that Esana will only be one and not many.  Now the spatial transformation of the object is Karma and together with Karma only that Esana is there i.e. to attain Brahma.  In such a case there will be much more acceleration in the process of Prati Sain&#x32D;cara.  As is said above, when the Esana is only one, the work will be done.  When there are so many, the work will not be done at all.  If one desires to take milk and smoke at once, it can&#146;t be possible.  A man has to do either of these two.  Hence the object of Esana is Parama Purus&#x301;a and nothing else.  &ldquo;Ananyamamata visnormamata brahmasamgata&rdquo;.  The Esana for other objects has to be channelized towards Parama Purus&#x301;a.  This will be the right Esana.  And &ldquo;Ananyamamata visnormamata brahmasamgata&rdquo; &ndash; that is love, that is Mukti.  Hence, the correct Esana for men is Bhakti (Devotion).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If a man wants to become a devotee of the lord but in the mind of his mind, if he thinks that God will make him pass his examination &ndash; here the Esana is not one but two.  Here the work will not be done, &ldquo;I want Paramatman and from Him I want nothing&rdquo;.  When something is demanded from God the Esana becomes two.  Hence the time is completely wasted.  Where this Esana is towards Paramatman there it is known as Devotion.  Where there is Bhakti there will be the success in action and there will be victory for devotees.  This world is for devotees and for nobody else.  When the Esana is not for Paramatman but for something else, it is known as Asakti (Attachment) and not Bhakti.  As for example, the Esana for wine.  This Esana will be termed as Panasakti, the attachment for wine i.e. attachment is always in bad sense and devotion is always supreme.  Therefore the correct Esana is devotion.  It does not mean that the devotee will do only Bhajan and Kiirtan.  They are not seasoned devotees!  It is because that Sadhaka who moves on speedily on the Pratisain&#x32D;cara path towards Parama Purus&#x301;a will never blind to the sufferings of numberless persons around him because of the lack of solid social system, solid economic system and the lack of humanity.  If he is blind to the ill-management in the social system, he has not been able to understand Parama Purus&#x301;a fully.  If he does so, his will be subjective approach but not the objective adjustment i.e. when a devotee will move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a his approach will be &ldquo;Atma moksartham jagat hitaya ca&rdquo;.  He goes on moving towards Parama Purus&#x301;a while serving the humanity.  When the humanity is neglected, the &ldquo;Atma Moksartham&rdquo; is also destroyed.  Hence he must be ready to serve the humanity. Therefore the Sadhakas who don&#146;t render social service don&#146;t have real devotion.  In their devotion lies selfishness (Khudaparasti).  The devotees who are selfish (Khudaparasti) don&#146;t attain God (Khuda).  Hence the correct Esana is devotion.  Those who are devotees are workers (Karmii).  They will never be afraid of the work.  They will do maximum work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now when you go to perform an action, you will have to learn the skill of performing it.  Hence the need for knowledge is there.  Hence those who are real devotees will not neglect Karma and whatever knowledge is necessary in performing real action will be also acquired by them.  Knowledge and Karma cannot reach a devotee to Paramatma &ndash; devotion can.  But for serving the humanity, knowledge and action are essential.  Devotees must have to learn it.  As long as men perform subjective approach and for the objective adjustment acquire knowledge for doing correct action, till then they have their existence (Astitva) and movement towards Shivatva.  How does this Astitva become meaningful (Sarthaka)?  The more he nears Paramatma, the more meaningful his life becomes.  The existence of a crude minded man is not valuable.  The existence of germs and insects is not valuable though they too have the feeling of their existence.  Everybody&#146;s existence hasn&#146;t the same value.  On the death of a certain man everyone weeps but on the death of another man people feel themselves relieved.  By action, knowledge and devotion the existence is made valuable.  This alone is true practicality.  The more existence of man merges in Parama Purus&#x301;a, the more valuable he becomes.  The person who does not have objective adjustment and fails to take Jiiva to be Shiva will never reach Parama Purus&#x301;a.  He can never be great.  Some Shastras name such persons as Prakrtiliina and some Videhaliina.  What is Prakrtiliina?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Persons who are self-centered (Khuda parasta), don&#146;t have Paramatman as their goal, but something else.  Outwardly they say that Paramatman should be obtained but in their inner mind they have the desire for something else.  Such people who outwardly say that Paramatman should be obtained but in the inner mind they desire for fame, riches, have the crude object as their goal.  Whatever the inner mind says is the goal of the Jiiva (microcosm).  Whatever is the feeling in the external mind is not the goal.  But in the inner mind, because of his goal being the crude object his ultimate achievement is known as Prakrtiliina.  Prakrti means the phenomenal world.  Their existence will be transformed into the phenomenal world i.e. the conscious man gets transformed into crude object.  There is one more word for the Samadhi in the Prakrta Shakti and that is Jada Samadhi.  Jada Samadhi is very much below human existence and to be free from that is also very difficult.  After crores of years there will be human life.  Just see how dangerous it is!  So with Parama Purus&#x301;a, don&#146;t have two personalities, inside something and outside something else.  Become the same as you are within.  Entire mental structure, entire ectoplasmic stuff will be converted into the quinquelemental world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There are also some people who have correct Esana but don&#146;t have correct direction.  They know that Parama Purus&#x301;a is the goal but they don&#146;t have the real direction.  It is said that spiritual practice should not be performed studying from books.  For it, Preceptor is essential.  Reading the book or hearing from other if a man starts doing Sadhana, that too is dangerous because in that case a clear conception about the goal is not formed.  Hence one does not know where one is going.  The boat is sailing but the sailor does not know where the boat will go to.  The sailor will get exhausted ultimately and will have some accident in the long run.  In that case when such persons die, the state after death is known as Videhaliina.  Their existence is not finished herein, but their feelings remain in the ideational world as an abstract.  This too is as dangerous as Jada Samadhi. The difference between Jada Samadhi and Videhaliina is that in the former there is a folly because of a hidden desire but in the latter there is no folly but the correct direction could not be had.  Hence everybody should know that without direction nothing should be done.  Everything should be done with proper direction, proper guidance.  As for instance, people utter loudly the word revolution, revolution, but revolution does not mean putting buses and trains on fire or removing the railway lines.  This causes damage to government and government is people&#146;s.  Therefore it is a damage to the people themselves.  All these are destructive approaches.  The persons who do such destructive approaches lack in knowledge.  Just like that, in Sadhana if some hodge-podge is made, it means the lack of knowledge.  Because of this, both the individual and the society are harmed.  So this is Videhaliina.  Hence Videhaliina is sure to be there if there is no love for Paramatman.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->And where there is love for Paramatman, there is action and knowledge also, service to humanity is also there, Sadhana is also being performed, in that sense if there is duality (Dvaeta Bhava) between Parama Purus&#x301;a and the devotee &ndash; in such a case if there is excess of Iishvara Bhava (Cosmic Ideation), Sadhaka enjoys Bliss and temporarily he becomes free from miseries.  That state of Bliss is Bhava Samadhi.  The persons who attain Bhava Samadhi are devotees but the duality exists.  Everybody is born out of Parama Purus&#x301;a, so how can there be two &ndash; the devotee and the Parama Purus&#x301;a?  Hence in Bhava Samadhi much higher stage is not attained.  As long as there is Bhava Samadhi there is Bliss, but after this the aspirant is an ordinary human being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Some devotees, who go still ahead and feel the oneness with Him, but instead of loving Paramatman Himself, think more of His Gunas (qualities).  In such a case they attain Gunatmaka Samadhi.  In that case the devotees also attain so many qualities, but permanent unification with Paramatman is not attained.  What happens in Gunatmaka Samadhi is that the devotee has much more the feeling of the qualities.  Secondly, the man having Gunatmaka Samadhi has the standard from where he thinks that his coming in this universe should be justified.  He wants to justify his body, mind, Atman, and the whole life.  These are the sentient feelings indeed &ndash; but they are also not seasoned devotees!  The feeling should be that the body and mind which have been given by Parama Purus&#x301;a will be utilized in the service of the society for pleasing Parama Purus&#x301;a.  Devotees are known as Gopa.  Persons who please Parama Purus&#x301;a are Gopa &ndash; &ldquo;Gopayate Yah Sah Gopah&rdquo;.  Their very nature is to please Parama Purus&#x301;a.  Gopa does not mean the persons who rear cattle.  Devotee of the first order will not want Gunatmaka Samadhi.  They will want to utilize their body, mind and their qualities for the service of humanity.  It is because everything belongs to Paramatman.  He has expressed Himself into every object of the universe up to the blade of grass.  A devotee will serve the humanity because Paramatman will be satisfied.  Those persons who utilize themselves fully for pleasing Paramatman are A-class devotees.  They alone are devotees and the others are not.  Where the only aim is to please Paramatman there the devotee completely forgets himself because Khudaparasti is pleasing oneself.  Up to Gunatmaka Samadhi even this sense of self-centeredness exists.  But where there is no personal desire but the only aim is to please Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Khudaparasti does not exist at all.  And in the absence of Khudaparasti only Khudaparasti remains.  The final merger (Pranasha) of the existence (Astitva) is there.  With the extinction of Astitva, there is the establishment of Shivatva.  Everything is done for the happiness of Shiva.  This establishment of Shivatva is known as Shiva Samadhi.  The Supreme Goal of human life is Samadhi.  People are established in Shiva Samadhi by being guided by &ldquo;Atma moksartham jagat hitaya ca&rdquo;.  There is no other way out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It can be questioned how an illiterate, weakling man will do action and acquire knowledge.  There is only one answer to this.  If one is a devotee then Paramatman will teach him the technique of rendering services.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhakti Bhagavatoseva&rdquo; &ndash; Devotion is for pleasing the Lord and not for pleasing any worldly object.  &ldquo;Bhakti Premasvarupinii&rdquo; - Bhakti is love personified.  The man who does not have compassion, the man who does not shed tears at the miseries of others, is not a man but a stone.  He cannot do any great work.  Be happy with the happiness of others and troubled with the trouble of others.  This alone is natural.  Don&#146;t be unnatural.  The effort to make everybody one&#146;s own culminates in love for the Lord, i.e., devotion is love-for-God personified.  &ldquo;Bhakti Anandarupashca&rdquo; &ndash; devotion is the ecstasy of Bliss, the ocean of Bliss.  And &ldquo;Bhakti Bhaktasya jiivanam&rdquo; &ndash; devotion alone is the life for the devotee.  The greatest enmity against devotees is to take away their devotion.  Don&#146;t ever try to snatch devotion from devotees since devotion is their life.  Paramatman himself will teach knowledge and the technique of doing the work.  It is not the devotees&#146; headache.  Surrender everything to the Lord.  Because man has not been able to solve his problems by his efforts, nor will he be able to, hence a devotee has not to be disturbed.  And if one requires  something from God, one has to require only Parabhakti (Absolute Devotion).  When devotion is attained, God is attained.  If God is attained, everything is attained.  What remains unattained!  Therefore from ancient time learned people have been accepting that the wisest man in the world is the devotee.  Devotee is not bereft of intellect.  On the contrary he is the wisest  If you want to remain in the world remain like a devotee.  As long as devotion is not there one&#146;s heart is like a desert and when the devotion is attained, an oasis in the desert advents.  You have not to be afraid of anything when devotion is with you.  Nothing is to be afraid of when Parama Purus&#x301;a is with you.  When devotion is there, Parama Purus&#x301;a is there.  And when He is there fear none.  In no case you have to be disturbed.  You must remember that devotion is a unique creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a.  And for getting this, learning, intellect, money etc. are not all needed.  Ask and you get the cheapest but the most invaluable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Hence, be a devotee and establish the ideology. If devotion is with you, whatever you want, in whatever way you want, you will establish your ideology.  Those who are devotionless, will go on blinking and can never do anything against you, if devotion is with you, victory is with you.<!-- /block --></p>
