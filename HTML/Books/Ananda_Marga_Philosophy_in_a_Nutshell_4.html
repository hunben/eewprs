<div class=book_chapter_title>The Sama&#x301;dhi of Inferential and Non-Inferential Bliss</div>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Everything of this quinquelemental world is born out of macrocosmic conation, so creation and dissolution of all the entities of this universe lie embedded in the Macrocosmic mind. In the flow of the continuous flow of imagination emerged the crude material mind and the living world. Inanimate and animate worlds along the path of sain&#x32D;carah and prati-sain&#x32D;carah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The movement and staticity and supreme culmination of both inanimate and animate objects all depend upon the cosmic will, for the entire creation is within the vast cosmic mind. The Macrocosm, is the supreme controller of the entire flow of creation. Human life and mind emerges in the introversive phase of the cosmic cycle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Although the Cosmic Mind is the supreme controller of this world of emanation the unit mind also has a certain amount of control over the nerve fibres and nerve cells &ndash; the unit body. We cannot call the power of control an absolute power; we may call it &ldquo;dominion status&rdquo;. By virtue of this power, the unit mind directly controls the nerve fibres and nerve cells of the unit body. As the unit mind is controlled by the Cosmic Mind, Parama Purus&#x301;a controls the nerve fibres and nerve cells of the human body indirectly. If He so desires Parama Purus&#x301;a can also control them directly, too. In that case the entire physical structure of a human being will be vibrated by the cosmic vibrations of Parama Purus&#x301;a, causing the function of the unit mind to remain suspended for that period. This state can be called the sama&#x301;dhi of non-inferential bliss. During this sama&#x301;dhi spiritual aspirants sa&#x301;dhakas enjoy divine bliss directly from the Cosmic Mind without the help of inferences or tanma&#x301;tras. Under normal circumstances human beings enjoy blissful feelings in the nerve cells and fibres and later in the mind; but during the sama&#x301;dhi of non-inferential bliss, the blissful vibrations are created directly in the mind because the Macrocosmic mind does not require any fixed medium &ndash; He can use anything as His medium.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is another type of sama&#x301;dhi, sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya sama&#x301;dhi (one of the four stages of savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi), in which spiritual aspirants enjoy blissful vibrations through the inferences. Because of the close proximity to Parama Purus&#x301;a they enjoy tremendous bliss and establish a sweet relation of deep love for Him. They feel oneness with their ideal while everything is in the most blissful state. The relation between the sa&#x301;dhakas and their dhyeya (object of meditation) is one of real love. They also feel the tactual bliss of the object of ideation. This state of sama&#x301;dhi is called the sama&#x301;dhi of inferential bliss, because the sa&#x301;dhaka feels the blissful vibration through the inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The basic difference between these two kinds of sama&#x301;dhi is that in the sama&#x301;dhi of inferential bliss, the sa&#x301;dhaka enjoy bliss through the medium of the tanma&#x301;tras, whereas in the sama&#x301;dhi of non-inferential bliss the sa&#x301;dhakas derive bliss directly from the cosmic mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The true identity of a human being is that he or she is the progeny of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and will always be. If the same person is merely looked upon as an insignificant, weak and frail human being, it would be demeaning. Human beings are entitled to the transcendental world beyond the realm of the senses. Thus, human beings must not remain oblivious of that transcendental world while caught up in the relative world of trials and tribulations. They must advance towards the spiritual goals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->This universe of ours is not absolute truth &ndash; it is only a relative truth. So the wise should try to know the absolute truth. But simultaneously it is also desirable that while striving to realize the Supreme Entity one should maintain an adjustment with this relative world. While doing one&#146;s duties properly with the application of madhuvidya&#x301; one can achieve permanent cessation of afflictions from this relative world. Then all the entities of this world will be as sweet as honey for the spiritual aspirant. One should follow the dictum, &ldquo;Hearts to God and hands to work&rdquo;. Sa&#x301;dhakas should proceed to the supreme goal with slow but steady steps with bliss within. They must do their duties in the physical world without attachment.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram it has been said: &ldquo;Shiva Shaktya&#x301;tmakam Brahma&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Brahma is the composite of Shiva and Shakti&rdquo;. The mutual relationship is inseparable. To attempt to separate one from the other would jeopardize their existence. They are as intimately associated as milk and its whiteness, water and its fluidity and fire and its burning capacity. Some people believe that Prakrti and Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; are synonymous. Theoretically they are virtually the same, but in the practical sphere there is some difference between them. When the three principles of prakrti &ndash; sentient, mutative and static &ndash; are in perfect equilibrium and equipoise, Prakrti is said to be lying dormant in her primordial state there is no manifestation of creation. To described this state the term Prakrti is used. But when the three principles lose their equilibrium and equipoise, the attributive expression manifests. In this state, when prakrti is committed to start the creation, (of course within the limited sphere of the infinite body of Purus&#x301;a, the Supreme Cognitive Principle). She is called Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, (the Supreme Creative Principle). The different living beings, the creepers, trees plants and animals, and this entire world of unique diversities that we witness around us, are all created by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. However, it is only with the express will and permission of Parama Purus&#x301;a that the vast creation occurs. In the field of creation, because of the diversity of the roles in the creation, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has various expressions:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph --><b>1) Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: When the Supreme Creative Principle continues Her creative role within and without the creation, the entity which maintains the external flow of dynamicity is called Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Because of the inexorable influence of this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the cosmic mind and the five fundamental factors from ether to sound are created. It&#146;s due to her influence that each and every atom and molecule constantly moves through different stages of metamorphosis and transmutation and is transformed into unit life and unit [[citta, aham&#x301;, mahat, etc.]]. It is due to Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;&#146;s influence that the animate and inanimate objects have all emerged. Without it, all the latent potentialities of the microcosm would have remained unmanifested. This quinquelemental universe was come into being. The created under her influence and its various expressions are the manifestations of the different forms of that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. In the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;na (a mythological text) it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><b>3) An&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: The creative principle which lies within every unit mind is called Anuma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Her influence causes unit beings to remain preoccupied with various colorful thoughts regarding the past, present and future. Some thought are materialized in the external world; others vanish as soon as they appear in the mind. It is also due to her influence that, many people move ahead fighting the formidable obstacles of life, allured by the future. The wealth and property, the name and fame that humans attain are also due to the influence of An&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301; on the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><b>4) Yogama&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: When the Supreme Operative Principle leads living beings towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, she is called Yogama&#x301;ya&#x301;. This universe is undergoing constant transformation in the flow of Sain&#x32D;cara and Pratisain&#x32D;cara. Due to the centrifugal force of the macrocosmic mind the five fundamental factors emerged, and due to centripetal force of the unit mind, life of the unit beings was created. The influence of Yogama&#x301;ya&#x301; is more clearly felt by the human mind. In her attempt to elevate the microcosm to the level of the macrocosm, She constantly attracts the unit mind along the path of attaining oneness with the macrocosmic mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>5) Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: The Supreme Creative Principle which leads unit beings from subtlety towards crudity is called Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. The extroversive phase of creation (Sain&#x32D;cara) is dominated by Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. She exerts her influence on human minds in two ways. In philosophical terms one is called viks&#x301;epii shakti, the other a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. When humans ideate on crude matter, their minds drift away from the macrocosm and their spiritual awareness fades. This is caused by the influence of viks&#x301;epii shakti. If one remains close to an object it does not necessarily mean that one will acquire precise knowledge about it. If an object is covered, for example, one cannot attain real knowledge about it even if it is close by. This is the effect of the a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti of avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. It is called &ldquo;a&#x301;varanii&rdquo; because it covers the original object. In darkness, one cannot properly recognize an object. At best one can form a vague idea about it. Due to the influence of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; one develops a non-integral view of the macrocosmic body. Due to the influence of avidya shakti in the flow of cosmic imagination the viks&#x301;epii and a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti become dominant in the extroversive phase [[of creation and in the introversive phase their influence gradually wanes.]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><b>6) Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: The Supreme Creative Principle that helps unit beings to move from the crude to the subtle is called Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Unit beings make steady progress towards the Supreme with help of the Vidya&#x301; force of Prakrti. At the last stage of the journey, Avidya&#x301; is completely non-existent &ndash; even the force of Vidya&#x301; vanishes. A sadhaka, in order to attain spiritual progress, require the help of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, but at the culminating stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya has no further value. A sa&#x301;dhaka performs sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to tear away the veil of darkness of the variegated world created by Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and to strive to established himself on the path of pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The two forces of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; are sam&#x301;vit shakti and hla&#x301;dinii shakti. The popular meaning of Sam&#x301;vit Shakti is &ldquo;awakeness&rdquo; &ndash; awakening from slumber. With the help of Sam&#x301;vit Shakti, unit beings become aware of their existence. They realize that they are the crown of creation, the most evolved beings whose goal is to attain the supreme rank and dispel the darkness of the a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya. Under Her benign influence one seeks greater proximity to the Supreme Entity, by surmounting the distance created by the influence of the viks&#x301;epii shakti of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya. When this Vidya&#x301;-dominated force firmly establishes itself in the mind of sa&#x301;dhakas and takes them nearer to Parama Purus&#x301;a, by fighting against viks&#x301;epii shakti it is called hla&#x301;dinii shakti. It helps the sa&#x301;dhakas overcome the bondages of pettiness and frailties along the path of synthesis, the path of blissful experiences which leads them towards the Supreme Entity. This force is known as shriira&#x301;dha to the Vais&#x301;n&#x301;avas.<!-- /block --></p>

Between the Macrocosmic and the microcosmic stances there exists the deep, dark world of ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. It is due to this that unit beings are unable to form an exact idea about the quinquelemental world, even though it is lying before their eyes. This darkness forms a clear line of demarcation between the Macrocosmic and microcosmic stances. It is an illusion which brings distrust, disappointment and other frailties to unit minds, and causes unit beings to fumble and falter on their journey. That&#146;s why spiritual aspirants seeking emancipation become eager to attain liberation from the bondages of the all-powerful Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. But will Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; make way for unit beings out of fear? A reply to this earnest query of the devotees has been given by Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a in the Giita&#x301;,<!-- /block --></p>

Dominion status may be granted, but the attainment of complete independence remains a far cry away.

The one who leads a spiritual aspirant from the darkness of ignorance to the effulgence of spiritual realization is the Guru. In this sense Brahma alone can qualify as the Guru of the spiritual aspirant When does one find such a genuine Guru?

Usually there are two types of diiks&#x301;a&#x301; &ndash; vaedikii diiks&#x301;a (initiation according to the Vaedic system) and ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; (initiation according to the Tantric system). Vaedik diiks&#x301;a&#x301; inspires the seeker to adopt true dharma and tread the path of spirituality which leads to the attainment of the Supreme Entity. Many slokas of the Upanishads and other scriptures are utilized in vaediik diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. The imparting of proper spiritual training produces a spiritual awakening in the human mind, causing spiritual aspirants to seek that path which leads to the attainment of their is&#x301;ta or spiritual goal. A competent spiritual teacher then will impart the practical guidance to those aspirants. That spiritual direction is called ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. Tan ja&#x301;d&#x301;ya&#x301;ta ta&#x301;rayeh yastu sah tantrah parikiirthita. The practical process which leads to the freedom from dullness is called Tantra. The process of initiation according to the science of ta&#x301;ntra is called tantrik diiks&#x301;a&#x301; Strictly speaking vaedik diiks&#x301;a&#x301; is not real diiks&#x301;a&#x301;; at the most it may be called a process of purification. Only ta&#x301;ntrik diiks&#x301;a&#x301; deserves to be called diiks&#x301;a&#x301; because it includes the necessary factors required for diiks&#x301;a&#x301; such as diipanii, mantra caetanya, abhis&#x301;eka. If sa&#x301;dhakas learn the proper techniques of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; from a competent master and practice the same regularly and with utmost sincerity and devotion, they will move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a with firm steps. Their entire existence becomes illuminated with the effulgence of Supreme veracity, of divine realization. Such sa&#x301;dhakas no longer remain under the domination of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

They are called plexii in Tantra. Each and every plexus regulates a certain number of propensities. The hormones secreted from these particular glands influence the concerning sub-glands, the other lower glands, and the vrttis controlled by their respective glands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The food and drink we take every day is converted into rasa (fluid), rakta, flesh, fat, bone marrow and lymph etc. Ultimately the lymph is converted into hormones of various types. The special hormone secreted from the spiritual aspirant&#146;s pineal gland flows into the pituitary plexus. At that time if one&#146;s mind remains engaged in pure spiritual thoughts that hormone flows from the pineal gland down the left side to the pituitary gland, and then to other plexii, glands and sub-glands, nerve fibres, nerve cells, veins and arteries, etc. This excessive flow of pineal hormone revitalises all the lower plexii. On the other hand, if one&#146;s mind remain preoccupied with crude thoughts then the pineal hormone gets burnt up at the pituitary plexus. The lower plexii and glands, due to the lack of supply of pineal secretion, do not enjoy any spiritual bliss. But when the pineal hormone flows through the pituitary plexus to the lowest plexii, the undeveloped plexii of the body become healthier and revitalized. As a rule the upper chakras control the lower ones. So the svadhista&#x301;na chakra controls the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra chakra, the manipura chakra controls the svadhista&#x301;na and mu&#x301;ladha&#x301;ra chakras, the ana&#x301;hata controls the man&#x301;ipura, svadhista&#x301;na and muladha&#x301;ra chakras, and the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; controls all the lower cakras.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Of course, to attain supreme spiritual salvation it is not necessary for a sa&#x301;dhaka to experience any sama&#x301;dhi at all. For example, a passengers travelling on a Calcutta-bound train may or will not be able to see the sights of Jamalpur or Bhagalpur towns if the doors and window-shutters are closed. Although the passengers are unaware of the towns they are passing through, they still reach their destinations. In the spiritual world also, the sa&#x301;dhaka, while ideating on the Supreme will certainly pass through the different stages of realization without necessarily being aware of it. When the all-merciful Ta&#x301;raka Brahma physically comes to Earth in the form of a Sadguru He helps the deserving sa&#x301;dhakas to attain this type of sama&#x301;dhi. Even when He is physically absent in this world He helps the deserving persons to attain this sama&#x301;dhi through other gurus.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Adarshana&#x301;da&#x301;patitah punashca&#x301;darshanam&#x301; gatah;<br>Na&#x301;sao tava na tasya tvam&#x301; vrtha&#x301; ka&#x301; paridevana&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Each and every object of creation comes from the world of invisibility and goes back to the world of invisibility. Between the two worlds of invisibility lies the world of visibility. Nothing can be the permanent property of anyone. Everything of this changing world is bound to this disappear, hence one should not lament over anything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This quinquelemental universe is composed of solid, liquid, luminous, aerial and ethereal factors with their respective inferences or tanma&#x301;tras. This universe is a collection of innumerable inferential or tanma&#x301;trika vibrations. This world of visibility has come into being through positive projection. Its tanma&#x301;trika vibrations may be withdrawn in a converse way, resulting in tanma&#x301;trika sama&#x301;dhi. In a negative process they may be withdrawn into the world of invisibility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The vastness of the universe is due to the five fundamental factors. If the liquid factor was withdrawn from this universe, it would be one thousand times smaller than its present size. If the luminous and aerial factors were withdrawn from that universe, it would be a thousand times smaller than a mustard seed. And if the ethereal factor was withdrawn from the remaining portion a small point would remain having a certain position but no magnitude. So, the vast universe is in reality, nothing but a point. The Supreme Entity, in His imaginative flow, has attached the five fundamental factors to this tiny point to create the vast universe. During sadhana, the mind has got to be one-pointed. That point is the silver line between the relative world and the absolute world. Hence, in the course of sadhana, when a sa&#x301;dhaka achieves full control over objects (an object is nothing but a collection of inferential vibrations) he or she is said to have attained &ldquo;tanma&#x301;trika sama&#x301;dhi&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Matter is not an absolute truth; neither is the mind. Matter is no more than a collection of inferential vibrations, and the human mind is puffed up with vanity or ego. Both are created in the flow of Macrocosmic imagination. Just as in the negative process, the quinquelemental world becomes non-existent, similarly, the human mind may also become non-existent. Parama Purus&#x301;a if He so wishes, may snatch away the intellect, the intelligence, in fact everything associated with human existence. Not only that, Parama Purus&#x301;a, the stealer of vanity, if He so desires, may snatch away immediately whatever the human beings consider as their own. Out of His Grace only He has granted all that the human beings require. They should properly take care of these created objects and make the best use of them. It is only when the human beings, become puffed up with vanity and misuse the power granted to them by Parama Purus&#x301;a, that He steals everything from them. Hence, He is called Darpaha&#x301;rii &ndash; the stealer of vanity, and Manachora &ndash; the stealer of mind. Vain people suffer a similar fate when their vanity is destroyed as the balloon faces when its air is let out. But, does Parama Purus&#x301;a snatch away everything from everyone? No, He takes away only then when the unit beings, try to create with the help of God-given obstructions in the flow of His creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Some people deny this world on the ground that it is an illusion. They say it is merely a relative truth, composed of inferential vibrations and not an absolute truth. Ananda Marga philosophy differs from them because, although it accepts that this world is a relative truth, and not an absolute one, yet this world cannot be dismissed as unreal because it provides vitality required from its food, drink and air to attain the absolute.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The unit mind has been created due to the influence Prakrti, and until these bondages of prakrti are removed, the unit beings can not attain the ultimate truth. Therefore sa&#x301;dhakas should withdraw their minds from the relative world and concentrate on a small point &ndash; the smallest diminutive of this vast universe, which itself is merely a minute island in the vast ocean of infinity. This point is the connecting link between the unit mind and the Macrocosmic mind. Through the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the concentrated unit mind becomes one with the Macrocosmic mind. Therefore the mind that has become one with the cosmic mind can easily bring the pictures or images of which is only the reflection of numerous tanmatras, London, Calcutta, or any other city of the remotest corner of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Human beings can surely expand their mental arena by dint of regular intuitional practice. Before one starts practicing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, one&#146;s mind becomes a little crude due to the influence of Prakrti. But it should be remembered that the Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is Herself subservient to Parama Purus&#x301;a. Cosmic ideation increases psychic power, permitting the sadhaka to break the bondage of ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->This world is a Macro-psychic creation. When the human mind becomes one with the Macrocosmic mind, through the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; it will immediately know whatever the macrocosmic mind thinks or does. The secrets of the mundane world will be revealed. So the seed of omniscience lies inherent in the human mind itself, but due to utter ignorance, the human mind has forgotten its inherent nature and capacity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The entire creation is a collection of inferential or tanmatrik vibrations which emanate from the universal mind. Thus it can be said that creation is the positive tanma&#x301;trika sama&#x301;dhi of Brahma. If He withdraws all the tanma&#x301;tras, creation will dissolve into nothingness. All tanmatras emanate from Him and finally merge in Him. Hence the negative tanma&#x301;trika sama&#x301;dhi of Parama Brahma means the dissolution of the creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Since creation, preservation and destruction depend on the sweet will of Parama Purus&#x301;a, nothing in this universe is eternal. The only entity which is eternal is Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. The success in human life lies in working according to the desires of Parama Purus&#x301;a and become one with Him. If human beings act otherwise, Parama Purus&#x301;a may snatch away everything they possess. Human beings are a composite of body, mind, self. If the thinking capacity is taken away from the human structure, it will become static or lifeless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->When the human mind becomes concentrated on mean and crude thoughts instead of subtle and pure ones, it enters a state called prakrtiliina avastha&#x301; a kind of negative tanma&#x301;trik sama&#x301;dhi. Those who die before they attain the prakrtiliina stage remain in the videhaliina stage and according to their inherent sam&#x301;skaras are transformed into gandharva, kinnara, vidya&#x301;dhara. Once their sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras have been requited they regain their human frame.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Hence it is said that human life is full of mysterious life. If it is properly utilized the human beings remain no longer humans they attain oneness with Brahma and those who, even after attaining human frames do not properly utilize are really unfortunate. Hence the human beings should learn the proper techniques of spiritual practice from the competent master even at the early stage of life. Lest they [[are]] forced to say &ldquo;My human life has been barren. If I had cultivated it properly it would have yielded a golden harvest&rdquo;. By consistent and continuous efforts they are bound to reap the golden harvest; one&#146;s life will be successful in all respects.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The word karma is derived from the root verb kri + suffix man. Kri means &ldquo;to do something&rdquo;, and man denotes establishment. (Similarly, dhr + man = dharma) So, karma means an action which is superior to an ordinary action. Both karma and kriya&#x301; mean action in the sense of change of place of an object, yet there is a difference between the two. An action devoid of cosmic ideation is kriya&#x301;. If we are to live in the world we must perform actions in order to maintain our physical existence. Whatever we do with our physical organs without a spiritual purpose is our kriya&#x301; &ndash; sleeping, resting, drinking and eating devoid of cosmic ideation are kriya&#x301; and not karma. Actions performed with cosmic ideation are termed karma. So people performing karma should be aware of questions such as &ldquo;What is my goal? By what means can my goal be attained?&rdquo; Thus all karma is kriya&#x301;, but all kriya&#x301; is not karma. Some human actions are kriya&#x301; while others are karma. The performance of kriya&#x301; leads to bondage, whereas the performance of karma leads to liberation from bondage. Even rituals and ceremonies are kriya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Kriya&#x301; is of two types: Nitya kriya&#x301; and naemittik kriya&#x301;. Those actions which are essential for the preservation of human existence are nitya kriya&#x301;, whereas those which are occasional and done with some other purpose are called naemittik kriya&#x301;. For instance, eating, bathing, resting, spiritual practice are nitya kriya&#x301;, because without food, drink, bathing and rest, etc., physical human existence become endangered, and in the absence of spiritual practice human psychic degeneration is unavoidable. Hence, in the daily lives of human beings, spiritual practice is indispensable. Regular spiritual practice leads to psycho-spiritual parallelism. A sadhaka slowly and steadily advances spiritually and finally becomes ensconced in the supreme spiritual stance. Naemittik kriya&#x301; are actions which are occasional and done with a set purpose, such as employment, study, charity, festivals, observances, etc. Naemittik kriya&#x301; may have a certain value in human life but is not as essential as nitya kriya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Human beings often attach less importance to the spiritual aspect of nitya karma and more importance to the physical aspect. This is detrimental because one should not forget that human life is short. From the moment of birth one slowly and steadily advances towards death with every passing second. This short period of time from birth to death is human life. Human beings have come from the world of invisibility and at the end of this short span of time will return to the world of invisibility. Those people can be called intelligent who utilize every moment of their short life engaged in spiritual practice. Hence regarding karma, the view of Ananda Marga is &ldquo;Karma Brahmeti, karma bahukurviita&rdquo; (&ldquo;Karma is Brahma so do as much karma as you can&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The physical body of every human being is composed of countless cells. These cells are of two kinds: protozoic and metazoic. All parts of the human body are composed of these two types of cells. In another sense, the entire human structure can be regarded as one metazoic cell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Each of these cells has its individual mind, soul, etc., but the minds of the cells are different from the human mind. (And the minds of the metazoic cells are more developed than those of the protozoic cells.) The human mind is the unit microcosm plus the collection of the minds of the protozoic and metazoic cells; therefore the human mind is a collective mind. Just as the Macrocosmic Mind is inseparably associated with each and every entity of this universe through ota yoga and prota yoga, the unit mind is inseparably related to each of its composite entities [individually]; and in a collective way also the minds of the cells have a certain relationship with the unit mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Generally a cell lives about twenty-one days and then dies, being replaced by new cells. When one rubs a certain part of the body, some seeming dirt comes off, even when the body remains covered, but this is not always dirt from the environment. In most cases, it is the accumulation of hundreds of dead cells.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Cells generally grow out of light, air, water and the food we eat. The nature of food and drink has its effect upon the cells, and consequently also influences the human mind. Obviously each and every sa&#x301;dhaka, or spiritual aspirant, should be very cautious in selecting food. Suppose a person takes ta&#x301;masika, or static, food. The result will be that after a certain period, static cells will grow and exercise a static influence on the aspirant&#146;s mind. Human beings must select sa&#x301;ttvika, or sentient, or ra&#x301;jasika, or mutative, food according to time, place and person. This will lead to the birth of sentient cells, which in turn will produce a love for spiritual practice and help in attaining psychic equilibrium and equipoise, leading to immense spiritual elevation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->After about twenty-one days the old cells are shed and new ones grow. But in old age, due to certain defects in the cells, the smoothness and the lustre of the face disappears and the skin becomes wrinkled, and the different parts of the body weaken. (With old persons, the old cells decay and new cells are produced in lesser numbers. And some of the new cells do not get proper nourishment.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In all cases where a patient has been ailing for a long time, experienced physicians advise complete rest for a minimum of twenty-one days to allow the growth of new, healthy cells so that the ailing person will regain physical and mental energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Cells are living beings, and as a result of transformation through lives together, they have found existence in the human body. Later, through gradual evolution, each cell mind will develop into a human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The aura or effulgence radiating from the human body is the collective effulgence of all its composite cells. When in old age many cells in the body become weak, this results in the diminution of the effulgence. Even the body of a young man who is suffering from a disease loses its lustre.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the human face alone there are millions of cells. When a person gets angry a large amount of blood rushes into the face, causing it to become red and causing many cells to die. A violent or cruel person can easily be recognized by his or her face.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As a result of eating sentient food and performing  spiritual practices, the cells of the human body become sentient. Naturally, an effulgence emanates from these cells creating an aura around the physical body of the spiritual aspirant. This is the reason why many pictures of maha&#x301;purus&#x301;as [highly-evolved persons] show them with radiant auras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->If cells are affected by food and water, and if the nature of the cells affects the nature of the human mind, obviously human beings should eat the correct diet, because food and mind are closely related to each other. Any food item, whether good or bad, must not be taken indiscriminately because it may lead to mental degeneration. Sincere spiritual aspirants must follow the dictum: A&#x301;ha&#x301;rashuddhao sattvashudhih [&ldquo;A sentient diet produces a sentient body&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Only food which is helpful in keeping the body and mind sentient should be eaten.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Every object of the world is dominated by one of the three principles &ndash; sentient, mutative, and static. Food is no exception, and according to its intrinsic nature, is divided into the same three categories.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><b>Sentient food</b>: Food which produces sentient cells and is thus conducive to physical and mental well-being is sentient. Examples of sentient food are rice, wheat, barley, all kinds of pulses, fruit, milk and milk products.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><b>Mutative food</b>: Food which is good for the body and may or may not be good for the mind, but certainly not harmful for the mind, is mutative.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><b>Static food</b>: Food which is harmful for the mind and may or may not be good for the body is static. Onion, garlic, wine, stale and rotten food, meat of large animals such as cows and buffaloes, fish, eggs, etc., are static.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Very often people eat food without knowing its intrinsic qualities. For example, the milk of a cow which has just given birth. Or white eggplant, khesa&#x301;rii pulse [horse gram], red puni [Basella rubra Linn.], or mustard leaves, all of which often grew out of rotten matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In order to have a balanced mind and to progress spiritually, human beings will have to pay attention to the qualities of the food they eat. The idea that &ldquo;I will just do my sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and eat any food, proper or improper&rdquo; will not do.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Sine Qua Non of Human Existence<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In this universe there are people whose thoughts, character and behaviour are similar &ndash; similar but not identical. Differences in human character and mentality, which are reflected in external human conduct, are due to varying propensities and tendencies. This is what accounts for the differences between people. Just as individual human beings have their distinctive characteristics, similarly, groups of people brought up in various geographical environments, historical eras, or cultural atmospheres, acquire their own group characteristics, too. Later those characteristics inherent in a particular group get mixed with the internal thoughts and ideas of other groups within a society. This leads to the development of national characteristics. In this way an entire national psychology &ndash; its external behaviour, its social outlook, and its philosophy of life &ndash; is developed. This process produces different national outlooks which distinguish one nation from another. It is also in this way that different human groups have developed different viewpoints towards life and the world. These differences are internal rather than external. Through proper education and well integrated social living in the individual and collective strata, internal qualities can be properly developed. Internal discipline in the psychic sphere of individual life is what we may call the Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma of individual life. When the national characteristics are expressed in a particular vein, we may call it the Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma of the nation. Although Italy, France, England and America are part of the western world, their national characteristics are not uniform. There are considerable differences in the mental thought-processes and external conduct of the East and the West. The thoughts and ideals of India are quite different from the other countries in the East. Since ancient times, India has been adhering to her distinct Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. Regarding life and the world, the Indian people are certainly spiritually inclined. They look upon each and every thought and deed as part of their spiritual practice. The reason is that in ancient India, children studied from the age of five till the age of twenty-five. They lived virtuous, disciplined and holy lives and received extensive training in spiritual knowledge as well as some degree of mundane knowledge. At the conclusion of their student careers, they returned home to adopt the life of householders. As householders they continued to cultivate both spiritual knowledge (para&#x301;) and mundane knowledge (apara&#x301;). When they reached the age of fifty, having met all their family commitments, they would adopt the life of a Vanaprastha and retire to a forest to concentrate on the cultivation of spiritual knowledge. Thus all aspects of Indian life were based on spirituality. This subjective approach to life became the Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma of Indians. Spirituality has penetrated so deeply into Indian social life that even the toughest and most notorious robbers offer something to the goddess Ka&#x301;lii before committing theft. They pray to mother Ka&#x301;lii and make pledges to her to ensure their success. The ancient Indian system of education was based on this original Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. Consequently, the Indian students developed a reverential, humble and noble trait in their conduct. The subtle way to undermine an individual or a nation is to divert them from their original Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma, sometimes by forcibly snatching away their right to pursue it. This will sap them of their inherent strength and capabilities causing them to become increasingly weak. Just as a bird divested of its right to fly freely gradually becomes reduced to the status of a biped, similarly, human beings when deprived of their Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma lose their elevated stance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Moghul Rule and Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->During the Moghul period India was subjected to severe political torture. The Pathan and Moghul rulers tried to inflict a blow to the Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma indirectly. However, by holding out allurements of high posts or by using other methods, they could not do much harm to the Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. The reason was that the inner vitality of Islamic society itself was considerably weakened after assimilating the conflicting thought waves of Egypt, Siberia and Persia. Thus, though the Islamic Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma existed alongside the Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma it could not cause much damage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The British Rule and Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The British rulers were very clever. Instead of attacking the Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma directly, they resorted to the path of diplomacy. They believed that to maintain British rule in India they would have to create a group of native supporters who would remain Indian by birth and complexion but European in manners, customs, education, taste and culture. So they introduced a system of education based on their own British system. This was an obvious attempt to strike a blow at Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. As a result, the people of India forgot their distinctive national characteristics and developed a completely Western outlook. The moral, spiritual and social qualities that were developed through the Indian system of education were ignored. Rather, Indian youth, under the influence of materialistic Western civilization, grew cynical, materialistic and atheistic. A class of educated persons was created who were neither English nor Indians. Many of them were employed in the Indian Civil Service. A certain scholar once remarked that the Indian Civil Service &ldquo;is neither Indian, nor civil, nor service.&rdquo; These people became alienated from the mainstream of Indian social life because their conduct, behaviour, customs, manners, thoughts and ideals were different from those of other Indians. This neo-class of people with modern education could not regard the simple, innocent masses of rural India as their own. The clever English rulers trained them in such a subtle way that they looked upon the British as being nearer to them than the Indians. The imperialistic British purpose was served: colonial rule was firmly established.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The British Rule and Chinese Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The British also tried to destroy the natural Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma of the Chinese people. Prior to Kuomintang rule, Chinese people were simple, peace-loving, energetic and spiritually inclined. But the British imported a huge amount of cheap opium into China and made the energetic and pious people idle and indolent. Thus the Chinese race deviated from their original Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. As a result, it was easy to mislead them onto the path of communism. The British were responsible for the annihilation of the Chinese Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. The communists completely destroyed the ancient Chinese religion and finished the unfinished task of the British.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..9"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Capitalism in Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Although capitalism does not directly oppose Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma, the all-devouring exploitation of capitalism robs the people of their possessions and drives them into the street as beggars. For such people it becomes virtually impossible to properly follow their Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. Even the feudalistic exploitation in Indian social life did not run counter to the original Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. But the present capitalistic (Vaeshyan) exploitation has financially ruined the Indian people. Hence, it is impossible for the people to follow their Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. At this period of crisis in Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma the materialistic philosophies are getting scope to rear their heads.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The socio-economic philosophy of Ananda Marga calls for the elimination of capitalism. It clearly emphasizes the need to fulfil minimum economic needs and create an ideal congenial social environment in which there will be maximum utilization of collective wealth and the rational distribution of resources to solve all economic problems. Every human being will get ample opportunity to follow Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Communism and Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Materialism can never be the base of human life in any country because it is detrimental to the all-round development of human beings. Materialism is the philosophical base of communism. Communists act against human Dharma by propagating the defective philosophy of materialism. Communism is diametrically opposed to Indian Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. Although they raise high-sounding slogans of human emancipation and progress, human well-being cannot be accomplished by communism. The communist states give much importance to the application of material science and technology. This may help increase the wealth of the country and thereby alleviate the financial distress of the people to some extent, but by solving economic problems one does not solve all problems. If that were the case, the affluent countries of the West would be utopian. Human beings are not merely destined to fill their bellies. There is much more to human life than that. Human beings are veritable children of God having a thirst for unlimited happiness. Limited physical wealth can never quench their infinite thirst. Obviously, their Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma should provide them with the necessary ways and means to satisfy their unlimited hunger. Communism ignores the higher human and spiritual values of life. It lets the human soul stand unrecognized. The condition of human beings in today&#146;s communist countries is no better than that of domestic cattle in dairy farms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Ananda Marga wants to establish the Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma of the entire universe, and the Ananda Marga philosophy has been conceived to that end. Ananda Marga&#146;s spiritual treatise, social treatise, ethics, spiritual cult, socio-economic theory and educational system will all help in establishing Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. Whatever a genuine Ananda Margii does in his or her life is always conducive to Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. The Ananda Marga philosophy &ndash; unlike the Vedantic sannyasin who professed the philosophy of illusion &ndash; is not in favour of dismissing this quinquelemental world as mere illusion. On the contrary, Ananda Marga accepts this world as a relative truth and strives to cope with its problems. Both wealth and poverty force people to digress from their original Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. That&#146;s why the socio-economic philosophy of Ananda Marga has advised its supporters to be ever-watchful so that one is forced to die due to want of food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Education and Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Defective systems of education also strike a blow in Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. This is exactly what happened in India during the British regime. Ananda Marga is ever vigilant in this regard. Hence, the Ananda Marga system of education has been formulated in such a way that the fundamental Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma of humanity has been fully recognized. The educational system of our schools is based on the principle of Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. It includes the study of various aspects of modern branches of human knowledge, as well as the development of qualities such as reverence, good manners, humility, dignity of labour, social consciousness, etc. The Western system of education has miserably failed to inculcate these rare qualities in the students minds. Had there been radical reforms in the defective education system introduced in post-independent India, she could have solved many undesirable problems. The reformers of Indian education can make an experiment even today by introducing a new system of education based on national Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->All the countries of the world can apply Ananda Marga philosophy according to their distinctive national Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a Dharma. There is enough scope to introduce Ananda Marga philosophy in this way.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The recognized book on Ananda Marga Philosophy is A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram. Usually a philosophical treatise has four main sections &ndash; (1) ontology, (2) metaphysics, (3) ethics, (4) epistemology. But in Ananda Marga philosophy two more sections, in addition to the above-mentioned four, have been added. They are (1) psychology and (2) spiritual cult. In Western philosophy there is no mention of spiritual cult, because Western philosophers had no opportunity to learn such a cult. The main reason is that in the theology prevalent in the west there is no concrete spiritual cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->According to general belief, psychology is a part of general science, and should therefore not be included as a part of philosophy. Thus psychology has been accepted as a branch of science in the West. But in Ananda Marga, psychology has been included as a part of philosophy. Moreover, according to A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga the scope of psychology is wider than what is usually accepted by psychologists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><b>Ontology</b>: Ananda Marga believes in monotheism. In common parlance iishvara, Bhagava&#x301;n and Brahma are accepted as synonymous. But according to Ananda Marga, they are not synonymous, they represent the different aspects of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Brahma is the philosophical term, and Bhagava&#x301;n and Iishvara are the attributional expressions of Brahma. Regarding Brahma it has been said, &ldquo;A&#x301;nandam&#x301; Brahma&rdquo;, i.e. A&#x301;nanda and Brahma are identical. In Ananda Marga philosophy, a subtle line of demarcation between sukha (happiness) and ananda (bliss) has been drawn. Sukha denotes a congenial mental state whereas A&#x301;nanda is a metempirical state of bliss which overflows the mind &ndash; a state which should be called neither congenial nor uncongenial. The state of bliss is always above the scope of mind because it is limitless. The experience of bliss transcends the scope of mind and is concerned with the Macrocosm. Brahma is the name given to the ultimate quality of happiness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Two aspects of Brahma &ndash; Sagun&#x301;a and Nirgun&#x301;a &ndash; have been mentioned. &ldquo;Shivashaktya&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma&rdquo;, i.e. Brahma is the composite of Shiva and Shakti. The derivative meaning of Purus&#x301;a is one who lies covert in the unit being &ndash; one who is devoid of any action. Where there is no expression, that aspect of Brahma is called Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma and where there is expression, it is called Sagun&#x301;a Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Nirgun&#x301;a and Sagun&#x301;a are two aspects of one and the same Brahma. They are not two different Brahmas. It should be clearly mentioned that Ananda Marga is absolute monism &ndash; it is not dualism. A question may arise: How can Ananda Marga be called monism when it declares that Shiva and Shakti are separate entities. The answer is that in Ananda Marga philosophy, Shiva, or Cognitive Force, is both the material and the efficient cause, whereas Shakti, or Operative Force, is only the efficient cause. Shakti is merely subservient to Shiva, Shakti has no existence separate from Shiva. So we can safely conclude that Ananda Marga philosophy is based on monism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Entity, playing the role of the controller of the quinquelemental universe is called Purus&#x301;ottama. He controls all created beings and entities by virtue of His centripetal and centrifugal forces. In the Cosmic cycle, the inanimate objects are called sam&#x301;stha&#x301;, the living being ham&#x301;sa. Each and every ham&#x301;sa and sam&#x301;stha&#x301; is moving around Purus&#x301;ottama on its respective axis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The closer the microcosm feels to Parama Purus&#x301;a, the less the radius between Parama Purus&#x301;a and the microcosm will be. In addition to Nirgun&#x301;a, Sagun&#x301;a and Purus&#x301;a, a new concept of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma has been added to Ananda Marga ideology. The philosophical interpretation of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is found only in Tantra &ndash; nowhere else. Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is a link between Sagun&#x301;a and Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is more a devotional concept than a philosophical one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><b>Metaphysics</b>: Ananda Marga metaphysics is really unique and revolutionary. Metaphysics as explained in the West is not supported by modern physics. Modern science, while attempting to trace the prime cause of creation, has been upgraded to idealism above materialism. But facts of metaphysics as presented by modern philosophers are supported by materialism or extreme idealism. Both views are equally one-sided and unscientific.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->As the first cause of creation, Ananda Marga philosophy conceives of the gun&#x301;ayantraka, the triangle of forces. We have already discussed that Brahma is the composite of Shiva and Shakti. Shakti means the sentient, mutative and static forces. The expression resulting from the triangle of forces is the cause of a great bondage on Consciousness. In the first phase of movement of the Cosmic cycle, the Macrocosmic Mind emerges. Due to the increasing static pressure on Cosmic Citta, the five fundamental factors gradually emerge &ndash; ether, air, luminous, liquid and solid. Thus out of the Cosmic mind arises matter. This aspect of the Cosmic cycle is called Sain&#x32D;cara. Due to the further static pressure on the solid factor, there ensues an internal physical clash within the material structure which gives rise to unit mind and life. As a sequence to the origin of life and mind, there arise the living beings &ndash; the birds and animals, plants and trees &ndash; and in the final stage of evolution come the humans, having a developed mind and complex body. This introversive phase of the Cosmic Cycle is called pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Thus Ananda Marga can legitimately claim to have solved many riddles of metaphysics. It has clearly stated that matter originates from Macrocosmic mind and the microcosm evolves from matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><b>Spiritual Cult</b>: Thus far all philosophers have remained completely unaware of spiritual cult. Although new ideas in the domain of philosophy have been added, philosophy has failed to establish its link with the dusty earth. And a philosophy which has no relation with the dusty earth nor with the children of the soil has no practical value. Philosophy is meant for the benefit of the human race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ananda Marga philosophy is unique in this respect. Ananda Marga stands to implement its ideology. In order to establish a coordination between philosophy and practical life, Ananda Marga has evolved a spiritual cult on the basis of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>Epistemology</b>: According to Ananda Marga, epistemology has two branches &ndash; para&#x301; and apara&#x301;. Para&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means knowing the Supreme reality beyond the scope of time, space and person. Apara&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means the knowledge within the scope of time, space and person &ndash; which is ever changing. The means to attain para&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, or absolute knowledge, is through the application of pinnacled intellect (agrya&#x301;buddhi), and the means to attain apara&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, or relative knowledge, is the pinnacled intellect plus circular approach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><b>Psychology</b>: We have discussed earlier that psychology and manovijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na are not the same thing. Manovijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na deals with the origin and development of mind &ndash; its actions and reactions, its influences, its consummation, etc. This novel addition of Ananda Marga regarding the origin of mind is that the unit mind has evolved out of matter through clash and cohesion. Mind is the composite of citta, aham and mahat &ndash; its different functional chambers. It has four mental states &ndash; ja&#x301;grat (wakeful), svapna (dream), sus&#x301;upti (sleep) and turiiya (transcendental). From a practical point of view, the mind is divided into conscious, subconscious and unconscious portions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Mind has five layers (kos&#x301;as) of existence &ndash; ka&#x301;mamaya, manomaya, atima&#x301;nas, vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya and hiran&#x301;maya. The expression of mind, whether crude or subtle, depends upon the different kos&#x301;as. The association of mind with external objects is established through tanma&#x301;tras or inferences. Tanma&#x301;tras are of five kinds: sound, touch, form, taste and smell. The tanma&#x301;tras are actually the expressions of material objects. The tanma&#x301;tras in the form of vibrations come in contact with the mind through the five sensory organs. The mind establishes its link with external objects through the inferences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><b>Ethics</b>: Ananda Marga ethics is rudimental and universalistic. There are five kinds of yama and five kinds of niyama whose very purpose is to regulate the external and internal behaviour of human beings according to the highest principles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In Western philosophy observance of ethical principles is considered the primary goal in life, but Ananda Marga philosophy considers that ethical observance is the primary step towards the higher life. Niiti or principle is not the goal of human life, rather it is a starting point of life&#146;s journey.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sha&#x301;sana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah sha&#x301;strah parikiirtita&rdquo; &ndash; i.e., that which leads to permanent liberation is sha&#x301;stra or scripture. Here sha&#x301;sana means discipline. The role of scripture is to lead the human beings towards the Supreme goal through discipline or anusha&#x301;sana. Dharma is a valuable asset in human life. Dharma ensures a special position for human beings as distinct from animals. They are considered the crown of creation, due to their dharma. Human beings derive the noblest instructions for the greatest development from dharma. When the sole purpose of scripture, i.e. dharmasha&#x301;stra is to establish the human beings in the stable, exalted position of spiritual ideation, it must be practical, rational, infallible and universal. It must be based on deep eternal truths. It must be a&#x301;ptava&#x301;kya. A scripture is a guided entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The &ldquo;Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha&rdquo; series of books are the scriptures of Ananda Marga ideology. The books expound in simple and [[lucid, elaborate]] and rational ways, many important aspects of Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma. Upon reading this series of books, the reader will receive immense spiritual inspiration. While interpreting the various various spiritual ideas, relevant portions and shlokas of the Vedas and Tantras have also been discussed. According to Ananda Marga the Vedas do not necessarily include every branch of knowledge, nor are they infallible. On many occasions as per necessity, the relevant portions and shlokas from the other scriptures or books have also been quoted. For instance the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata, the Giita, the Quran, Tantra, Yoga, Vedanta, etc., have also been quoted to illustrate various aspects of Dharma and philosophy. This [[simple and]] lucid interpretation of Dharma will surely arouse the deep spiritual urges latent in the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Some Examples<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->To attain Parama Purus&#x301;a, a devotee must be free from the feelings of discrimination. Whenever there is a sense of difference, there is no Parama Purus&#x301;a. In this context there is a beautiful story in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata: the story of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a being fed banana skins by Vidura&#146;s wife. As soon as the story is illustrated, the readers have no difficulty in understanding a deep truth that as long as Vidura&#146;s devoted wife was feeding Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a with banana skins (instead of real bananas), with no thought of discrimination in her mind, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a relished them. But the moment Vidura aroused the feeling of differentiation in his wife&#146;s mind, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a lost interest in eating.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->To attain the Supreme Entity, special attachment for Him is required. While explaining the true spirit of that special love, it has been said, &ldquo;You love your son; that is all right. But if he dies, you will have immense grief. Is it not true?&rdquo; Because a son is a finite entity, he will not remain forever. He is bound to die one day, leaving you in boundless sorrow. But if you take your son to be a manifestation of Brahma, you need not fear in constant fear of losing him, because Brahma will never be lost. He is ever present, always surrounding you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This is the spirit of renunciation or vaera&#x301;gya.<!-- /block --></p>
<p class="plain"><center>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</center></p>
<a name="10..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->To attain Parama Purus&#x301;a there is a necessity of selfless devotion. To illustrate the point, a very common example has been given: Suppose you rear hens, you feed them rice and of course you love them also. If someone takes one of your hens, you will fall out with him, and even come to blows. But is that out of selfless love? Love must be untarnished and free from the least selfishness. You feed the hens for your benefit; you are motivated by the thought that one day the hens will lay eggs and you will earn money by selling them. &ldquo;Nija sukha la&#x301;gi ye kare piriiti, se ja&#x301;ni garala kha&#x301;ye&rdquo; (One who loves others for self-interest, swallows poison).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->For higher spiritual practice, there should be balanced emphasis on jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na (knowledge), karma (action), and bhakti (devotion). Ananda Marga scripture asks: Do you know the mutual relation amongst devotion, action and knowledge? Suppose you know that there is a certain gentleman, Ramesh Babu, and you also knows the place where he lives. This fact of knowing is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na or knowledge, but this alone is not enough, you are to try to reach him. Maybe you are to undertake a long train journey or undergo various other troubles to reach him. This are all karma, or action. Next you have to arrive in front of his house, gently knock at the door and call him politely so that he is pleased to come out and open the door. This part of action, i.e., knocking at the door and calling Him, is bhakti or devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The readers easily understand the point illustrated in the story.<!-- /block --></p>
<p class="plain"><center>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</center></p>
<a name="10..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->To attain Parama Purus&#x301;a one must pursue the path of greatness. One must fight relentlessly against all sorts of meanness, inferiority complex, etc., and advance towards Him while imbibing the ideation of the Supreme. Hence Ananda Margis do not recognize any so-called caste or class divisions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Another figment of human imagination is to attempt to limit the unlimited, formless entity to idols or clay images. Ananda Marga is clearly opposed to idol worship. So it states: &ldquo;Do not keep yourself absorbed in crude thought or allow yourself to be carried away by impulse, and narrow tendencies. Those who indulge in idol worship unknowingly worship the static force.&rdquo; According to Ananda Marga, Brahma, the Supreme entity, one without beginning and end is the only object of ideation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The spirit of the message of scripture is conveyed to the readers in a language that touches the deepest chords of the human heart. It is meant to provide inspiration to the seekers of truth. The scripture arouses deep devotional sentiments:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->(a) &ldquo;O human beings, proceed on the path of On&#x32D;m&#x301;kara towards subtleness. Do not run after the superficial, pleasant mirage dominated by tamogun&#x301;a. Establish yourself in sattvagun&#x301;a and then merge yourself into Brahma. Reach the point whence on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra has started. Awaken your latent dynamism through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and devotion, arouse your divine wisdom and merge that pure divinity into the endless stream of divine glory. Attain the Supreme state for which you have suffered tremendous privations. Today you have the most favourable opportunity to prove yourself as human being.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->(b) &ldquo;Do not disregard this overflowing love of your unfailing friend. Do not allow any of His gifts to go unused. Just think once deeply with a calm mind, how much He has done for you, how much he is doing and how ready He is to do anything for you. Do not forget Him, O human beings.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->(c) &ldquo;Thoroughly absorbed in the thought of Brahma, you rush along the path of self-realization starting from the first expression of moralism. Maybe your feet will be pricked by thorns on the path and will bleed profusely, or the treacherous horrors of thunder and lightning may fall on your head, yet you are to move on undaunted. Remember, you are a born fighter: to stop the war and lie inert or flee from the battlefield is against your nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ignoring all the obstacles on the way, you must rush towards the real destination &ndash; Parama Purus&#x301;a.

<a name="10..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In the &ldquo;Subhasita Samgraha&rdquo; series, the excellence of A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga has been analysed by way of comparing our ideology with other schools of thought. Some simple and innocent seekers of light may lose themselves in the narrow, meandering alleys of philosophies and doctrines. To provide proper guidance to the devotees, different philosophies with their positive and negative aspects, have been thoroughly analysed. For instance, there has been detailed discussions on bhakti and many of the stages of bhakti have been discussed &ndash; ta&#x301;masikii bhakti, ra&#x301;jasikii bhakti, sa&#x301;tvikii bhakti, vaedik bhakti, nirgun&#x301;a bhakti, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; bhakti, ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti, kevala&#x301; bhakti, etc. Of these stages of devotion which one should be pursued by Ananda Margis? The Ma&#x301;rga scripture says, &ldquo;In Ananda Marga, there is no place for vaedhii or jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; bhakti. Ananda Margis are followers of ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti and therefore they do not wish to terminate their journey in the state of vrajabha&#x301;va. Whatever else there may be in dualistic vrajabha&#x301;va, there is no expression of the due reverence or the will of Brahma or His introversive phase of the cycle of creation. Why do people fail to realize the nice opportunity which His grace has offered them? Why will they do not merge their &lsquo;I&rsquo; feeling into the immortality of the Supreme? By enjoying the bliss of divine attainment as a separate existence, the unit mind is associated with indriyas &ndash; the apprehension of deterioration exists. That is why Ananda Marga does not accept staying in gopiibha&#x301;va.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->This makes it amply clear to the sa&#x301;dhakas that one should not think of one self to be Ramdas&#8230; but Ramaswarupa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->There are three approaches to sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->(1) Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra (rightist approach)<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->(3) Madhyama&#x301;ca&#x301;ra (centrist approach)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Which path should an Ananda Marga sa&#x301;dhaka adopt? The Marga scripture says: &ldquo;Va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhakas, even before attaining their goal, often misuse their hard-earned power; consequently, they unknowingly invite more darkness, more dullness, and gradually degenerate into animality. Without fixing the goal of struggle, it is futile to win the war against Prakrti. Hence Ananda Marga supports neither va&#x301;ma&#x301;ca&#x301;ra nor daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; because the latter is the path of flattery. Flattery or sycophancy is a sign of cowardice. A mighty person being pleased with flattery may grant a few favours, a certain amount of privilege, but never complete freedom.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Hence, Ananda Marga advocates only the madhyama&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; to advance towards Brahma tearing the veil of ignorance created by avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Human life is usually busy nowadays. It is not possible to read various scriptures and gather the essence of scriptural knowledge. At the same time sva&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya, a part of yama and niyama, has also to be conducted. The study of Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha will serve the purpose.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The ancient preceptors will select and train only a handful of deserving disciples. The latter would sit face to face with the preceptor and seek clarification of doubts and confusions. But as Ananda Marga stands for a large-scale spiritual renaissance in the society, there is little scope for the preceptor and an increasing number of devotees to sit face to face and clarify all doubts. But there is no end to doubts and confusions in sa&#x301;dhakas&#146; minds. The Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha series deals with such topics as will help clarify the various doubts arising within the sa&#x301;dhakas&#146; minds.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The inner import of society is collective movement. The primary stage of this movement is morality. The idealistic element of mind which inspires the human beings towards the cosmic goal is moralism. Social life has to start its journey from this moralism. The journey will end at the point where universal humanism encompasses every human being in the universe. The only resource needed on the journey is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Hence it is said, morality is the base of life, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the means and divine life is the goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ananda Marga wants to build up an ideal society such as this. So there should be a congenial environment where people will get the opportunity to enhance their physical, psychic and spiritual progress, and advance rhythmically and in unison towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence, Ananda Marga has formulated a social treatise for the establishment of a congenial social structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The social code of Manu helped to build the Hindu social system, although the same social code has been the cause of degeneration in Hindu society. Manu wanted to bind the various aspects of social life together with rigid laws and regulations. Because of the rigidity and harshness of the laws, many common people could not follow them, and as a result, they approached the priests [[for concessions]]. This led to slackness in the observation of the laws and social codes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Manu&#146;s social code, the penal code was so severe that people were always afraid. There was no congenial atmosphere for [[freedom and full growth]]. Morality was confused with dharma, so people accused of social crimes were given religious punishments. This thwarted the spiritual growth of people at every step. Obviously, Manu&#146;s social code is totally unacceptable in the society which Ananda Marga wants to establish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The specialities of the Ananda Marga social system are as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->1) Social laws and regulations have been framed in accordance with the needs and [[prevalent moods]] of the people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->2) [[That which is true]] has been accepted, and the dark aspects of life have not been given any scope to flourish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->3) The physical, psychic and spiritual progress of all people has been stressed and promoted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->To build an ideal social system, the following factors are essential &ndash; unity, social security and peace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Unity<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In any society or social structure, unity among its members is indispensable. Otherwise, the structure will crumble down. Social disunity, economic self-interest, lack of [[openness of mind to]] others&#146; actions or viewpoints, are factors which not only degrade society, but also cause the complete eradication of society from the face of the earth. In the short annals of human history, there are many societies which have completely disappeared, leaving very little trace. So the most important thing is to know how to maintain social unity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Social unity and solidarity are only possible if the members of society are inspired with the following ideals &ndash; a common ideology, a caste-less society, collective social functions and no capital punishment. In the Ananda Marga social system, all these four factors are present.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>1) A common ideology</b>. At an early age, that is, at the age of five, when a child starts acquiring knowledge, it should be taught how to imbibe cosmic ideation. Ananda Marga society is based on a common ideological goal &ndash; the attainment of Brahma. Brahma is the Eternal and Supreme entity. Abiding peace is possible if Parama Purus&#x301;a is accepted as the goal of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the economic sphere also, Ananda Marga has accepted this common goal. The entire wealth of the universe is the common patrimony of all human beings, and all are equally entitled to enjoy this wealth. At the outset of any festival or social function, the Sam&#x301;gacchadhvam&#x301; mantra is recited so that everyone can reflect on the significance of the common ideal. A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga promotes love for the entire humanity and the proper utilization of all wealth for the benefit of all. Those participating in the child-naming ceremony take the collective responsibility for the physical, psychic and spiritual development of the child. This clearly demonstrates that Ananda Marga has a common ideology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><b>2) A caste-less society</b>. Any society which gives predominance to a particular class or caste is bound to disintegrate. The curse of caste divisions is not found in any country of the world except India. Small parties and groups seeking various social and economic privileges should not be [[permitted to be formed]]. In our Ananda Marga, the entire human race is considered one family, bound by the common bonds of love. In A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga, one introduces oneself as a mere living being, so here it is impossible to establish anything but a caste-less society. The head, the directors and the general members are not only the [[fellow]] members of the society, they are also mutual spiritual associates, sharing the common spiritual ideology. They may have belonged to any other class or caste, but Brahma is accepted as the common goal for all. A social structure has been evolved in which all members consider themselves only as living beings. The entire family is not deprived of the joy of attending a social function if an individual family member makes a mistake. This precludes the possibility of forming a dissident group of excommunicated members. There is no special requirement for marriage, studying the scriptures or any [[programme]]. In Ananda Marga, looking after children is considered a social responsibility. There is no caste or colour bar for learning spiritual practice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><b>3) Collective social functions</b>. Many social problems arise due to lack of magnanimity, such as not properly understanding or respecting the views of others. This not only keeps people apart, but also makes them hostile to each other. People come together in different festivals and social functions which foster mutual bonds of unity. When they participate in such activities and remain engaged in the same type of collective action, they develop the feeling of temporary affinity. Ananda Marga encourages these types of social functions. Collective bathing and collective meditation on special occasions are as good as common social functions. No ceremony or festival in Ananda Marga is performed in the presence of one a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya [[only]]. [[At]] least five Ananda Margis also have to be present.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><b>4) No capital punishment</b>. Capital punishment degenerates the moral standard of the society. It also checks the progress of those who are punished. In addition, people who are penalized with severe social punishment form bands or groups with the help of antisocial elements, and aggravate the problem of indiscipline and crime in society. In our Ananda Marga, capital punishment or social punishment is not supported. As a punitive measure, wrongdoers are not permitted to attend social functions for a certain period of time. After the period is over, they are again allowed to attend social functions as before. This system of punishment does not affect the other members of their family. Nor does it affect the moral standard of those being punished, which excommunication or penal servitude does.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Another punishment is that one must bring ten people to the path of spirituality. Only then will one be permitted to attend social functions. This system of punishment is corrective in nature. Wrongdoers have the opportunity to rectify themselves instead of having their progress checked. This system of punishment does not cast any aspersions on the concerned people or their families, and hence it does not foment further indiscipline or crime. On the contrary, those undergoing punishment utilize their time in a better way than other people when they try to inspire ten persons to embrace spirituality. They do good to both themselves and society by teaching a noble ideology. [[Nobody]] should be punished in hot haste. In the first stage, people should be given a chance to rectify themselves. It has been stated in &ldquo;Carya&#x301;carya Part 2&rdquo;:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->1) Criminals should first be persuaded to mend their ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->2) In the second stage, they should be bluntly commanded to mend their ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->3) In the third stage, they should be informed of the probable punitive measures that will be taken against him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->4) In the fourth stage, disciplinary measures must be taken against the offenders. Naturally [[would-be]] criminals will live in constant fear of punishment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..23"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Social Security<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The absence of social security may create disunity in the society. A society cannot last long if it does not guarantee the safety or security of its members against [[wrongs]] and injustice. In the absence of discipline, social security may be endangered. So for social security, both justice and discipline are essential.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><b>1) Justice</b>. To ensure social security, people should not be subjected to any form of injustice because of their economic status, sex or caste. Economic injustice springs mainly from lack of respect for the dignity of labour. That is, it takes place due to occupational differences. In Ananda Marga, the life of a scavenger is considered more respectable than of that of a social parasite. Injustices are bound to be eradicated from society when great importance is given to people&#146;s independent means of livelihood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Economic injustice may also arise from people&#146;s excessive desire to accumulate wealth. Selfish human beings want to appropriate all resources for themselves. But if they would realize that all members of  society have an equal right to utilize these resources, the economic problems confronting society will be greatly reduced. In Ananda Marga, the entire property of the universe is considered to be the property of all. In a society imbued with such a common ideal, there is little scope for economic injustice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Discrimination between men and women also encourages injustice. In human society, there is a marked tendency to consider women inferior to men. In many parts of the world, women are looked upon as mere objects of enjoyment. In some countries, they are even considered unfit for learning spiritual practice. Our Ananda Marga gives equal rights [[and responsibilities]] to men and women. [[In the Ananda Marga marriage system, the man and the woman both take on equal responsibilities. In Ananda Marga the female race is not considered unfit to learn spiritual practices.]] Both men and women are given [[respect]] in our social system, thus there is no scope for men to be considered superior to women.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Similarly, if the people of a particular caste are considered superior to other castes, economic injustice will be encouraged. In India, the so-called upper-caste Hindus perpetrate injustice on the Harijan community (the so-called untouchables). This has created a serious rift in the society. To eradicate this sort of social injustice, caste divisions should be completely abolished. In Ananda Marga, in the very first phase of initiation, a new member is taught to forget both their caste and colour. In the functions and festivals of a society based on caste divisions, the influence of caste prejudice is tremendous. In the collective functions and festivals of Ananda Marga, everyone, irrespective of caste, community or colour, can freely participate. In the society in general, the difference between castes and communities is given too much importance. Ananda Marga rejects these narrow sentiments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph --><b>2) Discipline</b>. Throughout history it can be observed that in the absence of discipline, many societies have been obliterated from the surface of the earth. Undisciplined behaviour by a handful of people severely disrupts the lives of others. For the sake of social security, discipline is essential. Normally, social indiscipline arises when a few people think that the existing social laws and regulations are defective and inadequate. If such thinking remains confined to debate and discussion, it will not cause any major social problems. However, to ensure discipline in society, the laws and regulations should be rational and capable of amendments. In Ananda Marga, there is no place for irrationality. In a society where rationality is given so much importance that amendments are permitted, discontent and indiscipline can hardly be contemplated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga, rationality follows obedience as the means to maintain social harmony. People should first be obedient to the social codes, and then if they find a few defects, they should have the right to initiate debates and discussions, and suggest amendments to the defective laws. But if people starts arguing without showing obedience, social indiscipline will be the result. The social code of conduct of Ananda Marga gives more importance to rationality than blind obedience. Thus, there is little scope for jeopardizing the system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..31"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Peace<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->A state of mental equilibrium and equipoise is called peace. It is important to know how the state of peace is attained, and how it is disturbed. A systematic, spiritual practice leads to psychic balance, whereas dogmatic faith in superstitions disturbs mental peace. Spiritual discipline and relentless struggle against superstition are required to maintain psychic peace. The principal aim of human life is to be free of sorrow and misery. Otherwise, one cannot hope to attain peace. The cessation of sorrow is of two types &ndash; temporary and permanent. That which brings about temporary cessation of sorrow is called artha (psycho-physical). But artha is a crude object, thus it can only bring crude and temporary satisfaction. To attain permanent relief from sorrow and affliction, Parama&#x301;rtha is the only means. Parama&#x301;rtha can only be attained through spiritual practice. That is why in Ananda Marga, each member is encouraged to practice from the age of five. As one grows, one acquires tremendous physical, psychic and spiritual benefits. The Ananda Marga method of spiritual practice does not encourage a person to give up all worldly duties, rather it teaches one how to make the best utilization of physical, subtle and causal potentialities to attain permanent mental balance and peace, and to enhance physical, mental and spiritual progress. Ananda Marga teaches a methodical and scientific system of spiritual practices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Our social code provides clear guidelines on how members will adapt to this modern, rapidly changing world. There have been more changes in the past 200 years than in the 800 years prior to that. In education, culture, dress and food habits major changes have taken place. Old, outdated wooden shoes, turbans, etc. have been replaced by modern shoes, hats and clothes made from scientific fabrics with contemporary designs. Primitive bullock carts, horse-drawn carriages, hackney coaches, etc., have been replaced with fast-moving cars, trains, and aeroplanes. In the past, people used to travel by elephant, but now they can travel to other planets by rocket. There should be a proper adjustment between the body and the mind to keep pace with the fast speed of the development in the world. For this reason, Ananda Marga spiritual practices place much importance on a&#x301;sanas, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->In a word, Ananda Marga&#146;s social code fulfils all the conditions of an ideal social code &ndash; it is universal, rational and psychological. It is eminently suited to the development of a dynamic social structure in this rapidly-changing world. As it has been formulated in conformity with the physical, psychic and social needs of human beings, people from all walks of life fully support it and are enthusiastically engaged in its implementation.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This quinquelemental universe is a relative truth, a changing reality, a passing phenomenon &ndash; a passing flow of constantly changing events. It rests on the three pillars of the relative factors &ndash; time, space and person. Space is always changing. It is composed of countless atoms and molecules. With the change in the movement of atoms and molecules, space also changes. That is why numerous rich and beautiful cities of the past are now buried under the earth. Many splendid palaces and mansions, many churches, temples, mosques and synagogues, and many pyramids have been reduced to rubble. With the constant change in the flow of time, how many major changes have occurred in the universe? Similarly, with the change in time and space, people also change. A small two-year old child becomes a smart and active twenty-five year old youth. And the same energetic youth becomes an infirm, inactive, old person in due course. Thus, nothing in this universe is permanent. Many gigantic animals in the past have become totally extinct from the surface of the earth. Royal pomp and opulence, the pride of power, the vast knowledge of mighty scholars have become things of the past, thrown into the dustbin of history. Many objects emerged in the past, remained on earth for a short time, and then disappeared according to the inexorable law of nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The only eternal truth is Parama Purus&#x301;a. He is anadi, beginningless, endless, all-pervasive; an entity beyond the scope of time, place and person. He is the only eternal, undecaying, imperishable, immutable entity. He is the Supreme Source from which the inanimate, plant and animal worlds have emerged. He is the starting-point and the culminating point of everything. Hence, wise people should utilize their physical, psychic and spiritual power to realize that Supreme Omni-Telepathic Entity to become one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->While trying to realize that singular entity, the balance between the subjective and the objective worlds is divided into two branches &ndash; pra&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya and a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya. Whatever people learn from the external world &ndash; be it from a book of facts or a learned discourse, or any source of knowledge &ndash; is &ldquo;pra&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya&rdquo; or &ldquo;relative knowledge&rdquo;. It is sometimes correct, sometimes incorrect. When human beings, through psycho-spiritual practice, make their minds as expansive as the Comic Mind, they can receive instructions or directions directly from Him due to His proximity. The knowledge thus acquired is called &ldquo;a&#x301;pta va&#x301;kya&rdquo; or &ldquo;absolute knowledge&rdquo;. As people receive the knowledge directly from the Cosmic Mind, that knowledge is true and beneficial for all people in all ages and in all countries. Absolute knowledge is the direct message from God.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There are three sources of relative knowledge &ndash; direct perception, inference and authority. Now let us see which source is reliable and to what extent. The empiricists contend that perception is the only real knowledge. How can something which can not be seen, heard, smelled, tasted or touch, they say, be accepted as something real? But the question is: If the indriyas (organs) through which we gather knowledge are defective, how can true knowledge be attained? Similarly, if the object of attainment is defective, how can true knowledge be attained? Similarly, if the object of attainment is defective, or if there are difficulties in the radiation of inferential vibration, knowledge cannot be acquired. That is why in the shadows of the night we wrongly think a piece of rope to be a snake; we fail to see the difference between a chilli and eggplant seeds; on seeing a bushy tamarind tree we mistake it for a ghost and frighten ourselves out of our wits. Thus, with the slightest defect in the knower, knowable and knowledge, real knowledge is not possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Can one attain real knowledge through inference? Suppose smoke is rising from a mountain. Many people may think at first that the mountain is on fire, but on examining the spot they will discover that the smoke had come from a nearby village where the inhabitants were cooking and the smoke had simply accumulated near the mountain. Inference in this case proves false. If some persons look towards the desert during a hot day they will see a vast lake shimmering in the distance. But in reality it is only a mirage. Thousands of people may see the mirage and swear that it is a lake. So inference is also an unreliable source of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The third source of knowledge, a&#x301;gama or authoritative documents, can provide real knowledge to human beings. However, if it is not based on spiritual realization, if it is a mere interpolation arising out of the fertile brain of an opportunist Vipra or intellectual, it can never bring real knowledge to people, but will sow seeds of disharmony and dissension in the human society. For instance, the scripture of a certain community states that the earth is fixed and the sun in moving around it. This assertion is of course absolutely wrong scientifically. If an erudite scientist points out this mistake, the orthodox followers of the scriptures will brand him or her an atheist. The scriptures of other communities proclaim that only the followers of their religion are the favourite children of God and others are damned heathens. To kill them is not at all a sin, rather one will attain a permanent place in heaven after their death. Such scriptures are very detrimental to human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Thus it is seen that relative knowledge promotes the welfare of human beings in only a few cases, whereas absolute knowledge is always conducive to human welfare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Generally there are three recognized means to bring about social welfare: 1) the rule of brute force, 2) the rule of reason, and 3) spiritual leadership.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->1) The rule of brute force. Sometimes the members of a society are made to follow rules in accordance with the dictatorial decrees of their leaders. But these dictating authorities are far from being benevolent. Rather, they trick the members of society into believing that they are acting for their welfare but their sole concern is to promote narrow self-interest, power and privileges. Their guidance is not at all helpful for the growth of social welfare. For example, the British government ruled India for two hundred years, but how much real progress has there been in India? In most cases, their rule was based on their own self-aggrandizement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The political leaders of so many countries have led their countries to the brink of war. The political history of Germany, Italy, Spain, Pakistan and China is a clear proof of this truth. Even though thousands of citizens hardly get enough food to fill their bellies, their leaders continue to spend vast amounts of money on arms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->History does provide some examples of benign, enlightened kings such as Ashok the Great and Alfred the Great who did some good for society, but they are few in number. Most were warmongers, such as Genghis Khan. They were so cruel that they stained the green earth under their feet with blood, and caused the sky to resound with the wails and tears of their innocent victims. The rule of a brutal dictator is no rule at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->2) The rule of reason. What is reason or logic? There are three aspects of logic: va&#x301;da, jalpa and vitan&#x301;da&#x301;. In the battlefield an efficient general does not start the battle without strengthening his own army first. First he sends out his intelligence unit to find the weak points of the opposing army. Secondly, he stations his army in such a way that his own soldiers can mount a surprise attack on the enemy installations. Thirdly, the moment he gets the advantage he invades the enemy camp and attains complete victory. In exactly the same way a logician strives to detect the loopholes and weaknesses in his adversary&#146;s argument. This part of the debate is called &ldquo;va&#x301;da&rdquo;. In the next stage the logician formulates convincing argument to defeat the logic put forward by his opponent. This part of the debate is called &ldquo;jalpa&rdquo;. In the third stage the logician will present very clear views in such a way that his adversary is completely defeated. This part of the debate is called &ldquo;vitan&#x301;da&rdquo;. When one&#146;s mind is perfectly adjusted with these three phrases of logic it is called &ldquo;yukti&rdquo; or &ldquo;reason&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Reason is relative knowledge. Many people may come to the wrong conclusion along the path of reason because if the first premise is wrong, the conclusion is also bound to be wrong. For in stance, if a person studies old books on geography and argues that Allahabad is the capital of Uttar Pradesh or Cuttack is the capital of Orissa, that would be something ludicrous. Rice is also relative knowledge because we do not get rice directly from God, we get it indirectly. If one resolves this very moment to lead an honest life, that would be absolute knowledge because absolute knowledge comes directly from the Supreme and produces a certain awareness in the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->3) Spiritual leadership.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Sha&#x301;sana&#x301;t ta&#x301;raye yastu sha&#x301;stra parikiirtiitah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That which leads to liberation through discipline is called &lsquo;scripture&rsquo;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Common people usually live their lives according to absolute knowledge and become noble and great. That is why we see people like Kabir and Ramakrishna, who even without formal schooling, were highly regarded by tens of thousands of people. In fact, it is doubtful whether learned scholars could bring about even a small fraction of the spiritual progress these great people brought to society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The amount of social welfare achieved by the rule of administration is very insignificant. The rule of administration is no rule. It does not provide any inspiration for the desire to work, but rather it injects a fear psychosis in the mind. Such administrators do not command the confidence of the people. Once they are removed from power they lose their social prestige.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->But social progress is achieved to some extent through relative knowledge, but here also there is a great possibility of conflict between relative knowledge and absolute knowledge. Relative knowledge often encourages divisive ideas and the propagation of narrow sentiments such as casteism, nationalism, communalism, provincialism, etc., by extolling the greatness of caste, community, creed, colour, etc. It often tends to suppress other castes, communities, creeds, etc., or wants to annihilate them completely. On the other hand, absolute knowledge teaches human beings that the Dharma of all humans is one and the same. The Supreme Entity is the Universal Father. All the human beings of the world are brothers and sisters. All are equal &ndash; no one is low, no one is high.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Relative knowledge, by concocting certain false arguments, may prove that God does not exist, that He is a mere figment of human imagination. A weak mind may accept these arguments, but the heart can never do so. Whenever there is a conflict between the brain and the heart, intelligent people should respond to the call of the heart. The books in Ananda Marga philosophy are all absolute knowledge. The proper mark of identity of absolute knowledge is that it must be universal, rational and psychological. Certain instances of absolute knowledge are as follows &ndash; the goal of human life is the attainment of Brahma; human beings are the progeny of Parama Purus&#x301;a; this universe is created by the macrocosmic conation; matter is the crudified form of the universal mind; by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practices human beings gradually become divine; whoever is born will have to die one day; liberation is the birth right of all living beings; human society is one and indivisible; diversity is the law of nature; no two entities in this universe are uniform.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->How far is relative knowledge acceptable to human society? As long as there is no conflict between absolute knowledge and relative knowledge, relative knowledge may be tolerated, but the moment relative knowledge does more harm than good to society, it should not be allowed to work in society, because by taking advantage of relative knowledge opportunists get the scope to exploit the psychological weakness of human beings. For example, the concept of selfless action in the Giita and the theory of the migration of souls have been interpreted in such an unscientific way that the society is greatly harmed. The boot-licking Vipras of the capitalist trick the hungry Shu&#x301;dras or workers into believing that poverty is a result of their previous misdeeds. Hence they will have to be prepared to wait until their next life before receiving the inexorable decree of fate. This makes a group of people passive fatalists. On the other hand, it paves the way for the ruthless exploitation of the capitalists. Once a reputed professor of Calcutta made a statement which became popular amongst Indian students that the beef-eating race enjoys independent political life. Many enthusiastic students were misguided by that. Today in the communist countries of the world thousands of people are being killed in the name of communism. So the value of relative knowledge should be assessed in the light of universal humanism. If relative knowledge promotes universal humanism, it will be tolerated by the society, but once it goes against the spirit of universal humanism, it will forfeit the right to exist.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Anubhu&#x301;tavis&#x301;aya&#x301;sampramos&#x301;ah smrtih [&ldquo;The re-creation of things already perceived by the mind is called memory&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The objects or incidents that one recollects are called anubhu&#x301;tavis&#x301;aya&#x301; or things already perceived. When the same objects or incidents are recreated in the mind, they are called smrti or memory. For instance, a person may not always recollect what he or she ate the previous day, but if he or she thinks hard, the items that were eaten will flash in the mind. In our daily life, we are constantly recollecting things perceived in the past.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->How does one activate the memory? There are two ways: internal and external. The internal way is to revive the undistorted image of perceived incidents in the nerve cells. Perception in the primary stage is registered in the unit mind through the nerve cells, and the vibrations of those perceptions remain embedded in the nerve cells. The nerve cells in the brain differ according to the different vibrations they carry. Some carry vibrations of knowledge, others the vibrations of action. Microcosms with brains do not have much difficulty in creating ideas at the psychic level carried through inferences because the vibrations in the nerve cells remain undistorted for quite some time. For instance, if someone happens to see a white cow, he or she can easily say after five minutes what the colour of the cow was because the image of the cow imprinted in the nerve cells is still clear and distinct. That is why it is not difficult for the brain to recollect a memory by recreating ideational waves. But if we ask the same person to describe the cow after a few days, he or she will have more difficulty recollecting its colour because by then the impression of the cow in the nerve cells will have become indistinct. At that stage the perceived image is stored in the citta or ectoplasmic mind-stuff and not the brain. Hence the mind will have to labour hard to reformulate the image of the cow from the accumulated sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or the mental reactive momenta of past actions. The ability to do this depends on one&#146;s psychic power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->If the external factors necessary for the revival of memory remain undisturbed for some time, one can more easily recreate events already perceived. For instance, if one happens to go to the spot where the cow was seen, one suddenly remembers that a white cow was tethered there. But, after a lapse of much time, when the external factors necessary for the re-creation of that image change drastically, it becomes difficult for the brain to remember the details of the event. At this stage, to recollect the image, one has to penetrate the citta of the unit mind. Of course, once an incident is recollected, its impression remains understood for some time before it finally disappears.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Thus the brain is nothing more than a worldly machine for mental recollection. Its various parts assist the mind in various ways. But the permanent abode of memory is the citta. So even though an impression has faded from the nerve cells, the mind can recreate the impression by its own power. When the brain assists in the recollection of any event or fact it is called &ldquo;cerebral memory&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The human mind has three stages: crude, subtle and causal. There are also three states in human existence: wakeful, dream and sleep. The crude mind remains active during the wakeful state and the causal mind remains active during sleep. The causal mind is the repository of infinite knowledge. Whatever sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras we recreate in the wakeful and dream states remain stored in the causal mind. When the causal mind sleeps we call it &ldquo;death&rdquo;. Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;amanasi diirghanidra&#x301; maran&#x301;am [&ldquo;Long sleep in the causal mind is death&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->After death the disembodied mind floats in the vast space with its unexpressed sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Later on, with the cooperation of the mutative principle, the disembodied mind finds a suitable physical base. The memory of its past life remains awake for approximately the first five years of its new life. Although the child remains in a new physical environment, mentally it continues to live the joys and sorrows of its previous life. That is why children sometimes laugh and cry in their sleep, and their mothers often think they are talking with God. In colloquial Bengali this is called deola ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;. In actual fact this laughter and crying is nothing but the reappearance of past memories. To re-experience past events one does not need the cooperation of the old brain. The newly-born mind has not yet had time to build a close relationship with the new brain. The revival of experiences of past lives is what we call &ldquo;extra-cerebral memory&rdquo;, and is principally the task of the causal mind. The child&#146;s mind being unacquainted with the outside world and the new-born brain being inexperienced, his or her crude mind does not function much.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The experiences of the crude mind are not reflected in the child&#146;s subtle mind. In the case of a child, since the crude experiences are relatively few, the subtle mind remains tranquil. Thus the waves of the causal mind easily surface in the child&#146;s subtle mind. As a result, the accumulated experiences of the child&#146;s previous life can easily be recollected. As the child&#146;s crude mind is not yet mature enough to work externally, the dream experiences are not expressed in the wakeful state.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This extra-cerebral memory begins to fade after five years. The more one advances in age, the more the new environment leaves its impressions in the child&#146;s mind. The more a child sees new things before its eyes, the more restless it becomes to know each and every object of this world. Hence the child asks a multitude of questions &ndash; it seems there is no end to its inquisitiveness. The more it receives the answers to its questions, the more its mind gets acquainted with the mundane world. The experiences of the crude mind then begin, and get reflected in the dream state. As a result, the vibrations of the causal mind cannot come to the surface any more. Hence, the more the child advances in age, the more it forgets its past life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Sometimes children can remember their past life even after the age of five. In this case the mind of the new body remains free from environmental influences. That is, the waves of the external world are unable to influence the mind. Such people are called ja&#x301;tismara or one who remembers one&#146;s past lives. Normally, the extra-cerebral memory of such people remains active up to the age of twelve. If one still remembers one&#146;s past life after that it becomes difficult to survive, because two minds will try to function in one body &ndash; the mind of this life and that of the previous one. A single body cannot tolerate the clashes of two minds, hence psycho-physical parallelism is lost leading to eventual death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Forgetfulness is a providential decree. Usually human beings forget their past lives. Is this forgetfulness a blessing or a curse? It is a blessing because human beings feel burdened by the weight of one life. It would be impossible for them to carry the burden of many lives together.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The human mind is sentimental &ndash; full of love, affection, camaraderie, etc. People have a deep attraction to this world; they remain preoccupied throughout their lives with fears and anxieties for the safety of their families. So many problems have to be confronted. The problems of one life alone are enough to make people restless. If they had to face the problems of several lives, they would be unable to lead a natural life. The problems of the past lives, compounded by the strife of the present life, would drive them to the brink of insanity. Secondly, it is difficult for people to be detached from love and attachment for one life. So much effort is required to overcome the bondages of attachment and march towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. If the memory of the past lives is revived, the bondage of attachment will tighten its grip, putting a halt to spiritual advancement. One will be caught in the grip of worldly attachment. Thus the decree of merciful providence is, &ldquo;Let human beings be oblivious of their past lives.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It is also true that nothing in this universe is lost or destroyed, so the history of a person&#146;s hopes and frustrations [of this life] remains stored in their subconscious mind [subtle mind]. Due to restlessness of the crude and subtle minds, the causal mind cannot give expression to its omniscience. But all knowledge, one&#146;s entire past history and flashes of one&#146;s previous lives, remain stored in sequential order in the causal mind, just like a colourful panorama, one layer representing one life, followed by a gap, followed by another layer representing another life, and so on. That is why the great poet Rabindranath Tagore said, Bhule tha&#x301;ka&#x301; se to nay bhola&#x301; [&ldquo;To remain in oblivion is not to forget completely&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Human beings, if they so want, may try to relive those experiences in their memories. This endeavour is called sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practice. Sa&#x301;dhakas or spiritual aspirants, by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, suspend their crude mind in the subtle mind, and the subtle mind in the causal mind. They can then clearly visualize that panorama of sequential events in the causal mind. As they have full control over the time factor they can easily transcend the intervening gaps between two lives and establish a link between them. A series of lives slowly and gradually unfold themselves like a moving panorama before their eyes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Should one strive to see one&#146;s past lives? Through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; human beings attain a certain degree of control over the relative factors. After a long journey of hundreds of years one begins to visualize the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of one&#146;s past lives. To visualize other&#146;s sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras is relatively easy for a sa&#x301;dhaka, but to visualize one&#146;s own sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras is very difficult. Behind this also there is the decree of merciful providence. Imagine a person was a sinner in his or her past life, but in this life has got the opportunity to lead a spiritual life, by His Grace. Now, if the person happens to discover his or her past sinful life, he or she will lose all inspiration to continue spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The dominant thought in his or her mind will be, &ldquo;I am a sinner. I have no sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and will be unable to do it.&rdquo; This sort of negative thought will thwart his or her spiritual progress. One&#146;s past life will pull one back. In the words of Rabindranath Tagore:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..17"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->[I asked the Lord of my life, &ldquo;Who is pulling me from behind with such irresistible force?&rdquo; He told me to look back. I did, and found that my own mental reactive momenta were pulling me back.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The pashca&#x301;ter a&#x301;mi [the &ldquo;me&rdquo; behind me] of the poem refers to the extra-cerebral memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Conversely, if a sa&#x301;dhaka happened to be a great spiritualist in his or her past life, then through the powers of his or her extra-cerebral memory he or she will be further inspired to continue the spiritual life. He or she will think, &ldquo;In my previous life I was unable to complete my spiritual practice. Now in this life Parama Purus&#x301;a has given me the opportunity to attain my cherished goal.&rdquo; He or she will intensify his or her spiritual practice and advance rapidly towards Parama Purus&#x301;a with His sweet attraction. He or she will recite: Sammukhe t&#x301;heliche more pashca&#x301;ter a&#x301;mi [&ldquo;My own reactive momenta are pushing me forward&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This vast universe is the greatest expansion of the Macrocosmic mind, now the question is, how was this universe created? The fact is that the Macrocosmic citta is the material stuff of this universe. The mind can have a form when it is vibrated by the cosmic mind. Hence this universe is made out of his mind stuff. In the extroversial flow of the cosmic cycle of creation the different tanma&#x301;tras are created &ndash; sound, touch, taste, form, smell &ndash; as a result of crudification of cosmic citta. These tanma&#x301;tras are the analytical forms of universal rhythm. The inanimate matter, plants and animals, etc., originate in the evolutionary flow of the Macrocosmic imagination. It flows from subtle to crude in Sain&#x32D;cara and in Pratisain&#x32D;cara flows from crude to subtle. In this second phase of the cosmic flow the evolved human beings emerged and carry the flow of creation to its successful fruition. In the observable world that is the macrocosmic imagination, the numerous forms have emerged &ndash; forms after forms, waves after waves, ideas after ideas. He is the noumenal cause of this phenomenal world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Each and every created entity &ndash; whether crude, subtle or causal &ndash; is vibrational and rhythmic. Suppose there is a man he has a body, mind and soul. His body is composed of eyes, nose, ears, tongue, skin, vocal cords, hands, legs, excretory and genital organs, ten vayus, blood vessels, nerves, blood, flesh and so on. Each of this parts of the body has its distinctive rhythm. The difference between two human beings or two objects is due to the vibrational or rhythmic differences. That no two entities in this world look similar is due to this vibrational differences. Thus this world is full of diversity &ndash; this is the inexorable law of nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Vaecitram pra&#x301;krtam dharma sama&#x301;nam na bhavisyati<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[Diversity is the law of nature, uniformity will never be.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The average of rhythms of all rhythms &ndash; the rhythm of body, mind and soul, and the individual organs etc., of the body &ndash; is called individual rhythm. The individual entity has five kos&#x301;as [layers of mind], rather like a plantain flower. Similarly, this universe is the collective form of countless vibrations and rhythms. Every animate and inanimate object of creation emanates its own vibrations &ndash; the mighty mountains, the flowing rivers, the lovely forests &ndash; none is mute, none is silent. Each of them is resounding with an inexplicable eternal vibration, as if in deep meditation. The collective rhythms of all the rhythms emanating every moment from the countless objects of the cosmic imagination is called &ldquo;universal rhythm&rdquo;. The existence and growth of finite, living entities are dependent on this universal rhythm, whether they realize it or not. A microcosm, due to its limited capacity, cannot fully grasp this universal rhythm, although it tries to do so. To catch the vibration of this vast, endless universal rhythm the microcosms will have to unify all the capacity of their indriyas and minds. Only then will they be totally identified with the universal rhythm and become absorbed in a blissful vibration. The auspicious moment when the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; and big &ldquo;I&rdquo; are harmoniously united, will [[result in the restlessness of the small &ldquo;I&rdquo; coming to a standstill. The result will]] be an unending flow of bliss in the cosmos. Let me try to explain the nature of the mutual relationship between the microcosm and universal rhythms with a simple analogy. Suppose a young boy is flying a kite high in the sky. It seems the kite has an apparent link with someone on earth, but that is not the fact. The kite has a link with the spindle in the hands of the boy through a thin thread. The kite flies at a certain altitude according to the sweet will of the boy. The microcosm and universal rhythm also are linked by an invisible spiritual bond in exactly the same way. That&#146;s why it is said that microcosms are only granted &ldquo; dominion status&rdquo;; whereas a complete independence is vested with the universal rhythm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->How can we understand that there is a spiritual link between the unit and universal rhythms. In daily life everyone realizes that if their lives are troubled their dear and near ones will feel great pain, whereas if their lives are filled with joy, their relative will be happy too. Even sometimes we feel a kind of pain in our hearts when we see the pale, sickly faces of those who are not even related to us. Sometimes people even forget their enmity out of deep sympathy for their sworn enemies. Who does not like the spontaneous joy of the innocent faces of children? This is all due to the invisible spiritual link between unit rhythm and universal rhythm. Thus those who are able to connect themselves with the universal rhythm will attain permanent composure. Their existence will acquire a new meaning. This universal rhythm is unfolding itself in innumerable rhythms in the vast bosom of this universe. He wants the living beings also to keep moving in harmony with the universal rhythm. If we call this endless, vibrating rhythm of the Macrocosmic entity Paramra&#x301;sa, then the individual rhythm of the microcosm should be called svarasa. The actual significance of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to merge the individual flow into the Macrocosmic flow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Those who seek to attain the permanent cessation of afflictions in their lives, have no other way than to follow this path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Very often it is found that a certain person is in possession of vast wealth due to his life long&#146;s diligent labour. It may be that the person, in the days of his prosperity, was a central figure in the society. But at the end of his life he may suffered a wretched existence, bemoaning his losses in the arid desert of his heart. The reason is that the person had an insatiable thirst for material objects and never tried to identify his individual flow with the cosmic flow. On the contrary, a person living in a thatched hut did not forget Parama Purus&#x301;a even in the midst of abject poverty and never deviated from the goal of his life. Such a persons life can never lose its charm. Every dust particle of this earth will seem to be as sweet as honey to him. Likewise, his existence will acquire the sweetness of honey.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Idam ma&#x301;nus&#x301;am&#x301; sarves&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; madhvasya ma&#x301;nus&#x301;asya sarvani bhuta&#x301;ni madhu.<br>Aya&#x301;tma&#x301; sarves&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; madhvasya&#x301; a&#x301;tmanah sarvani bhu&#x301;tani madhuh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Liberated souls or jiivanmukta are truly blessed individuals. How is this unification of the unit flow with the cosmic flow possible? It is only possible through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. When sa&#x301;dhakas ideate on the Supreme, their individual flow tries to maintain a parallelism with the universal rhythm. The bridge connecting the unit rhythm with the cosmic rhythm is the incantative rhythm. The individual rhythm vibrated by the incantative rhythm rushes to be united with the universal rhythm. When the unit entity feels the existence of the universal rhythm but fails to attain Him, it feels a psychic affliction. The great poet Rabindranath Tagore has expressed this so beautifully in one of his poems.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The universal life is unfolding itself in so many rhythms, tunes and melodies, in light waves and sound waves, etc. A microcosm which is about to touch Him, but fails to do so, carries the agony of his incapacity. But the wavelength of unit mind will increase by intensive efforts and one day will be one with that universal rhythm and will finally merge in the Macrocosmic wave. This merger is termed &ldquo; self-surrender&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->This universe lies embedded in the macrocosmic flow of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The imperfect microcosms have no instrument to measure this endless cosmic flow. Each and every atom and molecule of this universe, matter, mind, in fact everything, is floating on this Macrocosmic waves. A person whose mind is free from the load of crudity can easily float along the cosmic wave. One who is overloaded with sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras cannot float at all. Buddha in one of his teachings says, &ldquo;Sinca bhikkhu imam&#x301; na&#x301;vam&#x301; miktate lahu messatti&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;O monk, if you want to cross to the other bank, make the boat of your mind light.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Bhakti or devotion is service to Parama Purus&#x301;a. It is love and bliss personified, the very breath of devotee. Now what is meant by devotion?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The word bhakti is defined as bhaj + ktin. Bhakti means &ldquo;to praise with love&rdquo;, &ldquo;to worship someone&rdquo;. Two entities are required &ndash; the one who is eulogized, and the other who eulogizes. Here the two entities are the Lord and the devotee.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ananda Su&#x301;tram defines bhakti as &ldquo;Bhaktirbhagavadbha&#x301;vana&#x301; na stutirna&#x301;rchana&#x301;&rdquo;. Bhakti means ideation on the Supreme, neither eulogy nor ritualistic worship. Stuti is derived as stu+ktin &ndash; which means to praise the one in front. This is nothing but flattery. If a son praises his father in front of him, the father gets angry instead of being pleased. The word archana&#x301; has come from the root verb arc. Archana&#x301; means to worship a deity with flowers and other paraphernalia like vilva leaves, ganga water etc. In this ritualistic worship, how much genuine love is there. The ritualistic worship with paraphernalia is done in the midst of time space and person. The difference between time place and person brings difference in ritualistic paraphernalia. So in external rituals, the spatial and personal difference between the Lord and the devotee is not obliterated. But with cosmic ideation people advance towards Parama Purus&#x301;a a bit by bit. The more the sa&#x301;dhaka comes close to him, the greater will be the degree of devotion. At that time the devotee will realize Parama Purus&#x301;a as his or her own, as the soul of souls and will surrender his or her unit existence in the Macrocosmic flow. If human beings cannot surrender themselves at the altar of Parama Purus&#x301;a they can never attain spiritual progress in life. Without total surrender, Macrocosmic grace is not attained, and without Macrocosmic grace nothing is attained. Besides this there is no other way, (Na&#x301;nyah Pantha&#x301; Vidyateyana&#x301;ya).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Another definition of bhakti or devotion is &ldquo;Sa&#x301; Para&#x301;nuraktiriishvare&rdquo;. The word rakti means colour, attraction. Anura&#x301;ga means attraction for something. The attraction is of two types: 1) attraction for aparabrahma or finite objects and, 2) attraction for Parama Brahma or the Infinite entity. Attraction is the law of nature, repulsion is negative attraction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In creation one object attracts another. The sun as the nucleus of the solar universe attracts the different planets and satellites. Similarly the planet earth is attracting various objects lying on the surface of the earth. Just as honey bees rush towards beehives, greedy for honey, the people of country-sides flock to towns and cities in search for food, clothes and accommodation. It is notice that people rush towards those objects or shelters which are lasting and dependable, which can guarantee greater safety and security. The same psychology prevails behind the human desire to possess properties, name and fame, sons and daughters. But unfortunately although these finite objects and entities provide apparent happiness to people, they ultimately bring sorrow and pain. A billionaire undergoes heart rending grief at the death of his only son. No finite object can ensure permanent happiness or eternal peace to human beings. Only the infinite, imperishable, deathless Brahma can be the Supreme object of ideation. &ldquo;Satyam jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nanantam A&#x301;nandam Brahma&rdquo;. Only the people with all the warmth of their hearts move steadily towards the god of their hearts (just as a person, under the spell of Avidya&#x301; Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, moves towards finite objects can attain Parama Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In philosophical language, this love for the finite is called a&#x301;sakti. The transactional relationship of human beings based on a&#x301;sakti is business and attraction or love for Parama Purus&#x301;a is called devotion. The relationship between the Lord and the devotees is the relationship of service. The devotees want to serve the Lord out of pure love, to please Him, and wish for nothing and return.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->On a deeper analysis, it is found that human beings have nothing to call their own. They may boast about their intellect, intelligence, power and influence but the real owner of these is Parama Purus&#x301;a. By His grace, alone can one utilize or enjoy objects. If Parama Purus&#x301;a so desires. He can snatch away all these possessions from humans, And the humans will be unable to do anything about it. After realizing the Supreme truth intelligent people should endeavour to realize Parama Purus&#x301;a with the power He has given them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->This realization of the Supreme also depends on His grace. In order to merit Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s grace, unit beings will also have to do something. Their duty is to contemplate or ideate on Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Tha&#x301;kur Ra&#x301;makrs&#x301;n&#x301;a used to say, kr means &ldquo;do something&rdquo; and pa&#x301; means &ldquo;get something&rdquo;. It is the birth right of unit beings to attain cosmic grace. Rights and duties are inseparably related. So if one wants to attain cosmic grace, one will have to arouse devotion in one&#146;s heart. The one who feels this devotion is a blessed person. He has nothing else to do. He is sure to realize Brahma with that devotion. The main purpose behind intuitional practice is to arouse and develop devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->A person who wants to realize Brahma and has the required devotion in Him is sure to attain Him. But suppose a person lacks devotion, does not perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, does not understand philosophy, is an ordinary neglected illiterate villager having no social prestige can such a person attain liberation? Can he attain Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The answer is simple: Yes, certainly he can attain Brahma. To attain salvation is the birth right of all individual beings. Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; makes no difference between educated and uneducated, rich and poor, young and old &ndash; no such external difference has any meaning to Him. He is the all-knowing entity. He judges everything by studying the inner sentiments of individuals. Even the most sinful and most virtuous people are equally entitled to salvation in the eyes of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; only considers the inner thoughts and devotional sentiments of people. The intense desire to know Him, the deep urge to attain Him, the intense longing for Him &ndash; these are the qualities which Parama Purus&#x301;a values.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now the question is, How can this latent devotion be aroused? One of the ways is through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and accumulated virtues in previous lives. People of this category are really fortunate, because with that devotion, they will be able to attain Cosmic grace. But suppose one does not possess the accumulated virtue of previous lives &ndash; what will happen? Will one&#146;s latent devotion not be aroused? Will one remain deprived of the Cosmic grace? Through one day&#146;s intense longing for Him can one&#146;s supreme devotion be aroused? Yes that is enough to attain His grace. The life of the bandit Ratna&#x301;kar is a good example of this. The world has witnessed few bandits as cruel as Ratnakar was in his younger days. It is said that in only a few years he took the lives of a few thousand people. But even such a confirmed criminal is not deprived of divine grace. The moment he developed an intense desire to switch over to an honest life, a pure sentient and divine life, discarding his previous criminal ways, he receive Cosmic grace in abundance. This transformation of the ignoble life of the bandit Ratna&#x301;kar to the devotional life of the holy Ratna&#x301;kar took place within a few years only. The life of a bandit Ratna&#x301;kar was worse than that of ordinary men, but because he developed an intense desire to lead a pure spiritual life, he became a noble man. So every person like Ratna&#x301;kar through pious thought, benevolent deed and constant spiritual practice can become extraordinary. Should such a person still be called sinful or dishonest?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Everyone invariably lived an ordinary life or sub-standard life in the past. This is only natural, because although everyone has become from the same source, yet everyone has come through the process of Sain&#x32D;cara and Pratisain&#x32D;cara. Naturally, however black one&#146;s past life might have been one should erase it from one&#146;s mind. Human beings have no control over the past events. They can only build their future by making use of the present. God has put eyes in the front of the person&#146;s head. Hence the sages of the Upanisads say, &ldquo;Caraeveti, caraeveti,&rdquo; &ldquo;Proceed on, proceed on,&rdquo; make proper utilization of the present and build your future. Direct your propensities all your longings towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. Remember that you have none as your own except Parama Purus&#x301;a or Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u.<!-- /block --></p>

To one who will run towards Him with undiverted attention, with deep devotion and pure mind Parama Purus&#x301;a will spontaneously reveal Himself.

<a name="15..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->On the basis of some characteristics, bhakti or devotion is divided into a few categories;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph --><b>1) Nirgun&#x301;a&#x301; Bhakti</b>: Where the sa&#x301;dhaka without any motive runs towards the goal out of his intense love for Him, the psychology is: I do not know why I love my Lord, but I love Him because that gives me joy. I love Him for, I feel that he is the life of my life, the soul of my soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph --><b>2) Vaedhi Bhakti</b>: Where there is no exclusive devotion for the Lord but the sa&#x301;dhaka observes some ostensible vows, sprinkles cow dung and holy ganga-water, decorates the idols with gorgeous apparels and ornaments, offers flowers and bilva leaves, and chants mantras it is called vaedhii bhakti. Whatever might be in this brand of bhakti, there is the lack of expression of simplicity of the devotee&#146;s heart.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><b>3) Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; Bhakti</b>: when a sentient sa&#x301;dhaka does not forget Parama Brahma even after attaining the highest fulfilment, then self-knowledge begins to unfold itself in the devotee&#146;s heart. This category of devotion is called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; bhakti. Although this is a kind of nirgun&#x301;a bhakti, yet it contains a slight vanity of occult power and knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph --><b>4) Kevala&#x301; bhakti</b>: When one is identified with the goal there remains only one entity. This is called kevala&#x301; bhakti. This category of devotion is not attainable by one&#146;s individual effort. One can attain it by the grace of great personalities or Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is the highest stage of devotion. In this devotion the sa&#x301;dhaka remains oblivious of the differences and distinctions. This is called mahimna jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. As long as the sense of differentiation will exist, the sa&#x301;dhaka will hesitate to be one with Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph --><b>6) Ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; Bhakti</b>: When the s&#x301;adhaka will say, &ldquo;I love Him because I feel pleasure by loving Him; I love him because I cannot remain without loving Him&rdquo; &ndash; this is the stage of ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti. The stage prior to the stage of ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti is ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; Bhakti. The difference between the two stages is that in ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; Bhakti, to get pleasure is the main thing but in ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301;, to give pleasure to the Lord is the main thing. In Ananda Marga, there is no place for vaedhii bhakti or jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; bhakti. Here every sa&#x301;dhaka is a follower of ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301;, but they will not stop there. In the process of strengthening their devotion through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one will attain kevala&#x301; bhakti. For the one who has attained the kevala&#x301; bhakti what else is left unattained? While depicting the state the sa&#x301;dhaka attains bhakti. Na&#x301;rada says,<!-- /block --></p>
