<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->It is the Renaissance Universal convention. Our subject today is &ldquo;History and Superstition&rdquo;. Let me tell you at the very outset that the English word &ldquo;history&rdquo; and the Sam&#x301;skrta word itiha&#x301;sa are not synonymous. The chronological record of past events which is called &ldquo;history&rdquo; in English should be called itivrtta, itikatha&#x301;, pura&#x301;vrtta or pura&#x301;katha&#x301; in Sam&#x301;skrta. Itiha&#x301;sa refers to the particular type of itivrtta or history which has great educative value. Itiha&#x301;sa is defined as:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Dharma&#x301;rthakama moksa&#x301; niitiva&#x301;kyasamanvitam<br>Puro&#146;vrttakatha&#x301;yuktamitiha&#x301;sa pracaks&#x301;ate<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The type of history which has the possibility of fulfilling physical longings, psychic longings, psycho-spiritual longings and spiritual longings, and which also imparts great moral education, should be called itiha&#x301;sa.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->From this perspective, the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata can certainly be regarded as itiha&#x301;sa. But I do not subscribe to the views of those who are inclined to treat this great treatise as only an epic or educative story. So, you understand now that the book called The History of India, which is usually taught in schools and colleges, should not be called Bha&#x301;ratvarser Itiha&#x301;sa, rather it should be called Bha&#x301;ratvarser Itikatha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Those books which impart only moral education and have no relation to history are called pura&#x301;n&#x301;as. Books of this type are useless in determining the facts of history. Rather, their exaggerated and imaginary information create confusion in the minds of the readers. For instance, we can cite the case of the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. The Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a has great educative value, yet it is not history or itikatha&#x301;. Rather, it is a puran&#x301;a&#x301;, a myth. All the characters in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a are imaginary. The puspak chariot, the imaginary flying vehicle in the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, may mislead someone to believe that during the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a period the people of India knew how to manufacture planes. By reading such written records of our ancestors, many people today may misunderstand history and be misled into believing that the unreal is real, and thus indulge in superstition. This applies not only to the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a or other famous mythological books. Many stories and books of fiction are being wrongly treated as itiha&#x301;sa, causing the seeds of superstition to penetrate deeply into the minds of contemporary readers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There are many reasons why superstition takes root in the human mind. If we analyse these reasons, they can be divided into several categories &ndash; ignorance regarding history; ignorance regarding science; superstition caused by blind attachment; and superstition which has become habituated. Today we will analyse the superstitions which arise due to ignorance regarding history.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->First, let us discuss casteism. It is an undeniable truth that at the dawn of creation the earth was not inhabited by human beings. In the course of the introversial movement of the cosmic cycle of creation, plants first evolved out of the five fundamental factors, then underdeveloped creatures, and finally human beings. Through the study of history it is known that about 1,000,000 years ago a species of semi-human beings emerged on the earth who were closely related to apes. These semi-humans were the tailless apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, etc.) They were the early ancestors of human beings. After studying the origin of the human race and tracing the earliest human ancestors, every educated person will have to admit that all human beings belong to this semi-human species. No group of people can logically claim that their ancestors are superior to those of others. Every intelligent person will have to admit that the history of human lineage is created by human beings and is not divinely ordained. As human beings originated from apes, all belong to one race. Were the forefathers of brahmins monkey brahmins, and the forefathers of ka&#x301;yasthas monkey ka&#x301;yasthas? Such a ludicrous concept will provide historians with amusing anecdotes. In fact primitive people declared themselves members of the higher castes by verbal jugglery or defeating others in a battle of wits, and today their descendants claim this ancestral lineage. Simultaneously, those who had little intellect were forced to accept positions as members of the lower castes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Many people today speak of the so-called purity of blood. Let us also discuss this point. If by purity, of blood people mean pure Aryan blood only, then I will ask, &ldquo;Was there no racial blending among the non-Aryans and the Aryans who migrated to India from Central Asia and the North Pole?&rdquo; Certainly, racial blending occurred among the Aryarns and non-Aryans. This is the reason why the skin colour of the Aryans was gradually transformed into white, black or yellow as they travelled through different geographical areas on their migration to India. In India we notice black coloured brahmins and white coloured shu&#x301;dras because of this mixture of Aryan and non-Aryan blood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Some people support casteism by referring to books on caste history. Although many of the historical texts of the different castes were written in difficult Sam&#x301;skrta, one fundamental defect is apparent. If the shlokas in these texts are accepted as true, one will be led to believe that one caste was born out of the mouth of the Supreme Entity, another from His anus, another from the middle of His body, and yet another from His feet. Only those who are under the influence of intoxicants will accept such scriptures as authentic! Obviously, no human being can be born from the mouth. Though it is philosophically accepted that the quinquelemental universe was created out of the vast cosmic body, it is foolish to imagine that the Cosmic Entity has a mouth, hands, thighs, legs, etc. In fact this Rg Vedic shloka, which is a mere interpolation, has been used to perpetuate the defective concept of casteism. Moreover, the meaning of this shloka has been distorted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;o&#146;sya mukhama&#x301;siit va&#x301;hura&#x301;janyo&#146;bhavat;<br>Madhya tadasya yadvaeshyah padbhya&#x301;m&#x301; shu&#x301;dra aja&#x301;yata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->[Brahmans came out of the mouth of the Cosmic Entity, ks&#x301;atriyas were born out of the arms, Vaeshyas came out of the trunk of the body, and shu&#x301;dras were born out of the feet.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Actually, here brahmans [intellectuals] means those with a sentient nature and an intellectual disposition. Through allegory it is being suggested that intellectuals symbolize the mouth of the Cosmic Entity. The warriors [[(rajahgun&#x301;ii)]] represent the valiant arms, the capitalists, merchants and traders [[(rajastamagun&#x301;ii)]] represent the middle portion of the cosmic body, and the workers [[(tamogun&#x301;ii)]] symbolize the feet. This is the proper interpretation of the shloka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Numerous contradictions are also easily discernible in caste history. For example, if caste history is strictly followed, one has to accept only ten categories of brahmins &ndash; five from North India and five from South India. As other groups of brahmins do not fall into these ten categories, they will have to be declared as non-brahmins. Besides this, different caste histories make it clear that in ancient times the custom of niyogpratha&#x301; &ndash; that is, fathering a child by a woman other than one&#146;s wife &ndash; was practised extensively, and as a result promiscuity was widespread in society. Moreover, in the Bhuddist Age the rigidity of rastrism decreased, and the intermingling of castes became quite popular. In those regions where orthodox people tried to keep themselves aloof from caste mixing, various castes and sub-castes were formed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Let me tell you an interesting story which will illustrate the contradictory nature of caste history. In the caste history of the Bengal brahmins it is mentioned that King Jayanta Shur brought five sincere brahmins from Ka&#x301;nya Kubha to Bengal. These five brahmins are described as the forefathers of the millions of brahmins of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Barendrabhumi. (Did each of these five men marry a large number of Bengali girls, otherwise how could they have had so many descendants?) It is also stated that five shu&#x301;dras came to Bengal along with the brahmins as their servants and became the ancestors of the ka&#x301;yasthas of Bengal. Now, in the caste history of the ka&#x301;yasthas it is mentioned that King Jayanta Shur brought five warriors to Bengal from Ka&#x301;nya Kubha, and they are the forefathers of the ka&#x301;yasthas of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Barendrabhumi. These ka&#x301;yasthas were all chivalrous warriors, and came on horseback wearing leather shoes. Despite their capacity, they did not know how to cook, so five cooks accompanied them. These cooks became the forefathers of the brahmins of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Barendra. Obviously the question arises, are such caste histories reliable?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->According to the caste history of the ka&#x301;yasthas, Citragupta was the first ancestor of the ka&#x301;yasthas of Bengal. (All the ka&#x301;yasthas except four or five groups accept Citragupta as their first ancestor.) The amusing thing is that Citragupta is only an imaginary character. He is the mythological son of Brahma. It is stated in the caste history that Citragupta had twelve sons &ndash; Ca&#x301;ru, Suca&#x301;ru, Citru, Citraca&#x301;ru, Arun&#x301;a, Yatiindraya, Himava&#x301;na, Matima&#x301;na, Bha&#x301;nu, Vibha&#x301;nu, Vishvabha&#x301;nu and Viiryabha&#x301;nu. The twelve categories of kayasthas &ndash; ambas&#x301;t&#x301;ha, shriivastava, bhattana&#x301;gara, ma&#x301;thura, sakhasena&#x301;, ganda, su&#x301;ryadhvaja, valmiiki, kulashres&#x301;t&#x301;ha, as&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na, nigama and karana &ndash; arose out of these twelve sons. But the interesting thing is this. The ka&#x301;yasthas belonging to these twelve categories had two hands, but their father Citragupta is depicted as having four hands holding thunder, a club, a fountain pen and an ink-pot. Though Citragupta was supposed to be human, he was the record keeper of an invisible kingdom. I leave it to you to decide whether the episode of Citragupta is reliable or not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->There is an unhealthy tendency among some people in society to give credence to baseless stories and mythologies. They do so because they are ignorant of history. I have heard some people say that India was called &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo; after a mythological king, so the mythological king Bharata should not be regarded as false. But the facts of history are otherwise. India was not named after so-called King Bharata. In fact, the term &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo; is much older than the story of King Bharata. People have been misled and confused because of the apparent similarity in the names. Etymologically, bhara means &ldquo;feeding the people&rdquo; and ta means &ldquo;expanding&rdquo;. So Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a means &ldquo;a land which can readily supply food and shelter to its population, and easily facilitate the unhindered psycho-spiritual development of its population.&rdquo; (Vars&#x301;a means &ldquo;land&rdquo;.) Often the nomadic Aryans, who were used to living in an inhospitable environment arrived in the fertile, prosperous land of India, they were so overwhelmed with the abundant wealth, warm climate, lush vegetation and verdant beauty of the country that they called it &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavars&#x301;a&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->It was the practice of the Aryans to name geographical regions or individuals according to their special qualities or characteristics. For example, the Aryans noticed innumerable pebbles and stones the colour of blackberries in the northwestem region of India, so they called it &ldquo;Jambudwipa&rdquo;. The region had two large lakes, so they called this area &ldquo;Dvigarttabhu&#x301;mi&rdquo;. Gartta means &ldquo;lake&rdquo;. As the northern part of India was inhabited by people of the Kash tribe, the area was called &ldquo;Kashmeru&rdquo;. Meru means &ldquo;land&rdquo; or &ldquo;geographical area&rdquo;. Thus, because the Aryans considered that India possessed wonderful qualities and vast resources, they called it &ldquo;Bha&#x301;ratavasya&rdquo;. This name has nothing to do with the mythological king Bharata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->A group of people in India attach much importance to the traditional men&#146;s custom of wearing a pigtail on the back of the head and the sacrificial thread across the body. They believe that a man cannot be considered virtuous unless he follows these two practices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In ancient times when the nomadic Aryans migrated and settled in India, the country was already inhabited by Dravidians and Austrics, so naturally there was racial mixing among the Aryans and non-Aryans. Eventually there was so much social blending that it was impossible to determine who were the torchbearers of Aryan culture and who were not. To distinguish themselves from the masses as the upholders of Aryan culture and Vedic religion, the Aryans started wearing a pigtail. By flaunting a pigtail, the Aryans proclaimed their Aryan identity, despite the fact that tremendous racial mixing had already occurred in India and that the physical complexion of many of those who followed this custom was black. How can there possibly be any relation between these external rituals and the observance of dharma?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Regarding the custom of wearing a sacrificial thread, one need not bother trying to find a connection between an ordinary cotton thread and one&#146;s internal spiritual elevation. The fact is that the Aryans &ndash; the original inhabitants of the nonhern part of Central Asia and Russia &ndash; were very partial to drinking. Even after the Aryans of the Vedic Age came to India, they maintained some of their customs and traditions which can still be found in Russia today. In that undeveloped age of science, the Aryans, like numerous other tribes and races, were basically animists. They considered the various natural forces as expressions of a divine entity, and attributed all their fortune and misfortune to these deities. In order to save themselves from natural calamities, they used to chant hymns, offer their favourite food and burn sacrificial wood to propitiate their gods. This is how the custom of yajin&#x32D;as or sacrifices and the practice of offering ghee, animal flesh and other favourite food items arose among the Aryans. As the colour of clouds and smoke appear similar, the Aryans incorrectly thought that the smoke rising from their sacrificial fires would climb high in the sky, form clouds and bring down rain. The Aryans wrongly thought that the diseases which originated and spread from stinking, filthy places could be counteracted by the scented smoke of sacrificial fires. Goaded by mundane considerations, the undeveloped Aryans engaged in sacrificial rituals in an age of primitive science. Unfortunately, today a group of people still think that unless sacrificial rituals are performed, religious practices remain incomplete.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The five categories of brahmin priests (hotla&#x301;, rtvik, udga&#x301;ta&#x301;, adhvaryu and bra&#x301;hmana) who engaged in sacrificial rituals were supposed to perform their religious duties with perfect calmness and mental serenity. This is how the Aryans expected their priests to conduct themselves. Obviously, the priests would scrupulously avoid drinking alcohol and shun the company of drunkards during a ritual or sacrifice. To keep themselves aloof from drunkards, they used to wear a piece of deer skin across their left shoulder as a distinguishing mark. As this symbol was used during sacrificial rituals, it was called a yajinopaviita. Likewise, when the priests wore the same symbol on the right shoulder during oblations to their departed forefathers, it was called a pra&#x301;ciira&#x301;viita. When they suspended the same symbol around their necks, it was called a niviita. Women were entitled to perform religious sacrifices, therefore it can be presumed they also wore a yajinopaviita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Later on, after deer had become somewhat scarce and the Aryans had become acquainted with cotton, in India, the custom of wearing a deer skin was replaced with the custom of wearing a cotton thread. Subsequently, it became a part of their religious practice to always wear a cotton thread over the left shoulder. Whatever might have been the importance of sacrificial rituals and a sacrificial thread to the ancient Aryans, today in this relatively developed age of science, where people fight against natural calamities through their intellectual power and developed technology and no longer propitiate deities by offering ghee to sacrificial fires, whether or not the custom of wearing a yajinopaviita is useful should be decided by the intelligentsia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Many people become confused and indulge in various superstitions because they do not have a proper understanding of the correct meaning of words. I have often seen people debating over useless, trivial matters such as whether Rama or Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is greater, or Shiva or Narayana is greater. The word Rama is derived from the Sam&#x301;skrta root verb ram. Etymologically, Rama means &ldquo;the entity who is the embodiment of bliss&rdquo; &ndash; that is, Purus&#x301;ottama. Similarly, the word Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is derived from the Sam&#x301;skrta root verb krs&#x301;. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;the entity who attracts the entire universe towards Himself&rdquo;, &ndash; that is, Purus&#x301;ottama. Hence, Rama and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a are only the two names of one and the same Entity. Similarly, the word Shiva means &ldquo;the Supreme Consciousness.&rdquo; Narayana is a combination of two words &ndash; nara and ayana. Nara&#x301; means Prakrti or &ldquo;the Supreme Operative Principle&rdquo; and ayana means &ldquo;shelter&rdquo;. So Narayana means the shelter of the Supreme Operative Principle &ndash; that is, Supreme Consciousness. Thus Shiva and Narayana are merely two names of one and the same Entity. So where is the scope for wrangling over this issue? Moreover, the Persian word khuda&#x301; and the Sam&#x301;skrta word svayambhu (according to some people the Vedic word svayambhu has been transformed into the Persian word khuda&#x301;) are two names of the same Entity, hence is there any scope for debating over whether khuda&#x301; or svayambhu is greater? It is only due to their ignorance of etymology that people engage in unnecessary debates and arguments over the correct meaning of words and divide society. If all human beings are the offspring of the Supreme Entity, how is it possible for only Muslims to be the favourite children of Allah and Hindus of Narayana?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The fact is that all the created objects in this universe are the children of Parama Brahma &ndash; all are His finite manifestations. Nobody is inferior &ndash; nobody is insignificant. All are bound by the ties of fraternity. We will have to move forward, shoulder to shoulder, together with all. No one will benefit if human beings remain confined within the quagmire and filth of ignorance or the foggy atmosphere of superstition. Superstition and a false sense of superiority will only pave the way for the annihilation of the human race.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->While trying to bring about the development and prosperity of individuals and society, we should encourage the common points only among different communities &ndash; not the points of difference. It is natural that there are differences in society concerning dress, customs, cultural expressions, food habits, language, etc. But if these points of difference are given undue importance, social problems will only be aggravated, and as a result the unity and very existence of society will be jeopardized. If nothing is done immediately to check the deterioration of contemporary society, then as a result of different factors, in due course society will automatically evolve some common principles. So the points of difference should never be encouraged in any way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Social and political leaders should refrain from harping on the points of difference in society. Rather, they should continually emphasize that it is not the appropriate time to bring up complicated divisive issues. For example, take the case of Indian languages. There are many people in India who unnecessarily fight over the issue of language, but is now the proper time to raise this issue when there are so many people suffering from hunger, famine, disease, educational backwardness, economic distress, etc.? Can the people of India afford to waste their valuable time over the comparatively unimportant issue of language? On the contrary, they should immediately launch a campaign against exploitation, as this will keep the divisive forces under control. If this is not done, the fissiparous forces will create impediments and dissension in society, and the important burning issues confronting the people will remain unsolved.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Points of Unity<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The progress of a country depends on unity, so emphasis should be placed only on unifying factors. To eliminate fissiparous forces, we will have to fight a relentless war against disunity in the following three spheres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Socio-Economic Sphere<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->While some people are enormously rich, a large percentage of the population is languishing in poverty. Naturally, to build up a strong society, socio-economic disparity must be completely eradicated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->With the eradication of socio-economic disparity, the collective wealth of society will have to be increased progressively. Only then can the growing demands of the population be successfully met. Let us take the example of Orissa. Agricultural production, particularly in the rainy season, depends almost entirely on the monsoons. But if the irrigation system was properly developed, the total agricultural production in the state would increase 300 percent, and an additional 40 million people could be fed. Today only 15 million people are being fed with the present levels of production. Orissa is also rich in mineral resources. Abundant coal, bauxite, manganese and other minerals are readily available in the state, but many of these minerals are being exported to other countries. If these raw materials were properly utilized to manufacture finished goods in the state, Orissa could establish at least four large-scale steel plants. This would substantially increased the purchasing power of the people. Unfortunately, the incompetent political leaders of the country do not think in a rational way. On the contrary, they formulate plans that neither remove socio-economic disparity nor increase collective wealth. These leaders have committed a major blunder by placing the cart before the horse.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In all countries of the world, economically deprived people can be united through a common programme of socio-economic struggle and by fighting against cruel capitalist exploitation on the one hand, and by implementing developmental programmes to enhance the amount of collective wealth on the other. By undertaking extensive irrigation, mining, agriculture and industrial development, the collective wealth of a country can be easily increased.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Self-sufficient socio-economic zones should be established throughout the world to smoothly eliminate social disparity and increase collective wealth. The formation of states on political grounds should be carefully avoided. In one political unit there may be several socio-economic zones which can live unitedly together with their respective problems. For example, the state of Bihar is a political unit but while the Chotanagpur Hills are confronted with the problem of irrigation, the plains of North Bihar are suffering from the problem of drainage. In Royalseema, Srikulam and Telengana areas of Andhra Pradesh are situated in the political unit of Andhra Pradesh, but their socio-economic potentialities are quite different. To derive the maximum benefit from these areas, distinct socio-economic zones should be formed, regardless of whether or not they remain in the same political unit. It is a great mistake to form states on the basis of politics or language. If a capitalist and a labourer speaks the same language, who will think that they are friends because of their linguistic affinity?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The Psycho-Sentimental Sphere<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In the psychic sphere, there are certain factors that serve to unite different linguistic groups of people. For example, all North Indian languages and a few South Indian languages originated and developed from San&#x301;skrta. These languages have been greatly influenced by Sam&#x301;skrta. In such circumstances, the study of Sam&#x301;skrta should not be opposed by anybody. This may appear to be a trivial matter, but if it is encouraged it will be a great unifying factor in Indian society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In social traditions also, some common points may be developed. Research and archaeological excavation on glorious past civilizations and great personalities will help arouse a strong national sentiment. For example, the excavation of the Mahenzodaro and Harappa civilizations highlighted the accomplishments of ancient Indian culture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The study of history should also be encouraged. Itiha&#x301;sa is not synonymous with the Sam&#x301;skrta word itikatha&#x301; which means &ldquo;history&rdquo; and is the chronological record of past events. The word itiha&#x301;sa means that part of history which has great educative value. The study of itiha&#x301;sa or the cultural history of a country arouses a sense of unity amongst the members of society, and they become aware of their impact on cultural legacy. For example, the study of the historical epic Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata creates a sense of pride and inspiration in the minds of the people, and this fosters the spirit of collective unity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The memory of illustrious, saints, and sages also binds people together with common bonds of affinity. When people cherish their past leaders and saints, it creates a strong foundation for collective unity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The Spirituo-Sentimental Sphere<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The sentiments of a common spiritual heritage and a common spiritual goal are the only sentiments which can bind people together permanently. Socio-economic and psycho-sentimental issues are extremely useful for creating social unity and cohesion, but the sentiments arising out of these issues are temporary. Cosmic sentiments are permanent. By inculcating universal sentiments, socio-economic unity and fraternity will be based on a strong fundament. People will think in terms of cosmic paternity and universal fraternity. My firm conviction that we have all come from the same Entity and we will all merge in the same Entity will generate a unique unifying sentiment. All people will feel united by the ties of universal love and friendship, which will ultimately pave the way for a universal society.  The poet Satyendra Dutta, the great universalist, has eloquently expressed this sentiment in the following poem:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;ge anura&#x301;ge nidrita ja&#x301;ge a&#x301;sal ma&#x301;nus&#x301; prakat&#x301; hay<br>Varn&#x301;e varn&#x301;e na&#x301;hika vishes&#x301; nikhil bhuvan Brahmamay!<br>Nivir aekye ya&#x301;y mishe&#146; ya&#x301;y sakal bha&#x301;gya sab hrday<br>Ma&#x301;nus&#x301;e ma&#x301;nus&#x301;e na&#x301;iko prabhed nikhil ma&#x301;nava Brahmamay.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[When love awakens in sleeping souls, then true human beings will emerge.<br>There is no difference between one person, one race, and another, for the entire universe is pervaded by one Infinite Consciousness!<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Wherever there is a common point among people it should be encouraged, while the points of difference have to be discouraged and eliminated.  For fostering unity and enhancing the prosperity of the people, this must be the fundamental approach.  We should always remember:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Jagat jur&#x301;iya&#x301; ek ja&#x301;t a&#x301;che<br>Se ja&#x301;tir na&#x301;m ma&#x301;nus&#x301; ja&#x301;ti<br>Eki prthiviir stanye pa&#x301;lita<br>Eki ravi shashi moder sa&#x301;thii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..21"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->[There is only one race in the entire world,<br>And the name of that race is the human race.<br>We are bound together with the same breast milk of mother Earth,<br>And the same sun and moon are our common companions.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..22"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Points of Difference<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->There are conspicuous variations in four main areas of human society &ndash; food, dress, language and religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Food<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In India there are four distinct food zones where either coconut oil, mustard oil, sesame oil, or vegetable oil or ghee are used. In the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, most people prefer bread, whereas in eastern and southern India, people prefer rice. The food that people eat depends upon geophysical conditions. If all the people of India are made to eat the same food, regardless of their geophysical necessities, it would be a great mistake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Dress<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Similarly, dress and customs also depend upon various geophysical factors. For example, take the case of the Arabs who live in dry deserts. Hot winds and burning sands are their constant companions. Naturally, they are compelled to cover their bodies from head to foot and build their houses underground, otherwise it is next to impossible to survive. On the other hand, the people who live in North Bihar have to be careful that their clothes are not soiled by mud or dirty water caused by the heavy rainfall. Obviously, the 1 dress that people wear in a particular area is largely determined by climatic considerations. It is ludicrous to prescribe uniform dress for people, disregarding environmental conditions. People living in extremely cold countries automatically wear warm clothing, while people living in tropical regions do not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Language<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In every country, languages originate and develop according to racial and cultural factors. Though the origin of languages is fundamentally the same everywhere, languages vary from place to place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Racial characteristics are defined by the nature of the blood and the structure of the nose, eyes, hair and skin. The differences in the formation of these factors account for the variations in racial characteristics. There are four main races in the world &ndash; Aryan, Mongolian, Austric and Negroid. Aryans have red or fair complexions, Mongolians yellow complexions, Austrics dark brown complexions and Negroes black complexions. Austrico-Negroids are called &ldquo;Dravidians&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The Aryans can be divided into three groups. First, the Nordic Aryans have reddish white skin, reddish or golden hair, brown coloured eyes like those of cats, warm blood and parrot-like noses. Secondly, the Alpine Aryans have milky white skin, brackish blue hair, blue eyes, slightly cooler blood than the Nordics and hawk-like noses. Thirdly, the Mediterranean Aryans have fair skin, black hair, black eyes, ordinary noses, cooler blood than the Alpines and are of medium stature. The people living in southern France, Arabian countries and the Balkan states belong to the Mediterranean sub-race.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The Mongolians can be divided into five groups. First, the Nipponese have big faces, flat noses and big bodies. Secondly, the Chinese have flat noses and slanting eyes. Thirdly, the Malays have small bodies and flat noses. Fourthly, The Indo- Burmese have flat noses and comparatively big bodies. Fifthly, the Indo-Tibetans have flat noses and are quite good looking. All the people in these groups have yellowish skin and little hair on their bodies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The Austrics have medium-sized bodies and mud-black coloured skins.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The Negroes have black skin, kinky hair, thick lips, slightly colder blood than the Aryans and are often tall in stature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->There are several racial divisions in India which include the Indo-Tibetans, such as the Ladakhans, Kinnariis, Gar&#x301;hwalis, Nepalese, Sikkimese, Bhutanese, Newaris, Mizos and Garos; the Mediterranean Aryans, such as the Kashmirii Brahmins and those with a reddish or fair complexion; and the Dravadians, such as the Andhra Pradeshiis, Kanatakas, Keralites and Tamil Nadus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->In the pre-historic past the entire North India &ndash; that is, the entire area north of the Vindhya Hills up to Tibet &ndash; was under the sea. The area south of the Vindhyas, the present Arabian Sea, South Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia formed the Gondwana archipelago. The Austrics inhabited the southern portion of Gondwanaland, the Negroes inhabited the southwestern portion and the Austrico-Negroids, the Dravidians of today, inhabited the central portion. The bio-racial structure of different ethnic groups indicates the race to which they belong.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->As a rule, a strong culture exerts a great influence on a weaker culture. When people with different cultural backgrounds live side by side, the language spoken by the people of the stronger culture automatically influences other groups. For example, though there were marked differences between the Aryan and non- Aryan cultures, the Aryan language was so powerful that all the languages of eastern and northern India had to depend mainly on Sam&#x301;skrta. The influence of Sam&#x301;skrta was so widespread that even in southern India it exerted a tremendous influence on the Dravidian languages. The following statistics demonstrate the extent to which the eastern and northern Indian languages were influenced by Vedic Sam&#x301;skrta. In Bengali there are 92% Sam&#x301;skrta words, in Oriya 90%, Maethilii 85%, Tamil 3% and Malayalam 75%. Some people from North India travelled to the western part of Madras by sea and settled there, hence Malayalam is full of Sam&#x301;skrta words, although the verbs are from Tamil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The influence of Aryan culture was prominent on the upper classes of the society, although it had a general influence on the other classes. There are some Austric communities such as the Saha, Dhangrsh, etc. who speak an Austric dialect at home but Bhojpurii outside their family circle. Similarly, the Singhmundas and Sarkars of Ranchi district and the Tinneras of Tripura speak their own dialect at home and Bengali outside. The people of Gar&#x301;hwal and the Kumayun have started speaking Indo-Aryan languages instead of Tibetan and Chinese. The Dravidian languages include Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Tulu. The alphabets of the Tibetan, Chinese and Indo-Chinese languages are the same, although the Chinese and Japanese scripts are pictorial. The inhabitants of Ceylon speak Sinhalese (which contains 87% Sam&#x301;skrta words) and Tamil (13% Sam&#x301;skrta words). Members of the Gunatilak and Bandar Nayak communities of Bengal migrated to Ceylon and became the Sinhalese community. The people of Burma speak several languages &ndash; Burmese, Chin, Kachin, Shun and other important and unimportant languages. Like the Sinhalese, their alphabets are based on the Indo-Aryan alphabet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The Indo-Aryan languages are Marathi, Rajasthani, Gujarati, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Khari, Bali, Vraja, Bundel Khandii, Avadhi, Chattishgarhi, Bhojpurii, Angika, Magahii, Maethilii, Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Gar&#x301;hwali, Kumaynani and Gorkhali. The Austric languages include all the Munda languages, Santal, Kerai and the Mankhamer group of dialects. The Tibeto-Burmese languages include all the languages and dialects of Assam except Assamese, and the Manipuri and Nagar dialects. The Tibeto-Chinese languages include Ladakhi, Bathii, Kinnari, Kirat, Lepcha, Tahru, Newari, Garo, Kashi and Mizo. The Sino-Japanese languages include Mandarin Sinalese, Cantonese, Japanese, Cambodian, Indonesian and the Malaysian languages and dialects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Basically there are four types of script &ndash; Indo-Aryan, Roman, Semitic (alpha, beta, gamma, etc. in Greek correspond to aleph, beth, gimel, etc. in Hewbrew) and Chinese or pictorial script. The oldest script was invented 6,000 years ago and is called &ldquo;Samalha&#x301;ptii&rdquo; script. Kharosthi emerged after 1000 years. Brahmii is written from right to left and Kharosthi from left to right.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Kuthila was used in Allahabad and east Allahabad. In Rajasthan, Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Orissa and Assam Brahmi script was widely used. The old rock inscriptions of Emperor Ashok were written in Kuthfia. Ancient rock inscriptions found at Allahabad, Dacca, Calcutta, Patna, etc., are all written in Kuthila script. Later, the script came to be known as &ldquo;Sri Harsa script&rdquo; after King Harsabardhan who used Kuthila in his rock inscriptions or official seals. The present Bengali script is Sri Harsa script.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; is used in northwestern India while Nar&#x301;a&#x301;da or Nagri script is used in southwestern India. The Nagri script does not use a ma&#x301;tra&#x301; or a line over the letters. When such a line is used, it is called &ldquo;Devanagri script&rdquo;. The Sa&#x301;rasvata Brahmins of Kashmir and the Punjab use Sa&#x301;rada&#x301; script, and the Nagar Brahmins of Gujarat used Nagri script. The present Sri Harsa script is about 1,300 years old and the Nagri script is about 300 years old.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->In ancient India, Vedic Sam&#x301;skrta tried to suppress the Dravidian and Austric languages, just as in Europe Latin tried to destroy all the other European languages. In the Middle East, Arabic tried to destroy all the Persian languages, and in India Sam&#x301;skrta tried to suppress all the Prakrta languages. When Buddha began to propagate his philosophy in Pali, the Sam&#x301;skrta scholars advised him to use Sam&#x301;skrta, but Buddha refused. In Medieval India, Kabir revolted against the use of Sam&#x301;skrta as the medium of expression. He said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..44"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Sam&#x301;skrta ku&#x301;podaka bha&#x301;kha&#x301; bahata&#x301; niira.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..45"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sam&#x301;skrta is like the stagnant water in a well, whereas the people&#146;s languages are like fresh, flowing water.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->In Bengal, Sam&#x301;skrta scholars tried to suppress the Bengali language, but Nawab Hussain Shah extended all kinds of help and encouragement to the development of the Bengali language. Till then, the Ra&#x301;mayan&#x301;a, the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata and the Bha&#x301;gavat Giita&#x301; were written only in Sam&#x301;skrta. Later, the poets Krittivas, Kashiramdas and Malladhar Basu (Guna Raja Khan) translated the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata and the Bha&#x301;gavat Giita&#x301; respectively into Bengali.  The Sam&#x301;skrta scholars began to spread the false rumor that the Nawab Suhen Shah was conspiring to destroy Hinduism because the holy scriptures of the Hindus were being translated into Bengali.  They imposed social restrictions on Krittivas Oja and excommunicated him from the Hindu religion.  This took place about 450 years ago.  Recently, some people in Canada and Wales revolted against the imposition of English because they wanted to use their own language as their medium of expression.  Likewise, Bhojpurii, Maethilii Magahii, Chattishgarhi, Angika, Avadhi, Bundeli, Marawari, Konkoni and many other important Indian languages are being suppressed by different vested interests.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..47"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Religion<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Not everyone follows the same religion, nor is religion a common factor in human society.  Rather, the opposite is the case, and very often it divides human society.  The Arabic word for religion is majhab whereas dharma in the etymological sense means &ldquo;characteristic&rdquo; or &ldquo;property&rdquo;.  In fact, if dharma is understood in the true sense of the term, it is one and indivisible for the entire human race.  Dharma is a psycho-spiritual faculty.  It gradually brings out the latent divine qualities of the human heart, and helps human beings attain oneness with the Supreme Entity.  It has nothing to do with material objects.  On the other hand, religion is a psycho-sentimental factor.  It is a collection of physical and ritualistic observances.  There may be many religions, but dharma is one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Religions always prescribe various ritualistic observances like lighting lamps in a particular way, holding candles in a specified manner, sitting one way or standing another way, counting beads a certain number of times, etc.  Only approved people are supposed to worship particular deities, fixed sacerdotal fees are to be charged, prescribed animals are to be sacrificed to the deities, alters are to be built in a particular way, and so on.  While following such rituals, the mind is engrossed in religious rites and material objects, so how can it move in an ideational flow to a devotional goal? Those who follow a particular religion are supposed to kneel down and stand up a specific number of times, so naturally they are always counting their movements, consequently their minds cannot be withdrawn from physical movements and external activities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->There are some people who vehemently believe that only temples are holy places, and that mosques, churches and synagogues are not. The followers of other religions look upon themselves as the chosen disciples of God, and regard others as heathens or infidels. But how can the bricks, stones, mortar, etc. be holy or unholy? They are only material objects. Most of the masons and carpenters who were employed to build temples belonged to other religions, yet once a temple was constructed, it was declared holy, regardless of who built it. Is this not ludicrous?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Religions are based on external ritualistic observances, so they are preoccupied with physical objects. In the course of time, these physical objects become the objects of ideation. Take the example of cows. Cows are considered sacred by Hindus because they provide milk. Now, if cows are considered sacred for this reason, then what about buffaloes which provide more milk? They should be considered more sacred than cows. The followers of religious dogma do not like to discuss such issues. As a result of ideating on religion, the human mind becomes inert. No amount of discussion or intellectual persuasion can shake that psychic inertia. From childhood, human beings are taught irrational ideas, so when they grow up it is extremely difficult to remove preconceived notions. For example, students conversant with science know that a solar or lunar eclipse is caused by scientific factors and has nothing to do with the mythological demons Ra&#x301;hu and Ketu. But even then, due to their inherent reactive momenta, they go to the Ganges and take a holy bath. Is this not due to ingrained religious beliefs?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->When people&#146;s ideas are so fixed that they will not entertain any discussion or argument it is called &ldquo;fanaticism&rdquo;. It is said that religion is a question of faith, not logic. In India, there are many religious fanatics. Due to religious fanaticism and bigotry, there have been innumerable violent clashes in the past. How repugnant that thousands of people were killed on the pretext of a single strand of hair! These fanatics never bothered to listen to the beliefs of others, and moreover, for them it is a sin to listen to others. In one sense they are worse than animals, because animals do not harbour any communal feeling. Physical sentiments are predominant in such religious expressions. People should keep aloof from the bondages of religion. Behind all religious dogma, physical considerations are dominant. One community considers it a sin to eat beef but not goats or deer. The custom of wearing a vermilion mark on the head and forehead by Indian women is an expression of religious sentiment. The women of other countries do not follow this practice. It does not matter at all if Indian women stop using vermilion. All religions exploit people by appealing to religious sentiments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->There are many people who worship particular scriptures. These scriptures were most likely composed, printed and bound by the followers of other religions. As soon as a book of scripture has been published, Hindus regard it as the goddess Saraswati. There are many people who spend money extravagantly to build idols, then after a day or two, a long procession and a lot of fanfare, the idol is immersed in a river. If a member of another religion accidentally damages any part of the idol, an undesirable incident of unprecedented magnitude may occur.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Fanaticism occurs when physical considerations outweigh rationality. Religious fanaticism occurs when fanaticism centres on a particular religion. A powerful intellectual appeal rather than the application of force is required to bring religious fanatics onto the right path, because force will only create a reaction which will intensify religious fanaticism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Certain practices were not originally religious rituals, but traditions or customs. Long ago the Jews started practising circumcision. When Moses converted some of his contemporaries to Judaism, and later when Mohammed converted some local people to Islam, neither prophet dared to instruct their new followers to discard the old customs they followed, consequently the old customs continued after their conversion. In ancient times, the Austrics used to worship the sun god because they believed that if it was propitiated it would send abundant rays and produce rich harvests; In Austric society, women have a very important role, consequently the role of the priests is not so important. The Austrics believed that the sun was a female god and that the moon was a male god, so they addressed the sun as mother. They introduced Chat Puja, the worship of the sun goddess. In olden times, people used to worship the sun goddess only once a year, but in Magadh it is worshipped twice, during the two major harvests. The tradition of Chat Puja became so strong among the inhabitants of Magadh that despite the enormous influence of the Aryans, Buddhists and Muslims, the custom of Chat Puja continued unchanged. Even today, the Muslims in some areas of Magadh worship the sun goddess. In some places they perform the worship themselves, and in other places they get it done with the Hindus. Similarly, in Bengal the Muslims worship the deities Satya Narayana and Olabibi. These are expressions of traditional beliefs which have been passed down from one generation to another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->The only way to combat religious fanaticism is to strengthen the logical wave. Through the study of science, we know that an eclipse is a physical phenomenon. The deities Ra&#x301;hu and Ketu have nothing to do with it. Although this sort of superstitious belief is no doubt diminishing, there are some people who still worship mythological deities because they believe that the deities can be propitiated to release the sun and the moon from an eclipse. The reason is that the fear psychosis in human beings is stronger than logic. When human rationality is strengthened, irrational ideas will vanish from society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->Many people today advocate the formation of theocratic states (dharmarasta). But when they use the term theocratic states, they mean religious states, not states which uphold the cause of righteousness. We should strive to establish states which uphold righteousness (dharma), and for this the physical sentiments that are the basis of religion should be ignored. People must remain aloof from dogmatic religious ideas. Some people perform religious observances which relate to the moon &ndash; after sighting the moon, they start their religious penance. But what will happen to those who will live on the moon itself. Rational thinking will remove the fear psychosis from the human mind &ndash; rationality will defeat fanaticism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->In India, the Aryans tried to establish the Vedic religion by destroying the Austric religion. In the Buddhist period, particularly during the reign of King Binbisai of Magadh, Buddhism was imposed upon non-Buddhists. Later, the Hindus forcibly converted Buddhists and Jains to Hinduism. During the Muslim period, the Islamic rulers forcibly imposed Islam in India, Iran and Egypt. In false contemporary Egypt is a mixture of Arabian civilization and Islamic religion. Countless Jews were forcibly converted to Christianity. During the British rule of India, the Christians propagated Christianity in a very psychological way, consequently thousands of Hindus became Christians. Before the British came to India, there were hardly any Christians in the country. In the Muslim period, many Hindus were converted to Islam by both psychological pressure and physical force. Besides this, many Hindus embraced Islam because they were disgusted with the defects in Hinduism. At that time, along with severe religious upheaval, there was also extreme social disparity, and as a result many people turned to Islam. Even today, some missionaries are converting people into their respective religions by taking advantage of the peoples educational backwardness, superstition and poverty. The medieval crusades are also burning examples or the suppression of one religion by another.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Gur&#x301;otpanna. Gur&#x301;otpanna means &ldquo;liquor&rdquo; or &ldquo;alcoholic beverages made from fermented molasses.&rdquo; If you walk by some sugar mills in India, you will sometimes smell a particular type of molasses. This type of molasses is used to make liquor in government controlled distilleries. Mrtasainjiivanii sura&#x301; and mrtasainjiivanii sudha&#x301; [varieties of wine which make a sick person well] are also prepared in such factories. In my youth, I observed that these distilleries were often located beside sugar mills in North Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. However, as molasses is valuable as a food, it is undesirable to use it in the preparation of liquor, although it may be used to manufacture alcohol for use in medicines.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Fermented rice gruel can also be used to make a kind of rice wine, although this is less intoxicating than wine or date wine. Besides its use as a liquor, fermented rice gruel has medicinal value. It induces sleep, sometimes aids digestion, and removes physical weakness to some extent in pregnant women. Wine or date wine can sometimes relieve irregular kidney functions. When wine ferments it is transformed into vinegar, loosing its intoxicating power and developing a few sentient qualities. The sediment from the production of wine is called &ldquo;yeast&rdquo; and is particularly useful in the bakery industry. When a pregnant woman is on the verge of death because of labour pains, she may survive if she is administered dra&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301; ris&#x301;ta&#x301;, a kind of wine, mixed with the sugar of gurichi [an Indian variety of maple syrup]. If dra&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301; ris&#x301;ta&#x301; is not available, then mrtasainjiivaniijabaii [a type of wine which makes a sick person well] can be used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Although country rice wine is considered to be the cheapest liquor available in India, liquor made from barley pulp is cheaper. Country rice wine has done tremendous harm to the rural population of Bengal. Many tribals and people from the economically backward classes have become poverty-stricken under the spell of country liquor. It disturbs the peace of their families by causing unnecessary quarrels in the home and eventually brings about their degradation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->State control alone over the preparation and distribution of alcohol is not enough. Strict social controls are also required. In fact, both the state and the society will have to work hard in this regard. The poisonous nicotine in tobacco creates cancerous ulcers in various parts of the body; wine is enormously harmful for the liver, and opium destroys vitality. Intoxicated by opium, people sit idle and doze off. Hemp destroys general intelligence and the faculty of understanding. None of these intoxicants are good for human beings. The use of wine should be restricted in the name of religion or on any other pretext. No one should drink liquor without the permission of a physician, and only then as a medicine. A physician should prescribe liquor only after securing the written approval of another doctor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As a result of taking liquor, twenty percent of the latent potentialities in a student is destroyed. Extreme intoxication leads to inertness. Youths lose their dynamism, and their spiritedness disappears. In such a state, the nerve cells cannot be fully utilized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->I request those who use wine as part of their religious rituals to desist from this practice if there is no recognized alternative. In certain Tantric practices, there is a provision that the water from a dry coconut can be left in a brass pot for some time and used as an alternative to liquor. In such cases, coconut water should be used instead of liquor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->People practise meditation to make their intellect and intuition sharper and to achieve greater expansion. The use of liquor destroys these faculties and is detrimental to the all-round development of human beings. Alcohol destroys the glands, sub-glands, nerves and nerve cells in the human body. If one consumes alcohol, it is partly ejected from the body through perspiration, partly through defecation and partly through urination. Poisonous nicotine from tobacco is ejected in a similar manner after harming the body in various ways. This is why the perspiration, faeces and urine of those who are intoxicated by liquor smell very bad. If a drunkard or a heavy smoker enters a room, one can easily understand that he or she is addicted to intoxicants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->When a person smokes tobacco through a hooka, the tobacco smoke is mixed with the water in the hooka so it is slightly less harmful for the body, but this does not mean that it is harmless. You must have noticed that after a hooka has been used, the water is a balckish yellow colour. Those who smoke bidis [indigenous Indian cigarettes] and cigarettes &ndash; particularly cigarettes &ndash; develop a reddish yellow layer of nicotine on the lining of their lungs, and in many cases the lungs also get carbonated. Lungs which have been damaged by smoking are very vulnerable to cancer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->If someone indulges in chewing tobacco, when the tobacco comes in contact with the tongue it creates an unpleasant sensation, and consequently the person starts spitting repeatedly. This clearly indicates that chewing tobacco is detrimental to health. Dohta and jarda&#x301; used in India with betel leaves are also types of small tobacco leaves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->It is desirable that people keep themselves free from intoxicants and stimulants and move steadily towards the higher realms of physical, mental and spiritual development through all possible ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->As stimulants, tea, coffee, and cocoa are less harmful. Of these three, cocoa has some food value. Tea has little food value. It causes temporary stimulation, decreases the need for sleep and lessens the digestive capacity of the body. Coffee also has the same effects, but as a stimulant it is more powerful than tea. Coffee has slightly more food value than tea. The excessive use of tea is almost poisonous. If tea that has already been used is boiled again, it will have a poisonous effect on the body. The name of the poison contained in tea is &ldquo;tannic acid&rdquo;. In ancient India, ordinary people were not acquainted with tea. Only itinerant monks, who crossed intractable mountains and lived in remote caves, would take tea by extracting the juice from certain leaves.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->A society may be described as the collection of numerous parallel psychic waves which originate due to the psychic tendency of moving together in unison.

<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The main task of revolution is to overcome the barriers of staticity and inertia in the collective psychology of one age and establish the next age in the order of the social cycle. Society moves according to the inexorable laws of the social cycle, yet those who are concerned for the collective welfare will always endeavour to accelerate the speed of social movement by fighting relentlessly against exploitation so that all can move forward together in unison.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->When the psychic balance in social life undergoes a revolutionary change, certain factors remain inseparably associated with that change. Some of those factors are the collective upsurge against exploitation; revolt against the status quo; effective struggle to the benevolent forces against the malevolent forces; and the longing for a new collective psychology among the people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Human civilization has now reached a critical stage of transition. Exploitation of one human being by another has assumed alarming proportions. At critical junctures in the past, when exploitation had reached the zenith point, history witnessed the emergence of mighty personalities who were able to overcome the problems in society. Today also, the guidance of mighty personalities with a comprehensive ideology is required to lead humanity away from the edge of disaster towards a glorious future. The emergence of such personalities is an indispensable necessity of history.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The Social Cycle<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->There are predominantly four types of collective psychology. These psychologies are the shu&#x301;dra, ks&#x301;atriya, vipra and vaeshya. They have nothing to do with casteism and are completely psychological phenomena. Shu&#x301;dras are those who are influenced by materialistic waves; they cannot overpower materialistic waves by their individual psychic waves. Manual power is their only means of social security. Ks&#x301;atriyas bring the materialistic waves under their control through their physico-psychic waves. Vipras do the same thing through their penetrating psychic waves. For the ks&#x301;atriyas, physical strength or valour is the principal means of attaining social security, while the vipras rely on their intellects. A perusal of history illustrates that the vipras, by dint of their intellectual acumen, created a sense of reverence and subordination in the minds of the ks&#x301;atriyas, and were thus able to control their physical strength and prowess. The vaeshya psychology is somewhat different. The vaeshyas do not want to enjoy material objects; rather they get enjoyment at the thought of accumulating them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Primitive society was guided by shu&#x301;dra mentality. Gradually society became compact under the influence of ks&#x301;atriya mentality, and the ks&#x301;atriya era was established in the world. This was an era of heroes and kings. The ks&#x301;atriya age was subsequently replaced by the vipra age &ndash; the age of intellectuals and priests. Next came the age of the vaeshyas. The difference between the former two classes and the vaeshyas is that the vaeshyas seldom come to power directly. They put the ks&#x301;atriyas or vipras in power, and control the society, economy and polity from behind the scenes. Generally, the amount of physical and psychic clash is less during the ks&#x301;atriya and vipra eras compared to the vaeshya era, where poverty, deprivation and exploitation are extreme.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The transition from one age to the next may take place through natural change, evolution or revolution. Natural change or evolution can bring about change from the ks&#x301;atriya era to the vipra era, and from the vipra era to the vaeshya era, but to eliminate vaeshya exploitation, the application of tremendous force is absolutely essential.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->As a result of vaeshya exploitation, those having ks&#x301;atriya or vipra mentalities are transformed into the disgruntled slaves of the vaeshyas. They have no alternative but to toil at the behest of the vaeshyas to fill their bellies. Those ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras who are turned into shu&#x301;dras under circumstantial pressure carry a simmering discontent in their hearts. This group are known as the &ldquo;viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras&rdquo; or the &ldquo;disgruntled workers&rdquo;. These disgruntled workers &ndash; the exploited vipras and ks&#x301;atriyas &ndash; give systematic expression to the frustrations of the masses to end vaeshya exploitation. This is the class with revolutionary distinction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The revolution which terminates the capitalist era requires the united struggle of the disgruntled workers. Shu&#x301;dras can never be the actual revolutionaries because they lack sufficient moral stamina, responsibility and fighting spirit. They are vulnerable to many vices and are not well-established in human values, hence they cannot develop the requisite revolutionary character. The viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras develop into genuine revolutionaries because they acquire the moral courage and discipline to oppose exploitation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The revolution against capitalist exploitation is termed &ldquo;shu&#x301;dra revolution&rdquo;. Although the ks&#x301;atriyas and vipras are turned into viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras due to capitalist exploitation, immediately after shu&#x301;dra revolution, the viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras revert to their ks&#x301;atriya and vipra psychologies. Because of the martial character of shu&#x301;dra revolution, the leadership of society passes into the hands of the ks&#x301;atriyas, hence a new ks&#x301;atriya era emerges. Even during the ks&#x301;atriya era, the vipras try to establish their influence through force of intellect and attempt to move society along the path of vipra psychology. The vipra era is followed by the vaeshya era and then again by shu&#x301;dra revolution. So, the movement of the social cycle and revolution are inseparably related.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The four types of psychology dominate the social cycle in cyclic progression. Towards the end of an era, the collective psychology undergoes marked deterioration. Moral degeneration and social retardation cause psycho-social stagnation. Exploitation becomes rampant. This sort of unhealthy situation signals the end of an era. The different classes try to usurp social power and establish their hegemony by trampling on the rights of others. This conflict has been discernible from the dawn of human civilization. Through this clash and cohesion, human beings try to find the path of emancipation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In the modern world, capitalist exploitation is rampant almost everywhere. Capitalism is now rapidly moving into the final stage of degeneration. In the early part of the capitalist era, society experienced certain advantages, but towards the end, society has become the victim of insatiable rapacity, unbearable hardship and heartless deprivation. Those countries suffering under the weight of capitalist exploitation are rapidly moving towards shu&#x301;dra revolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Types of Revolution<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->According to their form and character, it is generally considered that the types of revolution include palatial change and pyramidical revolution. Palatial change and pyramidical revolution are not revolutions in the true sense because they may or may not result in the change of the collective psychology and the forward movement of the social cycle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->PROUT advocates another type of revolution called &ldquo;nuclear revolution&rdquo;. In nuclear revolution, every aspect of collective life &ndash; social, economic, political, cultural, psychic and spiritual &ndash; is completely transformed. New moral and spiritual values arise in society which provide the impetus for accelerated social progress. The old era is replaced by a new era &ndash; one collective psychology is replaced by another. This type of revolution results in all-round development and social progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Nuclear revolution can only be brought about by sadvipras who reside in the nucleus of the social cycle. Through their concerted effort, moral and spiritual power and all-round endeavour, they mobilize the exploited sections of society to overthrow the ruling class &ndash; the exploiters. This very struggle for mass upheaval liberates society from exploitation and ushers in a new era of peace and prosperity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Sadvipras will control the key points at the nucleus of the social structure. In nuclear revolution, there is minimum loss of life and property, and the transformation of society is accomplished within a very short span of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..29"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Requirements For Nuclear Revolution<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->There are several requirements for the success of nuclear revolution &ndash; the presence of exploitation in any form, revolutionary organization, positive philosophy, revolutionary cadres, infallible leadership and revolutionary strategy. All these requirements are necessary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The presence of exploitation. There are various types of exploitation in society. The form and character of exploitation changes as per changes in time, place and person. In every era of the social cycle, there are various kinds of exploitation. For example, in the economic sphere there is feudal exploitation, colonial exploitation, capitalist exploitation, imperialist exploitation and fascist exploitation. Exploitation may also manifest in such spheres as the physical, psychic, economic, political and cultural spheres. In the past the slave system was prevalent in the Greek and Roman Empires. The rulers sucked the blood of the vanquished to bolster their own interests. In psychic exploitation, the masses are misled with the help of pseudo-philosophies which encourage dogma and narrowmindedness. Democratic socialism and the theory of peaceful coexistence are examples of the hypocrite&#146;s psychology. In economic exploitation, vested interests deprive people of their minimum requirements. Money lending, charging exorbitant interest rates, compelling poor farmers to sell their produce through distress sales, etc., are examples of economic exploitation. Regardless of the type of exploitation used by the exploiters, when society is moving towards revolution, the role of the exploiters is exposed. The exploiters are unable to disguise their exploitation any longer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The existence of exploitation in society can be ascertained through the prevalence of such factors as extreme poverty; social insecurity; injustices against the common people; lack of purchasing capacity to acquire the minimum requirements of life; huge economic and social differences between various classes; the irrational distribution of wealth; etc. The present social, economic and political conditions in India exemplify all these ailments. India is on the verge of revolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Revolutionary organization. Revolution and war are almost the same. Revolution is a type of war. The difference between the two is that in war force is applied on behalf of a person or state, but in revolution, force is applied by a group of people to establish a society free from exploitation. A revolutionary organization is essential for revolutionary war. During the psychic preparation for revolution, the disgruntled sections of society will have to build a revolutionary organization which will create a congenial environment for revolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->A diverse, multifarious organization is required to conduct revolution. The responsibility of the organization is like that of a government. The revolutionary organization must be operational from the highest level of the state down to the village level. Local activists or coordinators are connected to every level of the structure. All the activities of the revolution are directed by the highest body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->If a revolution is started without building a proper structure, or if loopholes are left in the formation of the structure, the results will be disastrous. In the struggle for Indian independence, for example, the revolutionary leaders failed to build a structure down to village level, and the British seized upon this organizational weakness. Such loopholes cause unpardonable losses. This occurred in recent Indian history.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Positive philosophy. The revolutionary organization must follow a positive philosophy. A progressive, comprehensive ideology is the invincible weapon of the revolutionary organization. It counteracts negative ideas in society and generates a powerful, positive psychic flow in the collective psychology. People become revolutionary-minded, yet vested interests determinedly try to resist positive change, hence polarization occurs in the collective psychology. The duty of the revolutionary leaders is to create polarization through the propagation of a positive philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->The philosophy of the revolutionary organization should be free from all kinds of narrow defects and dogma. If there are any defects in the philosophy or if it is not comprehensive, there is the danger that the leadership of society will go out of the control of the revolutionaries. This will be extremely harmful for the progressive development of the society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->In addition, the philosophy must be based on practice, not on theory. If there are any defects in the practical implementation of the philosophy then can be rectified, but if there are fundamental defects in the philosophy itself, the philosophy can never be implemerited, nor can it be rectified.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The theories of Marx and Gandhi are examples of defective philosophies. The fundamental principles of Marxism are unpsychological, irrational and anti-human. Marxists say that revolution is the only solution to capitalist exploitation. This is a positive idea. But the concepts of dialectical materialism, the materialist conception of history, the withering away of the state, proletariat dictatorship, classless society, etc., are defective ideas which can never be implemented. That is why the post-revolutionary stage in every communist country has suffered from turmoil and oppression. There is not a single country in the world which is established according to Marxist ideals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Gandhism is also defective. Instead of guaranteeing liberation from exploitation, it favours the interests of the exploiters, hence it is a negative philosophy. Liberation from exploitation is impossible when the exploiters themselves find shelter in the philosophy. The co-existence of the exploiters and the exploited can never lead to a society free from exploitation. No revolutionary organization can accept Gandhism as an ideal philosophy. If any organization does, then it will no longer be a revolutionary organization, and it will break apart within a short time. This is an historical inevitability. Thus, the revolutionary organization must adopt a positive philosophy which is without defects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Revolutionary cadres. Before the revolutionary organization gives the clarion call for revolution, there must be intensive preparation. In spite of the presence of all the conditions for revolution, revolution may not take place unless the exploited masses are psychologically prepared for revolution. If the people do not support revolution, the clarion call for revolution will not be heeded. Ideologically educated revolutionary workers will have to channelize the psychology of the common mass towards revolution and inspire them to undertake revolutionary strugle! Such workers must adopt a rational approach inspired by the positive philosophy, have a well-developed socio-economico-political consciousness, and be dedicated to uplifting the standard of the common people. The duty of these workers is to inspire the frustrated masses along the path of revolution. Through their dedication and dynamism, they will be able to bring the collective psychology in their favour. The first and foremost duty of the revolutionary organization is to create dedicated workers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Infallible leadership. The success of the revolution depends on the leadership. Loss of life and property will be minimized to the extent to which the leadership is free from defects. Ideal leadership is the wealth of the society as well as of the revolution. It will not only lead to a successful revolution, but will also fulfill the hopes and aspirations of the people in the post-revolutionary phase of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->In many countries a well-knit and prosperous society could not be built in the post-revolutionary phase due to the defective leadership. Concepts such as Plato&#146;s philosopher king, Confucius&#146; sage, Nietzsche&#146;s superman, Marx&#146;s proletariat dictatorship, etc., were prepounded to develop ideal leadership, but all these concepts have failed. There is a vast difference between a theory of leadership and the practical, human qualities of a leader. Due to intelligence, acumen, social awareness, oratory skill and some other qualities, a few leaders were successful in the instigating revolution, but later on they became the objects of slander because they were unable to guide society along the path of real progress. They were unable to solve the pressing problems confronting the people or eradicate exploitation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Sadvipra leadership is the ideal form of leadership. Such leaders will be physically fit, mentally developed and spiritually elevated. With their help and guidance, revolution will be materialized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Revolutionary strategy. The forces opposed revolution possess immense military power. In spite of it, the revolutionaries achieve victory. This victory is due not only to a well-knit organization, progressive ideology and exemplary leadership, but also to revolutionary strategy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Leadership is not imposed from above, rather it establishes itself through dedication, sincerity, ideological zeal, fighting spirit and all-round capacity. Leaders gradually acquire such capabilities &ndash; step by step.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->A common base of integrity and unity amongst the exploited members of society will have to be established. This is essential because at the time of revolution there will be an all-out fight against antisocial activities and corruption. The revolutionaries will have to fight against three forces &ndash; outside exploiters, internal exploiters and other inner evil forces. All these three forces are powerful. Yet the moral, psychic and spiritual strength of the revolutionaries will be the cause of their victory, because physical weapons are not the only source of power. Moral and spiritual power is infinitely stronger than physical force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Although the primary duty of the revolutionaries is to drive out the exploiters, they also have to ensure that these exploiters do not get new opportunities to capture power or undermine society in the future. The greatest achievement of a revolution is to eradicate exploitation and bring about a progressive change in the collective psychology through the minimum loss of life and property.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..49"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->The Role of Sentiments<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Revolution always takes place around a sentiment. If there is no strong common sentiment, a revolution cannot take place. Sentiment is always stronger than logic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Communism propagates sentiments like workers of the world unite. Initially, people were attracted to such sentiments, but after some time they discovered that they were hollow, consequently intellectuals became dissatisfied with them. Communism is now unable to fight against the local sentiments that are coming up in different parts of the world because these sentiments are stronger than communist sentiments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->PROUT is based on a universal sentiment which is applicable for the whole cosmological order, and it is systematically moving towards the implementation of this sentiment. Who will make the local people conscious of their local sentiments keeping universalism in mind? Only PROUT can do this. Communists have no such idea. Only PROUT can tackle all local sentiments and lead everyone in the world to universalism by gradual stages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Revolutionaries must be well-versed in arousing the sentiments of the people and channelizing the sentimental legacy of the society towards universalism. During the preparation for revolution, unstinting effort must go into arousing the sentimental legacy of the people, because sentiments inspire popular support for the cause of revolution, and infuse the revolutionary workers with tremendous power and conviction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->According to PROUT, there are two types of sentiments &ndash; positive sentiments and negative sentiments. Positive sentiments are synthetic in nature. They unite society and elevate humanity, enhance collective interests and encourage progressive development. Negative sentiments are narrow in scope and divide society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Some important positive sentiments include anti-exploitation sentiment, revolutionary sentiment, moral sentiment, cultural sentiment, universal sentiment and spiritual sentiment. Some negative sentiments include communalism, patriotism, nationalism, provincialism, lingualism and racism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->Negative sentiments should never be used to divide people into castes and communities &ndash; to create artificial fissiparous tendencies in society. Rather, they should always be used to bring unity amongst people. Hitler used racism in an effort to unite the German people and he succeeded in the short-term, but because he used negative sentiments only and had no positive sentiments, his approach resulted in a world war and the near destruction of Germany. The path of negativity is extremely dangerous and harmful for society. Positive sentiments are the real weapons to build society. This must never be forgotten under any circumstances.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_title>The Responsibility of Society</div>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The essence of the parallel psychic waves of society is influenced by the resultant median of the following factors: 1) common language; 2) similar manners and customs; 3) similar mode of living; 4) similar traditions; 5) racial similarity; 6) regional similarity; 7) common culture; and 8) common objective or goal. Unfortunately, these factors are generally neglected while structuring society because they are the means through which the collective psychology flows and not the causes of the collective psychology. In fact this very common sentiment &ndash; or the common psychic waves &ndash; forms the essential vital force of a social structure. This is the reason why we say that society is actually the expression of parallel psychic waves, and originates because of the mental tendency of moving together in unison.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is clear that behind society there is the support of the immense collective power of many individuals. This is why the popular conception of society is that of a collection of individuals. But a mere aggregate of numerous individuals whose psychic waves move in different directions &ndash; that is, the psychic waves are not parallel but fragmented and disrupted by dissension &ndash; cannot be called a society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In a family, where each individual gives importance to the comforts and well-being of the other members, however physically or intellectually underdeveloped they may be, we see a society in miniature form. There are many families in the world where each member is concerned for the welfare of the others, despite differences in their physical or intellectual capacity. This is an ideal family. This should also be the ideal form of society, although this is extremely rare today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is the responsibility of society to preserve and utilize the common property of the society in a proper way. Society should utilize this properly to ensure that all may enjoy equal usufructuary rights so that all can live together with a healthy body and a healthy mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Today the world is following either capitalism or extreme materialism &ndash; that is, communism. According to these systems, those who are endowed with greater knowledge, intellect or physical power are continuously misappropriating increasing material wealth. People have forgotten that subtle wealth along with physical wealth is received from the Supreme Operative Faculty. A member of a family who does not feel a sense of unity with the other family members, and does not recognize the logically acceptable truth and lofty principle of joint rights, cannot be regarded as a social being. According to universal spiritual ideology, the system of individual ownership cannot be regarded as absolute. This is why Ananda Marga&#146;s concept of society does not support capitalism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In a joint family every member satisfies his or her longings and needs for food, clothing, medical care and other comforts according to the financial capacity of the family. If a certain member of the family accumulates more food, clothes, books or medicine than what he or she needs, will not the other members of the family face difficulty? In such circumstances, his or her actions will be ultravires to righteousness and society. It is the responsibility of society to demolish such a defective social system immediately.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the present world, capitalists accumulate increasing wealth and possessions for themselves, leaving others to suffer acute pangs of hunger. They force people to wear tattered rags so that they can parade in ostentatious clothing. To increase their own strength, they even suck the vital juice of others. It is the responsibility of society to make these people understand their mistakes by every possible means so that they stop their antisocial activities, because the very aspiration to become rich by exploiting others is a kind of psychic ailment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Capitalists argue, &ldquo;We amass wealth by dint of our intellect and labour. Let others also procure wealth in the same way if they have the intellect or labour. What stops them?&rdquo; These people do not want to realize that the amount of consumable commodities in the world is limited, but the basic necessities are common to all. If one person rolls in affluence, in most cases others will be deprived of even their minimum requirements. The failure to recognize the needs of others is itself a disease. But those who are the victims of this ailment are also our brothers and sisters &ndash; members of one and the same human family. Either by human appeals or circumstantial pressure, these people must be cured of this psychic ailment. In order to achieve this, people&#146;s obsession with material wealth will have to be channelized to mental and spiritual wealth. While satisfying their hunger and thirst everyone should be freely taught scientific processes to fulfil their psychic longings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There should be a social order in which every person will work according to his or her capacity. Those with greater physical capacity will provide physical labour, and those with greater psychic capacity will provide psychic labour. It is the responsibility of society to look after those who cannot render either physical or psychic labour because of their inability.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Society will not grant social rights to only those who have the physical capacity to work. All will have equal rights &ndash; and the rights of one individual will not violate the rights of others. Everybody should be guaranteed the absolute right to make psychic and spiritual progress according to their maximum capacity. There will be no obstructions of any kind. But so that peace and joy can be preserved in society, the individual right to go against the collective interest in the physical sphere will be snatched away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->While structuring society, the spiritual goal deserves the highest priority. Everybody will have to realize this. Even with psychic expansion, human beings become self-centred in the absence of a spiritual goal, and group sentiments grow in people&#146;s minds. Such people cultivate mundane knowledge but not spirituality. Spirituality means that people start contemplating such queries as, &ldquo;Who am I? What is my goal? How can I reach my goal? etc.&rdquo; Today&#146;s intellectuals have become impediments to the cause of spreading spirituality because they are deficient in morality and their psychic waves go against the collective interest. Consequently, immorality, corruption and dishonesty are rampant in society. A strong and healthy society will stop this trend.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The study of history makes it clear that a strong and healthy society has not yet evolved on this planet. This was mainly due to the inadequate propagation of a comprehensive spiritual ideology. Although a few people thought to establish a strong and healthy society, they adopted argument and debate instead of deliberation and reason to convince the people of the need for such a society, and ultimately ended up projecting themselves instead of the ideology. Thus, the ideology became secondary and was ultimately swept away because people started worshipping them as Mahatmas and Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;as. This was why, in the absence of an ideology, a strong society could not be established, and many defects crept into individual and collective life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was the first to attempt to build a strong and healthy society, but due to the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata war, much of His time was lost. As He did not find enough time to build a society, a human society could not come into existence. Similarly, Lord Sada&#x301;shiva, the original provider of Tantra, had to devote much of His time to building a strong foundation for spirituality, and despite His immense desire, He could not build a strong social order. Today, the combined power of both will help in building a healthy human society.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Each and every individual possesses two types of invaluable and extraordinary potentialities &ndash; psychic and spiritual. The dictates of the collective body cannot command these two potentialities &ndash; its jurisdiction is limited to physical wealth only. In the physical sphere, if individuals do not violate collective interests, both the society and the individual will enjoy a state of ease and comfort. For this reason, the individual right to go against collective interests has been snatched away. But in the psychic and spiritual spheres, each individual has full scope to advance and progress. From this perspective, Marxism is irrational, unnatural and unscientific. Even if the mundane wealth of the universe is properly distributed, people will not be satisfied. A cry will ring out from the depths of their hearts, &ldquo;I long for more. I long for more.&rdquo; This is because the longings of the human mind are limitless. These unlimited longings can only be satisfied when one enters the arena of the infinite. It is not possible to satisfy infinite longings through the physical world, because although the amount of physical wealth is very vast, it is not infinite. This is why wise people channelize their unfulfilled infinite longings towards the psychic and spiritual spheres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In Gandhism, we find two defects &ndash; psychological and material. Although Gandhism is not pure capitalism, it is undoubtedly a way to protect capitalism. Capitalists find complete shelter in this system. Gandhism claims that the capitalists are the trustees of human beings, but how can that be possible? Can those who thrive on human blood be the protectors of human beings? How can the exploited masses believe that the exploiters will be their saviours? Hence, Gandhism is ultravires to psychology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Secondly, Gandhism always tries to avoid fights and all sorts of struggle, including class struggle. According to Marxism, there are two main classes &ndash; the exploiters and the exploited. Gandhism does not recognize this sort of division. The fact is that out of the four classes in society &ndash; the shu&#x301;dras, ks&#x301;atriyas, vipras, and vaeshyas &ndash; the dominant or ruling class exploits the other classes according to its capacity. While the period of exploitation may be short or long depending upon the inherent strength or vitality of the ruling class, the order of mundane advancement follows this pattern. According to Gandhism, it is possible to transform the exploiters through persuasion. Theoretically, this view may be acceptable, but it is neither natural nor practical. If a goat tries to persuade a tiger, won&#146;t the tiger eat the goat? Struggle is natural and indispensable. According to Tantra also, progress lies in struggle. The denial of struggle is the material defect of Gandhism. THat is why the world will never accept Gandhism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->According to Ananda Marga, if persuasion fails, then the application of force is indispensable. We can conclude that the golden rule is: &ldquo;Protect the virtuous; punish the wicked.&rdquo; Humanity can be secured only if this principle is followed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Only those who are the aspirants of Supreme Consciousness and free from selfishness are the dependable trustees of society. Only those who are established in Yama and Niyama and have accepted the Supreme Entity as the goal of their life are capable of safeguarding the interests of human race. Such people alone are sadvipras and only they can represent humanity &ndash; they alone can serve all creation selflessly. Sadvipras will be identified by their conduct their commitment to service, their dutifulness and their strength of character. Only these sadvipras will firmly proclaim, &ldquo;All human beings belong to one race! All have equal rights! All are members of the same human family!&rdquo; Only these sadvipras can warn the exploiters with a thunderous voice: &ldquo;No exploitation of one human being by another! No exploitation in the name of religion!&rdquo; Such sadvipras will become the trustees of society. Sadvipras will never stop the ongoing class struggle which manifests according to the laws of the social cycle. They will only ensure that the rulers do not exploit society, thus they will rule the rulers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The propounder of Gandhism was a man of humble temperament, so he did not like conflict, but this is unnatural and impractical. A principle can only be accepted if it is practical. Practicality does not come from mere idealism.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_title>Decentralized Economy &ndash; 1</div>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The most important economic issue before the leaders of all the countries in the world today is how to increase the standard of living of their citizens through the economic prosperity of the state. This is a burning question, especially in those countries which are economically backward. The matter is not very simple because in many countries people are still directly dependent on nature for their subsistence. Only in a few countries have people been able to utilize their knowledge and wisdom to solve their economic problems.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Most countries in the world &ndash; whether capitalist or communist &ndash; have adopted the policy of economic centralization.  While the economies of the capitalist countries are centralized in the hands of a few capitalists or a few capitalist institutions, the economies of the communist countries are centralized in the hands of the party. After so many years of economic centralization, how successful have these countries been in improving the standard of living of the people? To assess this, the main issue is whether or not economic exploitation has been eradicated and the common people have been guaranteed ever increasing purchasing capacity. The fact is that in a centralized economy there is no possibility that economic exploitation can ever be eradicated or that the economic problems of the common people can ever be permanently solved.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->As far as India is concerned, the common people have been led astray time and again by vested interests. Innumerable promises have been made by political leaders, but they have proved to be nothing more than cruel hoaxes. The policy of economic centralization stands exposed as merely a strategy to accumulate increasing capital in the hands of the capitalists. On the one hand the incredulous masses are kept in good humour by promising them something negligible, and on the other hand the capitalists go on amassing enormous wealth. If we examine why this is happening, we will find that the cause is clearly evident. All the economic policies in the country are formulated by a handful of people who are pillars of capitalism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is only one way to stop economic exploitation and alleviate the plight of the common people, and that is to implement a policy of decentralized economy in all the sectors of the economy. Successful planning can never be done by sitting in an air conditioned office thousands of miles away from the place where planning is to be undertaken. Centralized economy can never solve the economic problems of remote villages. Economic planning must start from the lowest level, where the experience, expertise and knowledge of the local people can be harnessed for the benefit of all the members of a socio-economic unit. All types of economic problems can be solved only when economic structures are built on the basis of decentralized economy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The basic question is how to remove the unhealthy influence of centralized economy. The real issue is, who will bell the cat? If the vested interests fail to be guided by righteous intellect, then people will have to take matters into their own hands. They will have to create circumstantial pressure from all sides, uniting around the slogan: &ldquo;Abolish centralized economy to end exploitation; establish decentralized economy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Decentralized economy is the only way that people can attain all-round welfare because it will not only guarantee economic prosperity, but also pave the way for individual and collective psycho-spiritual progress. Once people&#146;s mundane problems have been solved, they will have greater opportunities to develop their potentialities in the psychic and spiritual spheres. With the establishment of decentralized economy, economic and psycho-economic exploitation will be eradicated, the gap between the rich and poor will be minimized and individual and collective welfare will be greatly enhanced. This in turn will create greater opportunities for the psychic and spiritual progress of all members of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Principles of Decentralized Economy<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The first principle of decentralized economy is that all the resources in a socio-economic unit should be controlled by the local people. In particular, the resources which are required to produce the minimum requirements must be in local hands, and all the industries based on these resources will have to be controlled entirely by the local people. Local raw materials must be fully utilized to produce all kinds of commodities necessary for the economic development of a socio-economic unit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Local people are those who have merged their individual socio-economic interests with the socio-economic interests of the socio-economic unit they live in. Clearly, this concept of local people has nothing to do with physical complexion, race, caste, creed, language or birth place. The fundamental issue is whether or not each person or family has identified their individual socio-economic interests with the collective interests of the concerned socio-economic unit. Those who have not done so should be branded as outsiders.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->No outsider should be allowed to interfere in local economic affairs or in the system of production and distribution, otherwise a floating population will develop, causing the outflow of economic wealth from the local area. If this occurs the area will become vulnerable to outside economic exploitation and decentralized economy will be undermined.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The surplus wealth, after meeting the minimum requirements of the people in the local area, should be distributed among the meritorious people according to the degree of their merit. For example, doctors, engineers, scientists and other capable people engaged in various activities require extra amenities so that they can perform greater service to society. While a common person may require a bicycle, a doctor may require a car. But there must also be provision in the economy for reducing the gap between the minimum requirements of all and the amenities of meritorious people. To increase the standard of living of common people, they may be provided with scooters instead of bicycles. Although there is some difference between a scooter and a car, the gap that existed between a car and a bicycle has been partially reduced. The economic gap between common people and meritorious people should be reduced as much as possible, and ceaseless efforts must be made in this regard, but this gap will never vanish altogether. If the gap increases, the common people will be deprived and exploitation will re-emerge in society in the guise of amenities. Decentralized economy leaves no such loophole because on the one hand the standard of the minimum requirements must be increased, and on the other hand the provision of amenities will be assessed from the viewpoint of the collective welfare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The second principle of decentralized economy is that production should be based on consumption, not profit. Most countries in the world have adopted economic systems which are profit oriented &ndash; that is, production is undertaken for profit. Producers give first preference to those items which bring maximum profit, so everywhere there is keen competition regarding the production of the most profitable goods. India is no exception. To increase the standard of living of the people, a new system of production will have to be introduced. Consumption, not profit, should be the underlying motive in the field of production.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In a decentralized economy the commodities produced by a socio-economic unit will be sold in the local market itself.  As a result, there will be no uncertainty in the local economy or the economic life of the local population. In addition, money will be circulated within the local market so there will be no outflow of local capital. The possibility of an economic catastrophe in the local economy will be largely eliminated. In such a system, people&#146;s income will have an upward trend and their purchasing capacity will continuously increase. No economic system in the world has been able to continuously increase the purchasing capacity of the people, because economic power is concentrated in the hands of a few.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The third principle of decentralized economy is that production and distribution should be organized through cooperatives. One of the principal reasons for the past failure of the cooperative movement is economic centralization. It is extremely difficult for cooperatives to succeed in an economic environment of exploitation, corruption and materialism, so people cannot accept the cooperative system wholeheartedly. Cooperatives are forced to compete with the monopoly capitalists for local markets, and the rights of the local people over their raw materials are not recognized. Such circumstances have undermined the success of the cooperative movement in many countries of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->On the other hand, decentralized economy is one of the principal reasons for the success of the cooperative system. The availability of local raw materials will guarantee constant supplies to cooperative enterprises, and cooperatively produced goods can be easily sold in the local market. Economic certainty will create increasing interest and involvement among the cooperative members, and as the local people will be confident of their economic security, they can wholeheartedly accept the cooperative system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->As far as possible, agriculture, industry and trade should be managed through cooperatives. In these sectors of the economy private ownership should be abolished in stages. Only where production cannot be undertaken by cooperatives because of the complex nature or small scale of operations should it be undertaken by private enterprises. The distribution of commodities should be done through consumers cooperatives. Adequate safeguards for cooperatives will also have to be arranged.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The cooperative system is a must, and it is only possible through decentralized economy. The cooperative system and decentralized economy are inseparable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The fourth principle of decentralized economy is that the local people must be employed in local economic enterprises. Unless the local people are fully employed in the local economy, unemployment can never be solved. Local people should determine the quantum of minimum requirements and the basic policies connected with their own economic well-being. If this principle is followed the problem of outside interference in the local economy will not arise at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Cooperatives will provide employment for local people, and also ensure that the skills and expertise of the local people are fully utilized. Educated people should also be employed in cooperatives so that they do not leave the local area in search of employment or move from the countryside to the cities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->For the development of agriculture there is a great need for specialists and technicians, so cooperatives will have to train unskilled rural people so that they can acquire the necessary skills to develop the agricultural sector. In addition, all types of agro-industries and agrico-industries will have to be developed according to the needs and resources of the local area, and these industries should be managed as cooperatives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The fifth principle of decentralized economy is that commodities which are not locally produced should be removed from the local markets. As decentralized economy aims to develop local industries and create employment for the local population, those commodities which are not produced within the local area should be banished from the local market as far as possible. It is essential that the local population utilize the commodities produced in their own area to ensure the prosperity of the local economy.  Initially, local commodities may be inferior, more costly or less readily available than outside commodities, yet in spite of this, locally produced commodities should still be used by the local people. If local commodities do not meet the needs and aspirations of the people, immediate steps must be taken to increase the quality, reduce the price and increase the supply of local goods, otherwise illegal imports will be encouraged.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In a decentralized economy, the application of this principle is very important. If it is neglected, the local industries will gradually close down, local markets will go out of the hands of the local people and unemployment will increase.  Once locally produced goods are accepted in principle, not only will local industries survive, but with their further development the local economy will thrive.  The outflow of capital from the local area will be checked, and because it will remain in the local area, it will be utilized to increase production and enhance the prosperity of the  local people. With the increasing demand for local commodities, large-scale, medium-scale and small-scale industries will all flourish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..23"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Economic Transformation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The agricultural, industrial and trade policies of a socio-economic unit will have to be formulated according to the principles of decentralized economy. The maximum utilization and rational distribution of local resources and potentialities to ensure full employment should be given priority, keeping in view that there should be uniform economic development in all regions of a socio-economic unit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The members of the cooperatives should decide the policies concerning such things as agricultural production, price fixation and the sale of agricultural commodities. Local people should not only control cooperative bodies, but supervise all activities related to the local economy. The local administration will have to assist the economic development of cooperatives. The price of agricultural commodities should be fixed on a rational basis by taking into account the price of commodities; the cost of labour, raw materials, transportation and storage; depreciation; sinking funds; etc. In addition, this price should include a rational profit of not more than fifteen percent of the cost of production. In a decentralized economy agriculture will have the same status as industry.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The industrial system must also be reorganized according to the principles of decentralized economy. If a certain part of a country is over-industrialized, it will impede the economic progress of other regions. Economic decentralization will not allow such a situation to arise. In a decentralized economy, key industries, medium-scale industries and small-scale industries will be managed by different groups of people. In a centralized economy &ndash; whether capitalist or communist &ndash; these industries are usually managed as either private companies or state enterprises. Most key industries should be managed by the local government but they should be guided by the principle of &ldquo;no profit, no loss&rdquo;. Most medium-scale industries should be managed as cooperatives, but they should not be guided by monopoly production and profit. The cooperative sector will be the main sector of the economy. Cooperatives are the best means to organize local people independently, guarantee their livelihood and enable them to control their economic welfare. Most small-scale and cottage industries will be in the hands of individual owners. Small-scale industries should be confined mainly to the production of non-essential commodities such as luxury items. Though privately owned, they must maintain adjustment with the cooperative sector to ensure a balanced economy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->A rural economy should not depend solely on cottage industries, otherwise the economic welfare of the rural population will be jeopardized. If cottage industries are properly organized, rural women will also get ample scope to earn a decent livelihood. Cooperatives and the local administration will have to take the responsibility of supplying cottage industries with raw materials so that they do not suffer from scarcity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The local administration will also have to arrange for the supply of sufficient power to facilitate industrial production. Every region in a socio-economic unit must strive to be self-sufficient in power generation. The local administration will have to supply locally generated power such as solar energy, thermal energy, bio-gas, hydroelectricity, nuclear energy, pneumatic energy, electromagnetic energy and tidal power, or any other power which is easily available locally. The generation of power is a key industry which should be run on a no profit, no loss basis so that the cost of production is minimized and the purchasing capacity of the people is increased. For example, if batteries are produced through cottage industries, power should be supplied on a no profit, no loss basis, but the battery producers will be able to sell their batteries at a rational profit. Here the power that is used to manufacture the batteries is not an industrial commodity but a raw material. The power for such things as transportation, communication, schools, colleges and hospitals should also be supplied on a no profit, no loss basis to maintain social dynamism. The immediate government or the state government will have to take the responsibility to supply power as a key industry.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->All kinds of industrial activities from key industries to cottage industries should be organized with the cooperation of the local population. Care should also be taken so that private enterprises are set up by the local people. Local people must be given preference in employment, and all local people should be locally employed. If this policy is followed, there will be no surplus or deficit labour among the local people, and if many people do come from outside areas, they will not find a place in the local economy. Where a floating population exists in a particular region, the outflow of capital remains unchecked and the economic development of the area is undermined.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Trade in a decentralized economy should be organized by distributing commodities through consumers cooperatives. There will be no income tax, but there should be a tax levied on the production of each commodity. Commodities should be exported from one region or socio-economic unit to other regions or units through cooperatives.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->In the decentralized economy of PROUT, exporting local raw materials is not supported. Only finished goods should be exported under certain circumstances. After all the requirements of the local people in a socio-economic unit have been met, the surplus goods may be exported, but only to a socio-economic unit which has no immediate opportunity or potential to produce them, in order to meet the requirements of the people in that unit. And even then, the whole transaction of importation and exportation should be undertaken directly by cooperatives, and the exportation of commodities must not be motivated by profit. If there are insufficient raw materials in any socio-economic unit to meet the minimum requirements of the local people, the necessary raw materials may be imported from another socio-economic unit providing it can be carefully verified that the raw materials in the latter unit are surplus. Free trade should be encouraged once self-sufficiency is attained, as this will help facilitate increased prosperity and encourage economic parity among socio-economic units, and lead to the formation of larger socio-economic units.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Another important characteristic of decentralized economy is that money will always remain in circulation, hence the economy will move with accelerating speed. The value of money depends on the extent of its circulation. The more frequently money changes hands, the greater its economic value. The greater the value of money, the greater the prosperity in individual and collective life, and the greater the opportunities for all-round welfare.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->There is a close relationship between the economic prosperity of people and their psychic and cultural development.  Improvements in individual and collective life will lead to the all-round welfare of people. If local people do not develop a sense of self-confidence in their economic activities, then they become mentally weak, and this inherent weakness becomes an impediment to their economic well-being. Such a community will become an easy victim of economic, political and psycho-economic exploitation by vested interests.  This unhealthy situation must be firmly resisted. Thus, the local language is to be used in all local dealings and transactions. That is, the local language should be used in the administration, the education system, the economy, and in cultural activities. All official and non-official bodies and offices of a particular socio-economic unit should use the local language as the medium of communication.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The overall well-being of society is the ultimate goal of decentralized economy. This is a comprehensive ideal and should be established in each and every socio-economic unit. It will bring about economic prosperity as well as ensure greater opportunities for the psycho-spiritual elevation of all members of society.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Nearly all the countries of the world today have come under some sort of democratic structure. Liberal democracy has been established in such countries as the USA, Great Britain, France and Canada, while in the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam and Eastern Europe socialist democracy is the dominant system. The plight of the people in liberal democratic (so-called democratic) countries is not as miserable as it is in communist countries, because in communist countries the political and economic system is imposed on society by party officials, causing untold human suffering and severe psycho-economic exploitation. Both liberal democracy and socialist democracy may be considered forms of political democracy because these systems are based on economic and political centralization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Political Democracy<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In all countries where democracy is in vogue today, people have been deceived into believing that there is no better system than political democracy. Political democracy has no doubt granted voting rights, but it has snatched away the right of economic equality. Consequently, there is gross economic disparity between the rich and the poor, immense inequality in people&#146;s purchasing capacity, unemployment, chronic food shortages, poverty and insecurity in society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The type of democracy prevalent in India is also political democracy, and it has proved to be a unique system of exploitation. The Indian constitution was created by three groups of exploiters: the British imperialists, the Indian imperialists and the ruling parties representing the Indian capitalists. All the provisions of the Indian constitution were framed keeping an eye on furthering the interests of these opportunists. Just to hoodwink the masses, the people were granted the right of universal suffrage. Millions of Indians are poor, superstitious and illiterate, yet the exploiters, through such practices as making false promises, intimidation, gross abuse of administrative power and vote rigging, repeatedly win over the electorate. This is the farce of democracy. Once they form the government, they get ample opportunity to indulge in rampant corruption and political tyranny for five years. In the subsequent elections &ndash; whether on the provincial or state level &ndash; the same absurdity is repeated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->This type of political opportunism has been going on in India since independence. For the last thirty-five years, the political parties have maintained that in order to attain economic parity with the industrially developed countries of Europe, India must follow the democratic system. To support this argument, they cite the examples of America and Great Britain or China and the Soviet Union. The political leaders urge the electorate to vote in their favour at election time so that the country&#146;s starving masses can reap the benefits of a developed economy. But once the elections are over, the exploitation of the common people continues unabated in the garb of political democracy, and other areas of social life are completely neglected. Today millions of Indian citizens are being deprived of the minimum requirements of life and are struggling to procure adequate food, clothing, housing, education and medical treatment, while a handful of people are rolling in enormous wealth and luxury.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->One of the most obvious defects of democracy is that voting is based upon universal suffrage. That is, the right to cast a vote depends on age. Once people reach a certain age, it is assumed that they have the requisite capacity to weigh the pros and cons of the issues in an election and select the best candidate. But there are many people above the voting age who have little or no interest in elections and are not conversant with social or economic issues. In many cases, they vote for the party rather than the candidate, and are swayed by election propaganda or the false promises of politicians. Those who have not reached the voting age are often more capable of selecting the best candidate than those who are entitled to vote. So age should not be the yardstick for voting rights.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Whether or not a candidate gets elected usually depends upon party affiliation, political patronage and election expenditure. In some cases it also depends on antisocial practices. Throughout the world, money plays a dominant role in the electoral process, and in nearly all cases, only those who are rich and powerful can hope to secure elected office. In those countries where voting is not compulsory, often only a small percentage of the population participates in the electoral process.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The prerequisites for the success of democracy are morality, education and socio-economico-political consciousness. Leaders especially must be people of high moral character, otherwise the welfare of society will be jeopardized. But today in most democracies, people of dubious character and those with vested interests are elected to power. Even bandits and murderers stand for election and form the government.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In almost all the countries of the world, the masses lack political consciousness. Cunning, erudite politicians take advantage of this shortcoming to confuse people and attain power. They resort to immoral practices such as bribery, vote rigging, booth capturing and buying of votes, and stand unopposed for elections. Consequently, the standard of morality in society is declining, and honest, competent people are relegated to the background. Moral leaders have less chance to win elections because election results are rigged through financial inducements, intimidation and brute force. In the present democratic system, all sorts of immoral and corrupt practices are given the opportunity to pervert society. The very nature of the present system is that it favours the capitalists and exposes the administration to immoral and corrupt forces.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The farce of democracy has been likened to a puppet show where a handful of power hungry politicians pull the strings from behind the scene. In liberal democracies, capitalists manipulate the mass media such as the radio, television and newspapers, while in socialist democracies the bureaucrats lead the country to the brink of destruction. In both forms of democracy, there is little scope for honest, competent leaders to emerge in society, and virtually no possibility for the economic liberation of the people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Political democracy has become a great hoax for the people of the world. It promises the advent of an era of peace, prosperity and equality, but in reality it creates criminals, encourages exploitation and throws common people into an abyss of sorrow and suffering.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The days of political democracy are numbered. PROUT demands economic democracy, not political democracy. To make democracy successful, economic power must be vested in the hands of the common people and the minimum requirements of life must be guaranteed to all. This is the only way to ensure the economic liberation of the people. PROUT&#146;S slogan is: &ldquo;To end exploitation we demand economic democracy, not political democracy.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Economic Decentralization<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In economic democracy, economic and political power are bifurcated. That is, PROUT advocates political centralization and economic decentralization. Political power is vested with the moralists, but economic power is vested with the local people. The principal goal of the administration is to remove all the impediments and obstacles which prevent the economic needs of the people being met. The universal aim of economic democracy is to guarantee the minimum requirements of life to all members of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Nature has been kind enough to provide abundant natural resources to every region of this earth, but she has not given guidelines on how to distribute these resources among the members of society. This duty has been left to the discretion and intelligence of human beings. Those who are guided by dishonesty, selfishness and mean-mindedness misappropriate these resources and utilize them for their individual or group interests rather than for the welfare of the whole society. Mundane resources are limited but human longings are limitless. Hence, for all the members of society to live in peace and prosperity, human beings have to adopt a system which ensures the maximum utilization and rational distribution of all resources. To achieve this, human beings will have to establish themselves in morality and then create a congenial environment for morality to flourish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Economic decentralization means production for consumption, not production for profit. Economic decentralization is not possible under capitalism, because capitalist production always tries to maximize profit. Capitalists invariably produce at the lowest costs and sell at the highest profits. They prefer centralized production, which leads to regional economic disparity and imbalances in the distribution of the population. In the decentralized economy of PROUT on the other hand, production is for consumption, and the minimum requirements of life will be guaranteed to all. All regions will get ample scope to develop their economic potentiality, so the problems of a floating population or overcrowding in urban centres will not be allowed to arise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Unless a country attains optimum development in industry and other sectors of the economy, it is impossible for it to be highly developed. If more than thirty to forty-five percent of a country&#146;s population is engaged in agriculture, there will be excessive pressure on the land. Such a country cannot become highly developed, nor can there be balanced, decentralized development in all sectors of the economy. India is a classic example of this. About seventy-five percent of India&#146;s population is dependent on agriculture for its livelihood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->In some democratic countries such as Canada and Australia a large percentage of the population is engaged in agriculture, and although these countries are regarded as agriculturally developed, they depend on industrially developed countries because they themselves are industrially undeveloped. For instance, Canada has traditionally been dependent on the USA, and Australia on Britain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->As far as India is concerned, as long as around seventy-five percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, the unbearable economic plight of the people will continue. Any country confronted with such circumstances will find it very difficult to meet its domestic and international responsibilities. The purchasing capacity of the people will keep decreasing, while economic disparity will go on increasing. The social, economic and political environment of the whole country will degenerate. India is a clear example of all these evils.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->So, economic decentralization does not mean that the majority of the population will be dependent on agriculture for their livelihood or that the other sectors of the economy will remain undeveloped. Rather, each sector of the economy must strive for maximum development, and all sectors must strive for maximum decentralization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->In all the democratic counties of the world, economic power is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and groups. In liberal democracies economic power is controlled by a handful of capitalists, while in socialist countries economic power is concentrated in a small group of party leaders. In each case a handful of people &ndash; the number can be easily counted on one&#146;s fingertips &ndash; manipulates the economic welfare of the entire society. When economic power is vested in the hands of the people, the supremacy of this group of leaders will be terminated, and political parties will be destroyed forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->People will have to opt for either political democracy or economic democracy. That is, they will have to choose a socio-economic system based on either a centralized economy or a decentralized economy. Which one will they select? Political democracy cannot fulfil the hopes and aspiration of people or provide the basis for constructing a strong and healthy human society. The only way to achieve this is to establish economic democracy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..23"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Requirements for Economic Democracy<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The first requirement for economic democracy is that the minimum requirements of a particular age &ndash; including food, clothing, housing, education and medical treatment &ndash; must be guaranteed to all. Not only is this an individual right, it is also a collective necessity, because the easy availability of the minimum requirements will increase the all-round welfare of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The second requirement for economic democracy is that increasing purchasing capacity must be guaranteed to each and every individual. In economic democracy local people will hold economic power. Consequently, local raw materials will be used to promote the economic prosperity of the local people. That is to say, the raw materials of one socio-economic unit should not be exported to another unit. Instead, industrial centres should be built up wherever raw materials are available. This will create industries based on locally available raw materials and ensure full employment for all local people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The third requirement for economic democracy is that the power to make all economic decisions must be placed in the hands of the local people. Economic liberation is the birthright of every individual. To achieve it, economic power must be vested in the local people. In economic democracy the local people will have the power to make all economic decisions, to produce commodities on the basis of collective necessity, and to distribute all agricultural and industrial commodities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The fourth requirement for economic democracy is that outsiders must be strictly prevented from interfering in the local economy. The outflow of local capital must be stopped by strictly preventing outsiders or a floating population from participating in any type of economic activity in the local area.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->For the success of economic democracy, PROUT must be implemented and the economic welfare of all people must be enhanced step by step. This in turn will lead to greater opportunities for the spiritual emancipation of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Finally, it should be remembered that economic democracy is essential not only for the economic liberation of human beings, but for the universal well-being of all &ndash; including plants and animals. Economic democracy will devise ways and means to effect the smooth progress of society by recognizing the unique value of both humans and non-humans alike.<!-- /block --></p>
