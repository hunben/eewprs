<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->On the 8th of September, 1985, the author, and founder of Ananda Marga, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, began an extraordinary series of Sunday lectures in Bengali that would eventually fill a total of twenty-six volumes over the next five years. The title he gave to this series was Shabda Cayanika&#x301;, which translates into English as &ldquo;A Collection of Words&rdquo;. As the title suggests, each discourse consists of a discussion of a certain number of words from the Bengali language, beginning, in the first discourse, with the first letter of the Bengali alphabet, a, and continuing on alphabetically. What results, then, is neither an encyclopedia, nor a dictionary, but something unique to the fields of scholarship and literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ostensibly, Shabda Cayanika&#x301; is a series devoted to the linguistics and philology of the Bengali language, but in reality it is much more than that. The author uses the platform of the word as a point of departure to take the reader on a journey through all the varied landscapes of human knowledge &ndash; history, geography, medicine, science, art, religion, philosophy, etc. &ndash; and in the process adds the indelible stamp of his own unique intellect, enriching our experience with new ideas and enabling us to see our human heritage in a way we have never been able to before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Like most great authors, he is a consummate storyteller, using a seemingly inexhaustible supply of anecdotes, personal experiences and stories to capture the reader&#146;s interest and lead him or her effortlessly through the garden of human knowledge. Along the way the author refines and develops a language that is the world&#146;s fifth most widely spoken and the closest living language to its great classical ancestor, Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the translators have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the translators or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The author uses a certain shorthand for explaining etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avatara can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The first English publication of the material on the equal rights of men and women in ancient society, pages 77-78, first appeared in The Awakening of Women, 1995. Pages 113-121 in the section on ekars&#x301;i also first appeared in The Awakening of Women. Both passages were translated by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Vijaya&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta, Avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; A&#x301;nanda Rucira&#x301; A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya&#x301; and A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Acyuta&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Many thanks to Avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; A&#x301;nanda Rucira&#x301; A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya&#x301; for her invaluable assistance with layout, indexing and proofreading.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Indukamala<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Indu means &ldquo;moon&rdquo;; Indu means &ldquo;the moon&#146;s ama&#x301;kala&#x301; [sixteenth digit or crescent]&rdquo;. In some people&#146;s opinion, indu means the entire moon. The light of the moon used to be considered as a symbol of sentient whiteness. Shubhrajyots&#x301;napulakitaya&#x301;minii [&ldquo;The radiant moonlit night&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The word kamala can be derived in two ways: (1) kam + ac + la&#x301; + d&#x301;a = kamala, meaning etymologically, &ldquo;that which holds beauty&rdquo;, or (2) kam + alac = kamala, which means &ldquo;that which is an embodiment of beauty&rdquo;. In both cases the colloquial meaning of kamala is &ldquo;lotus flower&rdquo;. In the first case the verbal root la&#x301; is derived with a&#x301;di la<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and in the second case a&#x301;di la is also used in the suffix alac; thus, in both cases, a&#x301;di la is used in the construction of kamala. Similarly, a&#x301;di la is also used in the construction of kamala&#x301; because this word is derived by adding the suffix t&#x301;a&#x301; to the word kamala.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Thus indukamala means &ldquo;white lotus&rdquo;. The word indiibara, which is used for &ldquo;blue lotus&rdquo;, is clearly a graceful combination, but when indukamala is used to mean &ldquo;moon&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the crescent of the moon&rdquo;, its meaning comes from the word indu. The etymological difference between the two deserves careful consideration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Synonyms for kamala are padma, abja, saroja, sarasija, kubalaya, kokanada, nalinii, naliniipus&#x301;pa, mrn&#x301;a&#x301;laman&#x301;ika&#x301;, etc. In Bengal it is padma, in north India kamala, in Kashmir pampos&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Indubila&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Indu + bil + ac = indubila. By adding t&#x301;a&#x301; it becomes indubila&#x301;. Indu means &ldquo;moon&rdquo; or &ldquo;the crescent of the moon&rdquo;. The meaning of the verbal root bil is &ldquo;to bore&rdquo; or &ldquo;to make a hole&rdquo;. By adding the suffix van (in some people&#146;s opinion, vun) to the verbal root bil we get the word bilva whose etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which makes a hole&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;bel fruit&rdquo; [wood-apple]. In ancient times people held the view that eating burnt, unripe bel or wood-apple would alleviate ulcers and other kinds of stomach problems, while eating ripe bel would create stomach ulcers. Thus they named the fruit bilva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->According to a story from the Puranas, the etymological meaning of indubila&#x301; is &ldquo;that woman who made a hole in the moon, or the crescent of the moon, in order to extract its nectar&rdquo;, that is, that woman who was inspired by the belief that if she made a hole in the moon its accumulated nectar would come out. Colloquially, indubila&#x301; refers to the mother of the god of wealth, Kuvera.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Indhana<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The word indhana is derived by adding the suffix lyut&#x301; to the verbal root indh or idhi. That wood which is used as fuel for cooking is indhana. By the same reasoning, in the modern era we can also call the coal or electricity that we use for cooking indhana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In southern Bengal, indhana is called jva&#x301;la&#x301;nii ka&#x301;t&#x301;h, in the central and western regions it is called la&#x301;kr&#x301;i, and in the north it is called khar&#x301;i. Wood which is used as cooking fuel is also called aran&#x301;i. Not all kinds of wood are suitable as cooking fuel. Many kinds of wood do not catch fire easily, others do not stay lit. Due to insufficient combustibility, some woods become scorched but do not burn strongly. Those woods which burn strongly are usable as cooking fuel and they are known as aran&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those forested areas which contain large amounts of aran&#x301;i are called aran&#x301;ya. In ancient times the sages generally used to live in these aran&#x301;yas, although this did not hold true for those who used to live off forest-grown fruits and roots. Those who used to cook their food needed cooking fuel, so they used to live in the aran&#x301;ya. They did not live in the ordinary forest areas which were bereft of aran&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->You must all be aware of the fact that the Vedas have two main branches: karmaka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a and jin&#x32D;a&#x301;naka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The karmaka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a is further subdivided into two: mantra and bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a. The jin&#x32D;a&#x301;naka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a is also subdivided into two: a&#x301;ran&#x301;yaka and upanis&#x301;ada. The etymological meaning of a&#x301;ran&#x301;yaka is &ldquo;that which pertains to the forest [aran&#x301;ya]&rdquo;, or &ldquo;forest-born&rdquo;. Colloquially it refers to all those philosophical portions of the Vedas which concern the objective world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Those areas which contained large amounts of less-combustible or less-flammable trees were called ban in the common language. For example, I will point out that the Bankura jungle has an abundance of high quality wood while in the Sundarbans there is a lack of high quality wood &ndash; the greater part is wood for fuel. By this analysis, we can call the Sundarbans aran&#x301;ya, while the Bankura jungle we would call ban in the common language, not aran&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->All those woods which were not used for cooking, that is, which were not indhana, but which were used for yajin&#x32D;a [Vedic ritual sacrifice], such as sha&#x301;l (indra), bilva (bel or wood-apple), yajin&#x32D;ad&#x301;umbara (ud&#x301;umbara) [Indian blackberry], are called samidha rather than aran&#x301;i or indhana. In ancient times, yajin&#x32D;ad&#x301;umbara was usually used as samidha; for this reason, those who were engaged in the performance of sacrifices would not use yajin&#x32D;ad&#x301;umbar wood as indhana; due to superstition they would not even consume its fruit. In subsequent times, most likely after their arrival in India, they began to use indraka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha (sha&#x301;l wood) and bilvaka&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;ha (bel wood) in their sacrifices. I have sometimes seen samidha called yajin&#x32D;a indhana in old Pra&#x301;krta literature. This usage is defective. Indhana is not used for sacrifices; it is used for cooking.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The verbal root ir means &ldquo;that which flows&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which does not remain static&rdquo;. One colloquial meaning of the word ira or ira&#x301; is &ldquo;water&rdquo;. Iravat or Ira&#x301;vat means &ldquo;sea&rdquo;. According to a story from the Puranas, the name of the huge elephant that emerged from the churning of the sea was Eravata/Era&#x301;vata or Aeravata/Aera&#x301;vata (mammoth).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Another colloquial meaning of ira or ira&#x301; is &ldquo;air&rdquo;. Sweet-scented ira means &ldquo;fragrant air&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Yet another meaning of ira or ira&#x301; is &ldquo;money&rdquo;. In this sense, the value of money lies in its mobility. If money stops circulating then it loses its value. The wealth of the individual or the state accrues through ceaseless circulation; thus money should not be kept in a pot buried in the ground. Its greatest value lies in its circulation. Irava&#x301;na or ira&#x301;va&#x301;na means &ldquo;wealthy&rdquo;. Another meaning of iravatii or ira&#x301;vatii is &ldquo;rich&rdquo; [in feminine form].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Still another meaning of ira or ira&#x301; is &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; or &ldquo;erudition&rdquo;. In the case of the physical world, ira or ira&#x301; is a name for wealth due to its mobility. For the same reason, another name for erudition is ira or ira&#x301;. Calamity results in individual, social and political life if wealth remains confined &ndash; the water in a clay pitcher leaks out if it is not used. Such is also the case with erudition. Its real worth depends on its circulating and spreading, otherwise it becomes a burden. Pustaka&#x301;ntaragata&#x301; vidya&#x301; parahastagatam&#x301; dhanam [&ldquo;Knowledge confined to books is like wealth belonging to others&rdquo;]. Knowledge is spread through distribution, by doing service. Herein lies the significance of its name ira&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->For the same reason, another meaning of the word ira&#x301; is &ldquo;articulation&rdquo; or &ldquo;vocality&rdquo;. Those who have the capacity to speak and make others understand should speak and explain good things to others. The faculty of speaking should not be confined to a mute vocal cavity. As speaking and knowledge is ira&#x301;, thus knowledge and the presiding deity of knowledge used to be called Va&#x301;gdevii (va&#x301;k + devii)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in ancient times. The word ira&#x301; used to be especially revered by the learned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..22"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Ila&#x301;bila&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word i is &ldquo;desirous of obtaining&rdquo;. The word la&#x301; (la&#x301; + d&#x301;a + t&#x301;a&#x301;) means &ldquo;one who holds&rdquo;. Colloquially, ila&#x301; means &ldquo;a collection of wealth&rdquo; (a collection of money or learning). The etymological meaning of the word ila&#x301;bila&#x301; is &ldquo;he or she who goes around everywhere searching for holes or poking around in hopes of obtaining riches&rdquo;. The colloquial meaning of the word ila&#x301;bila&#x301; is Kuvera&#146;s [god of wealth] wife.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->In one Puranic tale, the name of Kuvera&#146;s wife is Ila&#x301; (Iks&#x301;va&#x301;ku&#146;s daughter). According to a Puranic story, the male Mercury was physically transformed into a woman. After becoming a woman, his name became Ila&#x301;. Through surgery he was again changed back into a man. Iks&#x301;va&#x301;ku&#146;s daughter&#146;s real name was Ira&#x301;. After Mercury was changed back into a man, Ira&#x301; was given the name Ila&#x301;. This Puranic tale offers evidence that there were sex changes in the past similar to the great number that we see today in modern times.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Iliisha<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Il + iisha = iliisha. Il means &ldquo;to go down into water&rdquo;. Iisha means &ldquo;ruler&rdquo;&#8230; &ldquo;king&rdquo;. The etymological meaning of iliisha is &ldquo;the king of water&rdquo;. Colloquially, it refers to a certain kind of fish. Since those iliisha which unwittingly get caught in ponds, swamps, or stagnant water have their taste spoiled, they are called viliisha (vi + iliisha = viliisha). In Bengal, different people spell iliisha in different ways. This is not desirable. The correct spelling is iliisha because it is according to its derivation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..27"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Is&#x301;t&#x301;a<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The word is&#x301;t&#x301;a is derived by adding the suffix kta to the verbal root is&#x301;.

At that time I didn&#146;t have my own house in Delhi; sometimes I used to stay in hotels and sometimes in a rented house. This time I was staying in a hotel.

<a name="2..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;It is the voice of Dulu Palit that I know so well from my childhood.&rdquo; Dulu was both a close friend and a distant relative.

Both of them were quite handsome, but their inner beauty was even greater. It was their inborn nature to do good to others. But where was Dulu&#146;s voice coming from in this hotel bathroom? How did he get here? This was not a dream. I was standing in front of the washbasin in full possession of my senses, washing my hands and face &ndash; it simply couldn&#146;t have been a figment of my imagination or a trick my ears were playing on me!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Dulu spoke again in a hurt voice: &ldquo;Are you angry with me? Why are you not looking at me?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->I remembered how much Dulu used to love me.

<a name="2..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->The voice seemed to be coming from behind me.

The remedies for illnesses or answers to questions that a person receives at the shrine of different gods and goddesses is not due to the greatness of those gods and goddesses. As a result of sincere longing a state of one-pointedness arises in the mind and if, at that time, that person falls into deep sleep because of physical tiredness then the answers to his or her questions may descend from the unconscious mind into the subconscious mind. There the person receives the answers to his or her questions about illness or other questions according to his or her mental conceptions and beliefs. The person thinks that he or she has perhaps received these answers due to the grace of such-and-such god or goddess. Actually, thanks to the grace of the Supreme Consciousness, his or her unconscious mind is the hidden repository of infinite knowledge.

A person whose Bengali name is Arun Kumar will still be Arun Kumar if his name is written in English; it will not be &ldquo;son of crimson red&rdquo;. Hence the name Kalikata should be written Kalikata no matter  what language or script of the world it is written in. Writing &ldquo;Calcutta&rdquo;  is not even worthy of consideration. It betrays intellectual poverty  or split-thinking. In English one should write Kalikata.</p>

<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The eagle [iigal] is the largest of the birds who are able to fly. The emu, ostrich, etc. are bigger than the eagle but they are unable to fly. Of course, not all eagles are equally large. There are thirty-two different varieties of eagle.

In the village areas of Burdwan some of the old people still call the giant black owl the homa&#x301; bird. Their numbers are fast diminishing due to the scarcity of large trees and pervasive poaching by hunters greedy for the large amount of meat they can get from them. Some provisions should be made to ensure their survival.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The large migratory bird that one finds in the fields of northern India during the winter harvest at the beginning of the cold season is also called the garuda bird in the village areas of Bihar. However this bird is neither a garuda nor an eagle, but rather a very large variety of flamingo. They come to the winter harvest fields and eat the newly-sprouted pulse seeds.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The original home of the eagle was the mountains of the Alps in central Europe. Originally, different varieties of eagles lived in different portions of these mountains. Later, they spread to other areas due to natural causes, pressure from human beings and in search of food. Eagles cannot build nests like other birds due to their large size. Generally they place rocks and branches and twigs in mountain caves in order to protect themselves from the adversities of nature. This kind of eagle&#146;s nest is called an &ldquo;aerie&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The condor is the biggest member of the eagle family. In ancient times they used to live in the southeast region of the Alps. Today there are very few left.

<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->At one time a good number of golden eagles used to be found in western Europe. Today they are on the verge of extinction. Approximately a hundred years ago the last of the British variety of golden eagle died. Today the British golden eagle no longer flies in the earth&#146;s skies. Like the dodo bird, they have disappeared forever. The British golden eagle is one of the victims of humankind&#146;s death-sacrifices. Similarly, the Indian leopard can only be seen nowadays in pictures; it can no longer be seen in the Indian jungles. The Indian leopard, along with the leopard-cat, used to be found in good numbers in the Duars of northern Bengal, but today the Indian leopard is no longer to be found and the leopard-cat is also rarely seen anymore.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>

In ancient India the white vulture was considered to be a symbol of misfortune. Thus in the Vedic era, if a white vulture sat on anyone&#146;s house they would perform the shakunta yajin&#x32D;a [vulture sacrifice] to chase away misfortune. King Shya&#x301;mala Varmman&#x301;a brought Brahmans versed in the Vedas from north India to Bengal in order to perform the shakunta yajin&#x32D;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Although birds of the eagle group are meat-eaters and ferocious by nature, they are not very clever. Often it is seen that vultures meet their death in fights with crows because of their lack of intelligence.

Today the hippopotamus is no longer found in India. It disappeared from India approximately a thousand years ago. Human beings were most probably responsible for this evil deed, acting out of greed for their extremely firm, white teeth, much as they have nearly brought an end to the rhinoceros by killing them out of greed for their horns. It is in the last one hundred years or so that the rhinoceros has disappeared from the Sundarbans. The two hundred or two hundred fifty rhinoceri still surviving somehow in eastern India should be in protected reserves, otherwise humans, greedy for their hides, flesh and horns, will bring their final day even closer. Hippopotami teeth should also be considered ivory for the same reason that elephant tusks are. In prehistoric times, both hippopotami and giraffes were found in Rarh, but they disappeared about ten thousand years ago thanks to the capriciousness of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->One day, while searching in a spot near Muri in the Silli area, I came across a fossilized fragment of a mammoth jaw with part of the tusk still attached.

<a name="3..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->All day long I travelled like a whirlwind from village to village in Ranchi District&#146;s Silli area and the Jhalda and Jaipur areas of what was at that time Manbhum District, just adjacent to it. This region is also worthy of being recognized by archaeologists as the cradle of Rarhi civilization. Here the Suvarnarekha River-valley, Kamsavati River-valley and Damodar River-valley (Alkushi, Kupai, Uttara&#x301; or Chot&#x301;ki Guyai and Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; or Bar&#x301;ki Guyai) are all close to each other and I was able to discover many things there.<!-- /block --></p>

Although nowadays there are twelve dialects of Bengali spoken over this huge area, in those days there were even more because there wasn&#146;t any good transportation between the different areas. It was due to the impassability of traffic that so many dialects arose. Roughly speaking, the Bengali language of that time was a related form of Oriental Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii. We can also call it old Bengali. We can find this Oriental Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii-related form of Bengali in the Carya&#x301;pada and the Carya&#x301;caryavinishcaya of the Buddhist era. From this we can easily conclude that the Bengali language is at least 1500 years old &ndash; not a bit less.

The amount of inner feeling that exists in the initial stage is greatly decreased when it is translated into language, that is, when it enters the second stage, because language&#146;s capacity is limited in comparison with thought. Rasagolla, rasamalai and coconut ladu are three types of sweets. When we taste them we can easily understand the difference between them, but when expressing it in language we cannot explain just what the sweetness of each is like. The capacity of language fails. This is the case with all worldly feelings, in other words, in comparison with feeling, our expressive capacity is significantly smaller. If we stick ourselves with a pin we say &ldquo;ooh&rdquo;; if we are stung by a wasp we also say &ldquo;ooh&rdquo;; and if we are stung by a scorpion we still say &ldquo;ooh&rdquo;. Yet the feeling in each case is not the same, nor is the intensity.

For example, one who is very noble we call the embodied symbol of nobility. One who possesses great erudition we call the embodiment of erudition. Regarding Iishvara, it is said that He is the embodied image of love &ndash; the embodiment of divine love. No matter how much a person remains engaged in unjust actions, he always hopes that Parama Purus&#x301;a will forgive him, that He will wipe the dust off him and take him on His lap. Although he forgets Parama Purus&#x301;a at the time of committing injustice, after he has committed it, when he remembers Parama Purus&#x301;a, he thinks to himself: &ldquo;O Lord, you know the condition I was in when I committed this injustice. Please forgive me.&rdquo; Or else he says: &ldquo;O Lord, why did you give me such a nature that I could commit this type of injustice? Save me.&rdquo; That is, under all circumstances the living beings are dependent on Parama Purus&#x301;a, whether they know it or not. Parama Purus&#x301;a is such an entity. No matter how much a person may be frightened of Parama Purus&#x301;a, he is much more filled with hope by Him.

It was observed that when the dancers approached that unknown man he began to lift his hand to give something and then pulled it back. The king&#146;s intelligence people or gahapurus&#x301;as then understood that this aquiline-nosed man was the son of some royal family. And because he belonged to the Mediterranean<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn14"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn14">14</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  branch of the Caucasian race, they had no doubts that he was from Kashmir, that is, he was a member of the Kashmiri royal family and he had come there for the purposes of spying.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn2">2</a></b>)  The Philippines&#146; Sanskrit name is Maha&#x301;rlika&#x301;  or Maha&#x301;rliina&#x301; which means, etymologically, &ldquo;small in size  but great in qualities&rdquo;. After the Spanish took possession of  the country they gave it the name &ldquo;Philippines&rdquo; after their  King Philip.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn3">3</a></b>)  The word shaktu is used in the sense of &ldquo;that which makes the body strong&rdquo;. Its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;corn-meal&rdquo; or &ldquo;gram-meal&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn4">4</a></b>)   The plains at the edge of the Himalayas are called  terai in northern India and duya&#x301;r in Bengali. Thus  the name of the city of Alipur located in that region is Alipurduar, and the one that is not located in the duya&#x301;r, but rather adjacent to Calcutta, is just called Alipur. Until the Mughal era its name was Alinagar.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn5">5</a></b>)  In old Sanskrit they used to be called grdhra and in north India, gidha.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn6">6</a></b>)  In English we use the word &ldquo;tusk&rdquo; for the Bengali  word gajadanta and the adjective &ldquo;ivory&rdquo; is used for  the material which is made from these tusks. In other words, when  I show someone an elephant&#146;s tooth [gajadanta] I call it a  &ldquo;tusk&rdquo;, and when I show a bangle made from the tooth of an  elephant I call it an &ldquo;ivory bangle&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn8">8</a></b>)   The name of the first part of the river is Dhalkishore.  After it joins the Gandheshvari River in Bankura, the name of the combined flow is Dvarakeshvar. When this Dvarakeshvar River reaches  the far border of Hoogly District it joins the Shilavati (Shilai)  River coming from the west and thereafter flows towards the southwest  under the name of the Rupanarayan River, dividing Midnapore and Howrah;  thereafter it joins with the Bhagirathi. At its end, Howrah District&#146;s  Shyampur area is on the left bank and Midnapore District&#146;s Tamluk  is on the right bank.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn9">9</a></b>)  The far western fringe of Rarh, where the Suvarnarekha, Kansavati and Damodar River-valleys come together, we can call the  cradle of both Rarhi and human civilization. As regards the spoken  language, the branch of Rarhi Bengali that is prevalent in the area  lying on the right bank (south) of the Suvarnarekha River is called  Pa&#x301;inc-Pargan&#x301;iya&#x301; Bengali. The  spoken language found on the left bank of the Suvarnarekha  River and the right bank (south) of the Kansavati River is the Patkumi  branch of Rarhi Bengali. And the language spoken on the left bank  of the Kansavati and the right bank of the Damodar is the Golawa&#x301;rii branch of Rarhi Bengali. Gola is a famous place of this area from which the name Golawa&#x301;rii has come. The spoken language of the area lying on the left  bank of the Damodar, that is, north and west of the Pareshanath Hills  is called Daks&#x301;in&#x301;ii Khotta Bengali. The closer one gets to  the Pareshanath Hills the more the influence of Rarhi Bengali increases  in this Daks&#x301;in&#x301;ii Khotta Bengali and the nearer one gets to  the Tilaiya Reservoir, the more the influence of southern Magahii  or Gaya&#x301;li Magahii increases. The Pa&#x301;inc-Pargan&#x301;iya&#x301;  branch of Rarhi Bengali is spoken in Ranchi District&#146;s Bundu, Arki,  Tamar &ndash; 1, Tamar &ndash; 2, Sonahatu, the southern part of the Silli  area, and the southern part of the Angara area. The Patkumi branch  of Rarhi Bengali is prevalent in Purulia District&#146;s Jhalda and Tulin  areas, the northern part of Ranchi District&#146;s Silli and Angara areas,  and in certain parts of Hazaribag District&#146;s (now Giridi District) Kasmar and Petarwar areas. The Golawa&#x301;rii branch of Rarhi Bengali is spoken in Purulia District&#146;s Jaipur area, Dhanbad District&#146;s Chas,  Chandankeyari, Bokaro Steel City and Jeridi, and in certain portions  of Hazaribag District&#146;s (now Giridi District) Kasmar, Petarwar, Gola  and Ramgarh areas. The spoken language of Hazaribag District&#146;s (now  Giridi District) Gomoh, Nuyadi, Bermo, Dumri, Chandrapura and Bokaro (Thermal) areas is also a variety of this Golawa&#x301;rii Bengali.</p>

<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->This is a native Bengali word. In north India, diimak is used, on the Bengal and north India border, diiyank or diiya&#x301;n, in English &ldquo;white-ant&rdquo; and in Sanskrit valmiikakiit&#x301;a or plus&#x301;in&#x301;a. This tiny creature belonging to the ant group increases its numbers at an extremely fast rate. They cannot see anything in sunlight. Their sense of touch also diminishes when exposed to sunlight. Thus they build little tunnels out of earth to protect themselves from sunlight and use them to move around because their sense of touch and other senses come to life in the darkness of these tunnels. Under certain conditions the different branches and sub-branches of these tunnels that they lay down right and left become visible as a mound or hillock. In spoken Bengali we call these ui-dhibi, in English &ldquo;anthill&rdquo;, in Sanskrit valmiika. An anthill was built around the entire body of a sage who remained motionless for many days during the practice of his austerities. At the time that he sat for meditation he was known by the name of Ratnakara. The people gave him the name Valmiiki because at the time that he finished his penance and rose from his seat he had the body of an anthill.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->People in many countries of the world eat ants, even civilized people in some places. They say that ants are tasty and have a sweet and sour flavour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In many parts of Bengal, a is used in place of ra, and ra is used in place of a. For this reason ui are called rui nearly everywhere in southern Bengal. That fungus variety of plant, or mushroom, which grows on anthills is called rui-cha&#x301;tu [ant-mushroom].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit the word plus&#x301;in&#x301;a was more widely used than the word valmiikakiit&#x301;a. Sama plus&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301; sama mashakena sama na&#x301;gena sama ebhistribhirlokaeh, that is, Parama Purus&#x301;a is unbiased. He is equal to everyone because He sees everyone in the same way. He sees an ant in the same way He sees a small mosquito. He understands an ant in the same way that He understands a mosquito. He doesn&#146;t make any undue fuss over a giant serpent (python or &ldquo;elephant of the jungle&rdquo;) because of its great size. He sees a python or &ldquo;elephant of the jungle&rdquo; in the same way that He sees an ant or a mosquito, and they also see Him in that same way. Nor does He make any special fuss over this universe, the three worlds of heaven, earth and hell, because of their vastness, and they look at Him in this same way. In other words, everyone is equal to Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; a mosquito, an ant, a python, a mammoth, even the three worlds. He remains with everyone equally through His ota yoga and prota yoga. He is impartial under all conditions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the opinion of biologists, ants first appeared on the earth approximately six million years ago. It is possible that they appeared somewhat earlier than this, but not later. In other words, after ants arrived on the earth they passed through at least one, if not more than one, ice age, and have arrived in their present form having undergone one or more long hibernations.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Ukta means &ldquo;that which has been said&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which has been mentioned before&rdquo;. Vac + kta = ukta. Generally, when the suffix kta or ktin is added to a verbal root which begins with antahstha va, the va of the root verb is changed into u. For example, vad + kta = udita [said]. Anu &ndash; vad + ghain&#x32D; = anuva&#x301;da [translation]; but anu &ndash; vad + kta = anu&#x301;dita (that which has been translated). By adding kta to vac + n&#x301;ic we get the word ucita whose etymological meaning is &ldquo;that which has been made to speak&rdquo; and whose colloquial meaning is &ldquo;that which is to be done&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is worthy of being maintained&rdquo;. Some people spell the word ucita with t &ndash; ucit. This is anucita [improper]. There is no such word as ucit.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Vac + ktin = ukti. Ukti means &ldquo;word&rdquo;, &ldquo;language&rdquo;, &ldquo;remark&rdquo;.

<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix thal/vak to the verbal root vac we get the word uktha. Uktha means &ldquo;that which is uttered forcefully&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is sung forcefully&rdquo;. Many people know that the Sa&#x301;maveda is not actually a Veda. The song portions of the Rk, Yajuh and Arthava Vedas collectively make the Sa&#x301;maveda. The Rgvedic portion of the Sa&#x301;maveda is called uktha.

The etymological meaning of the word ucca&#x301;ra is &ldquo;that which is ejected&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;stool&rdquo;. The straining which is done at the time of passing stool is also called ucca&#x301;ra deoya&#x301;. Some people mistakenly use the word socca&#x301;ra when they want to say sarava, or &ldquo;vocal&rdquo;. One meaning of the word socca&#x301;ra is &ldquo;one who has passed stool but still has not cleaned oneself&rdquo;. Its second meaning is &ldquo;one who is straining to pass stool&rdquo;. Is it desirable then to request a gentleman or lady to be socca&#x301;ra?<!-- /block --></p>

Ut&#x301; + ac = ut&#x301;a. Ut&#x301;aja shilpa means &ldquo;that industry which is done in a cottage&rdquo; &ndash; cottage industry. One should keep in mind that the word ut&#x301;a here is adopted from Sanskrit.

In olden times the area from the mouth of the Godavari River to the mouth of the Mahanadi River was called Utkala, and the area from the mouth of the Suvarnarekha River to the mouth of the Mahanadi River was called the land of Od&#x301;ra.

In many cases people are devoted to upadevata&#x301;s out of fear and sometimes they are worshipped in the hopes of obtaining something. Banabibi [The Lady of the Forest] is there to save one from the grasp of the tiger. Besides her, there is Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a Ra&#x301;ya; out of fear of cholera people worship Ola&#x301;i Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii; out of fear of smallpox they worship Shiitala&#x301;devii; out of fear of snakes, Manasa&#x301;.

In Sanskrit they are all classified as upadevata&#x301;s because they are not Parama Purus&#x301;a, the object of meditation in the spiritual world. Besides these, there are many other upadevata&#x301;s such as Mangalacan&#x301;d&#x301;ii, A&#x301;sha&#x301;nbibi, Satyapiira, etc. Upadevata&#x301;s are also called folk [laokik] gods and goddesses. Some of them have dhya&#x301;na mantras and some do not; some of them also have dhya&#x301;na mantras in the local or state language and some do not have that either. In many cases the gods and goddesses of the Buddhist and Jain eras came or are coming to be worshipped as upadevata&#x301;s in the post-Buddhist and post-Jain eras. Those spiritual aspirants who follow the paths of knowledge, action and devotion, of course, do not bow their heads to upadevata&#x301;s.

In these hills humankind depicted its existence through many different varieties of drawings. From these it can be understood just how far back Angadesh&#146;s history goes. If Karna is accepted as Anga&#146;s first king, then Anga&#146;s political history is over 3500 years old, but these cave paintings are signs of the first stage of prehistoric humans&#146; ascension through the annals of history.

Blue dye was collected from the indigo plant. Bear in mind that nowadays blue dye is no longer prepared from the indigo plant.

The British cultivated their indigo in different areas using local farmers; in some areas they cultivated the indigo on their own land and they would prepare the blue dye in local factories from the indigo plants and send it overseas. These English indigo merchants used to be called niilkar saheb. There were many indigo factories in Bhagalpur, Monghyr, Burdwan and Birbhum. The indigo plant near Burdwan District&#146;s Ajapur was quite huge.

Those same farmers who could never think of confronting the Europeans, who used to flee in fear just hearing their name, are now chasing after them with their sticks and spears when they see them. The situation is not good at all! Here also, the houses of innocent farmers are being set on fire on your instructions; your men are dragging their daughters and wives out of their houses and taking them with them. People are being beaten for no reason and chased away with bullets. It&#146;s horrible. These things are inhuman; the dignity of these women is being trampled into the dirt.

Otherwise the demons in us will not only swallow our bodies and minds, but our entire human existence will end up crudified.

The man&#146;s voice had been coming from that dreadful northwest corner of the room. When I looked over there I could understand that the Englishman had just left hurriedly. I looked around the house carefully but found nobody there but me. I was the only guest of that deserted, silent night.

<a name="4..112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph -->I lay down and turned over from one side to the other. Can anyone sleep in such a state? The soft light of the hurricane lantern illumined the inside of the room; outside it was pitch black, completely dark. A few fireflies darted here and there over the rain-soaked earth. Seeing that I was not able to fall asleep, I thought it would be a good idea to go to the bathroom and rinse down my head and neck.

<a name="4..113"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=113 type=paragraph -->To get to the bathroom I had to go through that middle room. When I entered I pulled up, startled.

<a name="4..115"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=115 type=paragraph -->I went to the bathroom and cooled down by rinsing my hands and face, then went back into the middle room.

The titmice started to flee in fear when they saw me. Not finding the sahib, I started again for the bedroom to lie down but just as I took a step I heard the voice of the sahib behind me. He was saying: &ldquo;Please sir, don&#146;t leave me this way. I wasn&#146;t certain how to talk to you, so for a few seconds you didn&#146;t see me hanging from the rope.

<a name="4..116"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=116 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I do. I swear I do!&rdquo; Then I continued in a harsh voice: &ldquo;Why did you have to die this way?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..117"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=117 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;But please, sit on that stool over there,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&#146;ll tell you my story in brief.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..118"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=118 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;At the beginning of the British administration indigo was a booming business. On one side there was the oppression and tyranny against the farmers, and on the other our pockets were filling up with money. This was the biggest indigo factory in Monghyr District. Millions of rupees worth of indigo were exported from here to Europe each year. I was the head manager of the factory. It is normal human psychology that when there is oppression, at first the timid people keep their mouths closed and put up with it. Even courageous people think: &lsquo;Let me see how things go for the time being. Then I will take action.&rsquo;  When the oppression increases even more, the cowardly-natured slap their heads and curse their fate, and the brave call out in loud voices and fall on their oppressors. When tyranny reaches its limit then even the faint-of-heart start roaring like lions and mercilessly take revenge on their oppressors.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Maddened by delusions of power, and bereft of the knowledge of right and wrong in our greed for money, we niilkars forgot this historical and psychological truth. The result of this mistake of ours was the Niilkar Rebellion in Jessore and Nadia. The rebellion, however, never completely broke out in this Monghyr District because no such oppressive niilkars had come to this area besides myself. I set the steamroller of tyranny loose on these ordinary farmers. I earned huge amounts of money and in the process I sold my humanity in exchange for a few gold coins. I went hell-bound step by step, transforming myself from a conscious human being into no better than an inert stone. I had no remnant left of my common sense. Maddened by pride, I fired recklessly on those village farmers who came to me peacefully with their grievances and needs. I even killed seven men. After that I hadn&#146;t the slightest sense of what-to-do or what-not-to-do. There was no one around to give directions or orders or advice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..120"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=120 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;After firing on the villagers, I sent a letter to the district magistrate informing him of the affair. He sent back an immediate reply by letter-bearer informing me of the situation: &lsquo;The indigo rebellion has broken out in Jessore and Nadia. Under these circumstances it is best that you observe certain limits in all matters. Do not do anything that can make the situation get out of control or law and order get out of hand. For several days now I&#146;ve known that the village farmers have been disturbed by your conduct. You have even fired on and killed several innocent farmers. I can guess that they will become even more agitated. Under these circumstances I will give you this counsel: you should start for Calcutta this very night under the cover of darkness. It is no longer safe for you to remain there. It will take you approximately five days to reach Calcutta by horse-drawn carriage. To ensure your safety I will send some mounted soldiers to ride in front of and behind your carriage. In this matter I cannot rely on native sepoys.&rsquo;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->The sahib let out a long sigh and said: &ldquo;The advice of the district magistrate was quite sound, but at that time I was not in the right mind to accept his counsel. Because of my arrogance I had completely lost my common sense. My ruler&#146;s philosophy was prodding me continuously, telling me &ndash; What! Will I flee under the cover of darkness out of fear of a few ordinary farmers? Never! It is against my ruler&#146;s philosophy. I will have to do something to save my respect. On and on I went thinking like this until I was at a complete loss. There was no one to give any clear directions or orders. That day my wounded pride told me &ndash; the only way to salvage my honour is to tie a noose around my neck and hang myself with this rope. That is the only path to salvation. In this way my honour, my prestige, my reputation, will be saved.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I tied a noose around my neck with this rope and hung myself. You may call it suicide, cowardliness or sin.

<a name="4..124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph -->His voice choked. &ldquo;You know, now I am completely alone in this place &ndash; solitary, companionless.

<a name="4..125"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=125 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Then?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Today I realize what a horrendous mistake I made. Human beings&#146; benevolent consciousness leads them towards greatness and evil crudifies them.

<a name="4..127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Look here, sahib,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There is no limit to the injustice you&#146;ve committed.

<a name="4..128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->This time the sahib replied in even a sadder voice. &ldquo;Afterwards the people buried my body underneath that banyan tree where the owl lives. If you look over there you can see a place where there are a lot of fireflies gathered; I am buried just in that spot. A few bones from my skeleton still remain.

<a name="4..129"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=129 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Sahib, it saddens me to hear your repentant words. It brings tears to my eyes. But tell me, what can I possibly do for you?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..133"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=133 type=paragraph -->I looked towards the trunk of the banyan tree where the owl was calling and while looking there I told him: &ldquo;Sahib, it is true that you are completely alone in this place, completely solitary, altogether companionless.

<a name="4..145"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=145 type=paragraph -->Nya&#x301;sa means &ldquo;to place&rdquo;. For example, the placing of the first brick when inaugurating the construction of a house is called shila&#x301;nya&#x301;sa [laying of the foundation stone]. In olden times houses were built out of shila&#x301;, or stone, so we say shila&#x301;nya&#x301;sa rather than is&#x301;t&#x301;akanya&#x301;sa [is&#x301;t&#x301;aka means &ldquo;brick&rdquo;]. That person who has placed himself or herself completely at the service of ideology is sam + nya&#x301;sin = sannya&#x301;sin (in the first person singular, sannya&#x301;sii). One who is a true ideologue, that is, one who has placed oneself at the service of Parama Purus&#x301;a is sat + nya&#x301;sin = sannya&#x301;sin (in the first person, singular sannya&#x301;sii).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..146"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=146 type=paragraph -->Upa means &ldquo;near&rdquo;. If any material object (object of enjoyment or edible) is kept near a person then that is called upanya&#x301;sa, in Farsi pesh karna&#x301;. This upanya&#x301;sa can be done either with respect or without respect. If a wooden trough is filled with chopped hay or with bran well-mixed with flax, and that is placed near a cow&#146;s mouth, then this nya&#x301;sa is done with respect or care. If paddy or broken bits of grain is scattered or spread for the hens or pigeons then this is also upanya&#x301;sa. And if pieces of dried bread are thrown for a dog lying on the road then that is also upanya&#x301;sa. To place something near is upanya&#x301;sa. The word upanya&#x301;sa is also used in the sense of &ldquo;introduction&rdquo;, &ldquo;preface&rdquo; or &ldquo;prelude&rdquo;. In this case one thing that should be borne in mind is that the Bengali synonym for the English words &ldquo;novel&rdquo; or &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; is not upanya&#x301;sa; rather it is, or should be, katha&#x301;nya&#x301;sa. There is no relationship between the words &ldquo;novel&rdquo; or &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; and the word upanya&#x301;sa, so it is not desirable that the word be used mistakenly.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn2">2</a></b>)  Roughly speaking, this river-basin has two parts: Monghyr District&#146;s Khar&#x301;gapur (Habeli), Tarapur and Sam&#x301;gra&#x301;mpur  tha&#x301;na&#x301; [administrative area covered by one police  station], and Bhagalpur District&#146;s Belhar tha&#x301;na&#x301;. The Belharnii River forms the border between these two districts in most places. During the time of the Santhal Rebellion in 1855 there was a great battle between the British and the Santhals in this river-basin&#146;s Sam&#x301;gra&#x301;mpur. Hence the name Sam&#x301;gra&#x301;mpur [battle city]. At the beginning of the war the British were losing the battles. On  one side the Santhals entered the city of Bhagalpur and on the other side the cities of Suri and Rajnagar. The Divisional Commissioner of Bhagalpur was killed in the battle. Still today one part of the  city of Bhagalpur bears the name of the leader of the rebellious Santhals, Tilaka&#x301;ma&#x301;jhi.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="4.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.4.fn3">3</a></b>)  The people of Burdwan, Hoogly and Howrah have yet to forget the destructive Damodar flood of 1912. The Ta&#x301;rakeshvara  temple was on the verge of being completely submerged in that flood. Calcutta was also mostly under water. In order to save Calcutta, the British managed to divert the greater part of the Damodar&#146;s waters into the Dvarakeshvara (Rupanarayana) via the Begorhana-Mundeshvari rivers. After that the Damodar lost its force as it headed downstream in the Begorhana, that is, in the Amta, Bagnan and nearby areas, and Calcutta was thereby saved from the flood.</p>

In modern Sanskrit short u is used in all but one or two cases. For example, in olden times the popular word for &ldquo;owl&rdquo; was u&#x301;lu&#x301;ka. In subsequent times both uluka and u&#x301;lu&#x301;ka were common in Sanskrit, side by side. In this matter it would be better to maintain a uniform standard in Bengali.

<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In ancient society, men and women had equal rights. Later, when some distinguished women such as Gargii, Maetreyii and others excelled their male counterparts in intellect, learning, humanity and power of contemplation, a group of male conspirators started curtailing their rights one after another in order to engender an inferiority complex in their minds. In the varna&#x301;shrama [caste] system, women and Shu&#x301;dras as groups were segregated. That was a dark chapter in human history indeed. Human beings conspired against their fellow humans to deprive them of their legitimate human rights. It can be said that the seeds of exploitation, imperialism and colonialism were sown at that time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Long before that, weaving was done mostly by women because the capacity to care for minute detail which is so essential for handiwork is found more in women than men. Even today weaving is done by women in many parts of the world. Obviously, when women became segregated, then weaving, too, as a hobby or profession came to be considered inferior. All this happened due to the conspiracies of a few men. Usually people indulge in such acts to revenge themselves on others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This phrase, &ldquo;revenge oneself&rdquo;, reminds me of a story &ndash; the story of how King Ballal Sen revenged himself on the Suvarna Vanik [merchants] of Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The royal treasury of Bengal was controlled by a handful of wealthy merchants. Their principal centre was Suvarnagram. King Ballal Sen was given to much pomp and luxury and was a man of lecherous nature. His son, Laksman Sen, was extremely unhappy with his father. King Ballal Sen often demanded more and more funds from the treasury. Since it was the king&#146;s order, the merchants could not object. But later, when the economy was being terribly affected and still the king did not keep his promises to return the funds, they spoke to Prince Laksman Sen. Through him they conveyed to the king that if he continued to draw funds from the royal treasury, the country&#146;s economy would meet with disaster. King Ballal Sen was enraged by the merchants&#146; wise advice. He vindictively retaliated and declared the whole community of Suvarna Vaniks &ndash; well-educated, intelligent and talented men &ndash; as outcastes. Thus he revenged himself against them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In the same way, a section of selfish men curtailed women&#146;s rights and hatched a conspiracy against women and Shu&#x301;dras to keep them downtrodden and under their feet forever. From that time another meaning of u&#x301;ta became &ldquo;movement towards hell&rdquo;, &ldquo;ending up in hell&rdquo;. So just as one meaning of u&#x301;ta is &ldquo;that cloth which is woven&rdquo;, its second meaning is &ldquo;one who is inclined towards hell&rdquo;, &ldquo;one who has gone to hell&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the lowest level of hell&rdquo; which is known as raorava or rasa&#x301;tala.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Speaking of u&#x301;ta reminds me of something that happened long ago. At that time I used to go and sit nearly every evening on the highest peak of the hills east of my town. I may have told a few people how I met Vireshavijay Vasumallik while sitting on the top of that peak. After sitting alone on the top of the hill for some time I would return home about nine o&#146;clock. I used to climb down from the hills not long after the sun had gone down behind them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->On this day, however, I was a little late coming down from the hills. By the time I reached the bottom it had grown completely dark in all directions. After sunset, a little light would still remain at the top, though it would be completely dark at the bottom of the hills. That day it had become quite dark even in the hilltops so when I reached the bottom it was pitch black. Not only was it a dark night but there was a blackout on in town at that time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->This was towards the end of British rule; the Second World War was in full swing, with the fiercest fighting in Europe and Southeast Asia. Most of Southeast Asia was then under the control of the Japanese. Japan had conquered Burma and the Indian National Army under the command of Subhas Chandra Bose had taken possession of the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Subhas Bose had given them new names. The Indian National Army had entered by then into Manipur (Imphal) by land and the war had reached its final stage, the stage in which one already knew what its outcome would be.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The coastal areas of Bengal were fortified so that Bengal could not be invaded either by land from Burma or by sea from the Andamans. Bengal&#146;s clocks were also moved ahead one hour from Indian Standard Time for work convenience. The submarines of the Indian National Army were spotted from time to time off the coast of Orissa. Most of the cycles and boats were removed from the Bengal coast so that the enemy would not be able to make use of them. Although this created difficulties for the common people it was necessary for defence purposes. Bombs were falling on Calcutta and in several other places in Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Blackouts were in force from city to city. In most places there were careful preparations taken against air attacks. Naturally, moving on the roads after dark had become extremely troublesome, so people used to finish work quite early and go home and close their doors and windows. Yes, even the windows had to be shut, otherwise the light from inside the houses would leak out into the streets and make it easy for the enemy to locate the site.

On the way was a huge banyan tree which at that time was extremely tall. Later, the large head of the tree was cut down to make it easier for planes to land. At any rate, I had to pass the banyan tree on my return. On my little finger I was wearing a solid gold ring which had been loose for the past few days. As I was passing the banyan tree the ring slipped off my finger. I couldn&#146;t use a torch to find it because first, it was prohibited and secondly, it would bring the military people rushing to the spot when they saw the torchlight in the distance. Apart from that, I was one of the people responsible for the arrangements against air attacks. Why should I break the rules just to save a ring?

The womenfolk used to spend their time under great duress. If not all, at least most of the men did not shoulder any responsibility for their offspring. Most of them were libertine. This is not to say that there were not any libertine woman, but the number of such women was less. Moreover, the affection they felt towards their children was a very strong bond of attachment which they could not easily break.

The same Shiva who applied a healing balm to human beings&#146; external life by inventing medicine and the science of healing also regulated all levels of human life and gave humanity the top rung as the supreme and final achievement.<!-- /block --></p>

Then, with the help of his followers, Shiva obliged those wicked men to marry by punishing them with the rod and rope. Just as there were libertine men, there were also some libertine women.

The students used to learn from their Rgvedic or Sa&#x301;mavedic teachers when and where the extra-long pronunciation should be used (the extra-long u is virtually non-existent in the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda). While writing, they would write u&#x301;. In olden times many sounds were pronounced as u&#x301; that with the passage of time became shortened to u. The prefix ut is one such sound; in olden times it was u&#x301;t. The followers of Shiva forced the makers of this u&#x301;h-u&#x301;h sound to marry and to accept the responsibility of caring for their offspring.

This vyu&#x301;d&#x301;ha Shiva in later times, and in modern Bengali, became bur&#x301;o Shiva. This word bur&#x301;o has not come from the word vrddha [old] &ndash; it has come from the word vyu&#x301;d&#x301;ha. Of course, the word bor&#x301;o shiva has come from the Bat&#x301;ukabhaerava or Bat&#x301;ukashiva of the Mahayana Buddhist era. Vat&#x301;uka &rarr; vad&#x301;ua &rarr; var&#x301;ua&#x301; &rarr; bor&#x301;o. Shiva saved the womenfolk from complete ruin. He also saved the men from cultural degradation. For this reason every person in the world is indebted to Shiva; women as a whole are especially indebted to him. The unmarried girls of today still worship Shiva with devotion carrying on the traditions of that long-past event.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Rc + kvip = Rk. The meaning of the verbal root rc is &ldquo;to glorify&rdquo; (through song or through ordinary language). Rk means &ldquo;hymn&rdquo;. In ancient times, with the beginning of civilization, the sages used to look upon the various manifestations of nature as the play of one God and they composed hymns for that god. When they used to sing in the name of U&#x301;s&#x301;a, Indra, Parjanya, Ma&#x301;tarishva&#x301;, Varun&#x301;a, that singing was called sa&#x301;ma. At that time script had not yet been invented, so the disciples used to learn by listening to the verbal teachings of the guru. These were all words of truth, words of knowledge and since they were words of knowledge, since they elevated the uncultured human beings towards the light of culture, they were called veda, or knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root vid is &ldquo;to know&rdquo;. The word veda is derived by adding the suffix al to the verbal root vid; it means &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. Seeing the written form of the word veda many phoneticians are of the opinion that it is derived with the suffix ghain&#x32D;; nevertheless it is derived with the suffix al and it is masculine. And due to the fact that there was no script and it had to be learned by hearing it from the mouth of the guru, its other name was shruti (shru + ktin). The verbal root shru means &ldquo;to hear&rdquo;. One meaning of the word shruti is &ldquo;ear&rdquo;; its other meaning is &ldquo;that which is learned by hearing with one&#146;s ear&rdquo;, or veda. Each shloka of the oldest portion of the Vedas was called a rk. When many rks were collected together to create a certain idea or expression, it was called su&#x301;kta. Many su&#x301;ktas together would comprise one man&#x301;d&#x301;ala.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Rgveda<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Rgveda is very old. Moreover, it is certain that Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yan&#x301;a Vya&#x301;sa had divided the Vedas into three separate parts &ndash; the oldest portion, the middle-age portion, and the late-era portion &ndash; well before the Jain era. Here I use the words &ldquo;well before the Jain era&rdquo; because the Vedas are mentioned in the Jain scriptures, which were written in the Pra&#x301;krta language. The propounder of the Jain religion, Varddhaman Maha&#x301;viir, was born a little over 2500 years ago, and the Pra&#x301;krta language originated between four thousand and five thousand years ago. Thus, whatever portion of the Vedas is considered to be the most recent, it is certainly more than five thousand years old. And in regard to the Jain scriptures, certain portions of it were composed before the era of Varddhaman Maha&#x301;viir by certain other Jain saints; still they are in no way more than five thousand years old.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The time of the composition of the Rgveda was approximately between fifteen thousand years ago and ten thousand years ago, that of the Yajurveda between ten thousand years ago and seven thousand years ago, and that of the Atharvaveda between seven thousand years ago and five thousand years ago. The Sa&#x301;maveda is not a Veda at all. The word sa&#x301;ma means &ldquo;song&rdquo;. The Sa&#x301;maveda was made later on from the music portions of the three Vedas, that is, the Sa&#x301;maveda is found within the Rgveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. When the Vedas were first divided they were divided into the Rk, Yajuh, and Atharva &ndash; these three parts. But the Sa&#x301;maveda is mentioned in the Jain scriptures, that is, the Vedas had already been divided into three parts at the time of the origin of the Jain scriptures, and the Sa&#x301;maveda had already been created from the music portions of the three Vedas. Just as the Vedas could not be written down due to the lack of written script, it may also be that the early Jain saints, however old they may have been, were not able to record their teachings through the medium of written script. Varddhaman Maha&#x301;viir&#146;s time was after the discovery of script, thus in his time the Jain scriptures were written down and they were written down in the Pra&#x301;krta language of that time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Varddhaman Maha&#x301;viir&#146;s birthplace was Vaeshali in eastern India. Magadha and Rarh are the lands of spiritual propagation. Thus, it is an easily discovered fact that whatever he spoke or wrote was in the prevalent Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta language of the day. So it will not be enough to say that the language of the Jain scriptures was Pra&#x301;krta &ndash; there were seven main Pra&#x301;krta languages. The language of the Jain scriptures was one among them, that is, Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->There was no script during the time of the Rgveda, so it was not written down. Nor was there any script during the time of the Yajurveda, so it could also not be written down. Written script was invented during the time of the Atharvaveda. But since the Rk and Yajuh portions of the Vedas could not be written down, during the time of the composition of the Atharvaveda, that is, at the time of the composition of the last portion of the Vedas, people thought that the Vedas should perhaps not be written. Thus the Atharva portion remained unwritten like the Rk and Yajuh portions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The Atharvaveda&#146;s a&#x301;darsha purus&#x301;a (the first propounder or main propounder was called a&#x301;darsha purus&#x301;a at that time) was Brahmars&#x301;i Atharva. He was most likely from Central Asia, but this is not to say that one can say for certain that he was not an original inhabitant of India. Still, there is no doubt that the propounders of the later portions of the Atharvaveda were inhabitants of India, especially Mahars&#x301;i Vaedarbhi because Vidarbha was the name of a settlement in the central-western portion of India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yan&#x301;a Vya&#x301;sa is renowned as Vedavya&#x301;sa for having divided the Vedas into three main portions (Rk, Yajuh, and Atharva). There is a great  difference of opinion about this word vya&#x301;sa. There are many historical figures named Vya&#x301;sa, however, careful observation shows us that Vya&#x301;sa is not a name; it is a hereditary title. Va&#x301;dara&#x301;yan&#x301;a Vya&#x301;sa, Sain&#x32D;jaya Vya&#x301;sa, Vivasvata Vya&#x301;sa &ndash; their titles were all Vya&#x301;sa, not their name.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The name of the Vya&#x301;sa who divided the Vedas was Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yan&#x301;a Vya&#x301;sa. He was born in a fisherman&#146;s family (Kaevarta [a fishing caste]) on a blackish island<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> that rose out of the waters of the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna at Prayag, and for this reason the people gave him the name Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  This Krs&#x301;n&#x301;advaepa&#x301;yan&#x301;a or Vedavya&#x301;sa was the composer of the Mahabharata. The Mahabharata was composed long, long, long after the Vedas, but nonetheless it is undoubtedly more than three thousand years old.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Although the Rgveda is mainly concerned with hymns, it also contains various tales and anecdotes. While not all of these stories and tales carry equal spiritual value, they are representative of the cultural heritage of those ancient humans. They paint a portrait of the gradual advancement of human thinking and the structure of society. When considered from this point of view, the language, literature and expression of the Rgveda is of special value to the world. While it is true that there was no script during the Rgvedic age, phonemes and phonetic expression as well as the order of the sounds, interpolation and placement (the method of arranging the sounds) were in existence. The different Rgvedic styles of pronunciation for the various letters were in vogue which the followers of the Rgveda would learn orally from the guru in subsequent times. I have talked about this to some extent here and there in our language books. If time permits I will discuss the subject further at a later date.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In the Vedas, especially in the Rgveda, a special rule can be seen for the naming of the rks and su&#x301;ktas. Normally the rk is named according to the name by which the Supreme Consciousness is addressed. Where the Supreme Consciousness is not addressed by any particular name, then that su&#x301;kta, or in certain cases that rk also, is named with the help of the first word. The third characteristic is that in most cases the rks were composed in certain metres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->There are seven main metres: ga&#x301;yattrii, us&#x301;n&#x301;ika, tris&#x301;t&#x301;upa, anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa, brhatii, jagatii and pam&#x301;kti. Besides this, because there was no authoritative grammar in that language (that is, the Vedic language)  whereby differences between the metre and the prevalent unwritten grammar of the day could be resolved according to rules, the custom was in vogue of violating the grammar according to one&#146;s convenience by cutting, reducing, increasing or even changing sounds in order to keep the metre intact. One accepted name of the rk 310/62 that we generally call the ga&#x301;yattrii mantra is savitr rk &ndash; not ga&#x301;yattrii mantra. Ga&#x301;yattrii is the name of a particular metre, not the name of a mantra or a rk. In the concerning rk, Parama Purus&#x301;a is addressed as &ldquo;Savita&#x301;&rdquo; (the word is derived by adding the suffix trn&#x301;/trc to the verbal root su&#x301;). Thus the rk&#146;s name is &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo;. At the beginning of one su&#x301;kta in the first man&#x301;d&#x301;ala of the Rgveda we find:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->At the beginning of the su&#x301;kta the word na&#x301;sada has been used, thus the name of the su&#x301;kta is na&#x301;sadiiya su&#x301;kta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The aforementioned &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo; has been composed in the ga&#x301;yattrii metre. Each line of the ga&#x301;yattrii metre contains eight syllables. It has three lines, thus it is composed of twenty-four syllables. The rk is as follows:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->If we analyse the rk we find eight syllables in the second line: bhar, go, de, va, sya, dhii, ma and hi. In the third line there are: dhi, yo, yo, nah, pra, co, da and ya&#x301;t. But in the first line we see only seven syllables: tat, sa, vi, tur, va, re and n&#x301;yam&#x301;, that is, it is one syllable shorter. Thus, in this case, at the time of pronouncing it, the pronunciation of that time, and of today also, will be in violation of the current unwritten grammatical rules of that day &ndash; tat, sa, vi, tur,  va, re, n&#x301;i and am&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->At the beginning of the mantra, (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om&#x301; bhu&#x301;rbhuvah-svah (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om&#x301; is added and after the mantra (<span class=Bengali>&#x09FA;</span>)om&#x301; is again added. These are not originally from the Rgveda; they are from the Atharvaveda. The mantra is the collective expression of the seven-layered manifestation of Parama Brahma &ndash; bhu&#x301;rbhuvah-svah-maha-jana-tapa-satya. But where the crude, subtle and causal worlds are used as a short form of the seven lokas then only bhu&#x301;rbhuvah-svah, the names of these three lokas are used; for them the word maha&#x301;vya&#x301;hrti [supreme utterance] used to be used. They are not a portion or a part of the original Rgvedic &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo;. For purposes of practice the pronunciation of the &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo; is:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->By adding this maha&#x301;vya&#x301;hrti the meaning of the &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo; is strengthened. It was added for this reason. By adding the maha&#x301;vya&#x301;hrti the meaning of the mantra becomes clearer. &ldquo;In this bhu&#x301;r-bhuvah-svah, that is, crude, subtle and causal worlds, we are meditating on the excellent effulgence of Savita&#x301;, or the father, so that he might guide our dhii, or intellect, to the path of truth.&rdquo; Awakening the inspiration to get spiritual direction from Parama Purus&#x301;a with the help of this mantra is called &ldquo;Vedic initiation&rdquo;. Later on, when the person gets proper instructions in spiritual practice for moving on the spiritual path then that is called &ldquo;Tantric initiation&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The Rgveda was considered the chief Veda in ancient times, not only because of the value of its antiquity, but because Vedic initiation was more or less based on the &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo; of the Rgveda, although as regards the adjustment between the spiritual world with the material world for a spiritual aspirant, the Yajurveda surpasses the Rgveda in importance. In terms of pronunciation and phonetics the Yajurveda is quite different from the Rgveda. The Yajurveda had closer contact with Tantra. And the Atharva was mixed with Tantra at nearly every step. At one time the orthodox priests declared the followers of the Atharvaveda to be socially outcast; they said atharva&#x301;nnam&#x301; ma&#x301; bhuin&#x32D;jiitha&#x301;h, that is, the food of the followers of the Atharvaveda should not be accepted.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix thak to the verbal root rc we get the word rktha. The etymological meaning of the word rktha is &ldquo;one who is praised by people repeatedly&rdquo;. Colloquially rk means &ldquo;transferable wealth&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;gold&rdquo;. Gold is also a transferable, highly praiseworthy form of wealth. For this reason rktha also means &ldquo;gold&rdquo;. Pitrrktha means &ldquo;paternal wealth&rdquo;. The etymological meaning of rktha&#x301;siina is &ldquo;one who is sitting on money&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;one who possesses much wealth but does not engage in charity and meditation, who does not want to be generous even in regards to his own needs&rdquo;.

By adding the suffix uku to rn&#x301;j we get the word rju. The meaning of the word rju is &ldquo;one who moves straight ahead&rdquo; or &ldquo;that which is straightforward&rdquo;. If a room has a window in the eastern wall and directly across from it is a window in the western wall, then we say that the two windows are rju-rju. In many places in Bengal rju-rju is pronounced &ldquo;roojoo-roojoo&rdquo;. This is not a mistake. The Atharvavedic pronunciation of the letter r is &ldquo;roo&rdquo;. Thus it is not to be condemned if one writes rju-rju and pronounces it &ldquo;roojoo-roojoo&rdquo;. But there is no need to spell it ruju-ruju; it can be spelled rju-rju.<!-- /block --></p>

Just as in practical life, a straight life, a rju life,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is beneficial and leads to welfare, in spiritual life also the straight path is the path of welfare.

Rn&#x301;j/rrn&#x301;j + kta gives us the word rn&#x301;a. The etymological meaning of rn&#x301;a is &ldquo;that which entangles a person in net after net in each moment&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;debt&rdquo;. One who gives a loan is called uttamarn&#x301;a (uttama + rn&#x301;a) and one who takes a loan is called adhamarn&#x301;a (adhama + rn&#x301;a). In ancient times rn&#x301;a used to be spelled with a long rr but both spellings are correct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->According to the scriptures there are four kinds of debts which cannot be paid back. They are: debt to one&#146;s father, debt to one&#146;s mother, debt to one&#146;s a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya and debt to one&#146;s guru. The debt of affection that binds a person to his or her father as the source of his or her birth and as the person who rears them cannot be discharged. The saints and sages have said: &ldquo;If one dedicates oneself to the welfare of every man on earth then the debt to one&#146;s father can be paid back a little, but not completely. Similarly, if one dedicates oneself to the welfare of every woman on earth then one&#146;s debt to one&#146;s mother can be paid back a little, but not completely. If one tries without discrimination to bring knowledge to all human beings then one&#146;s debt to one&#146;s a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> can be paid back a little, not completely. As regards one&#146;s debt to guru, if one tries to propagate spiritual ideology amongst all people of the world then one can, to a very small extent (like a bubble in the sea), pay back one&#146;s debt to the Tantra guru<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  from whom one has received instructions in the path of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.&rdquo; This debt is almost completely non-dischargeable.

<a name="6..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the verbal root r is &ldquo;to move rhythmically&rdquo;, &ldquo;to advance without resistance&rdquo;. By adding the suffix kta to r we get the word rta. Rta means &ldquo;influential&rdquo;, &ldquo;enriching&rdquo;, &ldquo;revealing the fact&rdquo;, &ldquo;truth&rdquo;. That over which the influence of vyatha&#x301; [pain] has spread is vyatha&#x301; + rta = vyatha&#x301;rta. That over which the influence of shoka [grief] has spread is shoka + rta = shoka&#x301;rta. That over which the influence of vanya&#x301; [flood] has spread is vanya&#x301; + rta = vanya&#x301;rta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->In the opinion of the yogic scriptures there is an ideological difference between rta and satya. That which is a fact, which has happened or happens, is called rta. And the ideation used for the welfare of the people is called satya. Parahita&#x301;rtham&#x301; va&#x301;unmanaso yatha&#x301;rthatvam&#x301; satyam. &ldquo;Using one&#146;s mind or speech out of a spirit of welfare for others is satya.&rdquo; It is said that one should take the shelter of satya, not rta. If a person takes shelter in your house out of fear of a wicked person and afterwards that wicked person comes up to you and asks: &ldquo;Is that fellow here?&rdquo;, in that case, an innocent person&#146;s life is endangered. Here, if one is to follow satya then one will have to say: &ldquo;No, he is not here.&rdquo; In this way an innocent person will be saved from being murdered or tortured at the hands of a wicked person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->If, by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a person can elevate his or her unit existence and bring the crude, or conscious mind to the level of the subtle, or subconscious mind, and thereafter, going even higher, elevate the subtle or subconscious mind to the level of the causal, or unconscious mind, then in that condition the person gains full awareness of the past, present and future. This experience or realization in the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; comprises a state similar to the stance of the supreme attainment of intuition. About this state it has been said: rtambhara&#x301; tatra prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> I have just said that this state is very close to the state of supreme thought, supreme ideation.

<a name="6..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->By adding the suffix tu to the verbal root r we get the word rtu. Generally, words derived with the suffix tu are masculine. The import of the word rtu is &ldquo;one who comes in one&#146;s own rhythmic motion, in one&#146;s self-rhythm, whether others want it or not&rdquo;. Thus the etymological meaning of the word rtu is &ldquo;any characteristic division of time&rdquo;, whether it be age, year, season, month, fortnight, week, day, hour, minute or second. But colloquially, rtu means &ldquo;that measure of time which is distinguished by specific characteristics&rdquo; such as griis&#x301;ma rtu [summer season], vars&#x301;a&#x301; rtu [rainy season], and so forth. Generally, in the equatorial and tropical regions of the earth one rtu [season] is two months.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->The verbal root rs&#x301; has many meanings, one of which is &ldquo;to rise upwards&rdquo;. This verbal root rs&#x301; is used for moving up from one floor of a house to one above it. By adding the suffix in to the verbal root rs&#x301; we get the word rs&#x301;i whose etymological meaning is &ldquo;one who rises upwards&rdquo;; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;a person of elevated mind, elevated intellect, elevated thought&rdquo;. Although the feminine form of the word rs&#x301;i is rs&#x301;ya&#x301;, the word rs&#x301;i can also be used as common gender. That is, a woman can be called rs&#x301;i just as a man can.

<a name="6..69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->During the time of the Atharvaveda, its propounder or originator (in the Vedic language a&#x301;darsha purus&#x301;a), Atharva&#x301;, was honoured as brahmars&#x301;i. A number of rs&#x301;is were revered as mahars&#x301;i, some of whom deserve special mention. They were Mahars&#x301;is Atri, Aungira&#x301;, Aungirasa, Pulaha, Pulasta, Satyava&#x301;ha, Vashis&#x301;t&#x301;ha and Vaedarbhi. Those who believe that the Vedas were composed entirely outside of India cannot go unopposed. At least not in the case of the Atharvaveda. There is clear proof that the rs&#x301;i named Vaedarbhi was a man of Vidarbha, that is, the Nagpur-Amaravatii region. It is hard to imagine Mahars&#x301;i Vaedarbhi travelling all the way to Central Asia and staying there to compose the Atharvaveda. On the other hand it may well be that the entire Atharvaveda was not composed in India. Mahars&#x301;i Atharva&#x301; was the a&#x301;darsha purus&#x301;a of the Atharvaveda. He was also respected as an elderly person. Even today we say about very aged people: &ldquo;He has become Atharva&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->Bear in mind that rs&#x301;i and muni are not the same thing. I have already said quite a lot about rs&#x301;i.

If we climb a mountain which is bare, or bereft of plants and trees, and full of stones, then we will scratch and cut our hands and feet. Thus another colloquial meaning of rks&#x301;a is &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;. If any particular country is cut and bitten until it sheds blood and is forced to the brink of destruction, then we can say about that country: &ldquo;At one time this was a golden land but nowadays it is destitute, ruined, rks&#x301;a.&rdquo; It is only fitting that every righteous person in the world make efforts to increase the wealth of the world&#146;s rks&#x301;a countries.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The word eka is derived by adding the suffix kan to the verbal root in. The meaning of the verbal root in is &ldquo;to advance obliquely or tapering to a point, while moving quickly&rdquo;. Tiryak &rarr; tirachaa &rarr; teracha &rarr; tiracha&#x301; / teracha&#x301; / terecha&#x301;. Where multiple ideas or propensities or purposes become pointed like a needle, become centered in a point, while moving in rapid step, then the verbal root in is used for that style of moving. That is, the etymological meaning of the verbal root in is &ldquo;to become pointed&rdquo;, &ldquo;to arrive at a single point after abandoning multiplicity&rdquo;. Thus the verbal root in implies leading the many forward on the path of synthesis. By adding the suffix kan to this verbal root in we get the word eka. The etymological meaning of the word eka is &ldquo;the point of a needle&rdquo;. Since the point of a needle cannot be many, cannot be two-three-four-five, its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;one&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This word eka, derived from the verbal root in, is originally Rgvedic. In this world there are a great many languages descended from Vedic. Latin and its European descendants are all Vedic. The northern languages of Central Asia are descended from Vedic. The languages of south and southeast Asia are either descended from Vedic or have vocabularies which are rich in Vedic words. From the Rgvedic word eka we get the old Persian word iyak which carries the same meaning. From this word iyak, in later times, comes the word ik in several languages, and from the numerical adjective ik we get the words ika&#x301;i, ikka&#x301; and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There are many words used in Vedic which come from eka such as ekada&#x301;, ekaka, eka&#x301;kii, and many others. Eka + ka = ekaka [solitary] which means &ldquo;where work and business are centered on one&rdquo;. Eka&#x301;kii [alone] means &ldquo;absence of multiplicity&rdquo;. Ekada&#x301; means &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo;. By adding the suffix da&#x301;c to the root eka in the nominal inflection we get this word ekada&#x301; which means &ldquo;at one certain time&rdquo;. By adding the suffix dha&#x301;c to the root eka we get the word ekadha&#x301; which means &ldquo;to flow in a single stream&rdquo; or &ldquo;to proceed with a single inspiration&rdquo;. The suffix da&#x301;c is generally used to signify &ldquo;temporal succession&rdquo; and the suffix dha&#x301;c &ldquo;continuity&rdquo;. Shatadha&#x301; [hundredfold] means &ldquo;to be carried in the flow of shata [one hundred];&rdquo; similarly, bahudha&#x301; [in many ways] means &ldquo;to advance in the flow of bahu [many].&rdquo; I wanted to explain the meaning of a few words derived from eka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Roughly speaking, the languages descended from Vedic include the majority of the European languages, the Middle-East&#146;s Turkish language, Armenian, Farsi, Uzbeki, Tazaki, Kazaki, Pashtu, Kashmiri, Pahari or Pahari Punjabi, Dogri, Punjabi, Sindhi, Multani, Hariyanwi, Hindustani, Marwari, Dhundharu, Miwati, Haraoti, Mewari, Malwi, Kacchi, Kathiawari, Gujrati, Marathi, Khandeshi, Niwari, Barari, Konkani, Garhwali, Kumayuni, Brajabhasa, Awadhi, Bundeli, Bagheli, Chattisgari, Halwi, Bhojpuri, Magahi, Nagpuri or Sadri or Sadani, Sambalpuri, Oriya, Bengali, Singhali, Angika, Maethilii, Gorkhali (Nepali) and Assamese.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Besides the languages descended from Vedic, there are many languages in the world which are not Vedic in origin but which contain a great number of Vedic Sanskrit words. In some cases the number is greater than that of some Vedic descendants. For example, among the Dravidian languages (dra&#x301;mil  &rarr; dra&#x301;vil  &rarr; dra&#x301;vir&#x301;  &rarr; ta&#x301;mil), the proportion of Sanskrit words in Malayalam is greater than that of the pure Vedic language Kashmiri. There is also a great abundance of Sanskrit words in Telugu and Kannad. In both the Thai and Indonesian languages, there is such an abundance of Sanskrit words that it exceeds that of Pashtu,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> a direct descendant. Those languages which are not descendants of Vedic or Sanskrit, but which contain a great abundance of Sanskrit or Vedic words, we can call snigdha tadbhava [adopted descendants]. Each member of the Malay group of languages of southeast Asia (Malay, Sumatran, Balian, Javan, Tagalog, etc.) is an &ldquo;adopted descendant&rdquo;. The amount of adopted descent among the Indo-Burman languages is not equal in each case; the greatest affinity to Vedic among these languages is found in the Thai language (Siamese). There is no other language existing outside of India that has such a large Vedic and Sanskrit vocabulary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Although there is some small Chinese influence in the pronunciation of the Siamese language and dialects, the influence of the Gaod&#x301;iiya (Bengali) style of Sanskrit pronunciation is significantly greater. The reason for this is most likely because a prince of Rarh, Sahasrabahu, founded his kingdom there in ancient times. After conquering parts of Thailand and Malaysia, he annexed them into his own kingdom and named his capital Singhapur (Singapore) after the capital of Rarh.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Since the country was always shya&#x301;mala [green] he named it Shya&#x301;madesh. In recent times the name of Shya&#x301;madesh has been changed, of course, but the word shya&#x301;ma<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is still quite current in the people&#146;s daily life there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Anyhow, Sahasrabahu&#146;s conquest of Siam took place approximately two thousand years ago. While staying in Thailand this fact especially attracted this writer&#146;s ear. Many words that were used in the Bengali of that time (Eastern Demi-Ma&#x301;gadhii) still survive today in their original form in the Thai language. As a final word I will add that without the proper cultivation of the Sanskrit language, it is impossible, not only in the field of the science of language, but also in the world of psychic expression, to be considered a true scholar or learned person. The cultivation and teaching of Sanskrit is indispensable in the world of education. And although it is a little off the subject, it is good to mention here that as far as race or community or nation goes, while the Bengalees are Austrico-Mongolo-Negroid with little Aryan influence, the Bengali language is of pure Sanskrit lineage.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Ekars&#x301;i. Eka + rs&#x301;i = ekars&#x301;i. Ekars&#x301;i is the name of a kind of fire which was considered very sacred by ancient people. In the Vedas it is written:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Vra&#x301;tyastvam&#x301; pra&#x301;n&#x301;asya rs&#x301;iratta&#x301; vishvasya satpatih;<br>Vayama&#x301;dyasya da&#x301;ta&#x301;rah pita&#x301; tvam&#x301; ma&#x301;tarishva nah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the Atharvaveda, the word Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a is frequently used for Parama Purus&#x301;a. For Parama&#x301; Prakrti the words Rayi, Raya&#x301; and Raye are used. In this shloka it is said, &ldquo;O Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, O Parama Purus&#x301;a, You are a high, great object, as sacred as the ekars&#x301;i fire. Conversely, You are a very ordinary object like any other object. This universe is finally dissolved in You.&rdquo; (Atta&#x301; means &ldquo;eater, devourer&rdquo;.) &ldquo;O Parama Purus&#x301;a, we offer ghee and many other objects for Your satisfaction. You are the very dynamism, the mobility, inherent in the existence of all entities.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In prehistoric days, human beings did not know about fire. Prehistoric human beings used to live on fruits, roots, tender green leaves and raw meat. Those places where the Aryans used to live were also teeming with white bears, wolves and other animals. The Aryans would fall prey to attacks by these animals, but they also used to kill them with the help of their stone weapons. The raw meat of the animals they killed, especially the liver, spleen and heart, was their favourite food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->They knew neither how to light a fire, nor the use of fire. Out of fear and devotion they used to venerate Agni [fire-god] as their deity. They used to be afraid of lightening and believed that when the earth shook it was because it was afraid of lightening, that the earth was terrified. Indra, the king of this lightening was the absolute authority, so he was the best of all. One root meaning of the word indra is &ldquo;best&rdquo;. To them Indra deserved worship. The god of snow-storms, Marut [the wind], was another venerable entity to them. The huge waves of the sea brought terror to their minds, thus Varun&#x301;a, the god of the sea, was another of their chief deities. Agni, Marut, Indra, Varun&#x301;a and the rest stood out before these prehistoric humans as their chief gods. Behind these powerful, mighty, variously-manifest entities was another solitary entity. Those who searched for Him were the rs&#x301;is of that initial era. With this search the first dawn of the Vedas filled humanity&#146;s eastern cultural horizon with its crimson light.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The days passed. A few thousand years went by. They used to wear animal skins, not to cover their shame, but rather to save themselves from the cold&#146;s fierce grip (for this they used the verbal root u&#x301;rn&#x301;u). Such was the condition of the humans of those days. Language was still undeveloped and they had yet to discover script, but they used to band together and live in mountain caves, and they used bone and stone implements. With the help of these implements they would draw pictures depicting their prehistoric thinking and experiences. These were the oldest examples of their art.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Time continued its inexorable march. Human beings discovered fire. The discovery of fire, or better to say, the invention of fire, marked the most significant day in human history. After the invention of fire, people began to use it. It took a few more centuries to refine the uses of fire. Gradually, people learned to use fire properly. They learned to eat roasted meat instead of raw meat and to make other kinds of food much tastier by partially cooking them.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> They learned the use of salt. Earlier they used to satisfy their bodies&#146; need for salt by licking salty earth. Ultimately, with the help of fire and other means, they were able to produce salt and learned how to use it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->We can look at this special stage of human civilization as the time when prehistoric humans stepped into the periphery and power of history. After the terrifying night of their dark caves, the first dawn of optimism started to peep over their eastern horizon. The crimson dawn was another of their gods.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->This first moment of the invention of fire distinguished human beings as the greatest of living creatures. Through the use of fire, sky-kissing civilizations were built that could give everything to humankind &ndash; everything, that is, except life&#146;s deeper beatitude. One of the contributions civilization did make was to give humans an engulfing, domineering pride over all life. This pride may one day tumble them from the highest peaks down to the ground and turn them into dust.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Fire is indispensable. Humans cannot survive without fire. Metallurgy, and the manufacture of wheels, vehicles, weapons, agricultural tools and weaving machines, are all by the grace of fire. It is not an easy task to prepare fire. In the initial stage, they produced fire through the frictional heat of rubbing two pieces of flint together. Fire could not be kept by just anybody. A few rs&#x301;is [sages] were designated to keep fire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In those days, people lived mainly in the forests, constructing shelters in tall trees in imitation of birds&#146; nests, or in mountain caves. Gotra [which also came to mean &ldquo;clan&rdquo;] was the Vedic word for both &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; and &ldquo;large forest&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->In the beginning, a head woman would be the leader of each gotra. She was the gotrama&#x301;ta&#x301; [matriarch]. Later came the age of male dominance. The head of the gotra would then be a male rs&#x301;i. His followers took pride in the rs&#x301;i, who was designated to keep the fire. That fire-keeping sage was called a sa&#x301;gnik or a&#x301;gnihotrii. He would worship fire as a holy god. He would offer sumptuous foods into the fire for the satisfaction of A&#x301;gni, the fire-god. This was called havana. The general term for these offerings and sacrifices was yajin&#x32D;a. The word yajin&#x32D;a (yaj + na) means &ldquo;action&rdquo;, a special type of action, an auspicious action. The root verb yaj means &ldquo;to do a work&rdquo;. Yaj + ghain&#x32D; = ya&#x301;ga. When a sa&#x301;gnik fell ill or was absent, his patnii [wife] or son would protect the fire and provide it fuel. In this connection, I would like to discuss something about the meaning of the term patnii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Prior to Lord Shiva, there was no institution of marriage in human society. As fathers and mothers were not bound by the ties of duty, the innocent children suffered tremendous hardship. The mothers had to bear a great burden as they had to shoulder the entire responsibility of rearing the children. The result was that the women&#146;s progress in different spheres of life was thwarted. Shiva, through the application of logic and strength, forced husbands and wives into a social bond. That was the first time social marriage took place in this world. The system that Shiva introduced has continued in different ways throughout the world into the modern age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->After Shiva&#146;s time, opportunistic men divided the social status of women into various categories. We can roughly analyse the following levels:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><b>Patnii</b>: A patnii enjoyed equal religious and social rights as her husband.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Her children were entitled to all religious and social rights as their inheritance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><b>Ja&#x301;ya&#x301;</b>: A ja&#x301;ya&#x301; was deprived of the religious rights, but was entitled to the social rights of her husband. Her children were entitled to the religious and social rights of their father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph --><b>Bha&#x301;rya&#x301;</b>: A bha&#x301;rya&#x301; was not allowed any of the religious or social rights of her husband. But as the marriage was recognized, her children were entitled to the religious and social rights of their father. A bha&#x301;rya&#x301; was married only to perpetuate the lineage, not to give the woman dignity. That&#146;s why it was declared: Puttra&#x301;rthe kriyate bha&#x301;rya&#x301; [&ldquo;A bha&#x301;rya&#x301; is taken on only for the sake of male children&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><b>Kalatra</b>: Some time before the Buddhist age, the system of kalatra was introduced, but it did not receive encouragement in the Buddhist period. It remained in an obscure form, but later gained ascendancy in the post-Buddhist age. In this husband-wife relationship, the wife did not enjoy the religious and social rights of her husband. The children were also denied any of the paternal religious or social rights; they inherited their mother&#146;s gotra, caste and social rights according to the system of anuloma and pratiloma.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> For instance, if the father was a Vipra, an &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;, and the mother a Shu&#x301;dra, their child did not receive its father&#146;s caste; that is, the child was not a Vipra, but was put into the caste of its mother, that is, was treated as a Shu&#x301;dra. Or suppose the father belonged to the Bharadva&#x301;j Gotra. His child did not necessarily belong to the Bharadva&#x301;j Gotra. For instance, if the mother&#146;s gotra was Ka&#x301;shyapa, then her child belonged to the Ka&#x301;shyapa Gotra. If, furthermore, the marriage was not socially recognized, the children were not entitled even to their mother&#146;s gotra and caste. They were vra&#x301;tya [outcaste].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The word vra&#x301;tya occurs in the shloka in the earlier part of this essay. That is, in the period when this shloka was composed there was a rejected fifth caste suggested by this word vra&#x301;tya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Although kalatra means &ldquo;wife&rdquo;, it is neuter gender. It will not be declined as kalatrah or kalatra&#x301; but as kalatram.

<a name="7..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->(Similarly, the word da&#x301;ra means &ldquo;wife&rdquo;, but it is in masculine gender and plural number. So its declension will be like that of nara [&ldquo;man&rdquo;]. That is why when it is declined in the first case, it will always be da&#x301;ra&#x301;. When it is used in a sentence, da&#x301;ra is changed into da&#x301;ra&#x301;. But as the original word is da&#x301;ra, the Sanskrit expression is da&#x301;ra parigraha [&ldquo;to take a wife&rdquo;], not da&#x301;ra&#x301; parigraha when used in the sense of a man&#146;s marriage. A widower will be called mrtada&#x301;ra, not mrtada&#x301;ra&#x301;, a bachelor is akrtada&#x301;ra and not akrtada&#x301;ra&#x301;.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Needless to say, as the children of kalatras were not entitled to paternal religious and social rights, they were not permitted to keep fire either. If a kalatra marriage was socially recognized, the children were entitled to the maternal religious and social rights.

<a name="7..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph --><b>Niyoga custom</b>: When the kuliina [high born] system abruptly burst forth like a meteor or comet, cursing the whole society, its corollary, niyoga, spontaneously burgeoned.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->It was extremely difficult for the kuliinas who married so many women to maintain them all with food and clothes. Some of the wives stayed in their husband&#146;s house and the rest of the wives would remain in their fathers&#146; houses. In many cases, even though a child of a kuliina wife was recognized as the legitimate child of its mother&#146;s lawful husband, usually it was the offspring of a socially unrecognized mate of the wife. These socially unrecognized mates were called niyoga pati [niyoga husband]. The children would call that particular man niyoga pita&#x301; [niyoga father], and the children were niyoga putra [niyoga sons]. The Pandava brothers of the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata were the niyoga putras of different fathers. Society somewhat accepted this system. Although the children inherited the gotra and caste of their mother&#146;s legitimate husband, or even his social and religious rights, they did not inherit the natural inheritable qualities of their fathers, as there was no blood relation between the husband and the niyoga putras. In this niyoga system, the number of kuliinas increased by leaps and bounds, but the standard of quality could not be kept. The inevitable result of this ugly system was that the intellectual level of the kuliinas gradually declined. The children of the niyoga pita&#x301; could inherit the social and religious rights of their socially-accepted father, but were not authorized from the paternal side to keep fire. Most of them were not born or brought up in the paternal home, rather they would stay with their maternal uncles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph --><b>Pratiloma</b>: In the cases where the father was of an upper caste and the mother was of a lower caste, the offspring born under such an anuloma system were entitled to their father&#146;s gotra and caste but not his religious and social rights.

But in the matrilineal social system the children would inherit the mother&#146;s gotra, caste and social and religious rights.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->But if the marriage took place under the pratiloma system, the children were only entitled to their father&#146;s gotra, but not his caste nor any other rights whatsoever. Nor were they entitled to their mother&#146;s gotra, caste, or social and religious rights. Hundreds of castes and sub-castes were created due to the children born out of this socially-unacceptable pratiloma system.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->You can easily understand from these events and various marriage systems that women were merely playthings in the hands of a group of opportunistic, capricious men. Today their position has changed on paper, but the actual position remains virtually the same as before. People guided by righteous intellect should be vocal against these ugly customs and injustices to women. Further, they should work to abolish these things without any more delay. The path which Lord Shiva showed for social emancipation should be adhered to by His followers. The path should be made wider, paved well, and made easily accessible, instead of making it more thorny.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->What I have said about the preservation of the sacred fire was the norm but there were some few exceptions. There were even some rs&#x301;is who did the various works for preserving the fire by themselves such as the fire rituals, feeding it with wood and so on. They did not even take the help of their sons and wives. A fire that was preserved and tended by one such rs&#x301;i was known as ekars&#x301;i. An ekars&#x301;i fire was considered extremely holy. The shloka which was quoted at the beginning refers to Parama Purus&#x301;a as being as ordinary as an outcaste and also as holy an entity as an ekars&#x301;i fire, that is, He is the best of the best and the commonest of the common, the supreme of the supreme and the lowest point among all low points.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->In ancient times there was the custom of interring a person after death or floating the body on water. After the discovery and invention of fire people considered it proper to burn the dead body. Thus in the pre-Vedic and at the beginning of the Vedic era the prevalent custom was to bury the body. In later times, much later times, the system of cremation came into vogue. When the system of cremation became common people used to think: This rs&#x301;i who tended, preserved and meticulously served the fire throughout his life with the help of orally-pronounced mantras will no longer preserve the fire with the help of those mantras. Thus, at the time of offering his dead body to the fire, the ekars&#x301;i fire should first touch his mouth one last time; then let the burning grass or hay consume the rest of him. This custom of touching the mouth with the ekars&#x301;i fire gradually became transformed into a social tradition. Those who did not maintain the ekars&#x301;i fire also had fire put into their mouths. The rule was even introduced for those who had nothing to do with the fire at all. What was tradition became a compulsory social observation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->When superstition entangles a person it likes to tie him up thoroughly, step by step. This fire-in-the-mouth ritual became one such type of thing. The priestly tradition also devised a new mantra to accompany this putting of fire in the mouth; this mantra has no relationship with the ekars&#x301;i fire of ancient times. I do not even like to think about the abominable way we put fire in the mouth of our recently departed loved ones at the time of performing their funeral rites. The mantra also is also unusual. The common people either do not understand the mantra or recite it out of fear; it bears no relationship whatsoever to the original ekars&#x301;i fire.<!-- /block --></p>

Some of them had frets and others not. Just think of it! Shiva had to make practically superhuman efforts with this primitive <I>viin&#x301;a&#x301;</I>. He had to invent the scale. He had to string his instrument very carefully to get the proper sound. It was Shiva who made the <I>ra&#x301;gas</I> and <I>ra&#x301;gin&#x301;iis</I>. He introduced soul-stirring modulation into them. He felt the need for musical metre &ndash; without metre and tempo there could be no song. To maintain the rhythm he invented the horn and the <I>d&#x301;ambaru</I> [a small drum shaped like an hourglass]. In the post-Shiva, Vedic era this tabor and horn took the form of the <I>mrdaun&#x32D;ga</I>. That was during the end of the Yajurvedic <I></I>era and the beginning of the Atharvavedic <I></I>era.

The meaning of the verbal root anj is &ldquo;of some portion going out or advancing from the original structure&rdquo;. For this reason hands and feet and so forth are called the aun&#x32D;ga of the body. Thus, etymologically, one who has only one aun&#x32D;ga is eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga; its colloquial meaning is &ldquo;the planet Mercury&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->In most cases planets are those heavenly bodies that revolve around stars, such as the earth, Mars, Mercury, Saturn and so on. When several or more stars collectively resemble a certain animal or some other figure, and if they rest within the orbit of the sun and moon or other planets of this solar system then they are called &ldquo;constellation&rdquo;(ra&#x301;shi). A star or group of stars located in any of the portions of a constellation is called naks&#x301;atra. The smaller heavenly bodies that revolve around planets are called &ldquo;satellites&rdquo;, that is, the heavenly bodies that revolve around stars are called planets (graha) and the heavenly bodies that revolve around planets are called satellites (upagraha). For example, the earth&#146;s satellite is the moon; Mars&#146;s satellites are Deimos (daetya) and Phobos (bhaya). Because of the proximity of Saturn&#146;s satellites from one another they appear to form a ring. Thus Saturn has a ring of satellites revolving around it. In ancient times astrologers were unable to find any satellite of Mercury so they gave it the name eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..122"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=122 type=paragraph -->When stars move in circum-rotarian fashion while remaining in a liquid or gaseous state then small portions of these stars shoot off and go into orbit around them. These portions of stars that break off and go into orbit around them are known as planets. It is not that a large portion always breaks away from the parent body; small and extremely small portions also break away. Some of these small or extremely small portions return to the parent star and some go into orbit around the newly-created planets. Those that go into orbit around planets become satellites.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->It often happens that a newly-created planet has circum-rotarian motion. All newly-created planets revolve around stars but some revolve circumrotarian-wise and some do not. The earth does and for that reason it has both day and night. Those that do not revolve in such fashion remain in either eternal-night or eternal-day. When planets which revolve circumrotarian-wise remain in a gaseous or liquid state, portions of their body also often break off and go into orbit around them. These are also satellites. It was the opinion of ancient astrologers that the moon was formed in this way, that is, a certain portion of the earth broke away and went into orbit around it. It was the conception of those ancient astrologers that there was a great pit left in that portion of the earth from which the moon broke away, and that pit was the Pacific Ocean (the largest and deepest ocean). The old Sanskrit name for the Pacific Ocean was ks&#x301;iirasa&#x301;gara or ks&#x301;iiroda&#x301;rn&#x301;ava. Thus we even find in the moon&#146;s dhya&#x301;na mantra:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..126"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=126 type=paragraph -->If any smaller star, planet or satellite falls on a larger star, planet or satellite then that smaller falling star, planet or satellite is called ulka&#x301; [meteor]. A meteor need not be the entire body of a star, planet or satellite; it may also be a fractional portion of that structure. As a result of collision with a falling meteor, deviation of orbit sometimes occurs, or can occur. As a result of this deviation of orbit it is natural that a change occurs in the daily or yearly motion as well. In the last few thousand years certainly, and even in the last few hundred years, it is only natural that the earth&#146;s daily and yearly motion has undergone some change, thus it is incumbent upon the astrophysicists that they recalculate the exact time of the earth&#146;s daily and yearly cycles each year, or if this is not possible then at least every few years. Otherwise, we will be forced to carry the burden of our mistaken measure of time in many diverse spheres of life, and that is not at all desirable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..127"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=127 type=paragraph -->It will have to be carefully investigated if it is possible or not for any living being, microbe, living seed, plant or vegetable seed to travel from one planet to another through the medium of these falling meteors. Some people are of the opinion that the people of ancient times used to address as deva those beings who had arrived from other planets. The truth of their opinion should be carefully verified.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..128"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=128 type=paragraph -->In many people&#146;s opinion, if a powerful heavenly body or meteor approaches close to a star then often a loose portion of that star will separate from the original body and go into orbit around it. They are also planets and normally other small portions of the star do not break away along with them. And because the newly-created planet itself is not always in a gaseous or liquid state no satellite is produced from its body. Planets created in this way remain alone; they are eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga. Mercury is such an eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga planet, thus in the language of the ancient astronomers eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga meant &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo;. You can also use eka&#x301;un&#x32D;ga to mean &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo; in Bengali. Budhava&#x301;r [Wednesday] can also be called Eka&#x301;un&#x32D;gava&#x301;r.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Eka + s&#x301;n&#x301;a = aekya. Its etymological meaning is &ldquo;the state of one&rdquo; (ekasya bha&#x301;vah). If five or ten people get together and say: &ldquo;We are one; no external force can destroy our sense of oneness,&rdquo; then one can understand that among them there is aekya. Eka means &ldquo;unit&rdquo; and its abstract noun is &ldquo;unity&rdquo;, in ordinary English &ldquo;oneness&rdquo;. The words ekatva and ekata&#x301; have this etymological meaning of aekya; the first is neuter in gender and the second feminine.<!-- /block --></p>

By adding the suffix s&#x301;n&#x301;ik we get the word aecchika. Where one or more is chosen from among many objects according to one&#146;s will then this is called aecchika (optional). Doing something according to one&#146;s will or one&#146;s fancy is also called aecchika.  The root verb &ldquo;opt&rdquo; means &ldquo;to select something according to one&#146;s liking&rdquo;. According to the rules of linguistic science, if &ldquo;t&rdquo; is pronounced at the end of a root verb and &ldquo;ion&rdquo; is added to it then the proper pronunciation becomes &ldquo;tee-un&rdquo;. For example, since &ldquo;t&rdquo; is at the end of the root verb &ldquo;quest&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;to search&rdquo;, then when &ldquo;ion&rdquo; is added to it the proper pronunciation becomes &ldquo;ques-tee-un&rdquo;. &ldquo;Option&rdquo; is an exception to this. The pronunciation of &ldquo;option&rdquo; will not be &ldquo;op-tee-un&rdquo; but &ldquo;op-shun&rdquo;. Where the freedom is not there to choose between one or more among many, that is, where there is compulsion, aecchika is not used but rather ba&#x301;dhyata&#x301;mu&#x301;lak (compulsory).<!-- /block --></p>

That which has less educative value will have to be called itikatha&#x301;, not itiha&#x301;sa, that is, a factual chronicle of events we call itikatha&#x301;, whether or not it contains something of instructional value. But when we look towards the past and we are unable to discover a continuity of facts, or to put together a respectable portrait of reality, then we call it pra&#x301;gaetiha&#x301;sik (pra&#x301;k + aetiha&#x301;sik), or prehistorical or prehistoric. It is also worth remembering here that while it is true that we call prehistoric those temporal events for which we are unable, at present, to discover a historical continuity or common thread due to a lack of adequate research, if in the future, as a result of adequate efforts, we discover that continuity or get hold of the missing link, then we will no longer be able to call them &ldquo;prehistoric&rdquo;.

<a name="8..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Seas located in torrid zones are more saline in accordance with nature&#146;s law. The very salty water that collects in the depths of the ocean sometimes reaches extreme levels of salinity. As result of plutonic earthquakes in prehistoric times, land rose out of the sea and as the extremely saline water on the surface of that land gradually became calcined, it became trapped between the sand or sandy soil or loamy soil at the surface and the rising hard land from below. With the passage of time that extremely saline water congealed and became transformed into subterranean salt-hills. Since these hills originated from the bottom of the ocean or the sea they used to be called saendhava pa&#x301;ha&#x301;r&#x301;a [sea-hills] and the salt was called saendhava lavan&#x301;a [sea-salt]. This salt obtained from  deep seawater is thus naturally very rich in calcium and iodine and its colour becomes somewhat red. The salt which is artificially produced by evaporating or distilling sea water is generally called karkaca salt.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Since ancient times this karkaca salt has been produced in the coastal areas of the country. In Bengal it has been made since olden days in Khulna, 24 Parganas, Howrah District&#146;s Shyampur area and Midnapore District&#146;s Tamluk and Contai subdivisions. It has been produced extensively in India in those areas near the port of Tutikerin. At the beginning of the British period, those ships which would sail to Britain laden with raw materials from India used to return filled with salt from that country. Raw materials have less value and take up more space. Thus salt also has less value and takes up more space. For that reason the Indian government at that time was not eager to allow salt to be produced in this country, because if there was no demand for British salt in this country then what hopes would the ships have of returning laden with salt?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In my childhood days I have seen a certain type of mud-coloured salt produced from the local salt water and salty soil in South 24 Parganas. It was called ba&#x301;da&#x301;r salt. Its colour was somewhat muddy, that is, there was a little admixture of sodium chloride produced from earth. It was, however, not exactly the same as what we call karkaca salt. By comparison, this ba&#x301;da&#x301;r salt is much tastier than karkaca salt, even though it does not look as good. And the deep sea-salt [saendhava lavan&#x301;a] is nearly two or three times as tasty as this ba&#x301;da&#x301;r salt. On the western borders of India on both sides of the Aravalli mountain range, especially in the rain-shadow area on the other side, this salt used to be found in abundance. Parts of Rajasthan, Sindh and Gujarat used to remain at the bottom of the sea. Because a particular portion of this region was sargasso sea at that time, there is also a likelihood of finding mineral oil there. I would venture also that some saendhava salt-hills can still be found below ground in the northwest portion of Rajasthan. Saendhava salt makes the bones and bone-marrow strong; according to a&#x301;yurveda it also protects a person against attacks of goitre and throat ulcer. At any rate, the use of saendhava salt or aerin&#x301;a, where available, is preferred. In olden times physicians used to arrange for this.

Aereya refers to a specific kind of wine. In ancient times, when people first started to drink wine they drank fermented wine, not distilled wine. Thus, during the first part of the Vedic era the various words for wine, such as mada, a&#x301;sava, aris&#x301;t&#x301;a and so forth referred to fermented wine. In the second half of the Vedic era the Aryans learned how to distill wine. It appears that the inventor of the process of distillation was the guru of the Asuras, Shukracharya. Legend has it that distilled wine was first used during the war between the gods and the Asuras to keep the Asuras maddened with battle. Later the gods also learned the process of distillation from the Asuras and became addicted to drinking wine. Deva&#x301;suraeryuddhaka&#x301;le shukren&#x301;a parinirmitam. Shukracharya first made wine during a war between the gods and the demons. Understanding the evils of wine the wise forbade drinking it except for warriors at the time of battle &ndash; injunctions were set out. But wine is such a deadly thing that a person becomes addicted to drinking it within a few days, so in subsequent times the sages forbade drinking it in all circumstances. Human beings&#146; greatest wealth is their intelligence, their learning. Wine destroys the intellect. It is imperative that people stay away from objects which destroy their greatest wealth &ndash; their intellect and learning.<!-- /block --></p>

This barley-wine mixed with somalata&#x301; extract which was used at the end of sacrifices was called aereya. It is worth remembering here that the accepted Ayurvedic elixir or spirit for reviving the dead is a type of distilled wine.

It is considered the first of the eight occult powers because it is attainable in the first level of occult pursuit. One may attain it in both Vidya&#x301; Tantra and Avidya&#x301; Tantra but if an aspirant who resorts to Avidya&#x301; Tantra remains engaged in using this an&#x301;ima&#x301;-siddhi then his or her mental faculties gradually degenerate and he or she becomes crudified. Aspirants of Vidya&#x301; Tantra do not perform any special practice to attain this power, but if this power develops in a person as a result of natural elevation through spiritual practice, and if that individual possesses mental restraint, then he or she does not use it externally and continues to advance step by step in the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.

With this siddhi an individual can direct an entity according to his or her desire from any place at all. Generally this siddhi is not attainable in Avidya&#x301; Tantra. In Vidya&#x301; Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; this power arises spontaneously in some practitioners when they reach a certain stage. If an aspirant uses it in the external world he or she becomes maddened by it and as a result he or she degenerates.

When the sense of mahima&#x301; awakens in an entity or individual after having had this experience then it can be considered that one is completely established in mahima&#x301;-siddhi. This is also not attainable in Avidya&#x301; Tantra. In Vidya&#x301; Tantra this siddhi arises naturally in certain persons, or may arise. It is not proper for any spiritual aspirant to use this siddhi knowingly because while the world may gain something from its application, the world can also be harmed by its misapplication. If a person is influenced for even a short time by malice or jealousy then he or she can do great harm with this siddhi.

The practice of this pra&#x301;pti-siddhi generally instills a harmony between the crude world and the psychic world; thus, even though the misuse of this pra&#x301;pti-siddhi is considered somewhat harmful, roughly speaking there is no great harm attached to it.

He or she becomes skilled in all knowledge as well as all scriptures. Filled with love, he or she can become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a in the spiritual world. This is called madhura bha&#x301;va or madhura sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Tantra.

There is an inherent hostility between these two. According to biologists, members of the canine family are sharp-snouted, carnivorous, swift runners, make noise when they run, and have a strong sense of smell (the alsatian is an exception). They also display a good deal of affection towards their young. The largest animal in this group is the maned lion, native to Africa. In addition, there is the medium-sized maned Indian lion,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the maneless Indian lion or gurjar lion, the wolf (vrkavya&#x301;ghra), alsatian,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  the ordinary domesticated Indian dog, the wild Indian dog, the jackal (shrga&#x301;la), the fox (ulka&#x301;mukhii), and so on. In addition there are many kinds of short-haired and long-haired dogs differing from country to country and variety to variety. Some people are of the opinion that while the dog no doubt belongs to the canine family, it is not an original species but rather a cross-breed &ndash; the wolf is its father and the jackal its mother &ndash; this was the ancient conception.<!-- /block --></p>

After walking for a while, I came to a halt at one spot. To my left was a somewhat deep ditch where a dog had fallen in. He was still barking faintly in between pauses. I realized that this middle-aged creature had come to the last limits of his short life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->What an awful thing! Who could have done such a cruel deed? The dog showed no sign of any injury, that is, he hadn&#146;t been attacked by any animal. If a tiger had attacked it would have seized him or her by the throat or the neck. That is the way that felines attack, from the tigers of the Sundarban jungle to the domesticated housecat. Even a common cat catches rats and mice in that way. A wolf would have attacked the stomach or the back which is how canines attack, from the lion to the fox. When kakt&#x301;esiya&#x301;s creatures attack, however, they attack from the tail end. Their nature is to attack other animals from behind and swing and shake them about.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->The dog appeared completely uninjured. From looking at him, it appeared as if some unnatural means had been used to arrest his blood circulation and bring him seemingly to the point of death. Almost as if someone was rapidly squeezing the last drop of its life&#146;s essence. After a few minutes navel-breathing began. His dog-life did not have long to go. There was no water nearby. If it had been rainy season then some water could have been found in puddles and holes, but it was now the end of the cold season and water was getting scarce. There was none to be found anywhere. Alas, I thought, if I could just put a few drops of water in his mouth, his throat would not be dry during his last moments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->The dog looked at me with sorrowful eyes.

After I had gone a little ways I noticed that he was sitting absorbed in meditation in the siddha&#x301;sana posture, completely motionless. He seemed to be an extension of the hill itself. The only difference between the two was that the hill was reddish yellow and the human figure was bright and fair-complexioned. I crossed a vaenci-shiya&#x301;kul thicket, approached very close to him and saw a Tantric sadhaka sitting in a bhaeravii cakra yantra.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn12"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn12">12</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> My curiosity was aroused.

<a name="8..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->I had known Khagen since I was a child. His parents lived in Chakradharpur and he used to attend school in my town. After he finished his studies he left that area. I had heard from his father that the two of us were born on the same day. I was born most likely under the constellation of Visha&#x301;kha&#x301; and he was born a few hours later, most likely under the constellation of Anura&#x301;dha&#x301;. He was one class behind me in school.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->There was a hereditary inclination towards spiritual practices in his family. His grandfather, father and uncles all followed the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. I remembered many years before, when he was studying in standard nine, and he had asked me what the eight occult powers were and what special practices existed by which one could attain them.

I explained even more carefully the dangers associated with it and counselled him to shun that path. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; should be done only for the attainment of Parama Purus&#x301;a, not for any second thing. He asked me how it would be if he did the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for attaining Parama Purus&#x301;a along with the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for attaining the eight occult powers.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->Now I understood what kind of plans he had been hatching deep inside. I could see with my own eyes the fruits of his plans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Khagen was totally absorbed, like a tree immersed in meditation. He didn&#146;t blink at all or move even a finger or a toe so I kept quiet for some time and remained standing there, not disturbing him. At one point, I looked over at the dog and saw that he had died. His tormented eyes seemed to be looking in my direction, as if they were saying: &ldquo;I am innocent, without fault. Why should a person have removed me from the earth in this way without any reason? Will you not redress this?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->I looked again at Khagen and saw his fair-complexioned body gradually start turning red. It stayed that way for a short time and then slowly turned jet-black. I watched for some time longer until he gradually turned pale, anaemic. Then I touched his body; it was as cold as ice and harder than iron. A human corpse will turn cold but it never becomes that hard. I was considering what to do or not to do, and then I remembered that in such cases the body should not be cremated for eighteen hours; one must wait. If it didn&#146;t return to a normal state within eighteen hours then one could begin cremating. I thought about returning to town and letting someone know what had happened and then returning, but I realized that it would take at least two hours to go and come and in the meantime some wild animal might come and eat him, thinking him to be dead. Finally I decided to keep watch over the body throughout the night and then return to town in the morning to let people know. There would be little possibility of a wild animal showing up there during daylight hours. I remained standing there, looking now at the unfortunate dog and now at Khagen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->Suddenly I saw a point of light exit from Khagen&#146;s third eye and enter into the third eye of the dog. Then an even more amazing thing happened. Could it really be? The dog&#146;s tail started to move slowly two or three times. Then again quiet. As it had been.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->A short while later, the dog&#146;s tail again started to move slowly back and forth, and some barks came from his mouth.

<a name="8..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->Again, moments later, the dog&#146;s tail started to move. From its mouth came a few soft barks. This time the dog seemed to be trying to stand up. It rose to its feet then and fell down again. Then it was na yayao na tasthao [&ldquo;it remained in the same condition&rdquo;]. Again the dog&#146;s tail moved a few times and again it barked a little. This time it stood up, looked here and there, and then started climbing the hill.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->It approached us and then started circling around Khagen like a machine with someone at the controls, like an ox with blinders tracing fixed circles around the oil-mill. The dog didn&#146;t enter the bhaeravii cakra, but stuck close to its outer edge as it circled around. It was easy to understand what a dreadful state it was in; it had no fear, no thought, perhaps not even a sense of existence. It was a crude flesh-and-bone machine, a mindless, energy-driven body. And in whose hands was the switch for turning on the energy that drove him? You could not say that it was living because behind it there was no independent unit mind at work &ndash; it was acting at the urge of some other entity&#146;s mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->I understood that this was all Khagen&#146;s affair. He had mastered the skill to kill an innocent creature and drive its body. It made no difference whether the dog was alive or not because it didn&#146;t have any independent individual existence. Its existence was actually just like that of a puppet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->I couldn&#146;t bear it any longer.

A point of light exited from the third eye of the dog and entered into Khagen&#146;s third eye. The dog uttered a cry and collapsed on top of a rock. It was dead once again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->I looked over at Khagen and saw him slowly trying to open his eyes. He looked at me and started to cry.

I did not scold him any more along the way because he was not in a normal state. He was somewhere halfway between life and death. When I got to the edge of the muddy pond where I had been sitting, I saw that some black figure was standing beside the pigeon-pea field right behind me. His body was not luminous but rather fashioned from a black shadow. Lest Khagen be disturbed or feel worried, I didn&#146;t say anything.

Moreover, in practical cases it can create problems if there is more than one current spelling for the same word. In this regard there is nothing to say if one adds a hasanta at the end of the word ma&#x301;s. So if one says es&#x301;a ma&#x301;s also, it means &ldquo;this month&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the concerning year&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

Es&#x301;a mas means &ldquo;this year&rdquo;. Es&#x301;a mas means &ldquo;this time&rdquo; etymologically and &ldquo;this year&rdquo; colloquially. From es&#x301;a mas we get  the word aes&#x301;amasya which means &ldquo;during this time&rdquo; or &ldquo;in this year&rdquo;. &ldquo;I am not speaking about another year, I am speaking about this year.&rdquo; We can also rephrase this sentence as &ldquo;I am not speaking about another year, I am speaking of aes&#x301;amasya.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not speaking about earlier times, I am speaking about the present time.&rdquo; This sentence can be rephrased as &ldquo;I am not speaking about earlier times, I am speaking of aes&#x301;amasya.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&#146;t know how cold it was here in other months but this month is really cold.&rdquo; Instead of saying this, we can say: &ldquo;I don&#146;t know how cold it was here in other months, but aes&#x301;amasya it is really cold.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..119"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=119 type=paragraph -->The process for refining molasses and eliminating its smell was first discovered in China. The Indian people learned it from the Chinese several thousand years ago. Since it was learned from China, sugar became known as ciinii. We get the word ciinii by adding the suffix nak to the verbal root ci and then applying prs&#x301;i diirghah; its etymological meaning is &ldquo;that country which collects things with great care or which is produced from a collection of good qualities&rdquo;. We get the word ciinii from the meaning &ldquo;concerning China&rdquo; or &ldquo;produced in China&rdquo;. Both ca and na can take long ii. The old Sanskrit word for sugar was sharkara&#x301;. The words &ldquo;saccrum&rdquo;, &ldquo;sacrites&rdquo;, &ldquo;saccharine&rdquo; (all from Old Latin), &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; (English), sucre (French), sha&#x301;khar (Tamil, Gujarati, Marathi), sakkar (Hindustani), and so forth, have all come from the word sharkara&#x301;. All of them mean aeks&#x301;ava. Aeks&#x301;ava sugar is also called khan&#x301;d&#x301;a in Sanskrit. The word kha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301; in Punjabi, which means &ldquo;sugar&rdquo;, is derived from khan&#x301;d&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..121"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=121 type=paragraph -->The words currently used for sugar cane in India, whether Sanskrit, indigenous or foreign, are: iks&#x301;u (Sanskrit), kusherika&#x301; (Sanskrit), a&#x301;kh (Bengali), kushiya&#x301;r (Maethilii, Bengali, Assamese), kushyer (Bengali), kushur (Bengali), keta&#x301;rii (Nagpuri, Magahi, Angika), keta&#x301;r&#x301;ii (Angika), un&#x32D;kh (Bhojpuri), ikh (Hindi), and ganna&#x301; (Urdu).<!-- /block --></p>

In spoken Bengali we say ekho gur&#x301; [cane molasses]; an eloquent way of saying the same thing in literary Bengali would be aeks&#x301;ava gur&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..123"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=123 type=paragraph -->Formerly ciinii was mistakenly spelled cini [I recognize]. Cini go cini tumi videshinii. Here the word cini has a double meaning. One meaning is: &ldquo;O foreign lady, I recognize you.&rdquo; Another meaning is: &ldquo;Hey, sugar, you have come from overseas.&rdquo; During the first part of the British era, when insufficient coal sugar was being produced in this country, sugar was imported as required from Batavia in Indonesia. During my childhood, this sugar was known as ba&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;ciinii in the markets in Calcutta. The name ba&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;ciinii came from the name of the capital city Batavia. The Sanskrit name for the city of Batavia is Va&#x301;ta&#x301;viipura. The large-sized lemon that the Dutch brought to this country from Batavia, which has since become practically native, is still called ba&#x301;ta&#x301;vii lemon.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..124"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=124 type=paragraph -->The original home of sugar cane is southeast Asia. Sugar cane likes hot weather and lots of water. Southeast Asia is still the largest producer of sugar cane in the world. Gur&#x301; [molasses] is a very old Vedic word. There tends to be some difference of opinion whether or not the Vedic Aryans cultivated sugar cane or were familiar with sugar cane, but there is no doubt that they were familiar with sugar-cane molasses. It is not known whether they produced this sugar-cane molasses themselves or imported it from southeast Asia. The Vedic Aryans used to use honey for their religious rituals, but it was also the system that molasses could be used in place of honey as required when the supply of honey was insufficient. Madhvabha&#x301;ve gud&#x301;am&#x301; dadya&#x301;t [&ldquo;In the absence of honey, molasses (gud&#x301;a) can be offered to the deity&rdquo;].

According to the Puranic story, Holika&#x301; Ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii used to  eat one person a day and the kingdom supplied her meal. After this  Holika&#x301; Ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asii was killed the people burned her corpse  at the crossroads and celebrated the occasion with a festival. This &ldquo;Holi&rdquo; has come from the  burning of Holika&#x301;.

Except for one Narail subdivision, practically all of Jessore District was turned into a graveyard. Many rich settlements were abandoned and reverted back to jungle. The Bangaon and Magura subdivisions of that time were affected by both malaria and black fever. In many parts small villages were deserted and the jungle overtook them. Polecats then started taking up residence there in large numbers. There is Bengali adage that was made at that time which says: &ldquo;The polecat is the king of the wild village&rdquo;.</p>

<a name="9..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In Bengali script, vargiiya ba and antahstha va have been separate letters since olden times, but in the last one hundred years or so the character for the two letters has become the same. However their pronunciation is completely different. It has been difficult, not only for children but for adults also, to know from the spelling of a word whether vargiiya ba or anatahstha va was being used; as a result, the separate pronunciation of the two letters has gradually been lost and errors in pronunciation, as well as spelling, have crept into the Bengali language. In English &ldquo;b&rdquo; should be written for the letter vargiiya ba and &ldquo;v&rdquo; for the letter anatahstha va. Body, because, bell, buoy, but, beacon, big, bag, beach, biija, bit, ban, beans, beet, bat, beam, etc., should be written in Bengali with vargiiya ba. Beca&#x301;l, beha&#x301;ya&#x301;, besharam, beta&#x301;r, beka&#x301;r, beca&#x301;ra&#x301;, beja&#x301;r, bed&#x301;hap, bena&#x301;ma&#x301;, etc., should be written with vargiiya ba because they are all pronounced like the English sound &ldquo;b&rdquo;. Ba&#x301;laka, ba&#x301;la&#x301;, budha, buddha, bar&#x301;a, brhat, bandhana, ba&#x301;ndhu, ba&#x301;ddha, ba&#x301;ndh &ndash; these words should also be spelled with vargiiya ba because they are pronounced like the English &ldquo;b&rdquo;. Vote, value, valve, very, valley, van, veto, vapour, and so forth, should be written with antahstha va. Their pronunciation has no relationship with the English &ldquo;b&rdquo;. In order to eliminate the current spelling and phonetic difficulties in the Bengali language it has become imperative to re-introduce the letter b  with a line through the body of the letter. Moreover, if there is no separate character for vargiiya ba and anatahstha va in Bengali then the proper teaching and learning of Sanskrit becomes impossible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sanskrit does not have its own separate script, that is, there is no Sanskrit script.

In old Bengali the word guva&#x301; was used; supa&#x301;ri [betel nut] was not taken. The word supa&#x301;ri is originally Hindustani; it has come into Bengali in modern times.

For a long time in Bengali there has been the custom of writing t rather than ta with a hasanta after it. Wherever ta is written with a hasanta beneath it, t can be written in its stead which takes less time. Thus t should be kept and given formal acceptance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Fa (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AB;&#x09BC;</span>): This is not a separate acoustic root. Its pronunciation is similar to the English &ldquo;f&rdquo;. This sound is enunciated by filling the mouth with air and creating pressure against the lips with that air from inside the mouth, then expelling it outside while opening the mouth. This sound does not exist in Sanskrit and pure Bengali; what exists is the pha sound. Its name is phan&#x301;ii which should be written in English as &ldquo;phani&rdquo;, not &ldquo;fani&rdquo;. This sound is found in Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi, English, French, and the majority of the Latin languages. This letter is needed to indicate the correct pronunciation of words such as farukh, fazal, fir, fer, frya&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;r, fan, fair, frequent, fire, far, father, feya&#x301;r and so forth. If this letter is introduced into the modern Bengali script, then we will be able to indicate the pronunciation for words which we are unable to at present. We should write &ldquo;Fazl-ul-Haque&rdquo; but we write incorrectly &ldquo;Phajl-ul-Hak&rdquo;. I do not consider this mistake excusable. By introducing the letter fa, this long-time error can be rectified.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Ya (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AF;&#x09BC;</span>): This is also not a separate acoustic root. Pada&#x301;nte padamadhyasthe ya-ka&#x301;ra ia ucyate, that is, if ya is at the beginning of a word, then is pronounced as a light ja; and in the middle and at the end of a word it is pronounced as ia, but it will be easier to recognize when it should be pronounced as a light ja and when it should be pronounced as ia if a dot is placed beneath the Bengali character  [ya] for the ia sound. In the Bengali language, this ya with a dot below it has already been in use for a long time. It should be allowed to continue. Sanskrit does not have a separate form for ya when it is pronounced ia, but it is good that it remain in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Lra (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B2;&#x09BC;</span>): This letter is not found in Bengali, Assamese and Hindustani, but it is found in Sanskrit, Marathi, Gujarati and the alphabets of south India. In north India, it is present in the pronunciation of the common people although there is no separate character for it. The rule is that whenever la is present in the middle or end of the original verbal root, then it will be antahstha la (lra), and if it is at the beginning of the original verbal root then it will be a&#x301;di la (la). If it is present in the radical of a compound word derived from the verbal root, or after the prefix, then this antahstha la (lra) will not undergo any change in either form or pronunciation. Similarly, if a root word contains a&#x301;di la, and it is present in the radical of a compound word made with that root, then that adi la will not undergo any change, for example, shriilata&#x301;, shriilekha&#x301;, sulekha&#x301;, pus&#x301;palata&#x301;, and so forth. All those suffixes which contain la have adi la, such as alac, ilac and so on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Without this antahstha la (lra) in the Bengali language, the proper teaching and study of Sanskrit is not possible; it should be part of the Bengali script. Otherwise Bengali-speaking students of Sanskrit will pronounce it incorrectly. The difference in pronunciation of words such as lata&#x301;, phalra, kamala, ka&#x301;lraka&#x301;lra, etc., will go unrecognized if the letter lra is not introduced. If, while reading the Vedas, we read agni miilre as agni miile it will be incorrect, so the letter lra should have a place. There is a great abundance in Bengali of words borrowed from Sanskrit which contain antahstha la (lra), such as ka&#x301;lra, khalra, vimalra, samalra, amalra (not kamala), ta&#x301;lra, ta&#x301;lrii, dalra, palra, kalrya&#x301;n&#x301;a, kapa&#x301;lra, bha&#x301;lra (in the sense of forehead) &ndash; it would be an error to spell these with adi la.<!-- /block --></p>

For the same reasons, the letters rr, lr and lrr require a place. Although there are far fewer words in Bengali written with long rr (naerrta), lr (sam&#x301;klrpta, abhiklrpta), lrr (lrrt&#x301;) in comparison with the abundance of words containing lra, they are necessary for the Bengali-speaking students of Sanskrit, so they should also be given a place. Otherwise Bengali-speaking students will be hampered in the arena of pronunciation. So I will reiterate the need for qa, qha, za and fa for indicating the proper pronunciation of English, Arabic and Farsi words, just as there is a need for the letter lra for indicating the Sanskrit letter.<!-- /block --></p>

Ta&#x301;n + tathaeva is spelled ta&#x301;m&#x301;stathaeva but is pronounced ta&#x301;nm&#x301;stathaeva. If the candrabindu is pronounced, then why should it not be written?

<a name="9..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the Vedic verbal root uc is &ldquo;to be gathered together&rdquo;, &ldquo;to be assembled&rdquo;. By adding the suffix ghain&#x32D; (some say ka) to uc we get the word oka whose etymological meaning is: &ldquo;all those entities which are together or form a group&rdquo;. One of its colloquial meanings is a certain type of tree found in temperate and cold climates [oak]. This Vedic word oka is now quite common in many of the world&#146;s languages. Indeed, the tree which we know nowadays as &ldquo;oak&rdquo; grows in large groups. The oak tree is comparatively tall. Some varieties are taller, others moderately tall and bushy. People believe that the pores of the oak&#146;s leaves attract distant clouds. It is perhaps for this reason that in olden times people used to plant oak trees around their houses and villages. As a result the entire village would be turned into an oak grove. As I said, the meaning of the word oka was that they grew in groves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->There are three main varieties of oak tree which are well-known in the world. One of these is the red oak. Its original home was Britain, Ireland, Holland and nearby areas. People believe that the red oak has the greatest capacity to attract clouds. The second variety is the green oak. Although it doesn&#146;t grow in hot areas, it does grow in somewhat warm areas and its original home was north of Eurasia&#146;s Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn. The third variety of oak is the silver oak. It generally does not like predominately hot climates. While it is true that it is able to survive if planted in predominately hot regions, its growth is stunted. Its original home was also in the north-central areas of Eurasia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Oak wood is somewhat light. It does not make very good furniture and is used more as firewood. The sap and juices of the oak have medicinal qualities. At one time during the prehistoric age there was a huge oak forest by the Barak river-valley, that is, modern-day Manipur, the northern part of Tripura, Kachar, Kaminganj and certain parts of Silchar. That special variety of oak whose descendants are found today was known by the name manipurii oak. One of its branch varieties is also a type of creeper. Because of people&#146;s shortsightedness the manipurii variety of oak has been nearly wiped out. Still, with proper forethought, new forests can be planted and with the judicious use of this forest wealth, paper of a high grade can be produced. People also believe that this oak is especially capable of attracting clouds. As I was saying, in prehistoric times there was a vast forest of a now-extinct variety of oak in the Barak river-valley, so by searching this region a light variety of coal may be found.<!-- /block --></p>

Cooked rice is prepared by putting it in water and boiling it. For this reason it is called odana.

A is called the first acoustic root, thus at the time of arranging the alphabet a was placed first. The sound a&#x301; consists of two a&#146;s side by side so it was given the second position. In most of the alphabets of the world a is the first letter and the first in alphabetical order &ndash; aliph, alpha, &ldquo;a&rdquo; and so on. The sound a signifies the union of the introversial consciousness and the extroversial consciousness, thus a signifies the complete expression of the play of creation.<!-- /block --></p>

Whatever has been created or manifest in the universe, whatever wave has begun to be sounded in the firmament, is living or preserved within certain fixed limits of time. Static entities are, for the time being, comparatively more permanent, and dynamic entities are comparatively shorter lived, but all are circumscribed by temporal limits. As long as the created being, object or wave remains within its temporal limits then that abiding form is sounded and maintained by the seed of preservation and existence. The same is true for each and every entity of the universe, that is, what is created by the seed a abides in the seed u, thus creation and abiding, a and u, gives us a + u = o.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->When the rotation is circular the expressed entity gets an opportunity to return to its original cause. If that entity is ensconced in the ideation of its original source then there is nothing to add. But if that circular course continues to emerge out from the original source, still it has no other option but to return to that original source. Where the emanated entity advances on the path of diffusion, and that movement remains under the control of the nuclear force, then it is bound to return; it will one day merge in the nucleus. One day, under the inspiration of that preserving entity situated in the nucleus, the chapter of its return begins, and its culmination is in the nucleus &ndash; the end of all its peregrinations.<!-- /block --></p>

And when this na&#x301;sha signifies the return of an entity to its original state then it is called pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha. That which is created in the journey by the sound a and preserved by the sound u meets its pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha in the sound ma. Thus, this dissolution is not a terrible or dangerous thing; it is not death. Although the scriptures call it &ldquo;the great death&rdquo;, it is really a return to the original entity or original force. That state of the Supreme Force or Parama Purus&#x301;a which is signified by the sound a and which remains engaged in the action of creation is called Brahma&#x301;. That state which remains engaged in the action of preservation or maintenance is called Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u. And that state which remains engaged in withdrawal or pran&#x301;a&#x301;sha is called Sam&#x301;harta&#x301;, or Maheshvara. This a + u + m gives om.

We use a crescent line (na&#x301;da) as a symbol of the state that relates this dot with the om. The two of them together are known collectively as na&#x301;dabindu. Although it looks somewhat like the candrabindu, the two are not identical. The curved portion below the dot is not exactly like the curve of the candrabindu; the tail end curves up more, a little like a check mark.

This os&#x301;an&#x301;a or u&#x301;s&#x301;an&#x301;a means &ldquo;spice&rdquo;. Hot spice is called s&#x301;ar&#x301;u&#x301;s&#x301;an&#x301;a (s&#x301;at&#x301; + u&#x301;s&#x301;an&#x301;a). Os&#x301;adhi means &ldquo;that which brings the warmth of life into the body&rdquo; &ndash; which, by reviving, energy comes. Thus one colloquial meaning of os&#x301;adhi is &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; or &ldquo;medicinal herb&rdquo;. Us&#x301; + na = us&#x301;n&#x301;a; us&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;hot&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->Another meaning of the word os&#x301;adhi is &ldquo;all those living beings or plants where the mother rushes towards death as they are being born&rdquo;, or &ldquo;those progeny whose birth is also the cause of the mother&#146;s death&rdquo;. In the plant kingdom the plaintain group is of this type so it is classified as os&#x301;adhi. Some people also like to consider the grass family of plants as os&#x301;adhi. They claim that when the seeds of these plants (rice, wheat, etc.) mature then the mother, that is, the grass plant, dies. This is not so. Grass-family plants are not os&#x301;adhi, the reason being that while the seeds are technically the progeny of the plant, as long as they have not sprouted one cannot accept that any progeny has been produced. The seeds of grass family plants only get a chance to sprout long after they have matured. For this reason the grass-family plants, such as rice and wheat, cannot be called os&#x301;adhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->According to some people there are a certain few living beings who die when the children are born. In this regard, they talk about the crab. They say that while the baby crabs are in the mother&#146;s womb they eat at her flesh and finally, only after having exhausted all her flesh, are they are born, thus crabs are also os&#x301;adhi. Because they are matricidal, travellers used to consider bananas and crabs as inauspicious for journeys, that is, no one would ever take bananas or crabs with them to distant countries. In ancient times, a distant land was reckoned as that land which it took a lunar day or more to reach. In former times Midnapore was also a distant land from Burdwan. Today, even the moon is not a distant land from the earth.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->The quality of os&#x301;adhi or medicinal herbs varies according to the different lunar days. In olden times people used to think that the qualities of edibles also varied with the different lunar days, thus they declared that on such-and-such day brinjals were forbidden, on others palm, brhatii [a large variety of brinjal] or gourd. Because the quality of medicines varied according to the lunar day, that is, according to the position of the moon, the moon was called Os&#x301;adhipati [Lord of Medicine].<!-- /block --></p>
