<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->SHRII SHRII A&#x301;NANDAMU&#x301;RTI is the spiritual guide for millions of spiritual aspirants all over the world. He is called Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;, which means &ldquo;beloved&rdquo;. From His early childhood, men and women of all ages have been drawn to Him by the power of His love. Living an ordinary life, as a child, as a schoolboy, as a railway officer in a small town in India, at the same time He taught many sincere seekers how to realize the Truth within themselves. Soon the number of His disciples was multiplying so rapidly that He began to train others to teach the practices of self-realization; and thus the organization Ananda Marga, the Path of Bliss, was founded, and spread rapidly all over the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Those who follow His teachings find their lives transformed; the confining walls of their egos dissolve and an all-embracing cosmic feeling begins to fill their hearts. They begin to look on all people as brothers and sisters, as the manifestations of the Supreme. They want to serve those manifestations. They cannot bear to see others in pain, and they want to share with all the bliss which they themselves enjoy. From Hong Kong to Buenos Aires to New York, many people are working tirelessly in the service of humanity, motivated by His indescribable love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In these discourses Baba speaks of the journey of the Soul. The journey begins with Absolute Consciousness, the pure essence, Parama Purus&#x301;a, God. Due to the force of the Cosmic Energy, Prakrti, that Supreme Essence is transformed into this vibrational, manifested world, into &ldquo;crude&rdquo; matter. And then the return journey home begins. The creation, drawn by that supreme attractive force of the Cosmic Nucleus &ndash; the power of love &ndash; gradually evolves again into subtler and subtler entities, with higher and higher expressions of consciousness: unicellular organisms, plants, animals, higher animals, and finally man, the most evolved manifestation of that Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->At a certain point in his evolution, there awakens inside of man a desire to know himself, to know his purpose in life. When this desire awakens, he is ready to begin sa&#x301;dhana, the &ldquo;effort of completion,&rdquo; the practices of meditation by which he will accelerate his evolution and hasten his journey home to the pure Consciousness from which he came. When this desire awakens in him, his guide appears, the teacher who will lead him forward on the path of realization. Guru means &ldquo;dispeller of darkness,&rdquo; and the Master does exactly that; with His own divine powers, He clears the clouds from His beloved disciples&#146; minds. He helps them transcend all their negative tendencies so that their true nature &ndash; divine perfection &ndash; may shine forth from within. For the Guru is verily the perfect expression of that Supreme Consciousness. It is God who in the form of the Guru is drawing His beloved children to Himself. As the disciple progresses more and more on the path of realization, as his perfect nature flowers more and more within him, he feels the pervasiveness of love &ndash; God&#146;s love, the Guru&#146;s love, love within himself &ndash; and in ecstasy he sees love everywhere. God, the Guru, his innermost self, and all creation, all become one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The devotee reaches this sublime state by His Grace alone. For the devotee, His Grace is all.<!-- /block --></p>

It keeps its love for the moon constantly alive. It seems, however, but a most ordinary flower. There is nothing extraordinary about it. Still this most ordinary little flower has a romantic tie with the great moon. Similarly, you may be an ordinary creature &ndash; you may have to pass your days in the ups and downs of your worldly existence &ndash; still do not forget that Supreme One. Keep all your desires inclined towards Him. Always keep yourselves merged in His thought. Go deep into the mood of that Infinite Love.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There is a single entity, or personality, in this universe. Apparently you are many, but fundamentally you are one. The one is manifested in the many.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The word khila in Sanskrit means a &ldquo;latch&rdquo;. Akhila therefore means &ldquo;that which cannot be contained or closed&rdquo;, that is, this universe. The creation of this universe &ndash; the substance of this universe is one, though the creation is manifold. Why this creation of one into many? The reply is only with the Creator, the Supreme Lord. Philosophers try to answer this question but fail; how far can a microcosmic brain with its small nerve fibres go? Even if an individual utilizes all his or her mental powers, that individual will not succeed in answering. The devotee&#146;s approach to this question is, however, different. The devotee enters God&#146;s mind, mingles his or her mind with that of the Supreme Being, and knows some of the secrets of God&#146;s mind from within.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The devotees say God is Supreme. They sing His glory and defend all His actions. That is why God says, &ldquo;My devotees are greater than Myself.&rdquo; A common person says, &ldquo;Oh, God, we are tired of your liila&#x301;. What is the need of it? We are all suffering and you call it a play.&rdquo; The devotee, however, defends God with this: &ldquo;My Lord was utterly alone before the creation. A person becomes mad if he or she is alone in a big vacant house. God was restless before the creation. He could neither love, nor feel angry with, anyone. So creation was a compulsion. He has created all these forms by multiplying Himself. When God was alone, He had the power to see, but there were no objects to be seen. Now that He has started the creation, He sees whatever He thinks. If we are His own forms and feel a little restlessness in His creation, we are blessed, for we are saving our Lord from the restlessness of utter loneliness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This is the way a devotee looks at the secret of creation. We are all part of that Supreme Being &ndash; He is playing with Himself in all our forms. This is a divine play. He is playing hide-and-seek with Himself. Search Him in your little &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling and you will find the King of kings there.  In fact, the name of this search is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->If you do not go within, do you want to go out? But where will you go, since He is everywhere in this universe and surrounds this universe? You cannot go outside of Him.

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The yogi says there is hardly any difference between the terms &ldquo;God&rdquo; and &ldquo;bliss&rdquo;. It is just like two names, &ldquo;water&rdquo; and agua, used for the same entity. The yogi says, &ldquo;What is God? He is bliss. He is a&#x301;nanda.&rdquo; And the functional side of this Supreme Father is, everything cometh from Him and goeth back to that Supreme Entity. And what is that Supreme Entity? It is a&#x301;nanda.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->God is the Generator, He is the Operator, and He is the benevolent Destructor: G-O-D. What is God? As Operator He is the controller also. The operator of a machine must have control over that machine. He must be a controller. And this controller is not only an ordinary mechanic, He is a great Magician, because He creates everything in His mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The magician creates so many things in his mind, and the spectators say, &ldquo;Oh, he is a great magician.&rdquo; But actually, these spectators are befooled. Their mental attachment goes toward the created objects and not toward the magician. But they should know that those created objects are of  temporary nature. The magician is the truth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So this controller is a great Magician: He is creating every- thing within His mind. And for those created beings, the mental world of this Magician appears to be a physical one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Suppose you create a candle in your mind and a man in your mind. You know that both the candle and the man are of mental creation, are purely mental, not physical. They are within your mind. But for your mental man, your mental candle is a reality. Similarly, for you this world is a physical reality. But for that Supreme Magician, everything is transitory. So He is a magician and has control over the entire universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now what is God, again? The yogi says, &ldquo;He who has got occult powers, all the occult powers, all the faculties, is God.&rdquo; Unless and until one possesses all the occult powers, how can one control the universe? The occult powers are eight in number. He who is the owner of all these occult powers is known as Iishvara in Sanskrit. And why is God called Iishvara? He can see [and do] everything. He can go to any place without the help of any organ.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Another explanation by the yogi regarding who God is: &ldquo;He who remains unassailed, unaffected, by actions and reactions. He who requires no shelter, He who is the shelter of all, of everything &ndash; He is God.&rdquo; Another explanation by the yogi is that the universe is a collection of so many electrons, protons and positrons, and the Supreme Controller is God.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->You have only two eyes, and those eyes can function only where there are light waves in the external world. Where light waves are lacking you cannot see. But He has infinite eyes, and all those eyes are functioning within, because there is nothing without Him. Everything is within Him. In order to see your mental picture, do you depend on external eyes? No.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->For you there are two worlds, internal and external. But in His case everything is internal. You are within His mind, and whatever you are seeing, whatever you are doing, whatever you are going to do, everything, is being done within His great mind. There is nothing external. &ldquo;Oh, my child, oh, my little child, why did you commit such a sin?&rdquo; You cannot say, &ldquo;No, Father, I didn&#146;t commit a sin,&rdquo; because you are in His mind. He sees internally without the help of any eyes, because you are His mental creation, you are within His mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->He is omnipresent; He is everywhere. The movement of a grain of sand is as important to Him as the movement of an atom bomb, as the movement of a megaton bomb. For Him there is nothing unimportant. You cannot be unimportant for Him. The Father is always with you. And because of His omnipresence there is one advantage and one disadvantage. What is the advantage? The advantage is, the Supreme Father is always with you, you are never alone. You must not be afraid of anybody because He is always waiting to save you. And the disadvantage is &ndash; that He is always with you, and therefore it is very difficult for you to do anything unpleasant, anything undesirable. This is the difficulty. The universe is surrounded by Him. Whatever you do, your doing is witnessed by Him. You cannot think secretly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is that force which creates the illusion of this physical reality. It is the Operative Principle of God. Now this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, it is insurmountable for an ordinary human being, for a non-sa&#x301;dhaka. A person who is not a spiritual aspirant is to serve Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; as a slave. This is the case with all animals, with all brutes, and with all people of an animal temperament. Now, what is intuitional practice? What is yogic practice? Its purpose is just to overcome the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. This Operative Principle, the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, is just like a satanic chain, just like a serpentine noose, of afflictions and predicaments. One has to free oneself from this serpentine noose. And this is done through yogic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. When the yogi comes in close contact with the Supreme Father, the Lord says, &ldquo;Oh, my child, it is very difficult for a person to overcome the influence of this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is insurmountable. But he or she who has taken shelter in Me, who has [ensconced] himself or herself in Me, who has taken shelter on My lap, will surely go beyond the influence of this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Unless and until you have developed implicit faith and sincere love for that Supreme Father, you will not become one with Him, you will be bound by this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Now, when do people begin to feel that they should love the world? When they free themselves from evil, from egotistic sentiments. But they will say, &ldquo;They say God is gracious, but I am an unfortunate person, I am not realizing His grace&rdquo;. There are many persons who talk like this, but you know, my boys, you know, my daughters, there is no partiality in Him. His heavenly shower of grace is for all. He is for every creature. But one feels His grace and another does not. What is the reason? There is a heavenly shower of grace. But suppose that you are holding an umbrella over your head. Will you be drenched by that shower? Oh, no. They who want to enjoy this shower of grace must remove this umbrella of ego over their heads, and they will be drenched by the divine shower. So spiritual aspirants, yogis, must give up all their egotistic sentiments. And in the next moment they will be in the proximity of the Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->One is to get Him, to come in contact with the Divine Father, through jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, karma and bhakti. What is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na? Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is spiritual knowledge, not mundane knowledge. Mundane knowledge is distorted knowledge. It is not knowledge at all. Spiritual knowledge is the real knowledge. But what is spiritual knowledge? One must know what one is, what one&#146;s goal is. This is the spiritual knowledge. Then comes karma. Karma means &ldquo;action&rdquo;. But if one knows what one is, what one&#146;s desideratum is, then one will have to move towards one&#146;s goal. One will have to do something practical and move towards one&#146;s goal. This movement, this practical approach, this actional approach, is called karma. And then when, after karma, one comes near to Him, one will be united or unified with Him. This process of unification is devotion, bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Bhakti yoga can be divided into two broad categories: one is attributional devotion, and the other is non-attributional devotion. In attributional devotion there are three stages. The first one is the stage of static devotion. In static devotion, the devotee says, &ldquo;O my Lord, I am your devotee. Mr. Y is my enemy. Please destroy Him.&rdquo; In the case of static devotion, the devotee doesn&#146;t want to be with the Lord. The devotee wants something bad or harsh done to his or her enemy. That is devotion of the worst type. As it was not the person&#146;s longing to become one with the Father, that person never will become united with the Father. And also, the Supreme Father is the Supreme Father of the enemy also. So He may or may not kill that enemy. Static devotion is no devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Then comes mutative devotion. In this case the devotee says to the Lord, &ldquo;I am your devotee. Please give me money. Please give me name and fame.&rdquo; A boy wants toys from his mother. If the boy starts crying for his mother, the mother must leave her duties and attend to the child. But if the child just wants the toys, he will never get [the mother]. Here also, the devotee in the example didn&#146;t express the desire to become one with the Father, so he won&#146;t attain salvation. He won&#146;t become a devotee. (Yogii means &ldquo;one who finally comes into unification with the Supreme Self&rdquo;.) Also, this person asked for worldly property. Now you know that worldly properties are limited. The number of dollars in the world is very large, but it is not infinite. So the Lord may or may not fulfil such a desire. He has to look after the interests of so many children. He cannot fulfil your unjustified demand. So this mutative devotion is not devotion at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now comes the third kind of devotion &ndash; of attributional devotion &ndash; called sentient devotion. In this case the person says, &ldquo;I am your devotee. But, oh, Lord, I am an old man. Give me something concrete. I want salvation. And You know I am disgusted with the world. My digestive organs have become disordered. I can&#146;t eat anything. Please give me peace. Please give me peace.&rdquo; It is a sentient devotion because here the aspirant, the devotee, does not want anything physical. So it is better than static or mutative devotion. But it is also a very bad type of devotion. It is no devotion, because the person wants salvation from the Supreme Father, but he doesn&#146;t want the Supreme Father. So he is not a yogi. A yogi has to unify himself with the Father. A yogi will not demand any toys from the Father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Then there comes non-attributional devotion. In non-attributional devotion there are two phases. One is called ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti; the other is called ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti. In ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; devotion, the devotee says, &ldquo;O my Lord, I love You because in loving You I get pleasure. I want nothing from You. I want to love You because I get pleasure.&rdquo; It is non-attributional devotion, but it is still not the highest form of devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The highest form of devotion is called ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301;. In ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; the devotee says, &ldquo;O Lord, I love You. I want to love You. And why do I want to love You? Because I want my love to give You pleasure. I love You not to get pleasure but to give You pleasure.&rdquo; This is the highest form of devotion. And by dint of this type of devotion, ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; devotion, the yogi comes in closest contact with the Supreme Self and becomes one with Him. When the devotee&#146;s love is to give pleasure to the Lord and not to enjoy pleasure for himself or herself, the person&#146;s mind gets subjectivated. That is, the mind gets metamorphosed into the mind of the Lord. And that&#146;s why this ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; devotion is the only devotion. And through this devotion, the yogi gets established in the stance of supreme beatitude. The person and the person&#146;s God become one. It is the only goal of human life &ndash; to become one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->When one comes near the Supreme Father, he or she has to address the Father, &ldquo;O Father, give me shelter on Your blissful lap, on Your graceful lap.&rdquo; To say this, one has to establish a relationship of implicit faith and sincerest love with the Father. This implicit faith blended with spiritual zeal is called devotion. So knowledge and action are to help you in developing devotion, but your unification with the Supreme Self will be established with the help of devotion only. So where there is action and where there is knowledge but where there is lack of devotion, nothing can be done. So in the life of a spiritual aspirant, in the life of a yogi, nothing can be done if there is want of devotion. So you daughters, you sons, you must remember that you will have to develop devotion, implicit devotion blended with spiritual zeal. And that devotion will help you. Devotion is the only faculty to help you, to establish you in the supreme beatitude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Now this supreme Purus&#x301;a, for the blessed, for the virtuous, He is their Father. He is their supreme shelter. But for those who are not virtuous, those who are sinners, for them is He not the Father? Certainly He is the Father. He is the Father of the sinners also. Otherwise where are the sinners to go? He must give shelter to the sinners also. He knows the past of all His daughters and all His sons. Even then He loves them, doesn&#146;t He? Suppose the Supreme Father says that He is the Father of the virtuous only, not the Father of the sinners &ndash; then is He justified in this? Has He got the right to say this? Then the sinners will challenge His authority. They will say, &ldquo;No, Supreme Father, you have no right to say You are not the Father of the sinners&rdquo; &ndash; because when He is the Father of the universe, then do the sinners live out of the scope of the universe? No. Then the sinners may say, &ldquo;O Father, if you are not the Supreme, if you are not our Father, in that case please expel us to some place outside the universe.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Father, the Lord of the entire universe, is the Witness of all witnesses. He is the King of all kings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;If even sinners ideate on me, accept me as their only object of ideation,&rdquo; sayeth the Lord, &ldquo;they will be freed from all worldly fetters, all worldly bondages.&rdquo; Sinners must attain salvation, must be freed from all sins, all bondages of sin, by the Supreme Father. So for the virtuous and also for sinners, the Supreme Father is the only shelter. The Supreme Father is the only object of ideation. What are sinners to do? They are to forget their past, and they are to move ahead on the path of spirituality to attain that supreme stance. To come in direct contact with the Supreme Father, you are to serve the universe as the ideal daughters and sons of the Supreme Father. You needn&#146;t be anxious. You must not have any worries and anxieties about your personal problems. Your problems are to be solved by the Supreme Father. You serve the children of the Supreme Father as the ideal daughters and ideal sons of that Father.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Before we try to understand what a mantra is, let us be clear about shabda [sound]. Everything in this manifest universe is vibrational. Creation is also vibrational. And the first and subtlest expression of the vibrational flow is shabda. As shabda is the first vibrational expression of Brahma, Shabda Brahma is the first expression of Ka&#x301;rya Brahma [Effect Brahma, Expressed Brahma]. The fundamental difference between Ka&#x301;rya Brahma and Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma [Causal Brahma] is that all vika&#x301;sha, all expression, in Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma is purely svagata (subjective) and svarasa&#x301;tmaka (blissful). There is no paragata (objective) or pararasa&#x301;tmaka (extroversial) pleasure therein. Being purely subjective and blissful, it has no vyain&#x32D;jana&#x301;tmaka bha&#x301;va, no exceptional quality. In other words, it is purely original and cannot [contain] any compound or mixture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Prior to its practical emergence in the practical sphere, shabda was present in the realm of bha&#x301;va, or ideas. And the starting point of shabda in the world of ideation is called para&#x301;shakti. Para&#x301;shakti exists both in the unit<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and in the [Cosmos]. Although potentially para&#x301;shakti has full possibilities of expression, due to lack of a medium it does not get expressed. It germinates into expression as soon as it finds a medium. And its vibrational expression is shabda. In other words, we hear sound within and without when there is a mutual clash in the medium due to the formation of troughs and crests of various waves. This then is shabda.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Brahma [is represented] in Tantric scriptures by all the svaravarn&#x301;a [vowel] sounds taken together. When those sounds are converted into action, that is, acquire the potential to form mixtures and compounds, they are called vyain&#x32D;jana [consonants]. The diversity of creation is expressed through consonants, not through vowels. This is the logic behind the division of the Indo-Aryan alphabet into vowels and consonants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is a mantra? It has already been stated that the starting point of shabda, para&#x301;bindu, exists both in the unit and in the [Cosmos]. In the flow of evolution, in the unit as well as in the Cosmic, shabda is born out of para&#x301;. Para&#x301; is the womb of all sounds. A mantra is a collection of a few particular shabdas - not each and every shabda. Mantra means &ldquo;that collection of sounds meditation on which leads to liberation&rdquo; &ndash; Manana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah mantrah parikiirttitah. Man plus the root verb trae plus the suffix d&#x301;a make up the word mantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->By way of illustration, suppose you are sitting somewhere and you do not have the strength to move. A gentleman happens to come that way. If you say to him, &ldquo;Come, sir, let&#146;s have a little talk,&rdquo; that will not prompt the gentleman to lift you by the hand and support your movement. If, on the other hand, you tell the gentleman, &ldquo;Come, sir, I don&#146;t have the strength to get up &ndash; please take my hand and lift me up,&rdquo; it may bring about that result. Thus we get the result we desire by means of an appropriate expression in words. In this illustration the seed of the idea was the same at the level of para&#x301;, but due to two different formations of expression, different results were obtained. A given expression carries a particular meaning for you, as it expresses a particular feeling and it possesses a particular value. In other words, when a particular feeling is expressed through a particular combination of sounds, it achieves a particular value. But even then it does not attain the status of a mantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Unless the shabda or the collection of shabdas, when meditated upon, leads to the path of liberation, it cannot be called a mantra. Every mantra is thus sonic or vibrational and is vibrating simultaneously in the Cosmic system and in the unit body. When, with the help of a mantra, a person finally establishes the parallelism of the unit ectoplasmic vibration with the Cosmic vibration, that person gets mantra siddhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And what is mantra caetanya, or the awakening of a mantra? Mantra caetanya is the condition where, with the help of a particular shabda, a person establishes parallelism between his or her external physical vibration and his or her internal ectoplasmic vibration, and then raises this to the spiritual level.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And the culmination of this process in the achievement of the final spiritual goal is called mantra siddhi. The same shabda without being made &ldquo;live&rdquo; or awakened in the above process is meaningless; it acquires force and meaning when it becomes &ldquo;live&rdquo; in the aforesaid manner. The parallelism between the internal ectoplasmic vibration and the external Cosmic vibration can only be established when one has complete control over one&#146;s own ectoplasmic vibration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->According to one&#146;s sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, a person will be vibrated immediately by one shabda, but remain immune to the vibrations of another. Thus some people get angry when you say &ldquo;Sita&#x301;-Ra&#x301;m&rdquo; to them, but are pleased when you greet them with &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dhe-Shya&#x301;m&rdquo;. Our attitude towards different shabdas becomes defined.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->It will be noted that many writers repeat the use of particular words. Many, for instance, use the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; in every other sentence. All this happens because of their attachment to particular rhythmic vibrations. Similarly, when the vibrational expression is ectoplasmic, that is, when the individual gets equilibrated with the Cosmic vibration, [Cosmic] mantra caetanya takes place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As already mentioned, not only human existence but every existence in this universe is vibrational. But the vibrations of each individual, of each object, differ from those of other objects. For instance, there is a difference between the vibrational expression of iron and that of gold. Just as the vibrations of a human differ from those of iron or gold, the vibrations between one human and another also differ. A person&#146;s life is nothing but a mesh of multilateral rhythms, and the goal of human life is a singular Entity having no rhythm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The style of a person&#146;s speech represents a particular rhythm of his or her own. The way the person eats represents the rhythm of his/her own eating. Every person is thus special on account of these specialities. The rhythms of two individuals cannot be identical. An individual rhythm is the particular property of a particular person. It has been said in A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram:<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Vaecitryam&#x301; pra&#x301;krtadharmah sama&#x301;nam&#x301; na bhavis&#x301;yati [&ldquo;Diversity, not identity, is the law of nature&rdquo;]. In this universe every person in every action possesses a particular rhythm of his own. If someone wants to obstruct or strike that rhythm through disciplinary measures or expressions of anger, the person will not tolerate it. Personal liberty &ndash; individual liberty &ndash; really means the unobstructed expression of individual rhythmic vibrations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When with the help of one&#146;s para&#x301;shakti (para&#x301; in the sense of the starting point of shabda and not in the context of para&#x301; and apara&#x301;) a person coincides his or her individual rhythmic vibrations with the rhythmic vibrations in the realm of this quinquelemental universe, from that moment onwards his or her rhythms become vibrated with mantra caetanya. This is the awakening of, or putting life into, a mantra. Therefore Sada&#x301;shiva has said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Caetanyarahita&#x301;h mantra&#x301;h prokta&#x301;h varn&#x301;a&#x301;stu kevalam<br>Phalam&#x301; naeva prayachanti laks&#x301;akot&#x301;ijapaerapi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In order to make a mantra &ldquo;live&rdquo;, the individual rhythms have to be made parallel to the Cosmic rhythms. Then the starting point of expression of the unit will have to be made to coincide with the starting point of expression in the Cosmic field. &ldquo;If this has not been done,&rdquo; says the shloka, &ldquo;even hundreds of thousands, even millions, of repetitions of the mantra will not lead to mantra siddhi.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->There are several essential factors to bring about mantra caetanya. The first is that the mantra should suit the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra of the individual concerned. And the second is that the individual should feel a fraternal emotion for and attachment to the external world. This sentimental contact with the external world is a must. If someone is under the impression that &ldquo;I am doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for the sake of personal liberation and I have nothing to do with the world,&rdquo; and thus denies his or her contact with external physicality, although the person&#146;s physical body is very much in this world, the person is cheating himself and indulging in selfishness. Service to humanity with a view to serve Parama Purus&#x301;a and with the same attachment which one feels towards oneself and Parama Purus&#x301;a is an essential prerequisite for progress in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. This will establish the equilibrium and parallelism of the individual rhythms with the rhythms of the external physicalities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The microcosm is in a dormant state, and the jiivabha&#x301;va, the feeling of the unit state, is in a condition of slumber. The point where the jiivabha&#x301;va, that is, the sense of the unit identity, is locked, is called kula. Hence those who achieve perfection through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; are called kaola. (Kaola, with this meaning, is also used as a surname.) Those who can move the collective ectoplasm through the medium of their ectoplasmic rhythm, can awaken new power in shabda through their own ectoplasmic strength. The awakening of this power in shabda is called purashcaran&#x301;a in Sanskrit. And those who can perform such a tough task are called Maha&#x301;kaola. They alone are worthy of the status of guru and no one else. When a Maha&#x301;kaola awakens vibrations in the universal ectoplasmic body through the medium of particular shabdas, those shabdas [are also altered and] acquire the status of siddha mantras. A spiritual aspirant can only achieve perfection through the medium of those siddha mantras. Other mantras are not capable of leading to success, and spiritual aspirants cannot awaken them. A person&#146;s individual efforts will never be sufficient for that task.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Every person has certain mental limitations. He or she can only proceed to a certain extent and then cannot do anything further. Further progress requires special power and special grace. And this power and grace of God are always available for everyone. But people must use their existing strength in order to utilize that grace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->What is the range of these shabdas, whose troughs and crests are expressed in vibrational rhythms? The medium as well as the spirit of the human&#146;s individual life are personal, but in the Cosmic body, as well as in the case of less-developed creatures, the spirit is personal or individual but the medium is impersonal or Cosmic. An existence where the medium is impersonal [or Cosmic] but the spirit is individual is called an animal existence. In other words, any progress in the life of an animal is due to the vibrational power of Parama Purus&#x301;a; the medium therefore is Cosmic or impersonal, but the spirit is individual. The progress which is attained through the personal spirit and impersonal medium is towards Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. Therefore there is no chance of a spiritual fall in the life of an animal. Animals are set firmly on a path of gradual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->As the medium is impersonal, the growth in animals is from the crude to the subtle. But when due to engagement in subtler activities the medium also acquires individual influence, when its [mental] colour and its feeling do not remain entirely impersonal, gradually thinking and intellect are born. We find this in developed animals. The transformation in a dog is due to the effect of the personal, or individual, medium on the impersonal medium; this does not occur in lower creatures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->There is a big difference between a wild Alsatian in a jungle and one who is a pet. The medium of the one is influenced by the impersonal, that of the other is under the impact of an educated person. When in a living being the influence of the personal or individual surpasses the influence of the impersonal [or Cosmic], at that point the frame of that being can no longer be called animal but is called a human being. So this is the human status.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Due to one&#146;s individual effort, para&#x301; gradually develops step by step into pashyantii, madhyama&#x301;, [dyotama&#x301;na], shrutigocara&#x301; and vaekharii.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> These steps are from the subtle to the crude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Similarly in the Cosmic order, development is from the subtle to the crude, as the medium there is Universal Mind. The vibrational principle appears in the third phase of extroversial development. This vibrational principle is fully operative in matter and in the bodies and minds of undeveloped and underdeveloped creatures. The same vibrational principle functions in the human body when it starts from the point of para&#x301; and gets full extroversial expression. When a person will awaken caetanya in a mantra, that is, when he or she will do purashcaran&#x301;a, he or she will move from negativity to positivity, from human para&#x301;bindu to human sahasra&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The starting point of the vibrational principle is the culminating or last point of the primordial principle. In other words, the last point of the primordial expression and the starting point of the vibrational faculty are one and the same. The movement after mantra caetanya is from the fundamental negativity to the fundamental positivity. In other words, this movement will be the reverse of the movement of the vibrational faculty; it will be from crude to subtle and not from subtle to crude. In the vibrational principle, the first crest and trough are far apart, and thereafter the distance becomes shorter and shorter. In spiritual practice, the first troughs and crests will be frequent, and then the intervals will gradually lengthen till a straight line is formed. Thus, in the second phase, that is, in the returning phase, the vibrational principle will be reconverted into the primordial principle and the primordial principle or primordial faculty will ultimately convert itself into the basic faculty.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  This  movement, however, is only possible after the mantra has become [awakened], not before that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Spiritual practice is essential for human beings; and for spiritual practice initiation is necessary. And those human beings who do not perform spiritual practice are under the influence of the Cosmic principle. They are guided by the Cosmic rhythmic order, but as this is an impersonal entity they will never be able to enjoy liberation or salvation. So what is the way out? In what direction must they move after mantra caetanya? They have to do an about-turn and cross the three phases described above. They have to return to their original abode. They have to merge back into the One from where their existence sprang.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->What then is to be done? The scriptures say that you do not have to exert very much. I have said before that there can be no progress either in the realm of physicality or in the realm of intellectuality. Those who are hankering for progress in these fields are indulging in a self-cheating business. Whether they admit it or not, they know that they know nothing. Ask them whether they are getting pleasure in the realm of physicality. They will admit that they are not. Ask a good businessman whether he is earning good profits. His reply will be, &ldquo;What profit? I am incurring losses.&rdquo; This will be his reply whether you belong to Income Tax Department or not! To run after progress in the realm of physicality and intellectuality is utter foolishness, a waste of time, as there is no progress in these fields. But I have already said that you may make efforts in these directions provided you can convert or metamorphose them into spirituality. But as far as spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is concerned, or as far as efforts to achieve bliss are concerned, there is no touch of pain in them, as bliss is infinite pleasure alone. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; then is what wise men have to do. And in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the first thing to be done is to use mantra caetanya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->In simple words, what we have to do is to return home from where we came. We have all come from Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; the Supreme Entity &ndash; and from the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a-kendra, the nucleus of the universe &ndash; that is, Purus&#x301;ottama. We have to return to the same place. It is like a boy who has played throughout the day away in the fields, and now that evening comes, returns home. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the process of returning home. The child has played outside for the whole day. As evening approaches, he thinks, &ldquo;Father must have returned home. Let me also return home and sit next to him.&rdquo; When one is tired of this world and worldliness, one yearns to go back to spirituality, that is, to one&#146;s home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->And what is our permanent abode &ndash; our home? It is Parama Purus&#x301;a parama&#x301;shrayah Shriiniva&#x301;sah. Here shrii refers to the Universal Creative Faculty, or Parama&#x301; Prakrti. The abode of this Universal Faculty is also your abode. Therefore going home is a simple task. It requires no scholarship, no knowledge, no intellectual faculty &ndash; no long and tedious lecturing. The scriptures tell us to remember three points in order to return home. They are shravana [hearing about the Supreme], manana [ideating on the Supreme] and nidi-dhya&#x301;sana [meditating on the Supreme with an unbroken flow of mind].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->We know that the vibrational faculty converts subtler waves into cruder waves in the phase of creation. Hari katha&#x301; [devotional talk] provides subtler vibrations. You must allow yourself to receive these subtler waves. It has already been said that sound waves are the subtlest in the chain of Cosmic expression. The importance of Hari katha&#x301; in spiritual development is great. Hearing about God is much more important than studies in spirituality, as sound is subtler than visual form. Therefore wherever there is an opportunity, listen to His name and speak it to others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->When you speak His name to others, you also hear it. This dual enjoyment in reciting His name is called kiirtana.

This is shravana. The effect of shravana is that vibrations of sound which are moving from crude to subtle are set in motion against the flow in the vibrational faculty, where wordly sounds are moving from subtle to crude. This will set in reverse motion a flow of sounds, and this will take one up to the starting point of the vibrational faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->I have already stated that the starting point of the vibrational faculty and the culminating point of the primordial faculty are one and the same. You will therefore reach the culminating point of the primordial faculty. The vibrational phase is called bhava &ndash; also bhava sa&#x301;gara or bhava pa&#x301;ra&#x301;va&#x301;ra [ocean of creation]. The word bhava thus denotes the entire realm of the vibrational principle. This is the world of mundane involvements. The Caetanya, or Cognitive Principle of this faculty is called Bhava, and the Shakti, or Operative Principle of this faculty is called Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti. This is the worldly bondage. Only through the medium of Hari katha&#x301; can one cross this ocean of bhava, the entire range of the vibrational faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Thereafter comes manana, that is, thinking only about Parama Purus&#x301;a and about no one else.

The fact is that even after surrendering everything to Parama Purus&#x301;a, your arch-enemy &ndash; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; remains. Because you will say, &ldquo;I have surrendered everything to God.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; my friend, surrender that &ldquo;I&rdquo; to God.

What is important is to have proper shravana, manana and nidi-dhya&#x301;sana. If one does this, one will no longer find it difficult to learn to do anything.

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s discussion will be on &ldquo;Vibration, Form and Colour&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Vibration<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->From where does vibration come? Whenever an action takes place, its character is established by the nature of its waves and these waves are but vibrations, flowing through different channels. The relative transposition of objects is what we call action. And this is why every action has vibrations due to its movement. Just as action is of many varieties, so is vibration. Every action has its own vibrations. The vibrations of two actions are not identical. Had they been so, there would not have been any difference between the two actions. Vibrations occur according to the shock that emanates from a cardinal point, according to the type of action that takes place at that fundamental point. Have you ever thrown a stone into a pond and seen the result? According to the velocity or strength you apply of that stone, its vibrations also differ accordingly in wave-length and character. Here one more thing should be clearly understood and that is that the cause and controller of these vibrations also imbibes vibrations: it is also a vehicle of energy and not an inert, passive entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->I will give you a good example of vibration in human body. Take, for instance, the case of anger. A great impact of a shocking provocation has taken place in your mind, as the result of which a great vibration or agitation has seized a particular portion of your brain. The next moment that agitation runs from your brain to your whole body through your nervous system with lightning speed. Then it can be understood that a paroxysm of rage has taken possession of your mind. As the result of this violent vibration in your nervous system, your face gets red and hot and your hands and feet tremble. None of your sensory or motor organs, particularly your motor organs, can function properly and your words become jumbled. Those who stammer a little in their speech, become conspicuously more stammering. People&#146;s judgment and intelligence with which they keep mean propensities in check, become dulled by the impact of these violent vibrations. A furious man, regardless of place, time and person, resorts to wilful and indiscriminate vituperation. As an aftermath of this excessive physical and cerebral excitement, his brain becomes hot. He cannot think whether for right or wrong. His body and his internal glands begin to feel limp and depressed. His appetite forsakes him. Does it not happen like this?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Since in every action and in every entity there is vibration, human beings receive tanma&#x301;tras (sensible or ultrasensible inferences) with the help of the vibrations emanating from an action as soon as it is performed, or from the presence of an object. Actually these vibrations themselves are tanma&#x301;tras, for they carry the subtle, characteristic essence of an action or object and convey it to the sensory organs. Then again the vibrations of tanma&#x301;tras of a sight or a scene which may sometimes be created by the motor organs, are received by the sensory organs of the perceiver. The various vibrations that we encounter in the world are divisible into five main tanma&#x301;tras: sound, touch, form, taste and smell. We perceive them with the help of our sensory organs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The perception of the difference in tanma&#x301;tras is due to the differences in the vibrations, without the senses of sound, touch, etc. would lose their distinctive features. The vibrational lines in a record are made in a special way. When you bring into play those mute vibrational lines with the phonograph needle, a stir in the atmosphere is created which is but the reappearance of the original vibrations, the vibrations of sound waves, not those of touch, form, etc. That is why you hear the voice of the original reciter or singer, or the sound of the instrumentalists. As the form-waves were not recorded in the record, you cannot visually see the forms and features of the instrumentalists during their performance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->There is a sweet smell in the flower but it would have appeared odourless to you, had not the smell-tanma&#x301;tras or waves been carried to the gates of your nose by the aerial vibrations. Then again you could not have sensed the existence of the airborne fragrance, had not sympathetic waves been created in your afferent nerves upon their contact with the fragrance-carrying breeze. Similarly you would not have sensed the sweetness of a delicious sweet, inspite of its contact with a particular region of your tongue, had not that contact created a particular type of vibration or sensation in your afferent nerves by means of your taste-organ.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The distinctiveness of vibrations or waves does not end here. After the contact of different types of things with the tongue, different types of contractions and expansions occur on different portions of the tongue and palate, as the result of which their respective vibrations are also different. It is because of these vibrational differences that chilli tastes pungent or hot, sugar tastes sweet and margosa tastes bitter. The interesting aspect of this is that we sometimes become confused and cannot distinguish one object from another if their vibrational differences are less. Such confusion sometimes arises between honey and molasses, among the seeds of tomato, chilli and brinjal, and between a genuine diamond and a fake diamond. In individual life many of you must have noticed that water tastes a little sweet after taking neem. Chemically, there is not very much difference between bitterness and sweetness. By the vibrational influence of the hydrogen in the water, the bitter vibrations of the neem are turned into those of sweetness and we think that the water is sweet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->All that is comprehensible and graspable in the world is but a vibrational play. Just as the tanma&#x301;tras of sound, touch, form, taste and smell are creating vibrations in our nerves by coming in contact with the gates of our sensory and motor organs, so our mind, being also similarly vibrated by these vibrations or waves, goes on transmuting the citta (mental plate) into the same forms of these waves. As a result we &ldquo;see&rdquo; elephants and horses, &ldquo;hear&rdquo; Puravi and Bhaeravii ra&#x301;gas, &ldquo;touch&rdquo; hot and cold, &ldquo;taste&rdquo; bitter and sweet and &ldquo;smell&rdquo; shiulii and rajaniigandha&#x301; flowers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now consider this vast universe. What is the characteristic of this universe? The universe is the psychic manifestation of the Macrocosm: His mind stuff is the universe, which we call the visible world. How did this Brahmic Citta come into being? The Citta is the static result of mental action. The apparently static or stationary entity that comes into being, as opposed to those entities influenced by the sentient (sattva) and mutative (rajah) forces, is created by the static force (tamah) of Prakrti &ndash; which, whether it is original or born of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (past momenta), is nothing else but citta. The characteristic of the static force is to give form, to create or evolve resultants, to bring inertness or staticity. So citta, the resultative place of he mind, is dominated by the static force and takes the form of objects in the external world or objects created by the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Wherever there is form, it is of momentary duration and of limited demarcation. The same holds true for the Cosmic Citta also. Hiran&#x301;yagarbha or the Subjective Entity of the subtle Cosmic Mind is superlatively vast and in this way evolves the different fundamental factors. So His mental plate is also limitless, but however great its manifestation, it does have a shape. There is an aura of thought-waves revolving around the Cosmic Nucleus or Purus&#x301;ottama, the nucleus of the Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, as the result of which energy particles are created. The five fundamental factors &ndash; ethereal, aerial, luminous, liquid and solid &ndash; are the sequential metamorphoses of these energy particles, so this quinquelemental cycle is the resultant of the Cosmic thought-cycle; but this thought-cycle, too is the resultant of pure consciousness. Every revolution of that cycle is the playful manifestation of Prakrti that produces vibration sometimes in consciousness, sometimes in thoughts, sometimes in energy and sometimes in the so-called inanimate objects. This though-cycle, evolved in the Cosmic Nucleus, Purus&#x301;ottama, is what is called the elliptical universe. All revolving material objects are controlled by both the centrifugal (avidya&#x301;) and centripetal (vidya&#x301;) forces; and as a result their totality looks somewhat elliptical. No matter how enormous the Cosmic Cycle is, it appears to be elliptical and thus it is called Brahma&#x301;n&#x301;da&#x301; (Brahma or Supreme Entity: plus an&#x301;d&#x301;a or &ldquo;egg&rdquo;). Within the Cosmic Cycle every entity represents a different vibration; those small or great cycles, which revolve in a concordant harmony, keeping intact all their rhythms and tempos, are all modulated and attuned to the vast universal vibration. Their microcosmic individual waves find their self expression and development in that very vast universal vibration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->How did this elliptical universe come into being? The Cosmic Citta is the material cause of the world. But the mind stuff or citta finds expression or takes shape only when it comes in contact with psychic vibrations. So we may say that universe is the manifestation of the Cosmic Citta, born out of psychic vibrations. All the tanma&#x301;tras of sound, touch, form, taste and smell that are composed of different kinds of vibrational currents resulting from the gradually crudifying expressions of the Cosmic Consciousness under the influence of the static principle of Prakrti. They are the analytic expressions of those universal rhythms or vibrations. Thus the visible world is created through the gradual crudifications of His thought-projection. The thought-waves, metamorphosing from subtle to the crude manifestations and then, on their way back to their nuclear origin from the crude to the subtle, assuming the mentally developed human form, are indeed guiding the thought-wave cycles towards their ultimate fulfilment. Since the world is His thought-projection, it may be said that this visible world is only His act of thinking and abides only in His imagination. Due to the vibration of Cosmic Citta these variegated forms have blossomed forth through newer and newer thoughts, forms and waves, following one another in succession.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->What is imagination? It is psychic action or sam&#x301;vedana. Every action or sensation is vibrative. This universe which is created as the result of the sam&#x301;vedana of the Cosmic Mind, must move in accordance with the vibrational law of the thought-process. The internal expression of the five tanma&#x301;tras takes place in the individual mind in a vibrational flow. Similarly, the vibrations of the Cosmic Mind, also create the tanma&#x301;tras which the unit entity receives or holds with its own sensory and motor organs and its pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya. (The five vital airs, e.g. pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, apa&#x301;na, sama&#x301;na, uda&#x301;na and vya&#x301;na). The unit entity receives from the outside world the various tanma&#x301;tras which pulsate in that very universal life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->What is the nature of this visible world? Each and every object is moving; none is immobile. Not a single entity in this universe is stationary. All are progressing, for none can be static even for a fraction of a second. Whether the mind likes it or not, whether the soul wants it or not, one has to run after things to come, leaving the present behind &ndash; this is Prakrti&#146;s inexorable course. No matter how dear a person may be to me, I cannot hold that person for ever. Death with its outstretched powerful fangs is fast approaching to snatch my dear one away from me with its vicious grip. No finite entity is capable of thwarting its onslaught, for all finite entities are subject to time and Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Only the essence of all His evolved entities &ndash; His characteristic Self that remains as the unexpressed witness of all is supratemporal, beyond the orbit of time. The real awakening of any entity depends on its ability to realize its characteristic self, and in such a state of awakening, the question of station or motion, progress or regress does not arise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I have already said that relative transposition of objects is action. An action imbibes motion, rhythm and vibrations, and out of these vibrations flow the tanma&#x301;tras. The vibrations which are excited in the mind through the intake of tanma&#x301;tras corresponding to one&#146;s vrttis or particular bent of mind, will be just opposite to those created by tanma&#x301;tras, which do not correspond to one&#146;s particular vrttis. The former will be pleasant and the latter will be painful. Generally the easier the intake of the impact of vibrations, the more pleasant is the effect and the more difficult the vibrational intake, the more painful or sorrowful is the effect. So the vibrational state in which the citta seeks to remain is called happiness (sukham) and that in which it does not want to remain is called grief (dukham). Even when the object of happiness or sorrow that comes to us as the result of the past reactive momentum of our previous lives, creates any great vibration, we are very often incapable of receiving it at all. Finding someone in such a serious predicament, we say &ldquo;The man&#146;s mind has received a serious shock. Will he be able to endure it?&rdquo; At times, as the result of a great shock and due to extreme tension in the nervous system, a person may even die of heart failure. Suppose someone&#146;s dearest relative has died. Naturally, this news will give her mind a great shock. If her mind possesses even a little strength to check the inroad of such a vibration, she will be able to bear it. We call a person &ldquo;tough&rdquo; who has greater power of resistance and endurance. Even if a person who lacks such power of endurance survives, even if her heart does not stop, her mind will readily stop functioning. We then say that the woman has become unconscious or is in a coma. Hysteria in women with weak minds and nerves is due to some extent to this vibrational shock; but we call it a disease, for here the weakness is rather excessive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Similar is the impact of happiness. This shock is also not easy to endure and absorb. If an abjectly poor man suddenly receives a lakh of rupees, the strong vibration of the news that arises in his mind, will violently agitate his whole nervous system. Such a highly vibrative news may even put an end to his life for his limited strength may not be able to bear such vibrational waves. Suppose while your mother is taking her dinner, you receive the news of her father&#146;s death, a great vibration will arise in her mind. If she is informed of this news suddenly, her limited strength may not be able to endure that violent vibrational force. In such a case the news should be disclosed to her gradually, by slow degrees, so that her mind will be able to gain sufficient strength to withstand the vehemence of that vibration. You may start with, &ldquo;No news from grandpa for quite a long time. I wonder how he&#146;s getting on.&rdquo; On hearing this, an ominous, premonitive vibration will arise in the corners of her mind but even this you should say after her dinner is finished. Then after a while, you may add, &ldquo;Maybe grandpa is very ill and that is why there is no letter.&rdquo; This will further strengthen her mind. Then you may say, &ldquo;Perhaps he is no more. No wonder, he was quite aged, wasn&#146;t he? But indeed his life is so precious to us.&rdquo; At last you break the news slowly and cautiously.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The power of enduring different kinds of vibrations varies in the same person in different conditions. So you should never suddenly break any news of great joy or great sorrow to anyone. First prepare the ground &ndash; create the right atmosphere for the mind and then bring the news to their knowledge. If you can gradually create the right type of waves, the strength to withstand the strain of the vibrations will come by itself. Thus, you should first tell the poor man &ldquo;If you get a hundred rupees, what will you do with the money?&rdquo; Then you give him a stronger dose: &ldquo;If you could get a thousand rupees in a lottery, what would you do with it?&rdquo; In this way you go on creating more and more pleasant vibrations in his mind &ndash; you go on habituating him to greater and greater shocks of happiness, and then at last you tell him he has won a prize of a lakh of rupees in the lottery. You will then see that as a result he can maintain his mental balance to a great extent.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The stamina to stand vibrations differs in different people. Hence various degrees of happiness or sorrow are experienced by different people, and these differences depend on their respective mental constitutions. The subtle causes of these different mental constitutions are their acquired sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or reactive momenta, and the crude causes are their nerve cells, nerve tissues, glandular secretions, etc. The sudden vibrational impact on the body and mind makes the mind react violently, resulting in the cessation of the cardiac functions. This also explains the death of a person struck by lightning. The sudden contact of the eyes with an extremely dazzling radiance often results in the total impairment of vision. If we look directly at the brilliant sun for a few moments, our visual power becomes temporarily stunned and we cannot see anything for some time. Similarly, when some very high pitched or loud sound strikes the eardrum, the power of hearing may be destroyed. The sensitivity of every organ may be suspended by the impact of any violent vibration; this stupefaction, if the intensity of the vibrational impact is very great, may even become permanent. Yet sometimes powerful vibrations may help stimulate and restore the power of organs which have not been functioning for years. You must have heard of a person who had been blind or deaf and dumb since his childhood, regaining the lost power of his impaired organs in his latter years either by stroke of lightning or by being suddenly informed of an extremely happy or sad news.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In this visible world you receive tanma&#x301;tras in accordance with your strength and ability. When the tanma&#x301;tric vibration is more powerful than your strength or capacity, you are unable to receive it. Similarly, when the vibrational momentum is more slow and slack than your power of perception, you cannot receive it either. If people whisper in a soft voice, you cannot hear them &ndash; there you become deaf. Then again, if there is a very loud noise somewhere nearby, you cannot hear that either, for your hearing has been stunned &ndash; here too you are deaf. Your system may easily endure petty mental afflictions and in that case you do not cry before people. Then when you are filled with extreme grief you become so dazed and bewildered that in this case, too, you do not cry before people. You have seen a child suddenly stops crying in the midst of intense suffering. We call it &ldquo;choked in crying&rdquo;, for the child is unable to endure the violent sorrowful vibrations. You can tolerate a small pain with a smiling face and people cannot detect your hurt. An intense pain stuns you into unconsciousness and then, too, people are not aware of it. You are able to utter pathetic cries of &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; only in the intervening state to embellish your plight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->You cannot perceive the essences of ultra-subtle and ultra-crude entities: it is beyond your mental capacity to receive their vibrational waves and that is why, you cannot normally detect their existence. There are many birds and reptiles that can receive the premonitive vibrations of an event before its actual materialization. A frog detects the pre-indication of rains long before many other living beings do: it catches the premonitory vibrations beforehand and keeps croaking the announcement of the forthcoming happiness to the four winds. Normally humans, however, cannot know anything before the rain actually starts, for the requisite subtle mechanism to receive the pre-rain vibrations is not well developed in them. So for forecast they have to take recourse to meteorology and use a special type of scientific instrument.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->A crow has a natural premonitive instinct regarding storms. An owl and to some extent a dog can sense beforehand the possible occurrence of an earthquake or some other unforeseen natural calamity of great magnitude. Such power of apprehending phenomenal vibrations exists not in ten or twenty but in innumerable species of birds. Such a power is indeed of paramount necessity in their rigorous struggle for survival. Such a power did exist, too, to some extent, among the prehistoric people. But today, in this age of so-called civilization, human beings, having become extremely ease-loving, have lost that power through misuse and lack of necessity; just as their tails, their ability to move their ears and their capacity to hold things with their feet have disappeared. Now the hairiness of their bodies and the strength of their teeth and nails are also becoming extinct. The greater the preoccupation of creatures with the struggle for existence, the necessarily greater must be their power of premonition or prescience of impending danger, or else their existence will be effaced from the surface of the earth &ndash; this is the law of nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Those creatures that pulsate in the darkness of the deep sea are blind due to the darkness; and hence by natural law, just as their bodies possess the power to radiate light, so as weapons some of them possess sensitive spines, some have glandular poison jets and some have attractive voices. With the help of these, they compensate for their lack of visual perception of form-vibrations and preserve their own existence by their subtler reception of other tanma&#x301;tras or vibrations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The capacity of an instinctively wicked person to absorb vibration differs somewhat from that of an average person. The amount of beating that might endanger the life of average people, may be easily borne by those who are instinctively wicked. Very often they remain quite unconcerned about the bleeding that pours out of their cuts and wounds &ndash; rather they feel relieved from such bleeding.

Take, for instance, a very tiny particle like an atom. From this also form tanma&#x301;tras or vibrations emanate, but human eyes normally cannot perceive these extremely minute vibrations. So human beings have to bring them within the scope of visibility of their sight organs with the help of a microscope or other such instruments. Thus apprehending the vibrations of these minute entities is beyond the capacity of the human sensory organs. Remote sounds or inarticulate vocal expressions may not be normally heard by your ears; for this you will have to take the help of a microphone or a loud speaker, because perceiving these sounds is beyond the range of your ear-organ. There are several tiny creatures that produce faint noises: they are hovering all around you, yet you cannot hear their sounds. You cannot hear the sounds of Calcutta with your crude acoustic power, but through a radio you can receive them very easily, for your radio receiver has a far greater power than yours to receive distant sound-waves. You receive from the aerial vibrations what had been received by the radio receiver and then transmitted by it again into the ocean of air. So it is clear that there are distinctive differences in the vibrational reception of different instruments, and humans and animals receive tanma&#x301;tras according to the respective capacities of their different sensory mechanisms.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Does only what you see with your eyes have a form and not anything else? No, not at all: all vibrations have forms. Every tanma&#x301;tra has a form and this form is the resultant of its vibrational expressions. Viewing this vast Cosmic Citta, which we call the Universe, we exclaim in awe, &ldquo;Oh how vast&rdquo;. This, too, has a form &ndash; this, too, is the resultant of vibrations. Because of its vastness this Cosmic Citta is sometimes called formless, for its form has no limit. It is limitless not because it has neither beginning nor end, but because every infinitesimal fraction of it is flowing through innumerable forms, through countless vibrational expressions towards the inconceivable glory of the ocean of forms. It is a passing show &ndash; a panorama of transient phenomena &ndash; a changing reality. This vast vibration of the Supreme Spirit, this inconceivable expression of the Supreme Exultation &ndash; this thought-projection of the metempiric Entity, your ordinary organs have no power to apprehend. Your sight-organ cannot apprehend the vibrations of this Super-form nor can your crude ears receive its vast sound waves. Where there is vibration, there is sound. The universe is His imaginative thought-projection which is also vibrational, and so it has a sound also. But the amount of self-development that is required to perceive that supramundane sound is generally lacking in human beings. As long as they are aware of their individuality, they cannot receive the vibrations of the Great in the fullest measure, since all the powers of individuals are more or less limited. You can feel any object by touch but you cannot say, &ldquo;I am touching the Supreme Brahma.&rdquo; You do not have that sensory capacity, for the power that is required to touch Him is not so developed in you.<!-- /block --></p>

You have been hearing so many kinds of sounds and yet you are unable to perceive that eternal sound which is the seed of all sounds. To apprehend these sound waves, an extremely powerful instrument is necessary: the acoustic mechanism in your body at present is too pitifully weak for the purpose. Your instrument of hearing should be immeasurably more powerful than any radio-set that receives soundwaves from the air. Since your weak instrument is quite incapable of apprehending that sound, you are doubtful about the existence of such a phenomenon. But in order to receive the vibrations of the Infinite, you will have to identify your citta or mind and all your organs with that Infinite. Then alone will you be able to merge yourself in the Supreme Vibrational Exultation, surging through your theopathic trance. It is only when your &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling and His, become one, that you can know and hear His mind &ndash; that you can experience His sound with every molecule of your being. Then your unit-mind will merge in the Cosmic Mind. In that auspicious moment when your &ldquo;I&rdquo; and the Cosmic &ldquo;I&rdquo; will meet in the supreme reunion, all your egotistic frivolities, fevers and frets will cease.

<a name="6..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Now the question may arise whether the different varieties of sound that arise in the universe are the same or different from those of the Cosmic Mind. Are your footsteps, when you walk, the mute witness of your silence or are they the expression of your motivity? What you eat is also sonorific. Every small or great action of your life, every clash of vrttis (desires), every venous vibration is eloquent of a language. Tranquil mountain ranges, flowing streams and river, dense forests &ndash; none are mute, none are silent. They are all absorbed in an inexpressible sonorific meditation. Only those who have ears can hear them. None of these sounds is distinct from that Cosmic Sound, from that boundless sonic manifestation. All are Its inseparable flows. All are manifestations of one and the same On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. And yet due to our analytical minds we perceive these different manifestations to be different types of sounds. Consider, for instance, a village market place. What do you hear from a distance? A medley of howls, is it not? But as you approach nearer to the village, you will notice that the cacophony of sounds becomes differentiated into various meaningful sentences or words: &ldquo;Give me a kilo of brinjals.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your potatoes are too small,&rdquo; and so on. The some total of all these utterances becomes a howl. Just as all the sounds of the market place have been blended and united into one roaring soundwave, similarly all the sounds of the universe are merged into one On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, the unified form of all sounds. As every action is vibrative, so every expression of the Cosmic Citta is vibrational. Among all the vibrational tanma&#x301;tras, the subtlest is the sound tanma&#x301;tra. That is why the sound tanma&#x301;tra is the first stage of crudification of the subtle mental sphere into the crude physical world. On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is the initial manifestation, the first supersonic expression of the Cosmic Citta; thus, it is called Shabda-Brahma or Sonic Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Among the vibrations in this created world, colour occupies the position of secondary importance after the sound tanma&#x301;tra. All forms in this universe are chromatic and the distinction between objects is indeed discernible through colour, for colour indicates the attributional difference. The three binding principles of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, sattva (sentient), rajah (mutative), and tamah (static), are also colour. Whenever there is an excess of sattva in any particular entity, the vibrations emanating from that object will be sentient. If you perceive those sentient vibrations with your eyes, or through any other means, you will find that they have created a white colour on your mental plate or Citta. Thus, the vibration of colour indicates the attribute or quality of an entity. Sattva is white, rajah is red, and tamah is black. The greater degree of purity, the more predominance of sattva and proportionately whiter in colour. That is why in India whiteness and purity are often used synonymously. What is this white colour? White is not a colour; it is the combination of all colours. And what is black colour? Black is also not a colour; it is the absence of all colours. That is why black is the symbol of inertness, for it is the colour of the static principle. It is due to the absence of any vibration or one&#146;s inability to apprehend them that an object appears black. In darkness we see everything as black.<!-- /block --></p>

This white colour is composed of the seven component colours: violent, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red.

You may recall that when your mind is attracted to any object, it is form that attracts you most. The science of chromatics is a wonderful science. The ploy of colours determines the affinity between object and object, animal and animal and between human and human. Due to this chromatic affinity we are attracted to an unknown person, even though we are not at all acquainted with him. You must have noticed in your individual lives that you like some people immediately without any apparent reason, and you hesitate to associate with other people, in spite of their widely publicized praise. Behind this experience is the same chromatic play, which you feel but cannot explain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->I have already told you that the sentient principle is white. So the people in whose minds white vibrations are flowing we call Sattvagun&#x301;ii or sentient (also known as vipravarn&#x301;a). The mutative principle is red. So those people whose minds are filled with red vibrations we call Rajogun&#x301;ii or mutative. Due to the greater crudeness in the mutative principle, the Rajogun&#x301;ii mind is more partial to crude activities than the sattvic one. Such mutative people are popularly considered to be of the Ks&#x301;atriya Varn&#x301;a or warrior temperament, possessing energy and valour. The sentient principle is cognitive, and the mutative principle is energetic. Vaeshyavarn&#x301;a, the temperament of the business class is concerned with activities much cruder than those of the Vipra and the Ks&#x301;atriya. Here the Citta or the mental plate is dominated by yellow vibrations, which are created by the combined influence of the mutative and static principles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Those whose Citta is predominately influenced by the static principle, naturally possess a greater degree of inertness than others: they have neither the knowledge of the sentient persons nor the valour of the mutative ones nor the capacity for activating things of those dominated by the mutato-static principles. This static inertness or crudeness is black. Those whose minds are predominately black are popularly known as shu&#x301;dras or the labour class. Thus all the colours are related to one&#146;s mental waves, and according to these waves a person is called a Brahmin, Ks&#x301;atriya, Vaeshya or Shu&#x301;dra. But it should be emphasized that any person can achieve Vipravarn&#x301;a by means of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (spiritual practice). In order to change the form and colour of the vibrations, it is necessary to change the mental tendency. From the Pura&#x301;nas we know that the King Vishva&#x301;mitra was a Ks&#x301;atriya in the early part of his life, but he attained Bra&#x301;hminic qualities through Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Lord Krs&#x301;na&#146;s father, Vasudeva, was a ks&#x301;atriya. His relative Nanda of Gokul, was a Vaeshya for he earned his living through dairy farming. Still another of his relatives, Garga Muni, who christened Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was a Vipra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->The indication of colour is most glaring in the form-tanma&#x301;tras. But it is not found only in the form-tanma&#x301;tras. Whenever there is vibration there is tanma&#x301;tra, and there is colour as well. If the proper instrument is used the colour and the subtle form of every vibration can be detected. Where there is a line, a form must necessarily be there. According to the rhythm of the vibration, sound must also be present. Any variation in the rhythm will cause variation in the sound and colour as well. The radiated vibration of an object in an object in the day will be quite different from that of the same object in the night due to differences in the light-waves, and so the object will appeal differently to your eyes. Why? Because it changes its colour. Since mundane vibrations are mainly dependent upon the sun, the vibrations of the human nervous system vary according to the presence or absence of the sun in the sky. Daylight imposes mutative influence on the human nerves and night-time imposes a static influence, causing the inertness of sleep in the body and mind. The periods of sunrise, sunset, moon and midnight (the sandhya&#x301;s) bring about a sentient transparency in the Citta. Thus, it is clear how great is the vibrational influence of the variability of colour, sound and mood, and people are naturally disposed to such influences. Ladies are not inclined to choosing expensive saris or cloths at night, for the colour is not then properly discernible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->We apprehend phonic as well as alphabetical difference quite accurately due to these vibrational differences. Short, long or galloping intonations are merely degrees of vibrational differences. The differences in Svaravarn&#x301;as (vowels) and Vyain&#x32D;janvarn&#x301;as (consonants) are also totally dependent on the difference in their vibrational characteristics. In the Sam&#x301;skrta language, the letters of the alphabet are called Varn&#x301;as or colours and all the consonants end in the first vowel &ldquo;a&rdquo;. So you see that Varn&#x301;a-Paricaya (the first book of the alphabet) literally means &ldquo;acquaintance with colour&rdquo; and this colour is, of course, the colour vibration. The Giita&#x301; also says that the four Varn&#x301;as or castes are evolved from the differences of attributes of activities. The differences in attributes account for the differences in activities and the differences in activities account for the differences in colours. With the change of attributive activity, the colour will also change. Hence the distinction of Varn&#x301;a or caste in social life is not an unchangeable or inviolable institution. The varn&#x301;a has evolved according to one&#146;s activities and by changing one&#146;s activities one can change the caste.<!-- /block --></p>

You are endeavouring to realize that endless flow of joy, to evolve your own consciousness to that blissful state. How can you apprehend that endless blissful flow through a particular limited object? In the worship of idols the tendency of the human mind is extroversial, and in this way human beings gradually degrade their minds from the awareness of that Infinite Supreme Entity. Their extroverted minds run after the crude, and as the result of this persistent pursuit of crude objects, they themselves gradually become crude. Discarding all vagaries of pleasure and pain, human beings have to progress from the mortal world towards immortality, towards the touchstone of Absolute Bliss &ndash; and when this is attained, everything is attained. Their movement should be towards the calm tranquillity of the soul, forsaking the humdrum of external life. But they will never be able to attain this as long as they involve themselves with idols, apprehensible through the indriyas or organs. They will proceed more and more towards crudeness and negativity, enmeshing themselves deeper in worldly bondages, and ultimately reach a state of oblivion &ndash; instead of attaining the ultimate goal of introversion of the evolutionary flow.

Human beings can achieve salvation only through knowledge, and true knowledge never recognizes such superficial rites and rituals as a means of attaining Brahma. Of course, if anyone fasts for his physical health, it is beneficial &ndash; but certainly not as a means of attaining Brahma. Is it not that the idol one worships is wholly an expression of the idolator&#146;s fanciful imagination? That which is purely a human creation &ndash; that which owes its form to the handicraft of a potter or an imagemaker &ndash; is nothing but a crude object. No matter what its subtle emotional connations may be, its foundation is crude. Before our very eyes it becomes distorted decayed and destroyed, how can this vulnerable object, born of your imagination, give you salvation?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->Can you bind God to an image made of clay, rocks, metal or wood, infusing life into it by chanting mantras for show? Though the image is but a small thing, the temple is much larger and yet Brahma is far greater than even the temple &ndash; He is beginningless and endless. The image, the temple all are within Him. How can anyone confine Him in a crude form? Such idolatry will lead you to sufferings. Until you practise intuitional science sincerely your troubles will never cease. So you see, idolatry is not only accepted in the Pura&#x301;n&#x301;as as the proper way to worship; rather it has been opposed by them as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Some people say that in the first stage they will worship an image for concentration of mind and then gradually give up the practice later on. Such an approach is not correct, for they will eventually become attached to the image and it will be very difficult to remove the resultant Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra (acquired momentum) of that attachment. You must have noticed at home how attached you become to your cats and dogs after having kept them for some time as your pets. Imagine, then, how difficult it will be for you to give up that image which you have worshipped as your beloved Lord with all the sweetness of your heart. So from the very start it is best not to indulge in image worship. Just as a flood after it recedes leaves behind a mark on the river-bank, so the staunch idol worshippers, too, find it painfully difficult to remove the impression of that Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra, even when they learn the introversial worship of Brahma and attain the ability to reach Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi. You will find this in the biography of a recent great Sa&#x301;dhaka who had to face a similar difficulty. One should avoid this predicament from the very start.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->Yet, only opposition to idolatry is not enough: the worship of Brahma should be done scrupulously, or else you will later regret and bemoan the futility of your life with the last drop of your tears at your last hour. You should make your life worthwhile through your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. How much can your worldly friends and relations do for you? After your death your relatives may perhaps ask, &ldquo;How much money has he left behind?&rdquo; Your friends may go to the crematorium and indulge in flattering reminiscences about you. Your husband or wife may cry for you for about ten or twelve days and then regain their normal composure. Your lot will be only a profound sigh &ndash; a record of the futility and frustration of your life. So do not waste your time lest you later have to repent.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->People may ask, &ldquo;We are ordinary people. If we always keep ourselves absorbed in the thought of Brahma, can we properly attend to our worldly duties?&rdquo; To this my reply is, of course you can, and you will do them still more beautifully. In the worship of Brahma there is a method by which easily and perfectly every worldly duty can be performed. For the ideation on Brahma a person does not have to become a hermit in the forest. Only go on behaving rightly and properly with every manifestation of Brahma in this universe &ndash; remove or rectify the mental disease of the criminals and reform their characters, cure the sick of their sickness, and arrange for their medicines and their diet. Just remember only this: that you have to behave properly and reasonably with every entity of this world. Pay special attention to the word &ldquo;properly&rdquo;. By &ldquo;proper behaviour&rdquo;, I mean that in which there is neither anger or jealously, neither attraction nor aversion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->You exist in a vast, limitless ocean of rasa or essences. A never-ending, radiant wave of manifestations is surging within and without you and radiating through all the ten directions &ndash; the indescribable vibrational expressions of small and great, accented and unaccented, eternally flowing thought-waves. Behave properly and reasonably with every expression, with every manifestation of the Cosmic mind. But always remember the One, Who is the essence of all these diverse vibrational manifestations. Train yourselves in the ideal of the lily, which blossoms in the mud and has to keep itself engaged in the struggle for existence day in and day out, parrying, bracing and fighting the shocks of muddy water and the force of storms and squalls and various other vicissitudes of fortune; and yet it does not forget the moon above. It keeps its love for the moon constantly alive. It seems but a most ordinary flower: there is nothing extraordinary about it. Yet, this most ordinary little flower has a romantic tie with the great moon. It has focused all its desires on the moon. Similarly, perhaps you are an ordinary creature &ndash; perhaps you have to pass your days in the ups and downs of worldly existence &ndash; yet do not forget that Supreme One. Keep all your desires inclined towards Him. Always keep yourself merged in His thought. Go deep into the mood of that Infinite Love. By this your worldly activities will not be hampered in any way.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->No matter what circumstances you are in, never lose sight of the Infinite One. Degradation is impossible for those who have accepted the Supreme Being as the Ideal of their lives. Indulging in mean thoughts only engenders crude vibrations in the Citta, as the result of which you will have to take rebirth in lower species in order to suffer the lowly Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras created by those crude vibrations. Thus you must arouse higher vibrations in your Citta. Even a man of King Bharata&#146;s calibre had to take rebirth as a deer because at the time of his death he was deeply anxious about a fawn. Thus regardless of what you are at present or what you may possibly become in the future, do not digress from the ideal of the Great in any circumstances: do not stray even a step away from the path of realization of Absolute Bliss. Ananda Marga or the path to eternal bliss is the only path for you.<!-- /block --></p>

If your love for Him is genuine, you will ever remain in an Elysian exuberance. Pain will then mean nothing to you, nor will happiness either.

<a name="6..100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->The attraction between one object and another is always chromatic, pertaining to ra&#x301;ga or colour. The word ra&#x301;ga is derived from the root ran&#x301;j which means &ldquo;dyeing&rdquo;. Anura&#x301;ga means to dye one&#146;s mind with the colour of that Infinite Entity. Nothing will result from dyeing one&#146;s clothes with saffron colour only for show. Dye yourself within. People of some particular religious creeds think that dyeing their clothes or bodies with a particular colour is a part of spiritual Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But remember that is all useless, unless you are dyed within as well. Can a person become a shu&#x301;dra only by wearing a dark dress, or a vipra by donning white garments?

No external sign of Sa&#x301;dhuta&#x301; or virtue is necessary. Became sa&#x301;dhu within. Behind the external show of virtuousness of many so-called sa&#x301;dhus exists a pharisaic state of mind. Preserve the true dignity of the word, Sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph -->That is why I say that you must bring about a revolutionary change in the flow of your judgment and thought, and see how, after overcoming your fascination with external colour, your mind becomes tinged with the His glorious colour. In Ananda Marga Sadhana, the method of withdrawing the mind from degrading tendencies, and absorbing oneself in the colour of the Great, is called Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra Yoga (the yoga of withdrawal) or Varn&#x301;a&#x301;rghyada&#x301;na (the offering of colours). All people have a particular attraction for one or another object or activity and as soon as they become attracted to an object, then their minds become coloured with the colour of that object. You can withdraw your mind from the colour of that object and dye yourself in His colour by offering Him the captivating colour of the object that has attracted you: this is the real Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra Yoga. The word Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra means &ldquo;to withdraw&rdquo; &ndash; to withdraw the mind from its object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph -->The main object of the Spring Colour Festival (Vasantotsava) is not playing with external colours; it is meant to offer Him the colours of different objects which have dyed the mind. When this practice of offering your own colours &ndash; your own attachments, becomes natural and easy, you will then merge in Him. Then you will have no need for any colour, for you will become colourless &ndash; you will go beyond the reach of any colour. Your unit-ego will become one with the Cosmic Ego. Whichever way you look you will see only Him in His ever-surging glory. There is no &ldquo;I&rdquo; nor &ldquo;you&rdquo;. By an everlasting, mutual pact the final curtain will have fallen on all clashes of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;you&rdquo;. At that stage, if you call Parama Brahma as &ldquo;I&rdquo;, you are right in calling Him so; if you call Him as &ldquo;He&rdquo;, you are equally right; and if you call Him as &ldquo;you&rdquo;, again you are correct. The extent of your attainment of Him will be proportionate to your self surrender.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph -->Remember, you have to offer your own identity &ndash; not money, rice plantains or other crude objects. The give-and-take of crude things is a business transaction. If you want to attain the bliss of Brahma, you must offer your own self. If you want to have the Great &ldquo;I&rdquo;, you must give away your own little &ldquo;I&rdquo;. You have to give the full sixteen annas, (the full rupee). Giving fifteen annas and holding back one anna will not do. You must completely surrender. To attain that Infinite One with the help of your mental concentration and strength, you have to surrender yourselves. But, remember self-surrender does not mean suicide. On the contrary, your soul will have its full expression. Your existence will not become contracted, for contraction is inert in principle. Hence in the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of self-surrender the ego is expanded, not contracted. In the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata, when Duhsha&#x301;sana was pulling the sari of Draopadii, she was tightly holding the cloth to her body with one hand beseeching lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a with the other. &ldquo;Oh! My lord, save me!&rdquo; But the Lord did not then come forward to save her from shame. When Draopadii found no means of escape, she then released her hold on the cloth and appealed to the Lord most piteously with both hands out-stretched, crying, &ldquo;O Lord, I surrender my all to you. Do what you think is best&rdquo;. And the Lord immediately rescued her. That is why I say that you will have to dedicate yourselves to His feet wholly and unreservedly. You will earn godliness in proportion to the extent that you surrender yourselves, and finally, after merging that acquired godliness of yours in His Entity, you will attain eternal bliss.<!-- /block --></p>

Where there is one Supreme Father, how can there be different castes and creeds? You are all equal; none is inferior and none is superior.

<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Why call the Supreme Being &ldquo;Rudra&rdquo;? The word Rudra in Sanskrit means &ldquo;weeping.&rdquo; But the Supreme Being not only makes all weep, He also makes them laugh! In both the circumstances, that is, of extreme pain and pleasure, there are tears in the eyes. In pain the tears come from the middle of the eyes, in pleasure they come from the corners of the eyes. A mother weeps when her daughter goes to her in-laws&#146; house. She also weeps when her daughter returns from the house of her in-laws. In one case she weeps for pain, in another she weeps for joy.<!-- /block --></p>

God, that is, Rudra, is a first-class dramatist. He keeps life floating within the two extremes of joy and pain; hence His liila&#x301;, His play, goes on.<!-- /block --></p>

Rudra is one, but has five types of administrative functions. Everyone has his duty. The Supreme Being, also having manifested Himself into relativity, has His duties.

<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The face to the extreme right is called Daks&#x301;in&#x301;eshvara.

Suppose there is a child of 3-4 months. Both the parents look at him with great affection. There is no desire to punish at all. This central face of the Rudra is His permanent nature. It is the quality of grace and beauty which is the only lasting characteristic and property of Rudra. Changes in this to the right or left are only due to administrative requirements.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->But God is one and always graceful and kind. The concept of God and devil co-existing is neither logical nor practical. There cannot be two rival powers contending for superiority. The destructive aspects of God are also due to His extreme kindness towards His creation. When a shirt is torn and you change it for a new one, it is not an act of cruelty. God creates this universe, maintains it and goes on destroying its useless parts or changing them for new ones. Rudra, being the final power in this universe, also has final responsibility to protect, maintain and control it. Power and responsibility should go hand in hand.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->When He finds a particular structure incapable of performing its part well, He discards it for another.

<a name="7..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There is going to be no final destruction of this creation. But suppose this were going to happen, even then the human beings need not be afraid, as they will remain on the lap of Rudra even in that state. So no one should feel afraid. The word &ldquo;fear&rdquo; should be removed from the dictionary of mankind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Do not think that because you are small or uneducated, God will not attend to you.

If no one else thinks of you, do not worry, Rudra will think about you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The more inward you go in your mind, the nearer you are to Rudra.

<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The sweetest part of liila&#x301; &ndash; God&#146;s play &ndash; is that He is hidden in everyone and everyone is searching for him. He wants His children to go round and He plays hide-and-seek with them. This is so that they may perform certain essential functions in the process. This gives interest and pleasure to both the Creator and the created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Thus all things are one. There is no distinction due to sex, age, or anything. Male and female, young and old are all actors playing different roles in the drama of this universe. Their forms differ, but their substance and purpose is one. God is male, female, child, youth, and old age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->God has His faces in all directions. No one can hide anything from Him. He sees both our external and internal actions. Do not hate those who are small. You have no right to hate anyone. Do not be afraid of nature either.

<a name="7..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Movement is life. Where this is towards God, the Subtle, the All in One &ndash; it is progress, otherwise it is degradation. The moment a man is born he starts his journey. The end of his journey is death. The gap between these two is life. It is a small gap. Waste no time. Every minute takes you nearer to the grave. There is no time to waste. This mission of life &ndash; to be one with God &ndash; has to be fulfilled here and now.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The mind also moves and changes, but it has no relation with this body and its grave. Bodies are given up one by one, but the mind remains the same continuing unit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->All creation is dancing round the Parama Purus&#x301;a, whether knowingly or otherwise. The steps and the direction of one&#146;s dance are according to one&#146;s nature. Those who are becoming degraded are dancing away from Him. Others are expanding and moving towards Him. This dance is the cycle of Brahma [Brahmacakra].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Every mind is dominated by one particular desire. Some pray to God, &ldquo;Please remove my stomach-ache.&rdquo; Others say, &ldquo;If my daughters get married I shall leave the world and come to You.&rdquo; God smiles at these prayers in silence, as laughing openly would embarrass His children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Every body and mind is structured according to its dominant desire. You can recognize a good man by his face. People with the same dominant desire easily become friends though they may belong to different countries of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->This dance of individuals according to their desire is ra&#x301;saliila&#x301; or the play of the waves in God&#146;s Ocean. As a boat goes up and down on a wave, so the human beings go up and down on the Cosmic waves of their desires. As long as one considers oneself separate from the Lord, this dual dance goes on. When one knows the Supreme Being, the rhythm changes and becomes soothing and graceful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->But coming to know Him is only possible through His Grace. Scholarship will not lead you to God. A devotee will always win when there is a conflict with a scholar. The scriptures are like curd which is churned by scholars &ndash; while they analyse the butter and buttermilk, the butter is eaten up by the devotees and only stale buttermilk is left for the scholars.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->How to get this kindness, this Grace from God? You have to snatch it from Him, just as a little child by weeping bitterly snatches his mother&#146;s love and attention, though the mother at first may be unwilling to leave the kitchen for the child.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->But the devotees always plead for God. They justify His actions. They say, we are doing our sa&#x301;dhana not to get pleasure but to please our Lord. He feels happy when He sees His creation making attempts to meet Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->God&#146;s Grace is forever raining over all but we keep umbrellas of our ego aloft and hence do not get drenched in it. Devotees, however, puncture this ego. They surrender themselves to Him and thus get His Grace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Since all beings have come out of Rudra, He is also their final Goal; merging in God is as natural as being born. Sa&#x301;dhakas will surely achieve this. Go on doing your part. I shall do mine and help you in establishing yourself in the Supreme. I have come on this earth for this sake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->If someone wants to inject an inferiority complex in you, do not be affected. You are the children of God, not inferior to anyone. Make attempts to meet Him and success will surely be yours.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The object of the ordinary mind, be it external or internal, is the outcome of the five fundamental factors. In order to maintain its separate existence the mind has to stick to some object. Here an object means a place. Just as a living being in order to maintain its physical existence has to inhabit some physical space, similarly the mind to maintain its subtle existence has to attach itself to some object of requisite subtlety.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Time and space are indispensable for maintaining individuality. It is for this reason that the individual mind is forever in search of one object or another. The mind turns away from those objects which cannot properly effect the materialization of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or from those objects which are used up and exhausted, and it moves towards a new object. This upheaval of the mind is never-ending. The more intense the desire for the materialization of its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, the more swiftly the mind wanders from one object to another. This is called unsteadiness of the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A question may arise, what will happen to the mind if it is completely weaned from objects? If this occurs then the mind will be dissolved &ndash; it will be obliterated. To strive for self-protection is natural, and for this reason the mind constantly runs after the retreat of its objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It has already been said that the object of the ordinary mind is always collected from the world of the five fundamental factors. What is the form of this pain&#x32D;cabhaotika world and of what property is its subjective mind made?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->From the philosophical point of view, there is an eternal infinite consciousness all around. So long as this entity of consciousness remains in its original state, there is no question of a subject or an object, nor of knowledge and the knower. However when a part of it comes under the sway of Prakrti, then the knowledge of existence or the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is present. This very &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling appears at the same time as the object of Purus&#x301;a or Cosmic Consciousness. This pervading effect of the feeling is called mind. There are three grades of the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling &ndash; Mahattattva (I am), Aham&#x301;tattva (I do or I am the master) and citta (the resultant &ldquo;I&rdquo;). This mind constitutes the initial degeneration of Purus&#x301;a and forms its object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It has been said that the manifested world is the object of this mind. Consequently Purus&#x301;a does not get any enjoyment from this pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhaotika universe at all. It is only the mind which enjoys, while Purus&#x301;a is simply a witnessing entity to the workings of the experiencing mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The objects of gratification of the two higher states of mind, namely mahattattva and aham&#x301;tattva, are sustained, formed and manifested in its stratum of Citta. If a person derives pleasure from eating palatable food, what is the subject of this gratification? It is the two strata of the mind, the mahattattva and the aham&#x301;tattva. Now what is the object of gratification? Superficially it appears that it is the food which is the object of gratification. Even when the food has been eaten, the mind will not experience pleasure until the feeling of palatability in the form of the vibratory waves of touch and taste is taken up by the corresponding sense-organs and conveyed to citta. A person working in an indifferent mood does not derive the due pleasure in doing interesting work or even taking food. The reason is that citta is partially otherwise engaged and cannot give relevant form to the vibratory waves of the object of gratification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->From this we arrive at the conclusion that mind never enjoys the original object; it enjoys only the reflected shadows of the original object. Catching the shadows of the physical world, people mistakenly believe that they have realized their goal. If the mind really desires to enjoy something, it should adopt the opposite course. The mind will have to be extricated from the quinquelemental world which has been created as the crudest manifestation of the cosmic mind-stuff, and adopt the universal Purus&#x301;a &ndash; the original constituent of the cosmic mind-stuff. The object of Purus&#x301;a is the mind, and if Purus&#x301;a becomes the subject of the mind, then, as a result of their proximity developing into union, the subjective feeling of each will disappear. This union is called &ldquo;yoga&rdquo;. In other words, it is the union of the unit &ldquo;I&rdquo;, centered in the mind, with the universal Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Sam&#x301;yogo yoga ityukto jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; Parama&#x301;tmanah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->If a person desires to merge in the Purus&#x301;a retaining his/her &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, then he/she will not be completely free from objects. In that state, the universal mind of the universal Purus&#x301;a becomes the object. We call this state, &ldquo;savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi&rdquo;. Where there is no anxiety about the &ldquo;I&rdquo; and no desire to preserve the separate identity of the &ldquo;I&rdquo;, then a state of complete freedom from objects or thoughts is achieved. This state is called &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; or &ldquo;nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a is the only knowing entity. Purus&#x301;a alone is knowledge personified or knowledge itself. Just as the sun is light itself &ndash; on a cursory view it does not seem to shine from borrowed light. The motion towards absolute knowledge is called the process of knowledge, and the motion diametrically opposed to this is towards the shadows of the fundamental factors created by the thought-waves of the Cosmic Mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It can be more lucidly explained in this manner. Omniscient Brahma alone is truth absolute and this pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhaotika universe is the result of the domination of Prakrti over Brahma. If we were able to enjoy this pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhaotika world, we would claim to enjoy the shadow or imagination of the waves of the cosmic mind. In reality, however, none of us can enjoy this pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhaotika world. We enjoy that relative shape which our sense organs convey to that mind stuff, after receiving the reflections of tanma&#x301;tras. That is, we experience only the reflections of shadows.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Can we realize the real Purus&#x301;a merely by seeing the reflection of a shadow? No, certainly not. From the shadow of a tree we cannot say whether this is a mango tree or a jackfruit tree or a lichee tree. To know the tree it is necessary to look at the tree, not its shadow. To know Brahma, it is no use remaining engrossed in the illusory reflections of Brahma. All the psychic tendencies will have to be directed towards Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Just as the egoistic mind is the subject of the living being, so Purus&#x301;a is the subject of the mind. In special circumstances we call this Purus&#x301;a the unit soul or jiiva&#x301;tman. Only by advancing in the direction of Brahma, and by attaining this original form, can human beings be liberated from this illusory world. To attain one&#146;s original self is to attain the universal Purus&#x301;a. The object-free unit soul and the object-free universal soul are one and the same entity.<!-- /block --></p>

One has to pursue one&#146;s path towards Brahma as the destination. If all the tendencies are directed towards Brahma, they will become subtler and subtler and will ultimately merge in Brahma.

<a name="8..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->One has to advance by making the maximum effort to keep the mind scrupulously away from vices. Never let your mind&#146;s purity be polluted in any way. After practising this for some time, you will observe that the same mind that sustained your vile tendencies has become your greatest friend. Your mind will serve all your purposes so that you should let it have constant inspiration from your soul. Enlighten your mind with the effulgence of the soul.

<a name="9..3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[The microcosms are in bondage, and the Macrocosmic Shiva is free from all bondages.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is the fundamental difference between jiiva and Shiva, between microcosm and Macrocosm, between the creation and the Creator? The main difference is that the microcosms are in bondage, whereas Shiva or Macrocosm is free from all bondages. The difference between one object and another is determined by observing their respective characteristics. The wood apple and the mango are two different fruits, but if the qualities of the wood apple are transferred to the mango, then the wood apple itself becomes mango. Likewise, the microcosmic created entities are different from the Macrocosm, their Creator, because of their qualitative differences. Now, if by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, if the microcosms can assimilate the special characteristics of Parama Purus&#x301;a, they cease to remain microcosms; they become Shiva Himself. At the same time it is also said that all the qualities that are present in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma or Iishvara (Qualified Consciousness) are of course also present in Parama Purus&#x301;a, with some other qualities as well. So we see that Parama Purus&#x301;a is both Iishvara and Bhagava&#x301;n, and something more than that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now let us analyse the qualities that are present in both Parama Purus&#x301;a and His created entities. The Sam&#x301;skrta word Iishvara is derived from the root verb lish + suffix varac. The root verb iish means &ldquo;to control.&rdquo; Hence the word Iishvara literally means &ldquo;controller&rdquo;. In this universe each and every object whether big or small or middle has a controller. This rule applies universally to all objects, from the tiniest molecule to the universe. However, Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Supreme Controller, and His created microcosms are the controlled entities. In the mundane world, human beings can never control their own activities because human capacity is extremely limited. For instance, even a second before one&#146;s death one cannot know of the impending death. But Iishvara, the Controlling Entity, has absolute power of control: there is none to oversee or supervise His activities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Just as the owners of a house can remove the tenant if they so desire, according to necessity they may issue a notice for the tenant to vacate the house. Of course the tenant may go to the court for help, but Iishvara, if He so desires, may snatch away this human body, whose true owner is not the human being but Iishvara Himself. Human beings can at the very most utilize their bodies; but if Iishvara takes away this body, human beings have nothing to say about it, for as they are controlled entities, they have no alternative but to surrender to the Supreme Controller Iishvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Therefore it is logical that when Iishvara controls everything Himself, in that case His created microcosms have no freedom. Of course in the kingdom of Parama Purus&#x301;a, a certain amount of freedom is granted to the microcosm. For instance, if any human being sitting in the kingdom of the Lord criticizes Parama Purus&#x301;a, He does not become angry, nor does He admonish His critic. This much freedom is granted to the microcosms. But at the same time it should be remembered that the capacity, the strength of the microcosm to criticize Parama Purus&#x301;a comes from none other than Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. The microcosms criticize Parama Purus&#x301;a with the energy allotted to them by Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now what sort of attitude should the microcosms adopt towards the Supreme Controller, Parama Purus&#x301;a?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Ya eko ja&#x301;lava&#x301;niishata Iis&#x301;an&#x301;ibhih<br>Sarva&#x301;unlloka&#x301;niishata Iis&#x301;an&#x301;ibhih<br>Ya evaeka udbhave sambhave ca<br>Ya etadviduramrta&#x301;ste bhavanti.<br>Eko hi rudro na dvitiiya&#x301;ya tasturya<br>Ima&#x301;unlloka&#x301;niishata Iis&#x301;an&#x301;ibhih<br>Pratyamjana&#x301;m&#x301;stis&#x301;t&#x301;hate sauncukopantaka&#x301;le<br>Sam&#x301;srjjavishva&#x301; bhuvana&#x301;nii gopah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The controlling power of Parama Purus&#x301;a is truly a unique force, a magic power. When an expert magician creates a living pigeon out of a clod of earth, the spectators become wonderstruck to see it. In reality that earth is not actually transformed into a pigeon, but the spectators seem to see with their eyes that the soil is being transformed into a living, flying pigeon. What is the secret behind this phenomenon? And who knows this secret, whether the clod of earth really became a pigeon at all? In fact this secret is known only to the magician and his inveterate followers and no one else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->With a similar kind of magic power, Parama Purus&#x301;a has been continuing His creation. Now if anyone desires to know the inner secrets of that magic power, what should be done? The answer is to establish a relationship of love with the magician Himself. One will have to enlist oneself in the inner circle of His followers. Then the Controller of this universe, because of His intimate relationship with that person, will disclose the secret of His controlling power. So one can know the secret from Parama Purus&#x301;a only through the closest proximity to Him, and not through any struggle with Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Hence the only path for the survival and progress of the microcosms is to establish a sweet relationship with the creator of the universe. According to Mahars&#x301;i Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da, the illustrious propounder of Vaeshes&#x301;ika philosophy, this universe is composed of innumerable atoms and molecules; these are, however, only material forces. In the absence of consciousness, they themselves cannot create anything original or do anything rational. If the responsibility of all the actions of this universe had been left to the atoms, molecules, protons, electrons, positrons, etc., then there would be clash at every moment; and in that case this vast, beautiful and harmonious universe where everything is moving according to a particular system, would not have existed at all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->According to Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da, those material forces are undoubtedly the primary causes, but they cannot control themselves; they are controlled by the Cognitive Force, the knowing faculty which is none other than Iishvara. Such a blind material force cannot create this vast, well-ordered universe. So in order to transcend the crudity of this material universe, there is no other way for human beings except the surrender to the Cognitive Principle, and the sooner the human beings thus surrender, the better it will be for the speed of their progress will be accelerated. Human beings are not simply living creatures with hands and feet: they are something far greater than that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The human body which is material, is controlled by mind, and mind is controlled by unit consciousness, and unit consciousness is controlled by Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence truly intelligent people should perform their mundane duties according to the will of Parama Purus&#x301;a. We already discussed the two different interpretations for the word Iishvara; the third interpretation is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Klesha-karma-vipa&#x301;ka&#x301;shayaerapara&#x301;mrs&#x301;t&#x301;ah<br>Purus&#x301;a vishes&#x301;a Iishvarah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The Entity which remains unaffected or unassailed by kles&#x301;a (afflictions), karma (action), vipa&#x301;ka (reactions or requitals of actions) and a&#x301;shaya (unserved sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or unrequited actions) is called Iishvara. All the living beings in this world are not equally evolved; the standard of elevation of all is not uniform. When living beings in the course of evolution go beyond the periphery of these four factors mentioned above, they are called Iishvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->What is kles&#x301;a? That which affects the natural state of mind is called kles&#x301;a, that is, the psychic state from which people seek to be liberated is called kles&#x301;a. No one wants his or her natural state of mind to be impaired. Suppose in a certain place there is something decomposed from which a foul stench is emanating. Whenever one thinks of that, one&#146;s natural mental state is disturbed; one cannot remain mentally balanced. Obviously, people want to avoid such an uncongenial atmosphere. Conversely, where there is a fragrant odour, the mind rushes there and it becomes pleasurably balanced. When people light fragrant incense before meditation, the same psychology prevails: the mind remains calm and quiet, in a natural flow in such a congenial environment. All the living beings are affected or assailed by kles&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->How many types of kles&#x301;a are there? The four main types that people experience while performing their mundane duties are: klis&#x301;ta&#x301;vrtti, aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vrtti, klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;klis&#x301;t&#x301;avrtti, and aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;klis&#x301;t&#x301;avrtti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vrtti: People sometimes knowingly or unknowingly do certain actions as a result of which they not only undergo difficulties at the time of action, but even after the action is finished, they suffer the negative consequences of their undesirable actions. Suppose in a certain place people are competing with one another to determine which one of them can consume five kilos of rasogollas [sweetmeats]. While they are eating the five kilos of rasogollas, they certainly do not feel comfortable. Although they have no real inclination to eat and find it difficult to do so, they force themselves out of competitive spirit just to win the prize. So they suffer at the time of eating, and afterwards they certainly suffer from digestive trouble. This is an example of klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vrtti. Goaded by this klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vrtti, human beings do many actions in this world. It affects all living beings except Iishvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;klis&#x301;t&#x301;avrtti: Suppose someone is doing a good action, and in the process undergoes some hardship, while at the same time his friends are deriving material benefits from their actions. Perhaps some of them have already purchased several luxurious buildings, whereas he is living in a dilapidated tenement. He undergoes hardship in the beginning, but what is the ultimate result? It is aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a &ndash; not painful. Perhaps while living an honest life, people may face some difficulties, but as they led pious lives, their death becomes glorious. So initially their action is klis&#x301;t&#x301;a or painful, but ultimately it becomes aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a or non-painful. This klis&#x301;t&#x301;aklis&#x301;t&#x301;avrtti also affects living beings, but not Iishvara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;klis&#x301;t&#x301;avrtti is that action which is not painful at the beginning but which is ultimately painful. Suppose four passengers, A, B, C and D, are going to Bombay from Nagpur. The first three are travelling without tickets, and that too in the First Class compartment. But passenger D is travelling second class, and the train is overcrowded and painfully cramped. So for passenger D the train journey is certainly painful (aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a) but for passengers A, B and C the journey is quite pleasurable (aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a) because they are travelling in the comfort of First Class without spending a farthing for tickets. Now at a certain railway junction the inspector boards the train and arrests passengers A, B and C for ticketless travel: they are dragged to the police station in humiliation, bound in chains. But as passenger D was travelling with a bonafide ticket, he exited triumphantly from the compartment. Thus although for him the journey was painful, ultimately it became non-painful (aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a). This vrtti also affects living beings, but not Parama Parus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Finally, aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vrtti is that action which is neither painful in the beginning nor painful in the end. This vrtti may be present both in living beings and in Parama Purus&#x301;a: it is part of Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s characteristic nature, and for living beings it is in their spiritual practice. In the spiritual sphere human beings and Parama Purus&#x301;a are in the same realm, and thus the more the human beings perform spiritual practice, the closer they come in contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a, because then there remains Only one common vrtti for both them and Him &ndash; aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vrtti. Hence it is mentioned in the scriptures that in Parama Purus&#x301;a there is not the slightest vestige of kles&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->When there is some expression both in the psychic and spiritual spheres, it is called kriir&#x301;a&#x301;, but Parama Purus&#x301;a does not do anything in the physical sphere, because for Him there is nothing external &ndash; everything is within Him. For the microcosms, for the unit living beings, there are both external and internal psychic projections. If someone thinks about ghosts even in broad daylight, one will definitely see those ghosts externally due to repeated internal psychic projection. On the contrary, a person who has never thought about ghosts will never see ghosts even in the dead of night. In the process of constant brooding over ghosts, a major portion of the mind becomes concentrated, and suspended in the object of that internal psychic projection. In that case the entire personality of the individual concerned is disturbed. He or she starts thinking, &ldquo;I am the ghost,&rdquo; and acts accordingly. The disease of hysteria is similar to this ghost phobia or ghost possession.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Again, there are some people who sometimes experience spirit possession: perhaps at night they feel possessed by the spirit of the goddess Kali or by Lord Shiva. These are all psychological phenomena. Hence this proves that for living beings there are both physical and psychic actions: they think of so many things, and what they think within, they cannot speak out either due to shame or fear of social criticism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Remember that the less the gap there is between one&#146;s internal thinking and one&#146;s external action, the better person one is. Obviously the inner personality and the outer personality should be one. Usually it is found that there is a gap between these aspects of a single person, and with the passage of time this gap goes on increasing, and finally one&#146;s real personality becomes completely lost. This split personality is a great impediment to human progress. Do not allow such a thing to happen. Today&#146;s civilization is not a civilization in the true sense of the term. I urge society&#146;s thinkers to analyse this situation deeply. What is the major defect in our civilization? It is this very split personality: the inner personality and the outer personality differ, and that difference is gradually increasing. Such a split personality is rarely found among the rural masses. In Parama Purus&#x301;a also such a defect cannot be found because for Him there is no difference between internal and external &ndash; for Him everything is internal, nothing is external; everything is within, nothing is without. Thus from the actional point of view there is some difference between jiiva and Shiva, between Parama Purus&#x301;a and His creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Next comes vipa&#x301;ka. The word vipa&#x301;ka is derived from vi - pac + ghain&#x32D;. Vipa&#x301;ka literally means the reaction of an original action: whenever a person does an original action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. But to state only this much is not enough: something more must be added, and that is &ldquo;provided the three factors, time, space and person remain unchanged.&rdquo; If there is the slightest change in time, space or person, the reaction will not be equal and opposite: it will be either slightly more or less. For example, suppose Mr. X borrowed the amount of Rs. 2000 from Mr. Y one evening at 7-30 P.M. If Mr. X returns the amount the same day, he will not be required to pay anything extra. But if he returns the amount the next day, then he will have to pay a certain amount as interest on the original amount, because there has been a lapse of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Similarly, if someone commits some wrong or undesirable action, then the requital will not be equal to the original action because the reaction is not expressed immediately after the original action is performed; it usually takes place after several hours or days. It may even take a few decades for its expression. For this the wrongdoer will have to undergo a reaction which is greater in degree than the original action: the doer will have to undergo a certain amount of pain as &ldquo;interest&rdquo; to the original action. This is what is meant by the term vipa&#x301;ka. It is applicable only to the microcosms and not to Parama Purus&#x301;a, for human beings perform actions both in the physical and psychic spheres, and for their undesirable actions in the psychic spheres, too, they will have to suffer the consequences. It is said in the scriptures that in Kali Yuga (the present Age of Darkness), mental sin is no sin at all, and this may be true to some extent. But it is also true that although psychic sin is not punishable, still it must be avoided.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->External sin, expressed in physical action, should not only be avoided but it is punishable as well. Take for instance, the case of someone stealing with one&#146;s own hands: for this the thief will have to undergo punishment. But suppose someone steals mentally: by this no one on earth is harmed. This mental crime may not be punishable, but it should definitely be avoided, because if people often think about committing theft, as a result of prolonged thinking one day their hands will certainly be engaged in the actual act of stealing. Now if Parama Purus&#x301;a does something mentally, that also involves vipa&#x301;ka or reaction, whether good or bad. The fact is that although Parama Purus&#x301;a does not do anything bad, He certainly does good, and these good actions also beget good reactions. It is the divine decree that good actions beget good reactions, and bad actions beget bad reactions. The former is like golden chains, and the latter like iron chains. Yet in the case of Parama Purus&#x301;a this question of reaction is not applicable, because there is nothing beyond Him &ndash; everything in this expressed universe is all created within Him, and He is dealing with His own created objects according to His own wishes. Thus no question of good or bad can arise, and that is why the matter of suffering the consequence of action also does not arise in His case. If you slap a decent person, that will be an undesirable action on your part; but if you slap your own cheek, will that also be considered an undesirable act? No, certainly not. No one will ever criticize you, or file a suit against you for this, because it is exclusively your personal matter. Likewise, whatever Parama Purus&#x301;a does, He does with His own created objects, and hence in that case the question of vipa&#x301;ka does not arise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Next comes a&#x301;shaya. The principal meaning of the word a&#x301;shaya is ashraya or &ldquo;shelter.&rdquo; Each and every entity requires a shelter; for instance, the city of Nagpur where we are seated now requires a shelter. In this case Nagpur district is the shelter and of Nagpur where we are seated Nagpur city; and the shelter of Nagpur district is Nagpurcommissionary; and the shelter of Nagpur commissionary is the state of Maharastra; and the shelter of Maharastra state is India; and the shelter of India is the continent of Asia. The continent of Asia is only a part of our little planet Earth, and this planet Earth is only a small part of our solar system. And finally Parama Purus&#x301;a is the shelter of all the solar system. So if Parama Purus&#x301;a is the shelter of all, then what is the shelter of Parama Purus&#x301;a? The answer is that Parama Purus&#x301;a does not require any shelter. Regarding Him the scriptures say, &ldquo;Nira&#x301;lambamiisham&#x301;&rdquo;; that is, the Supreme Entity does not require any shelter or refuge. But for the microcosms, a shelter is indispensable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->If the microcosms are to save themselves from afflictions or kles&#x301;a, then they will have to acquire all the qualities or characteristics of the Supreme Entity. The aklis&#x301;t&#x301;avrtti or non-painful propensities are inherent both in jiiva and Shiva, in microcosm and Macrocosm. Hence human beings will have to encourage this non-painful propensity more and more; that is, let human beings practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; more intensively and look upon all their mundane duties as part of their spiritual practice, thus superimposing cosmic ideation on all their actions. Only thus can they avoid undergoing afflictions. If people become more and more regular in the application of their guru mantra, then on one hand they will be able to perform more and more physical activities, and at the same time they will be able to avoid creating new sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (reactive momenta). Regarding vipa&#x301;ka it can also be said that human beings must treat all the objects of this universe in the proper perspective as the various expressions of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and learn how to apply madhuvidya&#x301; even while discharging their mundane duties.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Regarding a&#x301;shaya, spiritual aspirants should remember that they will have to become completely dedicated to their ideology or a&#x301;darsha. More important than this is that they will have to become dedicated to their Is&#x301;t&#x301;a; they will have to establish a relationship of exclusive devotion to Is&#x301;t&#x301;a. If there is not intense attachment to one&#146;s Is&#x301;t&#x301;a in one&#146;s heart, then one cannot do anything. Thus during sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you should think that as you are thinking of Parama Purus&#x301;a, He is also thinking of you. This is the proper devotion to one&#146;s Is&#x301;t&#x301;a. When people do something exclusively for themselves, their mental tendency is called a&#x301;shakti or attachment, and when they do something not for their personal satisfaction but for the pleasure of Parama Purus&#x301;a, their mental tendency is called bhakti or devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Parama prema svaru&#x301;pa: whatever the Lord does, He does for the welfare of His created beings and not for His own interest. He is inexplicable: no language can properly explain Him. The microcosms on the other hand, have limited intellect. They are goaded into action by trivial self-interest. Once a certain gentleman, a businessman, was asked to laugh. He said, &ldquo;I am ready to laugh provided it brings me some profit.&rdquo; Without considering the profit and loss of any action, he could not act. But such a question does not arise in the case of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Whatever He does, He does for the welfare of all creatures. He is inexplicable also: but the ways and behaviour of microcosms can be explained. Regarding any individual, we can say that he or she is such-and-such type of person: &ldquo;She is very frugal&#8230; he is good-hearted but sharp-tongued, etc.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->An old definition of verse is va&#x301;kyam&#x301; rasa&#x301;tmakam&#x301; ka&#x301;vyam. When a story is narrated in a lucid manner it is called ka&#x301;vya or poetic verse. Who is a poet? One who knows all the three phases of time &ndash; past, present and future. In the modern age, the Sam&#x301;skrta word kavi is translated as &ldquo;poet&rdquo; in English, but in old Sam&#x301;skrta the word did not necessarily mean a poet &ndash; it meant a self-realized person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->In older days the scriptures or sha&#x301;stras were divided into several categories. Sha&#x301;sana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah sha&#x301;strah parikiirttitah: that which leads to human welfare through a system of discipline is called sha&#x301;stra. That is, the books which lay down certain guidelines as to what actions should or should not be done, which actions are conducive to human progress and which lead to degradation, are called sha&#x301;stra. They are divided into four categories: ka&#x301;vya (verse), pura&#x301;n&#x301;a (mythology), itiha&#x301;sa (educative history), and itikatha&#x301; (history).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Itikatha&#x301; or history, means the recording of chronological events; that is, the maintenance of a record of events as they took place in succession; and itiha&#x301;sa means that portion of itikatha&#x301; or history which has some specific educative value &ndash; it has no English synonym. Hence all history or itikatha&#x301; is not itiha&#x301;sa. When we refer to the history of India, it means the itikatha&#x301;, not itiha&#x301;sa, of India. Now, the definition of itiha&#x301;sa is:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..36"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Dharma&#x301;rtha ka&#x301;ma moks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; niitiva&#x301;kyasamanvitam pura&#x301;vrttakatha&#x301;yuktam itiha&#x301;sah pracaks&#x301;yate.<!-- /block --></p>

Iti ha&#x301;sati ityarthe itiha&#x301;sa. Judged in this light, the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata can be called itiha&#x301;sa. What is taught in schools and colleges these days in the name of itiha&#x301;sa should not be called thus; rather it should be called itikatha&#x301;, itivrtta, pura&#x301;katha&#x301;, or pura&#x301;vrtta.<!-- /block --></p>

The Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a is such a pur&#x301;a&#x301;na because it contains much material to educate the people.

It is not possible to write something about an Entity who is indescribable. So at the end of the shloka the author begged Parama Purus&#x301;a for forgiveness:<!-- /block --></p>

I know you are omnipotent, and even so I have extolled the glories of certain places of pilgrimage, and thus I have limited Your all-pervasiveness. I have described the merit one acquires by visiting certain places of pilgrimage, by bathing in holy rivers, by performing various sacrifices, charities and rituals &ndash; this is my third offense.

Everything concerned with Parama Purus&#x301;a is infinite, whereas living beings are all finite. Then what should the microcosms do to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a? They must meditate on Him, and in this process they will one day attain that infinite love themselves. Regarding Parama Purus&#x301;a, the scriptures say:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Human beings perform actions with a limited mind, whereas Parama Purus&#x301;a performs actions with His infinite mind, and thus human beings can never compare themselves to Him. Human beings read a few books and, puffed up with vanity of knowledge, say, &ldquo;Can you show us where Parama Purus&#x301;a is?&rdquo; Now the question is, do they have the proper vision to visualise Him? If you tell a blind person to describe the parts of an elephant&#146;s body, can he do it? Before describing the elephant, one must have the vision to see it: so first the blind man&#146;s sight must be restored. Human beings see with two eyes, and both eyes are in front. Of course, if they had one eye in front and one in the back, that would also serve the purposes. But fortunately or unfortunately both eyes are in front and so they cannot see what is happening behind their backs. Whereas Parama Purus&#x301;a is seeing everything with His infinite number of eyes. He knows even what human beings do secretly or think inwardly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->He is sahasrapa&#x301;t &ndash; with a thousand feet. Human beings are limited by time, space and person. Suppose you are at Nagpur. You are thinking, &ldquo;Had this town of Nagpur been very close to Hyderabad, I could have got my work done more easily!&rdquo; But Parama Purus&#x301;a faces no such difficulty. He does not need to move from one place to another. Suppose someone has his or her Master&#146;s Degree in geography. If that degree-holder is asked, &ldquo;Can you say how many houses are there in Nagpur city? How many bricks are there in those houses?&rdquo; &ndash; I am sure he or she cannot answer those questions. I have yet to meet a pandit who can tell me how many bricks are in the town of Nagpur. Human knowledge is very limited, very imperfect. Hence it is totally pointless to pride oneself on so-called intellectual knowledge or pedantry. In fact, human beings have nothing to be proud of except one thing, and that is Parama Purus&#x301;a. What type of pride is this? Human beings can think, &ldquo;A perfect Entity like Parama Purus&#x301;a is my Father, I am His dear affectionate child.&rdquo; This sort of vanity and pride can be harboured. But besides this human beings have no other treasure of which to feel proud.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Human beings can at most remember events which took place only a couple of days ago. Often they are quite ignorant of what will happen just after one second. Mostly they say something or perform some actions on the basis of assumptions. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is omniscient; everything, past, present and future is at His fingertips. But the knowledge of living beings is very limited. If those of you who have acquired the highest university degree are asked to sit for examination right now, perhaps none of you will pass the exam, and if you are asked to answer the same questions which were given to you when you passed from the university, you will certainly not be able to answer them, for you have completely forgotten the topics which you studied in the past. In such a situation, should human beings be proud of their intellect? Yet they are often misguided by a false sense of superiority or inferiority.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Suppose there is a Master&#146;s Degree-holder in a certain village, and in that village no one else knows even A, B, C, D. If you visit his village you will find that that so-called educated person, because of his vanity and false sense of superiority, does not even talk to the illiterate villagers &ndash; he feels ashamed to speak to his old friends. In this way human beings develop meaningless ideas of big and small, high and low: they lose their universal vision.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->But for Parama Purus&#x301;a there is no difference between educated and uneducated, literate and illiterate, high and low, black and white. Human beings always discriminate between those who are socially high and low: they disdain the low and prefer the high-born. This sense of discrimination exists only among living beings. Parama Purus&#x301;a always remains with people in their joys and sorrows. A virtuous person when in trouble says to Parama Purus&#x301;a. &ldquo;Oh Lord, save me!&rdquo; Similarly, a thoroughly wicked person also says, &ldquo;Oh Lord, save me!&rdquo; Parama Purus&#x301;a listens equally to both of them. In this regard I have already said that Parama Purus&#x301;a cannot do two things. First, He cannot create another Parama Purus&#x301;a like Himself. He can create everything, but He cannot create a second Parama Purus&#x301;a. Secondly, He cannot hate anyone even if He wants to. But human beings commit the mistake of hating others easily. So in this respect human beings are ahead of Parama Purus&#x301;a, that they can hate others!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Those who are seated in Heaven are as dear to Parama Purus&#x301;a as those who are ensconced in Hell, scorched in eternal hellfire. Even for those infernal creatures Parama Purus&#x301;a has unbounded love and affection &ndash; even such people are not helpless. Their piteous wailings reach His ears, and accordingly He takes steps to help them. But this is not the case for human beings: rather even at the sight of the sorrows and sufferings of afflicted people they will say, &ldquo;Well done! as you sow, so you reap! Those people are reaping the consequences of their past misdeeds!&rdquo; In the human mind there is an ingrained sense of hatred for others. But there is no such feeling in the mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is the all-controlling Entity. No one else can dictate to Him. This is the major difference between jiiva and Shiva. In spite of such a serious difference, Parama Purus&#x301;a loves human beings and showers His Grace on them, and out of His infinite love for them, He has given them a valuable treasure &ndash; mind. The characteristic of this mind is that as it thinks so it becomes. Hence if they so desire, human beings can merge their individual minds in the Macrocosmic Mind. While taking the ideation of Parama Purus&#x301;a, human minds will one day become identified with Him, and one auspicious moment all the inherent qualities of Parama Purus&#x301;a will be infused in their unit minds. Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati: One who knows Brahma becomes Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The one who has known the Supreme Brahma has really known Him as the refuge of this universe. The One Who is the ultimate refuge of each and everything, animate and inanimate, movable and immovable, from the Supreme creation&#8230; Brahma &ndash; to the lowliest blade of grass, is the supreme goal, the final beatitude. The universe has been created within Him and is indeed radiant with His radiance. That the universe is created within Him is not all that can be said. It is the transformation of His own Self. It is evolved by Him. He is the substance as well as the cause of this universe. It is the cooperative creation of the sixteenfold distortions (ten sensory and motor organs, the mind and the five Tanma&#x301;tras or inferences) and the eight binding factors of Prakrti that are there as the cause and effect of His qualitative manifestations. The seeds and potentials of this universe are also inherent in them. It is for this vastness that He has been called Brahma, which means Great (Brahatva&#x301;d Brahma). Then again the One who makes another great, the One with whose thought and bearing the small unit establishes itself in the vastness, is also called Brahma (Brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d Brahma). When this world is within Him, then He must necessarily be greater than the world. Suppose there is a box in a room; then the room must be greater than the box. That is why there is space for the box, otherwise it could not have been accommodated. That in which this universe is implanted is naturally greater than the universe. The entire universe is pivoting around its knower, its Nucleus, in a cyclic order in the vast body of Purus&#x301;a. Revolving thus in this cycle the one who progresses towards the knowing Entity by virtue of one&#146;s spiritual force attains unity with Him, becomes one with Him. They become Brahma themselves, and that is why He has the quality of making one great.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Brahma is effulgent in white radiance. The Shruti says that Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are indivisible and inseparable. Where Prakrti (the operative principle) is active over Purus&#x301;a, Purus&#x301;a is of white radiance. In the Ga&#x301;yattri mantra the word, &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo;, is used in the sense of white radiance, and that is why this &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo; and Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (The subjectivated Transcendentality) are inseparable. The inseparability of Brahma and His Radiance is fully substantiated by the real meaning and analysis of the word &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo;. It is trilateral, the combination of three letters, viz., &ldquo;Bha&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ra&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ga&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Generally speaking, the word, &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo; is used verily in the sense of Brahmic effulgence. Now the question arises, whether Brahma and His radiance are two different entities. If we say Ra&#x301;ma has such and such qualities or Shya&#x301;ma has such and such qualities &ndash; aren&#146;t the individuals and their qualities two absolutely separate entities? Such distinctiveness is not applicable to limitless, integral, Brahma, who is without a second. Brahma and His radiance are not two separate entities, for He is autophanous &ndash; self-luminous. Citing the instance of Ra&#x301;hu&#146;s<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.11.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#11.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (Dragon&#146;s) head we have to say that He is characteristically radiant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This creation is triple-attributional. The game of the three attributes goes on in everything and everywhere in the universe, and they have not spared the human body. The region below the navel is dominated by Tamogun&#x301;a (Static principle), the region from navel to throat, by Rajogun&#x301;a (Mutative influence) and the region from throat to Trikuti (the junction of the two eyebrows, where the seat of the mind is located,) by Sattvagun&#x301;a (Sentient influence). Normally, a particular region in the body becomes more active in accordance with the Vrtti or epithymetic influence or the inter- and intra-ectoplasmic occupation of an individual. When a Sa&#x301;dhaka is established in his/her mental seat by virtue of his/her hearing, thinking and profound meditation, he or she being then established in Sattvagun&#x301;a (Sentient quality), realizes the Supreme Being in His Super-white glory, as is the wont of Sentient quality. When one goes beyond the mental sphere, one merges in the objectlessness of the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma in the Brahmarondhra (An aperture in the crown of the head) and thus reaches beyond the scope of colors. Bharga or white color also disappears from him. A desireless person, who worships this Supreme Purus&#x301;a absolves himself from the momenta of rebirths due to mind being objectless or desire-free. Such an individual goes beyond the cycle of ordinary birth and death. In other words, one&#146;s mental force goes beyond the stars (&#146;Shukra&#x301; means Venus, a planet) due to one&#146;s being established in the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;ma&#x301; yah ka&#x301;mayate manyama&#x301;nah<br>Sa ka&#x301;ma&#x301;bhirjja&#x301;yate tatra tatra<br>Parya&#x301;ptaka&#x301;masya krta&#x301;tmanastu<br>ihaeva sarve praviliiyanti ka&#x301;ma&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->According to human longings and desires or according to human propensive pursuit, their minds take form i.e., they will gradually acquire the like Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or reactive momenta. They first see within themselves what they aspire for and then let their minds flow towards it. Thereafter the external organs i.e., hands and feet, etc., set about achieving it. And so it is generally seen that the desires that they had been giving indulgence to throughout their lives, come hurtling over to them in a condensed form at the last hour, i.e., their mind-stuff takes the like mental form for the last time in order to shape itself into a fitting medium of the like Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Even during the life-time as well it is seen that the mind-stuff of a drunkard, which imbibes within it an indomitable desire or Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra for wine, turns into a vantage ground for undergoing the next Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or momenta of pleasure and pain. That is to say, such a person gets scent of the wine shop by the sheer propulsion of his acquired mental propensity, if he happens to go to a new and unfamiliar place. A man who has cultivated dog-like or swine-like desires all his life, dies with the same dog-like or swine-like frame of mind. Thereafter with the help of Prakrti&#146;s Mutative force he acquires the form of a dog or swine in order to undergo the dog-like or swine-like Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. The great ascetic, King Bharata, died thinking of a fawn, and that was why it is written in the Pura&#x301;n&#x301;as (Indian mythologies) that he had to take the body of a deer at his next birth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->But he who is fully satiated, i.e., he whose longings and desires have consumed themselves, obliviates even the possibility of any such thought-wave later because of the absence of any Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra. Such all-satiated persons are indeed self-purified. How can final satiety possibly come unless and until that Whole &ndash; that Supreme Spirit &ndash; is achieved? Hence he who has attained full satiety has indeed reduced all his Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras to nothingness right here in this world and so he has gone beyond the cycle of life and death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->From the inanimate to the animate goes the process of evolution. Take a piece of stone for instance. It has neither the power of action nor the sensation of mind. What is the reason? It is because hitherto there has been no manifestation of mind in the stone at all. Thought-wave or sensation can take place or an action can take a form only if there is a mind. Take, for instance, trees and plants which are more animate than stones. There are activities in them. They grow, draw the vital juice from the earth, maintain their species by creating seeds in their own bodies and enjoy and suffer pleasure and pain, when taken care of or smitten. We see in them the manifestation of consciousness or animation, for the mind has awakened in them. Thus progressing on the path of psychogenesis or mental development we see in humans the greatest manifestation. Just as during the Cosmic thought-process the evolution takes place from the subtle to the crude, similarly the unit retroverts step by step from the crude to the subtle, towards the same Absolute Consciousness from where it had come. It is just like the waves of the sea rippling back from the shore to the ocean from where they had originally come. Now, just how much should a person strive on his return journey? He has got to be alert, so that he may easily end the journey in his characteristic Self. Then alone shall we call him self-purified. Then alone shall he become saturated with Brahma, within and without.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->To become self-purified one has got to make some effort &ndash; this effort is what is known as Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The greatest Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is that which comprises three aspects viz., devotion, action and cognition. Medium Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is that which comprises two aspects i.e., devotion and action, and the inferior Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is that which consists of only tall talk (cognition or knowledge cannot exist singly without action and devotion &ndash; whatever may exist will be merely the debris of knowledge). The ability of a Sa&#x301;dhaka cannot be based on his common or worldly knowledge alone. It can only stand on the firm base of his knowledge, devotion and action (Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, Bhakti and Karma). By firmness I mean unflinching intensity of zeal and earnestness. By just saying that Rasagolla&#x301; is sweet, one cannot get the taste of a Rasagolla&#x301; (a spongy and juicy sweetmeat). One has got to make some efforts to obtain it and eat it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->By tall talks alone one cannot achieve Brahma. An almanac forecasts that there will be so much rain this year. But mere knowledge of such a forecast will not save the crops of a farmer. No amount of squeezing the almanac will produce even a drop of water. One has got to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to habituate one&#146;s mind to Brhamaward projection in order to attain Him.<!-- /block --></p>

Just as one seeing in water the reflection of fruit dangling overhead from the branch of a tree cannot taste the fruit, similarly an erudite scholar, versed in the six philosophies, will remain far away from Brahma if one refrains from Brahma-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. No matter how vastly learned you may become in worldly knowledge, without Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you can know nothing about Brahma, for along with your knowledge of these lores, a vanity of knowledge will also grow in you. With this result, you will go on enhancing the volume of your burden unnecessarily by habitually giving importance to your small ego. This burden becomes the cause of your sufferings and enjoyments, not of your salvation. A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Sham&#x301;kar said:<!-- /block --></p>

These people are totally wrong. Only running after great men will be of no avail. A person has got to establish himself in the path of realization of Brahma by doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; himself. God does not bestow His mercy upon anybody after seeing how great a speaker he is or how many books he has read. Only one who has devotion can exact His mercy.

Take a very intelligent boy for instance. If his teacher does not teach him how to read and write, he will not be able to become a great scholar in spite of having the potential for becoming one. Similarly, all persons have the ability or potentiality of achieving spiritual development or of establishing themselves in the Brahmic stance, but for want of a worthy guide it cannot take practical shape. That is why a spiritual Preceptor or Sadguru is necessary &ndash; his grace is indispensable. His grace is but God&#146;s grace, for God is the ocean of grace.<!-- /block --></p>

The word, Sannya&#x301;sa, means to dedicate oneself for the attainment of God. When Brahma is everything, whatever you are, you must behave properly with everything around you. Hence to be callous about family and society is completely contrary to Brahma Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (Divine Contemplation). One cannot know Brahma through showy, superficial knowledge. You can only attain Brahma, when your knowledge has become strong and powerful through austere devotion to Truth. Only the soul of the one whose knowledge is identified with austerity, enters the abode of Brahma. Ultimately the united qualities of sedateness, mental and spiritual force, firmness, devotion to Truth, knowledge, the proper use of mundane things etc. will certainly enable a Sa&#x301;dhaka to attain unity with Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

So long as a Sa&#x301;dhaka does not attain Brahma, there exists in him a feeling of incompleteness. Suppose you want a thousand rupees. If you are given a thousand rupees, will you be contented? No, you will then ask for more. Such is the characteristic of human mind. Man has a limitless thirst. He keeps on harping ceaselessly, &ldquo;I am hungry.&rdquo; The hunger for a thousand will change into hunger for a lakh, and hunger for a lakh will make room for hunger for a crore. Thus the amount of hunger goes on increasing until a limitless amount of money is attained. This limitlessness is inherent in Brahma, and so your hunger can be satiated in Brahma alone. Hence when a &ldquo;Rs&#x301;i&rdquo; attains complete self-control (krta&#x301;tman), he goes beyond the sphere of attachment and detachment, and attains full realization of his characteristic Self. He becomes imperturbably tranquil, i.e. he reaches the stage which lies beyond the momentum of rebirth or regeneration. Attachment and repulsion exist so long as the proclivities of fascination and contempt exist. For instance, a puritanical sa&#x301;dhaka will consider wine as an object of disdain and will regard touching it as an act of impiety. A wine addict, however, regarding it as an object of greed, will run after it with total disregard for all social conventions and norms. But he who has become really desireless as the result of self-realization, will keep himself above these two. He will take wine as medicine under medical advice, otherwise he will carefully keep it away from the sight of people. He will have neither attachment nor aversion for the wine.<!-- /block --></p>

Does any independent tree actually exist outside you. Similarly Brahma is observing, hearing and doing everything by virtue of His thought-projection. He is an eternal, perpetual Entity beyond the purview of past, present and future. Being without beginning and end, He is called Vibhu or Eternal.

<a name="11..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is with Uma&#x301;, Uma&#x301; means Prakrti His operative principle. Brahma is the combined name of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. When the influence of Prakrti expresses itself upon the Purus&#x301;a, the cosmic thought process goes into action and by virtue of this activation by Prakrti, the sound of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra can emanate. But when Prakrti is inactive, i.e., when Purus&#x301;a is predominant, in that case the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra&#x301; sound also stops. By a slight transposition of A. U. Ma the three constituent letters of the ideogram ([DEVANAGARI CHARACTER] or On&#x32D;m&#x301;), i.e., placing, &ldquo;A&rdquo; at the end, we get the word UMA&#x301;. That is why Umapati (Pati means husband) means Purus&#x301;a. Brahma, in conjucation with Prakrti, is the cause of creation. In a particular content He may also be called Iisvara, means Controller Brahma is the controller of the organs and their gods directly and indirectly. His cognitive eyes are not two but three, i.e., He is the seer of all the three &ndash; past, present and future. He is Niilakan&#x301;t&#x301;ha or blue-throated, i.e., the vast bluish sky is in the region of His throat. His initial extroversion or expansion from the subtle to the crude is the sky. The sky is of blue color and is capable of imbibing and carrying the sound. Hence Niilakan&#x301;t&#x301;ha is a very suitable epithet for Brahma. His throat is not limited and demarcated like that of a unit. The entire creation is within Him. His depth is unfathomable and hence He is calm and tranquil. Reaching the original cause of all elements by virtue of their meditation and ideation the sages eventually attained the very Brahma Himself. His place is above all extroversive forces. He is all-knowing, all-witnessing and self-effulgent.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="11.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.11.fn1">1</a></b>) Ra&#x301;hu being the head itself. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="11.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.11.fn2">2</a></b>)  Of the countless number of veins or tubular organs of the human body, thirty-three are most important. The controlling entities of these thirty-three veins or tubes are called thirty-three gods, vid, eleven Rudras, eight Vasus, twelve Adityas, Indra and Praja&#x301;pati. The Chief manifestation of the Cosmic Force is called Indra, which controls the human body entirely.<br> <br> (a) The eleven rudras: Ten organs (sensory and motor) and the mind. &ldquo;Rudra&rdquo; means that which makes one cry. At the time of death when all the organs merge into their corresponding counter-gods, the mind becomes inactive and the human body becomes still and immobile. Due to this near and dear ones of the dead person cry piteously. These eleven gods make the human cry, and hence they are called Rudras. <br> (b) The eight vasus: Vasu means the habitat of the units; that is to say, those that are receptacles, shelters, or objects of the organs are called Vasu. The sun, the moon, the stars, the sky, the ether, the air, the fire and the earth are the eight Vasus. <br> (c) The twelve A&#x301;dityas: A&#x301;ditya means Collector. Here it means that all those which takes or take away the consequences of deeds and life. Every moment the duration of life is being reduced, and the unit is being compelled to undergo the process of metamorphosis in order to enjoy or endure the consequences of his deeds. All these are taking place through the passage of time. Hence time is A&#x301;ditya, for it takes away the life and the consequential moments of deeds. The twelve months are the twelve A&#x301;dityas. <br> (d) Indra: Indra means lightning, thunder or actional force. <br> (e) Praja&#x301;pati: Praja&#x301;pati means Yajin&#x32D;a (sacrifice) or action.<br> <br> Some are of the opinion that the veins of the human body are uncountable. Others say that they are a few crores, as if they had counted them all. Many people say that the number of veins totals thirty three crores and so the gods are also of the same number. Truly speaking it is due to ignorance and blind faith that the controlling nerves and veins of the human body have been converted into thirty-three crores of gods, having so many different names and forms. Sham&#x301;kara said in reference to gods &ndash;<br> <br> &ldquo;Sarvadyotana&#x301;tmaka akhan&#x301;dacidaekarasah.&rdquo;<br> <br> Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;avalkya said &ndash;<br> <br> Dyotate kriidate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divi<br> Tasma&#x301;ddeva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<br> <br> The gods are of two kinds &ndash; (1) Daehik Devata&#x301; (the physical gods). The manifestation of soul is accomplished through the organs, and so the organs are called Daehik Devata&#x301; and (2) Brahmik Devata&#x301; (Cosmic gods through whom the whole universe is manifested and controlled). Both are thirty-three in number. Each of the Cosmic gods is the counter-god of the respective physical gods. These physical gods get merged into the counter-gods, which again merge in Brahma, and that is why the liberated Sa&#x301;dhaka becomes Brahma Himself.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="11.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.11.fn3">3</a></b>)  Author&#146;s footnote on the other two meanings of kula omitted here. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="11.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.11.fn4">4</a></b>)  It is the Supreme Brahma Who is the creator of the universe and to create is also an act. Where there is action, there is sound. The pran&#x301;ava or On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is indeed the sound of the creative thought-process of the Supreme Spirit and he who has merged himself in Brahma due to the absence of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra or reactive momentum, has attained a position even above Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Maheshvara. <br> Of the three letters (A, U, Ma) of the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra &ldquo;A&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x0985;</span>) is the seed of creations, &ldquo;U&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x0989;</span>) is the seed of stability or preservation and &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AE;</span>) is the seed of destruction. &ldquo;A&rdquo; being the creative alphabet, Brahma is called Brahma&#x301; (Brahma + a) in reference to creation. Suppose a man&#146;s name is Ra&#x301;mbabu. His son will call him &ldquo;father&rdquo; and his pupil will call him &ldquo;sir&rdquo;; these are but the titles of Ra&#x301;mbabu applied to his specific occupational conditions, Actually Ra&#x301;mbabu is one, Sagun&#x301;a&#x301; Brahma imbibes three chief acts, viz., creation, preservation and destruction. These acts of creation, preservation and destruction are taking place in the psychic sphere of Brahma. With the termination of its thought process all the manifestations of these three kinds of acts will also cease. For instance, when we think of Bhagalpur, a clear picture of Bhagalpur gets projected on our mental plate and when we give up the thought of Bhagalpur, the picture of Bhagalpur gets lost in that very mental plate. If afterwards we cease to think at all, the mind also loses its existence. So Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Mahesh are the nomenclatures of the different psychic acts of Brahma Himself. When a Sa&#x301;dhaka, having gone beyond the mental stratum, gets ensconced in the immutable, pure Brahmic region, he certainly enjoys greater importance or superiority over these three gods. That state is the characteristic state of the unit &ndash; the supreme state of Shiva or Cosmic Transcendentality. Asked to reveal his identity, Lord Sam&#x301;kara&#x301;car&#x301;ya said &ndash;<br> <br> Manobuddhyaham&#x301;ka&#x301;ro cittani na&#x301;ham<br> Na ca shrotrajihave na ca ghra&#x301;n&#x301;a netre<br> Na&#x301;vyoma bhu&#x301;mirna tejo na va&#x301;yuh<br> Cida&#x301;nandaru&#x301;po&#146;shivo&#146;ham&#x301; shivo ham.<br> <br> That is,<br> <br> Not mind nor I-feeling nor ego am I<br> Nor ear nor tongue nor nose nor eye<br> Nor air nor earth nor sun nor sky<br> The Soul Eternal am I, am I.</p>

<a name="12..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject is &ldquo;Yajin&#x32D;a and the Fruit of Yajin&#x32D;a&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;Yajin&#x32D;a&rdquo; is formed by the root &ldquo;Yaj&rdquo; and the suffix &ldquo;na&rdquo;. It means actions. Whatever a person does, we can call it a yajin&#x32D;a. What is the origin of actions? Where is the unmanifested potentiality of action? The doer of an act is the mind. Before doing an act a person thinks of it and the thought gets manifested as corresponding vibrations or sensations in his mind. Those mental vibrations are then transformed into the actions in the external world. That is, when after thinking about doing an act, the hands and feet begin to move, then the action being done is called an act or kriya&#x301;. Vibration exists in the mind or Sublime level and an act exists both in the crude and sublime levels, because all vibrations are not necessarily transformed into acts. Whenever there is an act, then the existence of a precedent thought is a certainty. That is why Karma or Yajin&#x32D;a is called psycho-physical.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Human beings cannot exist even for a moment without doing an act. Salvation means the eternal emancipation from this very Karma or Yajin&#x32D;a. Ordinarily Yajin&#x32D;a is of four kinds: Bhu&#x301;ta Yajin&#x32D;a, Nr Yajin&#x32D;a, Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a and Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a. Of these four Yajin&#x32D;as, the first three, namely Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr, and Pitr Yajin&#x32D;as, are psycho-physical, that is, both mental and physical, but Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a is one hundred percent internal. The origin of Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr and Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a is in mental vibrations and they take shape in the physical world. The actual origin of Karma, however, is in the arena of the mind. Suppose I donated ten rupees to a particular person. This is called Nr Yajin&#x32D;a. In the first instance I gave the donation mentally, and when this mental donation took the shape of a physical act, then I practically made the donation. As soon as the thought of giving the donation occurs in the mind, the physical act of donating flashes before the mind, that is, the act actually originated in the mental domain. Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a, on the other hand, originates in the domain of the soul and terminates in the soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->(1) Bhu&#x301;ta-Yajin&#x32D;a: Bhu&#x301;ta Yajin&#x32D;a means services rendered to any created entity of the manifested world. For example, watering trees, serving cattle, undertaking scientific explorations and doing anything for the sake of welfare. In Sam&#x301;skrta, Bhu&#x301;ta means that which has been created. It does not mean ghost or spirit. The Sam&#x301;skrta synonym of the English words ghost and spirit is &ldquo;Preta&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->(2) Nr Yajin&#x32D;a: Nr Yajin&#x32D;a is action for human welfare. In fact Nr Yajin&#x32D;a is a part of Bhu&#x301;ta Yajin&#x32D;a because human beings are also created beings, I will explain Nr Yajin&#x32D;a later on.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->(3) Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a: Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a means remembering the ancestors and the sages. As long as a person possesses the physical body, he remains indebted to his ancestors. Those who are capable of working for their own emancipation, as well as of the society by virtue of the knowledge acquired through the austerities practised by the sages, are indebted to the sages. Sages are those who are helping and who have helped human society in numerous ways, such as the invention of new subjects. You enjoy the fruits of the inventor of railway engines. Is it not a fact that present intellectual currents originated from the fountain of their wisdom? Many people say that science is detrimental to civilization and an impediment to civilization, that the old world was indeed good. They forget that science also existed in the old world and, although it was very undeveloped, the people had adopted it according to their standard of wisdom and knowledge. We are progressing on the road constructed by them. We proceed and extend these roads by cutting down the jungles and the hills. Their bullock carts have given us the incentive for our railways and cars. We have converted the yachts constructed by them into submarines. That is why I say that there is no fault in the development of science. Time is also not to blame. The fault rests with us. Science does not tell us to use nuclear energy in destructive ways. To do so is to use science to establish our animality. Those who have invented destructive weapons with the help of science are not sages, because their Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; does not contribute to the welfare of humanity. On the other hand, those sages who have looked to the well-being of humanity certainly deserve our revered memory. To pay homage to them is Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->(4) Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a: I have already said that Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a is one hundred percent internal. The impetus for Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a comes from the soul and this impetus becomes operative in the mental province. The mind performs the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and the Karma also terminates in the province of the soul. That is, the ultimate goal of mental sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; lies in the province of the soul. Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a is a liberating sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and the remaining three, Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr and Pitr yajin&#x32D;a are both liberating and subjugating (Nivrtti Pravrtti).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Nr Yajin&#x32D;a is of four kinds: (a) Shu&#x301;drocita, (b) Vaeshyocita, (c) Ks&#x301;atriyocita and (d) Viprocita. To serve the world by the physical body, to make others happy by one&#146;s own sacrifice, or to alleviate the afflictions of others, for example by example by nursing the patients, comes within the scope of Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The services rendered by supplying food, money, etc. are termed Vaeshyocita seva&#x301;. Protecting others, even by risking one&#146;s life is Ks&#x301;atriyocita Seva&#x301;. Viprocita Seva&#x301; is to give expression of Adhya&#x301;tma yajin&#x32D;a by imparting the spiritual knowledge you have gained. Instil in others the earnest desire to follow the path of virtue &ndash; only then will you justify your existence as a social creature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301; is the backbone of society. Those who undervalue Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301; cannot render Vaeshyocita seva&#x301;. In the same way, one has to become a Shu&#x301;dra, in order to be eligible for rendering Vaeshyocita-seva&#x301;. Exactly in the same way, one has to become a Shu&#x301;dra, a Vaeshya and a Ks&#x301;atriya in order to be eligible to render Viprocita Seva&#x301;. Hence only those who possess these four qualities are Vipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Although the excellence of all the different services is equal, Viprocita seva&#x301; is particularly glorious because it is directly related to Adhya&#x301;tma yajin&#x32D;a. But it must be remembered that the value of a particular service depends on time, place and circumstances. Suppose a wayfarer is in distress in a lonely place and is about to die. In this situation viprocita sermons are entirely useless. While Shu&#x301;drocita seva&#x301;, i.e. nursing will be of great value. What will you do for a man who is dying of starvation? Will you nurse or preach sermons? Food must be arranged for him. In this circumstance Vaeshyocita seva&#x301; is of great value. In another situation, some men are attacking a helpless person. In this case neither sermons nor nursing is needed, nor is food to be offered; there you will have to render Ks&#x301;atriyocita service. In this situation, Ks&#x301;atriyocita Seva&#x301; is of greater value and other services are entirely meaningless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Shu&#x301;drocita service is meaningless to a drunkard, so is Vaeshyocita, because giving money to him gives impetus to the addiction to drinking and does not encourage him or her to give it up, If you give the drunkard a beating then he or she will leave the place and go elsewhere to get a drink. Therefore, a drunkard has to be treated firmly with Ks&#x301;atriyocita seva&#x301; and with Viprocita sermons. They must be emancipated from this bad habit by good counsel. The problem can not be solved just by simply inflicting punishment or enacting laws to close the liquor shop. In such circumstances the drunkard will seek to satisfy his or her bad habit in secrecy and consequently the whole society is affected. Thus we see that all the four types of services are important in particular circumstances. Still the effect of Viprocita seva&#x301; is stable whereas the effects of other types of service is not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->At the time of rendering service, you should feel that object of service is Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a or God and that you are a spiritual aspirant. With such feelings there is no room for conceit. Conceit causes the fall of human beings. To get rid of conceit we will have to regard the object of our service as Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->When you render service to anyone you must mentally address them with sincere devotion. &ldquo;O Lord, O Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a! Oblige me by accepting my services. You are merciful to me, and for this reason you have appeared before me as a living being to offer this very precious opportunity of rendering service to You.&rdquo; By maintaining such sentiments, conceit will not arise in you, nor will you be bound by the reactions of your actions. The principal cause for bondage to the fruits of actions is conceit or the yearning for fame. Suppose a certain man donates one thousand rupees to a particular institution. The next day he looks anxiously for his name in the newspaper. If his name does not appear in the paper, then with an air of conceit he brags amongst his kith and kin. &ldquo;I have donated a thousand rupees, but I do not desire recognition and therefore I have not published my name in the paper.&rdquo; The desire for fame exists in a concealed form in that man&#146;s mind. Clearly, he did not make the donation with the spirit of service. However, when you perform acts with the ideation that the person served is Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, there is no possibility of arrogance or the desire for fame growing in your mind. Then you will realize that through the grace of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a you have been given the opportunity of serving Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Our hands and feet are not ours, they are His, and by serving Himself with those hands and feet, He sports with Himself. Such an action is an action without attachment. Only in this way can one attain salvation from the bondage of Karma. You must feel that the person served is Brahma. The person served is a finite manifestation of Him. Never, even by mistake, take the object as a human being. A devotee in ecstasy says:<!-- /block --></p>

Though your mother tongue is Sam&#x301;skrta you speak in Persian. In that situation you have consciously thought, &ldquo;I am Sha&#x301;hjaha&#x301;n&rdquo;, and having influenced the mind accordingly, you behave in that manner. Here your own personality is masked by that of Sha&#x301;hjaha&#x301;n. This is known as direct imposition of ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><b>Indirect imposition</b>: Here you do not knowingly assume any idea, but are influenced and hypnotized by another person. You act unconsciously. Your personal exclusiveness is drowned in the currents of another&#146;s ideas.

<a name="12..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><b>Spontaneous idea</b>: In this case, the ideas spring from within and only the true ideas get expressed. This occurs while you are in Iishvara Pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na. Initially the feeling of &ldquo;I am&rdquo; certainly exists in the aspirant&#146;s mind. He or she feels that &ldquo;I am practicing Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for a realization of Brahma.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In the method of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; prescribed of Ananda Marga, this feeling of &ldquo;I am&rdquo; having been developed and expressed spontaneously is then transformed into feelings of Brahma. This spontaneous idea is not easily understood by those who do not practice Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. For this very reason, more often than not, non-aspirants are overtaken with false apprehensions since they do not know the transcendental currents of happiness in which the Sa&#x301;dhaka is drifting. You don&#146;t have to take the idea &ldquo;I am Hanuman&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I am Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo;. Adhya&#x301;tma yajin&#x32D;a is performed entirely in the mental arena and there is no necessity of any experiment or imposition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->But in Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr or Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a, experiment or imposition is necessary.

It should be remembered that the reaction of an action is intimately connected with the action itself and when you perform an act you have got to bear its brunt.<!-- /block --></p>

It is not within your right to get rid of it or to escape its fruits and consequences. You have a right only to the action. Just by wishing you may or may not do an act.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->What we call Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra is the reaction of Karma in potential forms, that is, it is the seed of the reaction to an action. The completion of a Yajin&#x32D;a lies in its offerings. Karma and Yajin&#x32D;a are the same and the accomplishment of the four varieties of Karma lies in offering one&#146;s dearest thing, that is, in offering one&#146;s own self. Ra&#x301;ma Yajin&#x32D;a signifies offering or surrendering unto Ra&#x301;ma. Vis&#x301;nu Yajin&#x32D;a has a similar significance. The word Vishnu means all-pervasive. For this reason the accomplishment of Vis&#x301;nu Yajin&#x32D;a lies in merging oneself into the Supreme Entity. Those who offer clarified butter in Yajin&#x32D;a are misguided. They think that by offering ghee in the fire, it will rain. Still today people are following such blind superstition. Science tells us that when ghee is offered in the fire, the ghee is burnt and the unburnt carbon particles evaporate in the form of smoke. Everyone knows that ghee is basically the chemical composition of hydrogen and carbon and that the water vapor generated by burning ghee is negligible. Therefore, what will be the magnitude of the cloud formed by burning even one thousand tons of ghee? It is an utter misuse of ghee. The proper use of ghee is to feed it to the weak so that they may have a good health. If you want rain you should perform Bhu&#x301;ta Yajin&#x32D;a. Scientific research comes within the purview of Bhu&#x301;ta Yajin&#x32D;a. Manufacture artificial clouds and make use of them wherever rainfall is needed.<!-- /block --></p>

For this you need not go begging from door to door. Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a is an internal affair and money has no use. Only in the case of Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr and Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a are crude physical things needed and not in the case of Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a.

By Lord&#146;s direction, you are serving Him, being a part and parcel of his manifestation. By maintaining such sentiments arrogance cannot arise. You know that the results of your actions will conformity to your intentions. If you submit the subjective feeling of your actions to the Lord, the reactions also appertain to the Lord. However, while taking this sentiment, one has to see that it is born out of love and not out of fear. Fear does not generate love. There is no service where love is absent and your Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr and Pitr Yajin&#x32D;a become meaningless. The sentiment must be surcharged with Prema or Love. What is Prema?<!-- /block --></p>

While rendering services you should think that you are serving for his or her comfort and well-being. This will make your service selfless and your love untarnished. Services rendered with a selfless motive are not without blemishes. You feed the hens for your benefit.

Such a person is not happy and this type of ritualism cannot be called real Karma. To serve others at one&#146;s sacrifice is called penance. In the absence of love any service or penance is for show and is therefore fruitless. All ritualistic devotion, sham penance, counting beads etc. are meant only for public show and true love and the Supreme goal are lost from sight. Brahma cannot be attained through actions, since the sweetness of joy is lacking in such ritualism. On the other hand the divine bliss is easily attainable to those who base their Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; on love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->One has to see appreciate how the consequences of actions are annihilated through service. Where there is the arrogance of &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, then the consequences exist with the actions. Where the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the doer then the same &ldquo;I&rdquo; is the receiver of the consequences. In detached actions the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is not the doer and is not therefore liable to reap the consequences. In an unattached action there is no bondage of the consequences because whatever the person does is consigned to Brahma, and therefore, the consequences of the actions are also consigned to Brahma. In other words, both the actions and consequences appertain to Parama&#x301;tman. You should regard yourself as an instrument of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a and go on doing your work in a detached manner. Where a person is suffering from pain, you may ask whether they are only reaping the consequences of their actions and whether in these circumstances it is proper for you to serve them. The answer is very simple. I should not even think that he or she is reaping the consequences of actions. My purpose is to decide the intention with which I will act. I will have to think that in the pursuit of a particular design, Parama&#x301;tman is suffering distress and in this way, He is giving me an opportunity to render service. Out of His grace He is obliging me by accepting my services. Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a&#146;s designs are inscrutable, so you must look upon the distressed with divine sentiments.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Just as vibrations take the shape of actions, so too counter vibrations bear exact opposite consequences of these actions. The nature of consequences is shaped by the tune of the nature of the intentions to act or vibrations. Then in the physical world the consequences of such an action are treated according to the status of the doer, irrespective of the magnitude of the action and is in consonance with his or her mental endurance. If there be no pain from a cut in the hand, that is, if the mind does not feel the consequence, the action then is not punitive. For those free from a debased mind and accomplished in universality the question of unitary suffering of the consequences of actions does not arise, since such individual do not work with unit feelings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Where action yoga, penance or knowledge is affected with feelings of distinctions, arrogance is bound to come into play and individual distinctions are created.

<a name="12..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Occasionally, an affectatious vanity is seen in the aspirant which is not meant for his or her personal end, but rather for the sake of Parama&#x301;tman. This is called Sa&#x301;ttvika vanity. The vanity associated with selfless service is not derived from the mean unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling, but from the feeling of Universal &ldquo;I&rdquo;.

<a name="12..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->You should act precisely with this sentiment. The more a person works with feelings of detachment, the greater is his or her Godward speed and the more the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling is annihilated. The Unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling will be completely annihilated by the time you are completely established in the divine feeling. Detached actions are the fight against the unit self and for the attainment of the Universal &ldquo;I&rdquo;. The Unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; will go on abating in proportion to the decline of arrogance. By the same proportion, the mind&#146;s sphere will get enlightened by refulgence of the Universal Self. That is why the followers of Ananda Marga must tread the path of action without detachment. Along with Adhya&#x301;tma Yajin&#x32D;a, Bhu&#x301;ta, Nr, and Pitr yajin&#x32D;a also have to be performed and then the true sacrifice of the self in the fire of Brahma is accomplished.<!-- /block --></p>

Genuine spiritual practice is that which does away with the mirror of Buddhitattva and enables Jiiva&#x301;tman, in the shape of the reflection to get absorbed in Parama&#x301;tman &ndash; the original entity. For this the inevitable requisite is detached action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Yajin&#x32D;a is performed to achieve emancipation from the consequences of action and to annihilate the Unit &ldquo;I&rdquo;. The fourfold services enumerated under Nr yajin&#x32D;a can be easily be performed by anyone. Every human being gets more or less opportunity for rendering services. If a poor man thinks that he cannot render Vaeshyocita type of service because he is devoid of money he is wrong. The charity of a few paise of the poor has the same value as a thousand rupees from a millionaire. Indeed the charity of these few paise is greater. Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a attached greater importance to a handfuls of grains from Vidura than to the sumptuous royal dishes of Duryodhana. Even so, everyone should render service to the world in accordance with their capacity and work for the welfare of the living beings to the best of their ability. Perform viprocita type of service by projecting your convictions to others as best as you can. Let every person perform the four kinds of service as much as possible. Adhya&#x301;tma yajin&#x32D;a is an internal yajin&#x32D;a and ultimately it terminates in Parama&#x301;tman, the original self. Therefore, your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; should be with a detached sentiment. All types of Yajin&#x32D;a begin and proceed in an externalized manner, but ultimately they will reverse their course towards the inner self and will gratify your innermost entity on the jewelled throne attained by your birthright.

It is your dharma to move from narrowness to vastness, from greatness to divinity. To allow yourself to fall into an abyss is against the characteristic of your existence. You long for eternal bliss and endeavour for eternal life. You are associated with that unending vitality in the blood circulation of your arteries and veins and in the rhythmic throbbing of your heart. You have been listening day and night the voice of eternal youth. Can you ever imagine remaining inert matter in an inactive state where there is no yajin&#x32D;a? Even in the state of supreme realization you will be infused with boundless knowledge. O human beings! be established in the radiance of divinity and the splendour of valour and chivalry, because yours is the path of revolution. Your path is not the path of extra caution and scheduled movement. You are the traveller of a rugged path. You are travellers of an impregnable path. You have to march ahead proudly with the flag of Marga upright. You have no time to stagger or to look behind.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Scriptures say that the ordinary human beings of the world use their power of discrimination before they decide upon what to receive and what not to receive when offered. They accept only that which they like and reject that which they do not like. Elevated beings &ndash; uttama purus&#x301;a &ndash; on the other hand, do not accept anything from anyone. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is entirely different from these two groups. He makes no discrimination whatever and accepts all that is offered to Him by any of His children.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->People normally offer sentient things to different deities &ndash; white flowers are generally offered to them.

One may offer one&#146;s reverence &ndash; shraddha&#x301; &ndash; or one&#146;s abuse &ndash; hela. The Lord&#146;s palms are ever-joined to receive it &ndash; Shraddhaya&#x301; helaya va&#x301; [&ldquo;With reverence or with indifference&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Once Lord Buddha was camping in a mango orchard at Baishali. A large number of people used always to [come and] accept the path shown by the Lord. But a particular individual and his group were very much opposed to Lord Buddha. It so happened that the group, without the individual himself, came to the mango orchard where Lord Buddha was camping, and were influenced by the Lord and accepted Buddhism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This news greatly agitated this man, and in anger he came to the orchard and started abusing Lord Buddha in all sorts of ways. Lord Buddha maintained his usual equipoise towards all this. One feels happy and encouraged in abusing someone only if he or she finds that person affected by the acts of abuse. This man found Lord Buddha undisturbed and was greatly disappointed, finding all his hard labour gone to waste. When he had done all the abusing [he could] for quite some time and his stock of bad words might have been coming to an end, the Lord urged the man to listen to him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Lord Buddha asked the man, &ldquo;Suppose you give something to somebody which he accepts; then the ownership of the thing is transferred to the receiver, isn&#146;t it?&rdquo; The man agreed. The Lord continued, &ldquo;And if the man rejects the offering, will not the thing be returned to its owner?&rdquo; The man again agreed. Lord Buddha concluded, &ldquo;All the words given by you have not been accepted by me!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->But the Lord [Parama Purus&#x301;a] has His palms ever ready to accept all that is offered by His children anywhere in the world. The palms of human beings are so small &ndash; they can receive and contain so little. Their palms simply cannot receive more than this [indicates]. But the palms of the Lord are large enough to receive any quantity from all His children at the same time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Lord&#146;s feet (pada) are also everywhere. There is no place which is inaccessible to Him. If a person is at a particular place and has to move to some other place, he or she will have to travel. But the Lord is everywhere, and He in reality does not have to move. In other words, He has so many feet that He is able to reach any place and be available at all places at all times. Elsewhere, scriptures say:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="13..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Sarvato&#146;ks&#x301;i &ndash; &ldquo;the Lord has His eyes &ndash; aks&#x301;i &ndash; everywhere also.&rdquo; The word aks&#x301;a has two letters, a and ks&#x301;a. From a to ks&#x301;a, in the Nagari system of letters, there are fifty letters. These letters are the acoustic roots of the fifty propensities through which human beings function. The different sounds are only a mixture and combination in varying degrees of these acoustic vibrations. So in other words, aks&#x301;a represents the whole set of the vibrations; that is, the creation. Since we see this creation with our eyes, the eye in Sanskrit is called aks&#x301;i. The pronunciation of this word as per the Tantric and the [Yajurvedic] system would be akkhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The Lord&#146;s eyes are everywhere. His eyes are even in a closed room where one may consider himself or herself alone. The story goes that once Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa gave a pigeon to Swami Vivekananda asking him to kill the bird in a place where he was alone. At the end of the day Swami Vivekananda returned along with the living pigeon and reported to Sri Ramakrishna that he could not find himself alone anywhere because wherever he went he found a pair of eyes &ndash; the Lord&#146;s &ndash; watching him.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.13.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#13.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[filler] What is the meaning of sa&#x301;dhu [saint]? Really sa&#x301;dhu means those in whose contact others become good. One is not a sa&#x301;dhu simply by wearing saffron dress. Those who have the capability of attracting others alone are sa&#x301;dhus. One can be a sa&#x301;dhu even in a suit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->[filler] There are many persons who have energy but do not work. They are lethargic. But there are also persons who work hard even if they do not have energy. They are persons who die working. This is very good. But better would be to work even while dying.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[filler] It is action that makes a man great. Be great by your sadhana, by your service and by your sacrifice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Where mind is operative in a structure, that structure is controlled by the mind; but structures in which mind is not expressed are controlled and operated by the mind of the Supreme Being. A man, for instance, moves from this place to that place by his mind; but the wind blows, and water flows according to the dictates of the Cosmic Mind. The movements controlled by the Supreme Being are all from inanimate to animate, and from crude to subtle. In other words, they are movements towards God. We may say that the Supreme Being is drawing everything unto Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Human beings are moved and guided by their own unit minds, but even here where matters of collective importance are concerned, they are not absolutely free &ndash; there the Macrocosm asserts Its mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When a man moves in a line opposite the pull of the Supreme Being, this is movement towards degradation. Movement is a must, whether it is towards progress or degradation &ndash; whether towards hell or superman. Those animals and inanimate objects whose minds are not developed have no chance of being degraded since they have no choice of movement except in the direction of the Supreme. But man has the freedom of choice between progress and degradation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->If only the movement according to the will of the Supreme Being is movement towards progress, the question arises how to ascertain the desire of God. Man&#146;s small mind, enclosed in a box of bones, is incapable of knowing the secrets of the Cosmic Mind. It is difficult to know the unexpressed desire of the Supreme Self. But wherever there is difficulty, the solution lies nearby. Every disease has a curative herb near the source of the disease itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Suppose you have to ascertain what Mr. X would like to eat &ndash; rasagollas or gulabjamun [two types of Indian sweets]. How would you know this? Being a gentleman he will not express his desire. And God is also a gentleman &ndash; His desires are not all on the surface. A villager may blurt out his desires, but a refined man will not &ndash; and God is refined.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->But there is one way out. Start loving Mr. X and your minds will meet and you will know his desires. This is the path followed by the devotees. They love God and know His mind; they tune their minds in the same wave-length and direction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The difference between a sa&#x301;dhaka and a philosopher is this: the sa&#x301;dhaka learns philosophy for the sake of convincing others, not for himself. He is content to love God.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Imagine a devotee and a philosopher being in a mango grove. The philosopher will start counting the trees, their branches, and the mangoes in the orchard. While he is thus wasting his time, the devotee is enjoying the sweet juice of the mangoes. The devotee says, &ldquo;God is mine &ndash; I shall love Him and understand His will and act accordingly.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those who do not love God are also not completely free to act. They have to follow the Divine Will perforce. Some follow Him out of love, others out of fear. There is some element of fear in love also. My slightest mistake may pain the person I love, and hence this fear keeps me straight on the path of love. Man alone has the chance to follow God with love; other beings have to do so compulsorily.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Those who are afraid of God are not sa&#x301;dhakas. All want to avoid fear. God is fear to fear. All are afraid of the terrible &ndash; and God is a terror to the terrible. Thus being our enemy&#146;s enemy, God is our best friend.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Movement is life. God is the movement of the innermost vital energy [pra&#x301;na]. If God removes himself, one will no longer exist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->[filler] Even if a boy says something logical, it should be accepted; and even if the lotus-born Brahma [the mythological creator of the universe] says something illogical it should be rejected like a straw. [end of filler]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->God is one who purifies the purification. He is the Purity of the pure. People consider a dip in the Ganges as a purifying act. If this were true, the fish and animals who live in the Ganges would be the purest of beings, since they live 24 hours a day in the Ganges!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->God lives in every heart, and He is the Purifier of purity. So all that you have to do to be pure is to search your heart, contact the Supreme Being there and be pure. Why need you go outside for purification??<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Power without devotion is a force leading to degradation. You should not forget that God is the source of all ultimate power. He can snatch your power from you in a minute. This body of yours wherein you are a tenant belongs to the Supreme Law. He can evict you in a moment, without prior notice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[filler] Knowing oneself is the real knowledge, serving all with the ideation of God is the real action, and the vow to please God the real devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->[ten fillers are missing here]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->[filler] Now this sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; which is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for complete merger, for unification, starts with fearful love. Love must be there. Unless and until there is love there cannot be unification. So love must be there but it starts with fearful love and ends in fearless love; and the space between fearful love and fearless love is the space of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. What is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the transformation of fearful love into fearless love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->[filler] When the devotional depth comes, love, too will be brimming with high sentiments, full and over-flowing. In that stage alone will come your final realization of the Supreme Consciousness. Where &ldquo;I&rdquo; is, &ldquo;He&rdquo; is not&#8230; where &ldquo;He&rdquo; is, &ldquo;I&rdquo; is not. Remember, devotion is the prerequisite of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Maturity of devotion is love, and maturity of love is HE.<!-- /block --></p>

We will not use the word &ldquo;desiderata&rdquo;, the plural of &ldquo;desideratum&rdquo;, for humans have only one goal, not many.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Whatever object or idea there is in this relative world, there is a reason behind it. The reason may be known to you or may not be known to you, but there is a reason. When you get quite tired of worldly activities and sit in a lonely place, you think, &ldquo;Why have I come into this world?&rdquo; You might not know the reason, but He, the one who has manifested His liila&#x301; [play] everywhere, knows the reason. You might consider yourself inferior, but you are not so to Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Take, for example, your body, your mind, and the innumerable tiny cells of your body. Each cell gives rise to a particular thought. Such specialities there are in the human structure! The Creator has created this body carefully, with the utmost care; He even knows where a particular spot in your nerve is. You are not small. A doll may consider itself small, and it may be considered small by some, but the creator of the doll would never consider his creation valueless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->All that comes within the scope of relativity has a reason behind its existence. Even the existence of an eighty-year-old man or woman has a reason behind it. Parama Purus&#x301;a has kept you in the world; there is definitely a reason behind it. Never let inferiority arise in you. You are the children of Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; how can you be inferior? If someone says that you are low, or valueless, that will be absolutely wrong. Parama Purus&#x301;a, your Creator, is a great entity. How can He create anything inferior?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Many say that nature creates. But this is wrong. What can nature create? The style, the system in which Prakrti [the Operative Principle] operates is known as nature. There is a style of singing, of dancing; there is a style for doing each and every action. The style of the work of the Operative Principle is known as nature. How can the style create? Only the One whose style it is can create. Nature can do nothing. The Operative Principle operates according to the desire of Parama Purus&#x301;a. If Parama Purus&#x301;a did not permit it, then Prakrti would be unable to create. A&#x301;brahmastamba &ndash; &ldquo;Even a blade of grass would not move. Right from Brahma&#x301; to a blade of grass, it is all His desire.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Brahma&#x301; means the stage of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma when It is creating the universe. (Brahma + a equals Brahma&#x301;. A is the acoustic root of creation.) Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, Maheshvara &ndash; these are not separate entities, they are all different functional forms of the same entity. A gentleman is a sweet-shop owner, a traveller and a man with a [cricket] bat &ndash; he is the same gentleman at different stages. Even Brahma&#x301; would be unable to create if He [Parama Purus&#x301;a] would not want. And the little blade of grass too would not move.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So forget the talk about nature. To talk of nature is to talk of a philosophy of [the time] when humans worshipped stones, trees, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Without His desire, nothing will happen. Say you are speaking against Parama Purus&#x301;a in a meeting. You might want to say, &ldquo;I challenge Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; But after only having spoken the word &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; you might find that your raised fist remains raised and your voice is choked. Nothing can happen without His desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->You have come according to His wish, and by no one else&#146;s. Leave everything to Him. An astrologer predicts your death on a particular day, and advises you to wear lockets to counteract the effects of stars and planets. But doesn&#146;t the astrologer himself die?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->You will live according to His desire; you will die, too, according to His desire. Yesterday I told you to take the name of one only. Today I tell you to depend on one only, not on two. Death will not be painful for you, because in death too you attain Him. Merge with Him with all your love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->He has given you your organs. Utilize them for Him. With your voice sing His name, His praise, His kiirtana. With your mind think of Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Is the misery less even if one is bound with chains made of gold? No, bondage is bondage, be [the chains] made of gold or iron. The bondage of satkarma [good actions] is that of gold, and that of asatkarma [bad actions], iron. Either of them is to be broken off. One has to refrain from bad actions so that the chains of iron might not be forged; and good actions are to be effected, but what one has to do is to offer the chains made of gold at the feet of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;: &ldquo;I do not desire the fruits of my good actions, O Lord! I offer them to Thee.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As long as the physical body exists, some actions are bound to be performed. No one can help doing actions.

<a name="16..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Even after crores of kalpas [aeons] the reactions of actions are not exhausted. This continues to be so as long as the reactions have not been experienced.&rdquo; How will the reactions of the actions be exhausted? Karmabhogena ks&#x301;iiyate &ndash; &ldquo;When the reactions are experienced, then only are they exhausted.&rdquo; Avashyameva bhoktavyam&#x301; krtam&#x301; karmashubha&#x301; shubham &ndash; &ldquo;one has performed good actions, so their fruits are to be enjoyed; so also is it with bad actions.&rdquo; Hence one has to be cautious while performing actions. After that, repentance will fetch no benefit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Avashyameva bhoktavyam&#x301; krtam&#x301; karmashubha&#x301; shubham. Now the question arises whether the reactions will be just [equal] to the actions, or less, or more. Equal and opposite reaction is [the rule], but then, whether the enjoyment of the reaction of actions is purely psychic or physico-psychic is to be seen. Where the action is purely mental, the reaction will be just [equal] to that. But if the action is physico-psychic, the question is, what will be the reaction? Still one thing is there, that if the mind is not affected by the physico-psychic action, nothing happens.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.16.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#16.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> But [usually] when the reaction is physico-psychic, it has more effect than the action performed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->If it is purely psychic, the reaction will be just equal to it. [But] the reaction of the physico-psychic action does not affect the mind cent per cent. A person enjoys [psychic] reactions just [equal] to the actions performed. If there be some quantity of the reaction of physico-psychic action [that affects the body], in that case, the reaction will be much more than the action performed. The mind will be affected just according to the psychic action &ndash; that is the case with psychic actions. [But] if the action is physico-psychic, some of the reactions [affect] the mind, some [do] not. That which affects the mind is  a psychic reaction, that which does not is physical. Among these reactions, the one that is in the pure physical sphere does not affect the mind. The pure psychic coupled with the [physical] of a physico-psychic reaction add up to produce a greater reaction. So the quantity of reaction in case of a physico-psychic action becomes much greater. Hence one should be careful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->There are so many grades of sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual practitioner]. Some say, &ldquo;O Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, please get my sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras exhausted as soon as possible. Give to me whatever is there.&rdquo; [But] some say, &ldquo;I am ready to bear the fruits of my own [actions] and I am also ready to bear the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of others.&rdquo; There are varieties of feeling. Some want to carry the burdens of others so that others might not be in trouble. Sa&#x301;dhakas are at different stages, and their feelings are just according to their stages. While doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a sa&#x301;dhaka reaches a stage where pu&#x301;rn&#x301;a bhakti [cent per cent devotion] is aroused for Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. Then one remains unassailed even if a cyclone of misery attacks him or her. One feels maximum torture in the mind, but he or she little cares for it, taking it to be the benediction of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; Himself. Torture is there but he or she derives bliss from it. The sa&#x301;dhaka of that stage is called dagdhabiija [burnt seed]. A dagdhabiija comes within the range of psychic directly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Biija means &ldquo;seed&rdquo;. Wherever a seed is sown, it [sprouts into] a plant; but where the seed is burnt, a plant is not produced. A sa&#x301;dhaka becomes dagdhabiija when he or she has no more pain or pleasure of his or her own. One who has surrendered in toto and has not kept in hand even a single paisa of it, is alone dagdhabiija. All carry their own burdens, but if a dagdhabiija sa&#x301;dhaka so desires, he or she can carry the burdens of others also. And those who want to carry the burden of others do lessen the burden of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; indirectly. You should remember this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Do not remain worried about your individual problems at all. Be prepared to carry your own burden and be prepared also to carry the burdens of others. Then alone are you brave. Be dagdhabiija. Everyone has his or her own individual problems. Do not try to pass them on to others. On the contrary, bear the burdens of others. No one is your enemy. Be ready to bear the burdens of others.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject of discourse is &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is Purus&#x301;a? Purus&#x301;a means &ldquo;Pure Shete Yah Sah Purus&#x301;ah&rdquo; or &ldquo;Purasi Shete Yah Sah Purus&#x301;ah&rdquo;. The Sanskrit word Pura means settlement or township (Nagara). Therefore the entity which lies covert in each and every microcosmic structure is called Purus&#x301;a. It means that this quiescent entity or Purus&#x301;a lies hidden in each and every microcosm but doesn&#146;t perform any action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the definition &ldquo;Purasi Shete Yah Sah Purus&#x301;ah&rdquo;, Purasi means &ldquo;in front of&rdquo; or &ldquo;before.&rdquo; As in the sentence Purasi Hitam&#x301; Karoti Ya Sah Purohitah which means Purohita is one who moves in front of you to promote your welfare. One special attribute of Purus&#x301;a is that He always moves ahead of the microcosms. Whatever may be the speed of the microcosms, Purus&#x301;a is faster and so He is always ahead of them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;ah akarta&#x301; phalasa&#x301;ks&#x301;iibhu&#x301;tah<br>Bha&#x301;vakendrasthitah gun&#x301;ayantrakashca.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Purus&#x301;ah Akarta&rdquo;. The word Akarta&#x301; has been used in connection with Parama Purus&#x301;a. Why Akarta&#x301;? When in a solid body a force operates in that special state the force is termed as &ldquo;energy&rdquo;. Action, or something that involves a changing of place, is originated by energy. Action, either physical or mental, is effected only because of the vitality in your body. During the state of ill health you will find that you cannot think for a long duration. It is only because of the lack of vitality. Doership is the Operative Principle, not Purus&#x301;a&#146;s. Therefore, &ldquo;Purus&#x301;ah Akarta&#x301;&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Phalasa&#x301;ks&#x301;iibhu&#x301;tah&rdquo;. Now let us see what is Phalasa&#x301;ks&#x301;iibhu&#x301;tah. Purus&#x301;a is acquainted with all that is done by an entity. Whatever the unit mind performs is known to unit consciousness at once i.e. whatever your mind does is known to you&#146;re a&#x301;tma&#x301; at once. Today&#146;s discourse however is about Parama Purus&#x301;a, not about Jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; or Jiivapurus&#x301;a. External activity is the actual expression of whatever you think on your psychic plane. So, whatever your mind is acquainted with, is done by your mind and hence your A&#x301;tma&#x301; comes to know it. To what extent does your A&#x301;tma&#x301; maintain its witnessing capability? Unit consciousness is Karmaphala bhokta&#x301;, i.e. whatever action &ndash; vice or virtue, is performed by your mind has its impression on Jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; and the impression of the actions on Jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; is at once conveyed to, Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Whatever action the Cosmic Mind does, that is not really action because everything is internal. But whatever the unit mind performs is both internal as well as external. For instance, if a desire for stealing is aroused in one&#146;s mind, that can be internal when you don&#146;t translate the same into action i.e. mental stealing can have external expression or it may remain in the psychic plane itself. But whatever the Cosmic Mind does is all internal, totally within His mental arena, there is nothing external for Him &ndash; all is within Him. Whatever He does, He does within Himself i.e. without your knowledge. For example He steals away your mind, your A&#x301;tma&#x301;. One fine morning you will find that you have lost your mind. Your mind does not exist as He has stolen it away and just like a lunatic you begin dancing. How He has managed to steal it away is a mystery to you. Therefore He does everything inside Himself &ndash; everything is within, nothing without. Suppose your boss arrives, your superior arrives &ndash; you will welcome him and say, &ldquo;Please come, take your seat and have something to eat.&rdquo; You flatter him to the extent you know, but you say inside yourself, &ldquo;What a trouble has arrived. When will he go?&rdquo; This is not known to your boss. Hence a couple of &ldquo;I&#146;s&rdquo; are within you &ndash; one performs action in the external world and the other is within with which you alone are well acquainted but others are not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, therefore, is to unify the two into one &ndash; the internal &ldquo;I&rdquo; and the external &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Two-ness in one single personality is a disease. The more the gap between these two &ldquo;I&#146;s&rdquo;, the more you will undergo psychic torment. You must remember that in this second half of the 20th Century people are feeling much gap in between their internal &ldquo;I&rdquo; and external &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Because of the trouble in adjusting these two &ldquo;I&#146;s&rdquo; there is an increase in mental illnesses. This is the greatest disease in the 20th century. As regards Parama Purus&#x301;a there is no double personality. Everything is internal. The entire world is internal for Him. That which is external world for you is internal for Him. Whatever you think or do in your mind is also internal for Him. He enters your internal world, your mind and you don&#146;t know that He has entered i.e., He will steal away your mind and you will not know. A person too wants that Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; should steal away his mind. Therefore I remember to have told you that one of His names is Ma&#x301;khanacora (Butter thief). Generally one says to God to come to him but actually God is already with him &ndash; He is simply unable to see Him. A Sa&#x301;dhaka may think with his conscious mind that when God appears before him, he will surrender completely to Him. In the most interior corner of his mind, however he feels that when God appears before him, he will certainly surrender to Him, but he will also seek God&#146;s help for relieving the asthma from which he has been suffering badly. God, who is in the most interior corner of his mind, even knows this. Then He will not hear anything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->He will steal away the A&#x301;tman of a person and his mind will not know it, Therefore, He is named Ma&#x301;khanacora. As the cream is the essence of milk so is the A&#x301;tman of the body. He steals away the A&#x301;tman, so He is Ma&#x301;khanacora.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Why Purus&#x301;a is Akarta&#x301;? Action results when in the physical body vital force operates. Energy will not work away from material structure. It will always work from within. For Jiiva there is action, and also for Prakrti. Prakrti gets the action done, but Parama Purus&#x301;a is actionless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Phalasa&#x301;ks&#x301;iibhu&#x301;tah&rdquo;. Whenever a person performs some action there is an accompanying reaction. Action means creation of reaction also. For instance, if you throw a stone in a haphazard way, that will certainly have a result. Where there is action there is reaction. Both action and reaction take place in His Cosmic Body (Bhu&#x301;ma&#x301; Shariira). He immediately knows about the action performed by a person and its reaction too. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is not the enjoyer of the reactions.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Two birds with beautiful plumage are seated on the same tree. One of them is tasting the sweet fruits of the tree, whereas the other is just looking on. The bird tasting the fruits is likened to jiiva&#x301;tman or unit consciousness. The bird which looks on without tasting the fruits, but which watches the other bird eating the fruits, is likened to Parama&#x301;tman, the Supreme Consciousness. The tree, i.e., the body of a human being, has both jiivatman, which is karmopahata or that which receives the impression of all that the person does, and it also has Parama&#x301;tma, who is the witnessing entity of jiiva&#x301;tman. Through Prakrti, the inherent energy of Purus&#x301;a, a human being performs actions and reaps their consequences. This &ldquo;natural&rdquo; set up has been arranged by Parama Purus&#x301;a. He makes the arrangements for actions and reactions to occur, therefore He is Phalasa&#x301;ks&#x301;iibhu&#x301;ta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->They say that wherever there is action there is equal and opposite reaction. But there is one thing to be borne in mind here. Where there is action, the equal and opposite reaction takes place only when personal, temporal and spatial factors remain unchanged. But you know that personal, temporal and spatial factors do not remain unchanged. Just in the next moment time-factor is changed. If it is an inanimate object there is entitative change therein. If there is an animate object, the person remains unchanged but the mentality changes. Therefore, we do not find the exactly equal and opposite reaction of the action done. Generally the reaction is enhanced and is not lessened because the gap in inter-ectoplasmic stuff is increased for the reaction of an action done. For instance, you took a loan of rupees 1,000/-. When you return the amount you will have to pay the interest also. You will pay back Rs. 1020/- or 1030/-. Like-wise, if you have committed some sin you will be punished a little more than the reaction of the sin committed. Had the time, space and person remain unchanged the reaction would also have been the same. So get it in mind, while doing some thing immoral be prepared to pay the interest too. It is better not to take a loan, then alone you will not have to pay the interest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Bhavakendra.&rdquo; This external world, this expressed world, which you see is full of action, full of rhythms. This actional world is both extroversial and introversial for you. There is a world inside your mind. That is your internal world, and the world which you see without is the extroversial world. Hence this internal world for you is ideational and the external world, actional. But for Parama Purus&#x301;a there is nothing like the extroversial world, all is introversial, and hence for Him this world is ideational or His thought projection, i.e., this world is Samkalpita for Him. Suppose you imagine Jodhpur<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in your mind. This is ideational. But when you see outside, you find that it is Jaipur<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->, not Jodhpur. Then you realize that Jodhpur of your mind is ideational and Jaipur is actual. The same thing occurs in dream. While you dream you think it to be a fact because the external world does not exist there. For Parama Purus&#x301;a there is nothing like the extroversial world; just as for you when the internal world, which you take to be true in dream, is actually not there. For Him, the world exists in His ideation i.e., nothing is extroversial, rather all is introversial. And His imagination is called Samkalpa. Hence this world is a Samkalpita world for Him. There is a difference between Kalpatia and Samkalpana. Whatever you do in Kalpana is transitory and the Java concerned is only its enjoyer and none else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->God is a master magician who, by His magic spell, has created all and has hidden Himself inside His creation. If at all you want to know the creation, the trick of the magician, that can only be done when you join Him and His party.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->This world is ideational for Him and this ideational cosmos has Him in its centre. He is in the centre of this ideational cosmos. He has to control it. Have you ever seen a fisherman spreading his fishing net in a river or a tank? The fisherman does so and he has to manage the net also. Likewise, He has made the ideational world which He alone has to manage and control. He controls the idea, therefore, in common parlance, He is taken as inactive. If, however, people steal, rob and are corrupt, will Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; say that He is Akarta&#x301; and hence He has got nothing to do with them? No, He controls them indirectly through the Gun&#x301;as. Actually He controls the Gun&#x301;as which do the actions. Really it is Parama&#x301;-Prakrti that operates. For instance, the commander orders the soldiers to catch so and so. Who catches? It is the soldiers, the power of the soldiers. People see that the soldier has caught the offender, but the soldier does so only with the direction of his commander. Hence Parama Purus&#x301;a is just like the commander and Parama Prakrti just like the soldier. This control over Blia&#x301;va Kendra is Samkalpita Niyantran&#x301;a, and He who controls it is named Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Therefore, there is another name of Parama Purus&#x301;a i.e. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Krsna means the attractor of this ideational world. This ideational world is made of ectoplasmic stuff or by ectoplasmic structure. For Parama Purus&#x301;a, the quinquelemental world is just the crudified form of His ectoplasm. His mental stuff is subtler than jiivas, and therefore contains speed (Gati), light (Dyuti) and rhythm (Chanda), and controls them. The mental stuff of Parama Purus&#x301;a with which the world has been created is something blissful (Svarasa). This very object is named Paramarasa. The unit mind does all with its mental stuff. Sometimes it creates money in the mind and seeing the mental bank balance it feels happy. Sometimes it makes itself a Prime Minister and feels happy, and sometimes it feels enemies are mentally beaten and it is overjoyed. All these are done only with an aim to satisfy its mental hunger, to quench its mental thirst. Ultimately we see that an individual&#146;s mental stuff is transformed into worldly objects. For the unit mind, whatever it makes within itself is Vaesayika. It is all directed for personal pleasure, for material pleasure. The flow of the ectoplasmic stuff of the jiiva is called Vis&#x301;ayarasa and the flow of Cosmic Mind is Paramarasa. When, even for once, the unit mind happens to come in contact with Paramarasa, the material pleasure ( vis&#x301;ayrasa) seems dry and insipid. Just as one eating vegetables without salt, feels they are tasteless. But material objects are needed to maintain the physical existence. The wise make the flow of Vis&#x301;ayarasa parallel to the flow of Paramarasa. They convert the waves of vis&#x301;ayarasa into the waves of Paramarasa. This alone is a safe way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is the nucleus of the Paramarasa of Bha&#x301;va Samudra and the unit minds are like boats in that Maha&#x301;Samudra. As per the rise and fall of Paramarasa of Parama Purus&#x301;a, the unit minds are to rise and fall i.e. as boats rise and fall with the waves of the ocean. The unit mind intentionally or unintentionally has to dance according to the rhythms and waves created by Parama Purus&#x301;a. This they are bound to do, there is no escape. Even if someone says that he will not dance because he is ashamed of dancing, really he dances, anyway; he simply does not know it. Everybody dances in the Paramarasa-Samudra. The Vis&#x301;ayarasatmaka Jiiva has to dance. There is no way out, they are made to dance. This very thing is the Rasa Liila&#x301; of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. There is difference between Liila&#x301; and Kriida&#x301;. Kriida&#x301; is causal. Everything in this world of relativity is causal. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is beyond the scope of relativity. Why is He making the world dance? Why has He made Paramarasa-Samudra? The answer to this cannot be known in the world of causality. Why Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; has done something has no answer because He is beyond the scope of causality. Hence that which is non-causal, that which is beyond the scope of causality is Liila&#x301;. Whatever Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; does is Liila&#x301;, but what Jiiva does is Kriida&#x301;. The wise will do Kriida&#x301; in such a way as to adjust their waves with the waves of Liila&#x301;. They will not try to know why Liila&#x301;maya has done an action. They will simply try to know Liila&#x301;maya Himself. If you cannot know the cause of a trifling thing like dancing, how can you know the cause of the action of Liila&#x301;maya? Jiiva has a very small brain and a very small cranium. It is not possible for it to know the action of Liila&#x301;maya. Suppose someone is an MA in 20 subjects. If he or she is asked suddenly to appear in the MA examination, he will not pass &ndash; he will have to read again, then he will have to appear. This proves that the Jiiva fails even to succeed in its own Kriida&#x301;. So how can it understand the cause of the Liila&#x301; of Liila&#x301;maya? It cannot. The best approach is to love Him, is to join His party. If there is true love the Master Magician will certainly make you understand everything because the more the members of His party know, the more convenient it is for Him. Hence He is &ldquo;Bhavakendrasthitah.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->There is a particular tune, a particular rhythm, a particular ra&#x301;ga, a particular ra&#x301;gini, particular laya and a particular ta&#x301;la in the Paramarasa-samudra as per the vibration projected in the nucleus of the Paramarasa. One who gets one acquainted with these does not like visayarasa, and naturally leaving the Visayarasa, one goes into Paramarasa. Then the attachment with the ra&#x301;ga and ra&#x301;gini of Visayarasa is lessened and one becomes like a lunatic. People say correctly that Ra&#x301;dha, hearing the melodious tune of the flute of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, started behaving abnormally. This was due to the bifurcation of the waves of Visayarasa and then sudden adjustment with the waves of Parmarasa. When a rural boy comes to the town and sees cinemas, then he does not like to see Ra&#x301;maliila&#x301;. He says &ldquo;Ra&#x301;maliila&#x301; is outdated. Cinema is far better.&rdquo; Is it not so? Likewise, when one comes in contact with the waves of Paramarasa, the charm of Visayarasa fades away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Wherever there is wave, there is sound &ndash; there is the sound of the ocean, of the river. The sound of Paramarasa is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s Muralidhvani. The sound of the Visayarasa is &ldquo;Money, more money, more corn, more vegetables, more bank balance.&rdquo; Don&#146;t you hear this? The sound of first class first, the sound for extension after retirement are the sounds of Visayarasa. The sound for the wedding of the daughter with no expenses is essentially the sound of Visayarasa. The sound of Paramarasa is the muralidhvani of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Hearing this, one does not appreciate the sound of Visayarasa. Parama Purus&#x301;a is Purus&#x301;ottama &ndash; He is seated in the nucleus of Paramarasa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is &ldquo;Gun&#x301;ayantrakashca&rdquo;. When Gun&#x301;a acts in material body that is known as energy. Energy is controlled by Prakrti but Prakrti, being the innate principle of Parama Purus&#x301;a, is controlled and guided by Him. The actions are controlled by Prakrti, but Prakrti is controlled by Parama Purus&#x301;a. Hence Parama Purus&#x301;a should alone be the be-all and end-all of humans. One must bear it in mind always that the Visayarasa of the units is encircled by Paramarasa from all the ten directions. You are never away from Parama Purus&#x301;a. He is always with you and in no condition you are alone. Since your activity is within Paramarasa, whatever you think, whatever you do with your organs is all made known to Paramarasa samudra. Since Paramarasa samudra knows it, it becomes the duty of Parama Purus&#x301;a as the witnessing entity to take you to task as long as you are not mended. I told you, Parama Purus&#x301;a is the creator and operator. His is not a vow to punish you, but to mend you i.e. whatever He thinks proper for you He will do, and it is proper for you to let Him do His will. Parama Purus&#x301;a will take care of those who take His shelter. He will not help those who think that they can take care of themselves, however, as He lets them do the things on their own. Therefore, it is told that for Bhaktas, Bhagava&#x301;n has special responsibility. It is the duty of Parama Purus&#x301;a to save the prestige of the Bhakta, and the duty of the Bhakta is to leave everything on Him. Whatever energy is working in Paramarasa or visavarasa is under Him. Therefore, when once you develop your love for Him you are not weak, not helpless and not alone. The victory is with you. Remember Him and march ahead &ndash; victory will be yours. You have not to be afraid of the worldly forces. Those who enjoy the highest force of Parama Purus&#x301;a are sure to succeed. Victory will surely be theirs.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma is eternal without beginning or end and Sagun&#x301;a Brahma also is eternal without beginning or end. Many people believe that when Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is within the infinite Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, then the former is indeed finite. This mistaken belief arises because people have no conception of the infinite, or have the capacity to conceive of it. If four is deducted from ten the remainder is six. Both four and ten are finite and the remainder six is also finite. However, if anything finite or infinite is deducted from the infinite the remainder is still infinite. So if the boundless Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is taken from the infinite Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, the remainder is still the infinite Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->That is to say, this is infinite and that also is infinite. The perfect has given rise to the perfect and if infinite be taken from the infinite, the remainder also is infinite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is the nucleus of knowledge in the form of Purus&#x301;ottama and His mental state is His object. Is Purus&#x301;ottama infinite or finite? For the reasons for which Purus&#x301;ottama is established in the subjective-feeling, for those very reasons His knowledge aspect is not destroyed. He is not under the bondage of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; (Prakrti) and whatever is beyond the bounds of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is beyond the bounds of time, place and person. Hence Purus&#x301;ottama is independent of time, place and form and is therefore infinite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The question we are considering is whether the mind of Purus&#x301;ottama, the Cosmic mind, is finite or infinite. Mind has three aspects: Mahattattva, Aham&#x301;ttatva and Citta. Because Sattvagun&#x301;a is expressed only in Mahattatva there are no limiting boundaries in the Cosmic &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Giving shape to a thing after rendering it finite is effected by Tamogun&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the Aham&#x301;tattva, that is, wherein the state of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma only Sattvagun&#x301;a and Rajogun&#x301;a can exist, and no Tamogun&#x301;a, there can be no limitations giving rise to crudeness of physical forms. So the Mahatattva and Aham&#x301;tattva portions of the Cosmic mind are infinite, that is to say, the Cosmic mind is infinite. Is the Cosmic Citta, the crudest manifestation of the Cosmic mind, finite or infinite? When Citta has been created under the influence of Tamogun&#x301;a, it is undoubtedly bounded by the limitation of time. Just as with the idea of oneness. He acquires the form out of the five fundamental factors for specific objects, or for the sake of sustaining the existence, accepts or discards them, so also the entire Cosmic mind assumes a particular shape, the boundaries of which are formed by the unit mind. The only difference between the two is that the component of the unit mind is only the reflection of the Cosmic mind. This quinquelemental world is the crude manifestation of the Cosmic mind. The Cosmic Mind is the creator of the sublime form of the unit mind and forms the medium of the individual for feeling of pleasure or pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Though this quinquelemental world is very large and extensive, it is not infinite because it is simply the collective evolution of the Cosmic Citta, created by the help of Tamogun&#x301;a. Without doubt it is limited. Just as each of the planets, the stars and the heavenly bodies possesses a particular shape, so also their sum-total is not shapeless, because they are all the results of the mind-stuff of the Cosmic mind. One day the scientists will also understand this reality and recognize the validity of the sages&#146; words. This extremely vast Cosmic mind stuff, which resembles the oval shape of the solar world is known as Brahma&#x301;nda (An&#x301;d&#x301;a means egg).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Regardless of how vast it is, the visible universe is finite. But is the potentiality of the Cosmic mind also limited?  When the Cosmic mindstuff merges into the state of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, will the Sagun&#x301;a Brahma also attain Moks&#x301;a? No, it will not. Even though all the manifestations of the Cosmic mind-stuff are limited, the mind-stuff is not finite. The origin of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is beyond the limits of time. Whatever Sagun&#x301;a Brahma has done in the form of Praja&#x301;pati, since eternity and without beginning has accumulated never ending sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. The original actions of these reactions have not been performed by any individual finite mindstuff. Rather innumerable mind-stuffs have been formed and destroyed, and to suffer those reactions innumerable mindstuffs of Brahma will in the future be created and destroyed. In the limited mind-stuff of Brahma, regardless of how vast it is, all reactions have neither been expressed or pulsated nor can they ever be so. As His Citta wanes, His unexpressed or unvibrated samaska&#x301;ras to on creating new mind-stuffs in His Cosmic mind to making Him bear the consequences of His actions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->As today&#146;s galaxies gradually evolve into stars and planets and ultimately get merged in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma the highest attainment of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, so too new luminous bodies, new atoms and electrons and new electrical bodies will be created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->For this reason I say that the present Cosmic Citta is limited, but the Cosmic mind-stuff is infinite and will continue throughout eternity. When we discover that the Cosmic mind is the innumerable expressions of the mind-stuffs in their totality, then we are correct in calling it infinite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Remember that your personality will also advance through transmutation like all other entities. The total extinction of the Cosmic mind will never occur. You have no cause to fear any final dissolution of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those who think that Brahma has something to gain by the attainment of emancipation by a living being are mistaken. What is the decease in the size, of the cosmic mind-stuff when one person attains supreme redemption? Again, that person will be created out of the unmanifested sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. For the sake of reaping His sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, Brahma continues to imagine and will continue throughout eternity. Brahma may be happy about the redemption of a unit living being, but it is no help to Him in attaining salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->It is expedient for human beings to be ever grateful to Him, since by His grace He has equipped them with the requisites for sa&#x301;dhana. He constantly showers His grace without reservation even on those persons who make no effort for salvation and who gradually degrade themselves. Even though you calumniate Brahma and deny His existence, yet He will not be displeased with you. He will not thrust you on the path of destruction. His imposing countenance of forgiveness will for ever remain, and He will forever go on directing you to the ways of salvation. Who else is your genuine friend and compassionate companion?<!-- /block --></p>

The aspirant&#146;s mind is perfused with feeling of love. The waves of bliss start stirring up his or her mind. His or her voice is choked by the influx of emotions and through lips zealous with sentiment, through the tilting body and tearful eyes, one and only one soundless voice recites. It recites the feeling of solitary self-surrender to Him, of complete dependence on Him &ndash; &ldquo;Brahma krpa&#x301;hi kevalam.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the morning I said that it is the utilization of energy which matters and not the possession of an unutilized capacity. Many people have inferiority complexes of different kinds. They think they are not learned.  How will they achieve the goal of their life?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is wrong to presume that by reading voluminous books or by delivering beautiful lectures, one can attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. No scholarship nor even literacy is required to meet God. The future of those who are uneducated is also bright.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->God&#146;s relation with human beings is a family relation.  When parents feed the children, they do not give four chapatis to the son who is a Master of Arts and only one to the next son who is only a matriculate. For parents, all their children are equal. Similarly, for God all persons are equal for the spiritual food He will give them. Really, the love of parents is dependent not upon the education of the children but upon the children&#146;s attachment for the parents.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Scholars or intellectuals have one drawback. They read different theories and philosophies, and these things create a clash in their minds. They are unable to decide whether this philosophy is correct, or that one is correct. The uneducated, on the other hand, are better off, as they walk on the spiritual path with steadiness, undisturbed by warring ideas. The intellect is incapable of comprehending Parama Purus&#x301;a. After all, the intellect is only a creation of the [pratisain&#x32D;cara]<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> process, in which Pure Consciousness reconverts itself into [the mind] out of the five fundamental factors into which it converted itself earlier. Being a created thing, intellect cannot comprehend its Creator, the Supreme Being. The puppets can perform any play the master wants them to perform, but they cannot control the master who plays them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->What is knowledge? It is the subjectivization of the object. God, being the ultimate subjectivity, cannot be caught by the thought process, which can only catch external objects and not a superior stage of subjectivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Nor is God attained merely by listening to a lot of [spiritual discourses]. Some persons are fond of attending spiritual congregations. But what they hear with one ear goes out the other at a 180&#186; angle, and does not lead to salvation. With kiirtana and the remembrance of God, however, it is otherwise. Whether you do these things with faith and devotion, or with enmity, the results are encouraging.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word shraddha&#x301; [translated &ldquo;faith and devotion&rdquo;] really has no equivalent in the English language. Whatever you consider as the summum bonum of life is sat. And when you direct all your faculties and sentiments towards the attainment of this goal, this is called shrat. And the feeling associated with this is called shraddha&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Even when you think of God as an enemy, you are involved in Him.  Really, our mind is more activated [to think about somebody] by anger and hatred [than by positive propensities]. When we have a quarrel with somebody, we keep on thinking that the next time we meet that person, we will say this or that. Therefore, God will be attained whether you love Him or hate Him. Ravana was constantly thinking of Rama as his enemy and therefore he also attained salvation through His hands. But merely listening to scriptures or talks is not going to bring about the desired results.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Another fact must be remembered: that God is realized only by those whom He graces with compassion. You should not have the feeling in mind, &ldquo;Now I have done so much; God should shower His grace on me.&rdquo; Rather you should feel, &ldquo;It is for You, O Lord, to grace me or not. This body of mine will work like a machine until You grace me with love.&rdquo; If you are proud of your meritorious actions, this pride will remain in the end and not the grace of God. For Him, all are equal. For society, the differences matter, but not for God. His grace is raining on all, but if you are carrying an umbrella of ego on your head, how will you get drenched by His Grace? Everyone has a right to enter Brahmaloka [the subtlest layer of the Macrocosmic Mind]; this is the birthright of all. He is kind to all, every moment of one&#146;s life. One has only to receive this kindness by removing the ego.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->However great a sinner one may be, the moment one surrenders to the Lord, one becomes a devotee &ndash; his or her salvation is guaranteed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Entity whom you are trying to attain &ndash; Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; is your own innermost self. Your relation with Him is not external, to be defined by courts, laws, or society. It is a family relationship. The desire in your mind to meet God is only born when He is inclined towards you. It is the result of His desire to meet you. Your meeting with God is not a unilateral affair, it is a mutual thing. You walk one step towards Him and He will come twenty towards you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When an infant starts walking, the parent first asks it and goads it to walk a little. It tries to walk, but falls. Then the parent advances and lifts it up onto his or her lap. God does the same. Make the slightest effort, and He will pick you up and place you on His lap.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Your relation with God is personal. No one can sever this relationship. It is part of your being, your birthright.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There is a famous verse from the Upanishads which says that you cannot reach Parama Purus&#x301;a unless you are strong and full of energy. The word bala means that spiritual force which functions in a jiiva [living being] base. In ordinary parlance, however, bala means &ldquo;capacity&rdquo;. It depends upon the extent to which one makes use of one&#146;s physical, psychic and spiritual energy.  A person may have immense capacity, but to the extent that he or she does not utilize it, it does not become helpful in God-realization. Bala, therefore, depends on the extent of the use of one&#146;s capacity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When the divine bridge was constructed by Rama to cross the ocean, Hanuman brought mountains, but the squirrel brought only small pebbles. Both were strong and full of energy, as each was working to his full capacity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Thus even a comparatively weak person can become balava&#x301;n [strong] by utilizing the small energy he or she has. Whatever power, energy, you have, utilize it for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and service, and you are balava&#x301;n, fit to reach Parama Purus&#x301;a. None of you need, therefore, despair. Each has the requisite wherewithal to reach the Almighty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The utilization of energy should be in the proper direction. If you have to move to the east and you start moving towards the west, your action will be considered full of pra&#x301;ma&#x301;da, or madness. Ananda Marga has the correct way, through subjective approach and objective adjustement. While followers of Ananda Marga keep their eyes steady on the absolute, they do not ignore this relative world. They work for self-realization and social upliftment, and hence the utilization of their energy is never in vain. When the effort is correct and the utilization right, you will certainly reach the goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->I do not want you to wait life after life to reach your goal. You should realize the goal in this very life. Why will you waste even one precious moment of this life? Therefore fear not, success is yours for the asking. Go on making the correct effort.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the Sanskrit language, the word na&#x301;ra has many meanings. One meaning is &ldquo;water&rdquo;. Another meaning is Parama&#x301; Prakrti &ndash; the Causal Matrix or Supreme Operative Cosmic Principle. The third meaning is &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The main and inevitable aim of every sa&#x301;dhaka is not to enjoy the nectar of devotion by himself or herself, but to distribute it all around. Sa&#x301;dhakas are eager to share with others the bliss which they enjoy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In ancient times there was one such devotee who used to go from place to place distributing the bliss of devotion. His name was Narada. Once he said to Parama Purus&#x301;a: &ldquo;O Lord, all the scholars and philosophers say that You are omniscient, but people do not feel Your presence everywhere. Where, therefore, is the place where Your presence can most be felt? Or which place do You consider as dearest to You?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The Lord replied, &ldquo;It is true that I am everywhere; there is no action, no thought, no feeling, in which I am not present. All actions take place before My eyes, within My mind. Nothing [should] be done or thought which is meant to be hidden from Me. Still, I do not live in the seventh heaven as people think. Minds which are free from narrowness, limitations, and isms are the places dear to me.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The true meaning of the word yoga is &lsquo;to unify&rsquo;. But those who do a&#x301;sanas, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, etc., without devotion are cultivating the desert. Without the water of devotion, their effort will not succeed. I am not in the hearts of such dry yogis.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word bhakti is &ldquo;attraction to the Supreme&rdquo;. When the attraction is to something limited, it is called a&#x301;sakti, and when the attraction is to the Supreme, it is devotion, bhakti. There is no compromise, no meeting point, between a&#x301;sakti and bhakti, between attraction to the Supreme and attraction to the objects of the world. In a&#x301;sakti, the feeling is that I get the object. In bhakti, the feeling is that I merge myself in Him. Where there is no desire, there the Lord lives. The Lord and the desire for the world, like the sun and the night, cannot coexist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->For devotees, all other enjoyments are insipid. They are like saltless food. Hence the Lord says, &ldquo;Where My devotees sing My praise, do kiirtana, there I go &ndash; I cannot help going there.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->One person is scholarly, another is rich; but they may or may not be devotees. The only thing that the devotee needs is love for the Lord.  When all feelings, all attachments, are directed towards Him, then it is devotion. The only qualification is a sincere heart. If your heart is pure, you need nothing else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Nothing is gained by becoming a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii. [Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na] has use only so far as devotion has not been born. When you eat tasty food, the paper on which you place this food is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. The food itself is karma, and the taste of the food is bhakti.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.23.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#23.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> If you have absorbed the food and got its taste, the dirty paper of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na has to be thrown in the dustbin. This alone is wisdom. Be wise!<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="24..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [knowledge]? It is subjectivization of the external objectivity. It leads a person from crudity to subtlety; that is, wherever this tendency is found, that can be termed jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, and where the tendency is not present, [there is no] jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. And what is the base of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na? Where jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is completely physical, its base is the mind; where it is entirely spiritual, its base is the soul. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na unifies the mind with the a&#x301;tman; this itself is the greatest quality of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. That jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na which does not unify the mind with the a&#x301;tman, is not jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na but the confusion of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Because of this so-called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, vanity creeps into a person. If you see a person with vanity, you must understand that that person has no knowledge, but the confusion of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the fifteenth century in India, and especially in Bengal, this confusion of knowledge developed excessively. The people of Bengal would keep arguing about minor things. For hours together they would talk about subjects such as sound, shape, etc. They thought themselves to be great in doing so, and the person having victory considered himself to be a great pandit. But these persons were neither pandits nor jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis. They were not pan&#x301;d&#x301;its because they were not established in pan&#x301;d&#x301;a bha&#x301;va [the feeling that one is Brahma], nor were they jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis, as their knowledge had not been subjectivized. They were arguing about pa&#x301;tra&#x301;dha&#x301;ra taela or taela&#x301;dha&#x301;ra pa&#x301;tra [&ldquo;whether the pot is the container of the oil or the oil is contained in the pot&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There was once an argument between two great pandits as to whether the sound of a falling palm-fruit is produced first, or the palm-fruit falls first. The discussion continued for a good number of months, but with no decision. They then decided to see practically, sitting under a tree one night, whether the palm-fruit falls first or the sound is produced first. The next morning it was found that both of them had been killed by palm-fruits falling on their heads. Hence this so-called knowledge is not a knowledge at all, but the confusion of knowledge, which you surely do not want to possess.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the first stage, the mind itself is the base of knowledge. What is the mind? The structure of human beings is metazoic. In that structure there are innumerable protozoa, protozoic minds, and protozoic microcosms. The resultant of all these protozoic microcosms is in the human mind. And in this metazoic structure there are metazoic minds, and with them are metazoic microcosms. Actually, each metazoic mind is a collection of [a number of] protozoic minds. For a human with a complex physical structure, there is also a unit mind. So the mind of a human has three compartments: the first is the collective protozoic [mind], the second is the collective metazoic mind, and the third is his or her own separate mind. Taking all three together, we get a human&#146;s unit mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The protozoic minds are guided by instinct only. The protozoic mind is citta only, with no development of aham&#x301;[tattva] or mahattattva. Ingesting food, supporting offspring &ndash; this is all done instinctively, according to their svabha&#x301;va [spontaneously], the reasons being quite unknown to those creatures. The earthworm does not know that it is an earthworm. It moves instinctively, spontaneously, according to its undeveloped mind. The protozoic minds and the protozoic microcosm can be said to be the physical mind. A protozoic creature has only physical mind. The collection of protozoic minds in the human can be said to be the physical mind of the human, known as the [ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a]. It is guided by instinct, there is no discrimination.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->But the metazoic mind moves with some intellect, or discrimination, as there has been some development of intellect in it. Hence the metazoic mind has control over the protozoic mind. The more the metazoic mind is developed in a creature, the more developed the creature is; that is, a metazoic structure will be more complicated. And where this complication has increased considerably, that physical structure is the human physical structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The individual mind in a human is a metazoic mind. Some one million years ago, the first parents of humanity were australopithecines. The metazoic minds of the then people were very, very simple as compared to those of present-day people. Hence in the intellectual realm, the then people were quite underdeveloped. In the course of this one million years, the metazoic structure and physical structure of humans became very complicated. This resulted in the complication of their metazoic minds, too. Different propensities, a number of propensities, were added to their minds. The number of propensities in the human mind is far more than in animals&#146; minds. The reason is that the metazoic structure, the physical structure, of a human is very complicated, hence the human&#146;s metazoic mind is very developed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The whole of a person comprises the person&#146;s own mind, the person&#146;s physical mind, and the metazoic minds. But in the protozoic minds there is a dominance of instinct. An animal does not understand discrimination, but the stick. You know that a person within whom there is a dominance of animality does not agree with logic, but [understands discipline].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->You know that at the time of the fight between the Kaoravas and the Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avas, the latter [tried] very reasonably to make the former understand, but in vain. Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hira even prayed to God for a change in them. There was the grace of Parama&#x301;tman also, but they were too crude to understand this. But they could very easily understand when they heard the thundering sound of Ga&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;iiva [the bow of Arjuna]. Hence the protozoic mind succumbs to physical [discipline], and nothing else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->All the protozoic minds in a human try to influence the human mind. The metazoic minds try to do likewise. Where the personal mind of a human is not vigilant, it becomes influenced by the protozoic minds and the metazoic minds. The person is led towards animality. But when the personal mind is vigilant, it has full control over the protozoic and metazoic minds. To maintain control is an internal fight. This fight is [the] first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. This fight is quite essential for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. On the one side there is dharma buddhi [good thought], and on the other, the forces of instincts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Protozoic minds move instinctively, whereas metazoic minds move with abhijin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta&#x301; [acquaintance, experience]. Hence undeveloped and underdeveloped metazoic structures work with both acquaintance and experience. Sub-human animals such as dogs and monkeys learn through this acquaintance [and experience]. The mind of an Alsatian dog becomes developed a lot when it comes in contact with a trainer; that is, it learns through training, for it has a metazoic mind. The jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na of a protozoic mind, that is, instinct only, is known as &ldquo;physical knowledge&rdquo;. The knowledge that a human acquires in touch with physicality is in its first stage physico-psychic. And when this physico-psychic knowledge becomes established in the mind, it is known as &ldquo;psychic knowledge&rdquo;. And psychic knowledge, when it is translated into the physical world, is psycho-physical knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Worldly knowledge, the confusion of knowledge, is in its first stage physico-psychic, and then psychic. That itself is translated into the physical world, hence it is psycho-physical. And what is the source of this physico-psychic knowledge? &ndash; let us see how far it is authentic. You derive jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na from books. You will read &ldquo;Lahore is the capital of the Punjab&rdquo; in a book twenty-seven years old. But this does not stand correct today. This is because the source of physical knowledge is bound up by time, space, and person. With the change of time, space, and person, physical knowledge will change. Hence it is not a permanent knowledge. It is based on falsehood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->There can be still one more flaw in the source of physical knowledge, and that is a printing mistake. Because of it you read &ldquo;Lahore&rdquo; as &ldquo;Labore&rdquo;. Next, there can be something wrong with your eyes, also, which causes you to read &ldquo;Lanore&rdquo;. These things provoke laughter in the audience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Hence because of defects in the different media, this knowledge will be wrong knowledge. If with this very knowledge a person is full of vanity, is that person not a first-class fool?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->This physico-psychic knowledge has value to some small extent in the physical world. But its value is always changing. The theory which is appreciated today changes tomorrow. Hence every knowledge in the world &ndash; every physico-psychic knowledge &ndash; is defective. To be proud of this kind of knowledge is not at all the job of the wise. It is better to say, &ldquo;I do not know anything.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->So what is true knowledge? True knowledge is the knowledge of that object which never undergoes any metamorphosis due to changes in time, space, and person. Everything in the world is causal; that is, the effect is followed by the cause, and the cause by the effect. It goes on like this. The effect of one phase becomes the cause of the next. This is known as sadrsha parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma in Tantra. As long as we are under temporal, spatial and personal factors, the cause-and-effect factor will work. Where the cause-and-effect factor works, there only imperfection exists. One cannot be proud [of] the knowledge springing out of that source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->It is said in the Vedas, &ldquo;I don&#146;t speak [about what] I don&#146;t know, nor do I speak [about what] I do know. Because the Transcendental Entity is known only by the person who knows that Parama&#x301;tman is beyond knowing and not knowing.&rdquo; This is because knowing is a particular psychic projection coming within the scope of time, space, and person. And not knowing is another psychic projection coming within the scope of time, space, and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Entity is beyond time, space, and person. It being non-changing, if a person makes an effort to acquire spirituo-psychic knowledge instead of physico-psychic, in order that the source of his or her knowledge be not the external physicality but rather internal spirituality, in that case that knowledge will be a perfect one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->What happens in the case of spirituo-psychic knowledge is that though its source is absolute, its subject is relative, as the mind works within the scope of relativity. The source of spirituo-psychic knowledge is absolute, the only absolute. When humans start acquiring knowledge, they should not endeavour for physico-psychic knowledge, on the contrary they should endeavour for spirituo-psychic knowledge. In spirituo-psychic knowledge, in the first phase there is more of psychic than spiritual. But later on, when mental concentration is gained in and there is advancement in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the spiritual increases and the psychic decreases. And when gradually the proximity to spirituality increases, the psychic is completely eliminated, and only the spiritual exists. The final, terminating, point of this spirituo-psychic knowledge is spiritual knowledge, and that alone is knowledge. That is the real knowledge which does not change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->All physical, physico-psychic, psychic, and psycho-physical knowledge is not knowledge, but the confusion of knowledge. When humans realize that that so-called knowledge is of no value to them, then alone do they surrender to Parama Purus&#x301;a [Cosmic Cognition]. As long as people have the desire to acquire all relative knowledge, and try to do so, those people think themselves to be persons of letters, and refuse to surrender at the feet of Cosmic Cognition. When people&#146;s vanity becomes powdered down by different blows, they realize that their approach to knowledge was a defective one. Then they surrender, and their egos are dashed to pieces. The greatest knowledge in the realm of physicality and mentality is that all the knowledge acquired by one so far is false. This physical knowledge is like the leaf of a shala tree [a tall evergreen with large leaves] on which people take meals. As long as you have not eaten, there is a value in the leaf, but the moment you have finished your meal, the leaf goes into the dust bin to be licked by the street dogs. When you come to realize that this physical knowledge of yours is only worth licking by a dog, then devotion will arise in you. Then you will acquire true knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->What is the nature of the psycho-spiritual approach through which one acquires spirituo-psychic knowledge? When the physical mind reaches the zenith of subtlety, that is known as physico-psychic knowledge. There the value of physico-psychic knowledge starts. When one is established in psychic knowledge, then there is the expression of the psycho-physical in it. Likewise, when psychic knowledge reaches the zenith of subtlety, it comes in contact with spirituality, and the point where spiritual knowledge or spirituo-psychic knowledge functions in the mental scope, is alone said to be spirituo-psychic knowledge. As matter is made to be the end of life in acquiring physical knowledge (fit to be thrown into the dust bin), so for acquiring spiritual knowledge, Parama&#x301;tman should be made the end. Then alone will people get real knowledge.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.24.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#24.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->How is it possible to make Parama&#x301;tman the end of your life? Parama&#x301;tman is the subject for the whole of the Cosmos, and the latter is His object. He is the Supreme Subjectivity, you are His object. It is not possible to make Him your object, as you are His object. Then what to do? You have to take the ideation that He is always witnessing you. The wise do not take Parama&#x301;tman as their object exactly, but rather think that they are being witnessed by Him. &ldquo;Parama&#x301;tman is not my object; I am the object of Parama&#x301;tman.&rdquo; When this feeling is constantly there, always there, in a person, the name of this stage is dhruvasmrti. That you are the object of Parama&#x301;tman is known to you, but you do not remember this all the time. When through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; a person never forgets that Parama&#x301;tman is always witnessing him or her, this is named dhruvasmrti. This alone is spiritual knowledge. In this stage alone does a person get true knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->This spiritual knowledge can be translated into the mental sphere as well as into the physical sphere. If a person is willing to translate it, he or she should do so, for that will bring a lot of good to the world. This alone is real knowledge. With this alone, progress is possible. The most learned person is one who understands that he or she is not at all learned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->You are spiritual aspirants. You must always remember that physico-psychic knowledge is needed only in the physical world. But when [spiritual knowledge] is acquired in the individual life, then it is no longer required.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->This very spiritual knowledge is alone devotion; that is, knowledge finally transforms itself into devotion after constant efforts; that is, when knowledge realizes that nothing is to be effected by it, then alone does it surrender to devotion. When knowledge surrenders to devotion, that is spiritual knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Hence remember that once you have got devotion, you have got everything. If Parama&#x301;tman asked you your demand, you should demand nothing, and if at all God is pleased to give you something, you should ask for para&#x301;bhakti [absolute devotion].<!-- /block --></p>

It is through jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma that bhakti is aroused, and it is bhakti that leads human beings to that supernal bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->While bhakti is free from any defect, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma may create certain shortcomings. The acquisition of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na often results in making a person alasa [lazy] and aham&#x301;ka&#x301;rii [proud]; while karma has the possibility of making a person proud. Unless a spiritual aspirant is able to get rid of these defects, the aspirant cannot be established in kevala&#x301; bhakti [non-attributional devotion], which is absolutely essential for the attainment of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The wise will, therefore, adopt such a conduct as to save themselves from the evil effects of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In order for sa&#x301;dhakas to save themselves from the evil effects of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, they must learn how to get rid of those effects, and thus preclude the possibility of allowing their jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na to be converted into bandhya&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [sterile knowledge], which is so much in evidence among the intellectuals of today. This bandhya&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, instead of being a source of inspiration to march on the path of progress, leads humans or society to utter destruction and decay.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It has been observed that those engaged in the acquisition of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na lose touch with practicality. Their constant preoccupation with books makes them lazy and lethargic, and they become shy of work; and this eventually leads to their downfall. The golden rule for getting rid of one&#146;s defects is that one should first create opposite feelings and ideas in the mind, and then bring them into execution. In order to avoid laziness, therefore, one will have to work hard. Work is the manifestation of the Supreme Entity, so everyone will have to work, and work in greater and greater measure. Karma Brahmeti karma bahu kurviita [&ldquo;Work is Brahma, therefore work more and more.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Work here does not mean just any engagement [of the faculties] which yields no result.

<a name="25..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The first type of aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is called abhima&#x301;nam, which means that a person thinks that he or she deserves more than what he or she is getting; and consequently develops an overbearing attitude towards everyone. Abhima&#x301;na has been compared with drinking: anyone who indulges in it loses his or her discriminating judgment, just as a drunkard does. (A human is different from an animal only because he or she possesses viveka [faculty of discrimination] and buddhi [intellect]. And just as a drunkard gradually loses these priceless faculties, an abhima&#x301;nii also becomes bereft of them.) Since the loss of the rational faculty goes against cardinal human virtues, drinking is a pa&#x301;pa [sin]. Similarly, abhima&#x301;na is a pa&#x301;pa, and leads to the downfall of the individual.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Gaorava is the second type of aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. It means &ldquo;self-aggrandizement&rdquo;. Puffed up with vanity, a person will want to project his or her image in an exaggerated manner. Often we hear somebody say, for example, that they have a rose the size of a balloon in their garden &ndash; whereas actually the rose may be the size of a ping-pong ball. Constant indulgence in this type of activity converts the mind into matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->We have seen bulls moving about in the streets with an air of arrogance. Such a bull creates a sound expressing the idea that it is big &ndash; Ham bar&#x301;a&#x301;. But when the bull dies and ta&#x301;n&#x32D;t [vina string] is made out of its intestines and musicians start playing on it, the sound which is then emitted expresses the idea Tun&#x32D; bar&#x301;a&#x301; &ndash; meaning thereby that the bull realizes that others are big, and realizes that he has arrived at this condition because of his arrogance.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.25.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#25.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In fact the inculcation of gaorava leads one to the worst hell. Just as there are six layers, or lokas, of the Cosmic Mind above the crude world, so are there six types of hell, six narakas, below the physical world. The names of these hells are tala, atala, tala&#x301;tala, pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, atipa&#x301;ta&#x301;la and rasa&#x301;tala. Another term for rasa&#x301;tala is raorava naraka &ndash; and a person indulging in gaorava will certainly go to raorava.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->(It must, however, be remembered that all these hells or narakas are not actually to be found below this earth. These various narakas denote the mental and physical states of human beings. A person whose mind has been converted into matter like that of a stone is really not worthy to be called a human being, because he or she has lost the mental qualities of a human being. A person of this type is said to be living in naraka. This point has been clarified in Ananda Su&#x301;tram [by the author, 1962]: Na svargo na rasa&#x301;talah [&ldquo;There is no heaven and no hell&rdquo;].)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The third type of aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is [the desire for] pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; &ndash; the desire to make oneself known. A person influenced by [the desire for] pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; expects respect from everyone, and hankers after name and fame. This mental state can be easily compared with the mental condition of a beggar. The beggar asks money from others, while the person craving for prestige begs others to give him or her respect. [The person desires something that] is really meaningless and possesses no value, something that has been fitly compared to the excrement of a pig.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Curing These Defects<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->After having analysed the various types of aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra and their evil effects, we need to examine the ways and means of getting rid of these defects. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has offered a psychological method to save oneself from the malady of aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. Aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is really a mental ailment, and a person suffering from this disease requires psychological treatment. The following shloka summarizes the line of treatment suggested by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Trn&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena taroriva sahis&#x301;n&#x301;una;<br>Ama&#x301;niina&#x301;m&#x301; ma&#x301;nadeyam&#x301; kiirttaniya sada&#x301; Harih.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..19"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[You must be more humble than the grass and more tolerant than the trees. You must give respect to those whom no one respects, and always do kiirtana to the Lord.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In order to get rid of abhima&#x301;na, one will have to cultivate the habit of being polite and humble. Just as a [blade of grass] may lie on the ground [underfoot], but does not, through its remaining humble, lose its importance, so a person will never become insignificant by being humble. Humility such as that of the [blade of grass] can alone save a person from abhima&#x301;na. Forbearance and tolerance like that of a tree which, even while being cut, continues to give its cool shade, are also necessary in order to keep away from abhima&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->A person who is always engaged in the thought of his or her pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; must learn how to care about the respect and prestige of others. Such a person must never forget that respect begets respect, and that he or she should always honour those who are not honoured by anyone. A constant practice of this type will remove the evil effects of the desire for pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;. One easy way to do this is that you always do namaska&#x301;ra first and do not create a situation in which you may have to do prati-namaska&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->And finally, a person who moves about puffed up with vanity and arrogance, and is always engaged in gaorava, self-aggrandizement, will be able to improve only by utilizing his or her time in kiirtana. If a person keeps himself or herself engaged in kiirtana, that person will not have time to criticize and slander anyone in order to project his or her own image by comparison and contrast. So it is a must for such a person to do a lot of kiirtana, so that the person does not get time to indulge in the despicable activity of paraninda&#x301; [slandering].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Therefore spiritual aspirants who have set their eyes on Parama Purus&#x301;a as their goal must always strive to get rid of a&#x301;lasya [lethargy] and aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, and gain the full benefits of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma, so as to arouse and enliven bhakti, which is the only road to the journey&#146;s end. The person will have to engage himself or herself in work for the collective welfare, will have to cultivate the qualities of humility, forbearance and tolerance, will have to learn to honour those who are honoured by none, and will have to participate in and organize kiirtanas.<!-- /block --></p>

Each and every human being wants to do something noble, something lasting. But the life of each and every person is not crowned with success, because the thing that a person requires most is proper guidance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There was a yogi-king in ancient India about thirty-five hundred years ago, and his guide was Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a was a great yogi. The name of that yogi-king was Yudhisthira. Yudhi means &ldquo;in war, in battle&rdquo;, and s&#x301;t&#x301;hira means &ldquo;unaffected, unassailed&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;balanced&rdquo;. One who can maintain one&#146;s mental balance even in wartime is &ldquo;Yudhisthira&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now, he was a yogi; &ldquo;yogi&rdquo; means a practical person. A yogi has got little to do with theory. A yogi is not a theoretician, a yogi is a practical person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->He was asked a question, and that question was, &ldquo;What is the proper path, proper way?&rdquo; And the answer of King Yudhisthira was &ndash; let me repeat it in Sanskrit &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

The theory may or may not be a success in the field of application. It may be good in books, it may be good in theory, it may be good in contemplation, but it may or may not be useful in practical life. So a yogi, a spiritual aspirant, has to follow the practical person. That is, a yogi is to follow a maha&#x301;yogii [great yogi].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Shrutayo vibhinna&#x301;h. Now, there are so many scriptures in the world, but these scriptures vary from one another. Now, the supporters of those scriptures, the supporters of each and every scripture, say, &ldquo;Ours is the message of God. It cannot be challenged.&rdquo; By saying this, that is, that it cannot be challenged, they try to block the intellectual progress of human society. [By saying] that one should not think beyond this [they] want to do &ndash; what? They try to block, to seal, the intellectual progress of human society. They are enemies of human progress, they are enemies of human civilization. Had there been no intellectual progress, then even in this second half of the twentieth century, we would have been in the stone age. So there must be intellectual progress, and no power, no theory, should try to block this progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->But scriptures vary from one another. And the supporters of each and every scripture say, &ldquo;Ours is the message of God, it is the supreme word.&rdquo; Then if all the scriptures are messages of the same Supreme Being, why do they vary from one another? The Supreme Being is one, and if all the scriptures are messages of that single Supreme Being, then there should not be any variation amongst themselves. This shows that those scriptures are not the messages of that Supreme Being.<!-- /block --></p>

Now how to adjust? Then if a sa&#x301;dhaka wants to make an adjustment, he or she either has to face north or south &ndash; an adjustment between east and west! Either north or south.

In ancient times there were so many social systems, and now there are so many social systems in different portions of the world, and amongst different races of the world, and amongst different races of a particular country. In the same country there are so many social codes and social usages. Whom to follow? Which one is absolute? Which one is perfect? What is a common person to do? A very knotty problem.

And they think if a particular intellectual supports the view of another intellectual &ndash; well, it is rather an insultation to support others!

<a name="27..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject of discourse is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Moks&#x301;a. While speaking of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a stresses the role of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; as being subordinate to Him, of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; being subservient to Ishvara. Only those who surrender themselves to His protection and guidance can overcome its bounds. Just as northbound travellers have to keep the pole star before their eyes, the passenger on the path of liberation from Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; will have to keep the Lord as his or her goal. No other physical or mental compass is potent enough to guide one&#146;s progress on this path, the path of Dharma. That is why it is said that there is only one Dharma &ndash; the way towards the Absolute.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and the Creation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;? When Parama Purus&#x301;a (Cognitive Principle) desires to create something, the Shakti (force) required is known as Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. As such, one of the important characteristics of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is its plasticity. It is equally clear that since Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is the force behind creation, if the Cognitive Principle had not desired to create anything, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; would have had no manifestation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What is it that made Him create and thus make the manifestation of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; possible? The traditionally upheld cause and effect theory cannot answer this question, for the theory works and holds good only in the expressed world (i.e., the universe after it has been created). Thus once the seed and the tree are there as a part of the expressed world, the cause and effect theory recognizes the seed as the cause and the tree as the effect. But why was the seed or the tree originally created is a problem beyond its scope. Thus the cause and effect theory does not go beyond the expressed world. Now action which is beyond cause and effect is Liila&#x301;. To differentiate further, action which is governed by the cause and effect theory is known as Krd&#x301;a. All His creation is Liila&#x301;. Hence the manifestation of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; in the expressed world too is His Liila&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..5"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Jiivas<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; influences the Jiiva in a number of ways. In His creation of the world, it is not the Citi Shakti that works. Instead, when ordered by Him, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is the force which works. Here it is known as Visn&#x301;u ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When human beings experience His attraction from Antahkarana the feeling that something is to be done is generated in them. This is also done by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and here it is known as Yogama&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Apart from these forms, Maya&#x301; works in the Jiiva in two other forms &ndash; as Vishva ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and as An&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301;. The fundamental stuff or matter used in His creation is Himself. In this process of creation, the Cognitive Principle crudifies Himself into this expressed world with the use of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301;. But the essential element, the fundamental stuff is He. However, the Jiiva does not have the capacity to see Him in this creation. A person sees a pot as a pot, a forest as a forest and so on. This is the work of Vishvama&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The sum of manifested Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; in the universe is known as Ma&#x301;ha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Now, it is observed that individuals can create the same things in their minds which are expressed outside and are seen in this expressed world. They can create a whole world in their minds, according to their fancy, and can enjoy pain or pleasure from it. Such vicarious living is found especially in persons of advanced age. This is the work of An&#x301;uma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->It must never be overlooked however that despite its various forms, it is His Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and that He is the Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;dhis&#x301;ha. Therefore, if the individual starts a fight against Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, he or she cannot succeed. This is amply confirmed by the fact that you cannot effectively indulge in the suppression or repression of a certain Bha&#x301;va for long, ultimately it overpowers you, because the more you try to suppress it the greater becomes the force with which it rebounds. If crude ideas come into your mind, you are not crude or bad &ndash; it is natural for them to come. But mental or psychic suppression or repression of these is not profitable for Sa&#x301;dhakas. Instead the correct and psychological approach to Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is to channelize it in the direction of the Absolute. For in this expressed world, you cannot overpower Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; because she has a much greater power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The central problem of reconciling the earthly duties of human beings with their progress towards the absolute thus crops up. The answer lies in the fact that this world is a relative truth. Human beings should not become slaves to it but should use it properly. However, as mind is engaged in it while using it, one may tend to crudify both in the mind and hence, in the body. This would hamper movement towards the Absolute which is the subtlest entity. The way out is to bring in the ideation of the Absolute. In other words, you should realize that while living in the expressed crude world, you do not work for the worldly things but for Him and with Him, because He is the essential element, the fundamental stuff out of which this world has been created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and the Absolute<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->On the other hand, those who run away from this material world to escape Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; only deceive themselves. For with the help of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, they will be led to Him, as Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has a close relation with the Absolute. What is this relation?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has three gun&#x301;as &ndash; operative principles through which it works &ndash; viz., Sattvagun&#x301;a (sentient principle), Rajogun&#x301;a (mutative principle) and Tamogun&#x301;a (static principle). They work and lie in an ascending order on the road to the Absolute. The sentient principle (Sattvagun&#x301;a) has the capacity to take the sa&#x301;dhaka very near Him (Nira&#x301;ka&#x301;ra Brahma) by making the mind more and more subtle. But there still lies a gap between this point and Nira&#x301;ka&#x301;ra Brahma. This gap is known as Bha&#x301;va or Bha&#x301;vasa&#x301;gar. This gap can only be negotiated with the help of devotion. Thus we see that Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, channelized properly (in its sentient operating principle) can take the Sa&#x301;dhaka to a point very near Ishvara, from which point the domain of devotion begins. An interesting illustration is afforded by the following story. Three thieves, Mr. Sattvagun&#x301;a, Mr. Rajogun&#x301;a and Mr. Tamagun&#x301;a once waylaid a man with some money in a dark forest. Though all agreed to pocket the money, Mr. Tamogun&#x301;a also desired to murder the man. The other two, however, would not agree to this. Mr. Rajogun&#x301;a declared that the man be left alone to fend for himself in the dark. Mr. Sattvagun&#x301;a was more charitable. He led the unfortunate man all the way to the outskirts of the city. But after a point on the road he bade farewell and would not go into the lighted street for fear of being caught by the police. Therefore we arrive at the paradox that Mukti (i.e. freedom from the bondage of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;) can be achieved not by a fight against Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, but rather through its help.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Different kinds of Sa&#x301;dhakas inhabit this world. Some ardently desire Mukti, while others do not. The latter base their choice on the reasoning that by becoming one with Iishvara, the Sa&#x301;dhaka loses the pleasure of being next to Him and harbouring Him as one&#146;s sole bha&#x301;va in work, service and sacrifice. Little do they know that this very ideation of the Cosmic world leads them to Mukti, for their minds have Him as their object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The best and highest Sa&#x301;dhaka and Bhakta, however, surrenders the decision on this question to Ishvara. The ideation that he or she embraces is: &ldquo;I am at your disposal. It is up to you to plan what you like for me&rdquo;. Theirs is the wisdom to foresee that complete surrender alone, which is the essence of the highest Bhakti, will enable them to sail the Bha&#x301;vasagar unto His feet.<!-- /block --></p>

For worshiping, both the person who worships and the person who is worshiped must be present. Hence as long as there remains a difference between the devotee and God, there is the opportunity and necessity of Bhakti-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="29..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word &ldquo;Para&#x301;nurakti&rdquo; should be considered. Rakti denotes Raga or attachment. Anurakti means maintaining attachment with or being attracted by a particular entity after having understood its meaning. Anurakti is of two kinds. The Anurakti for the Supreme Brahma or Infinite Cosmic Consciousness is Para&#x301;nurakti. The Anurakti for Brahma under the sway of Prakrti or the Anurakti for the crude manifestations is termed Apara&#x301;nurakti. God is an object for Para&#x301;nurakti. When the aspirant considers the Supreme Brahma to be his or her own, it is termed Bhajana&#x301; or Bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The two varieties of Anurakti exist only on account of the introverting or extroversial actions of the mind; that is extroversion denotes Apara&#x301;nurakti, while introversion denotes Para&#x301;nurakti. The externalizing forces subordinate a person to the sense organs and render him or her crude. Such a person is divested of his or her spiritual force. Para&#x301;nurakti on the other hand releases a person from the grips of the Indriyas and through sublime meditations establishes him or her in the finer sublimated senses, in the infinite blessedness beyond the bounds of the Universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now the question arises as to whether Bhakti is natural or unnatural for the living beings. All the things we see in the manifested Universe, whether they be conscious or crude, have attraction for one another. This attraction is the Dharma of the created Universe and as a consequence the continuity of the thought projections of the Cosmic Mind is maintained. Therefore, I say that attraction is natural for everything. It is due to the attractions for one another amongst myriads of heavenly bodies oscillating in the infinite space that balance is maintained in the firmament. In every planet or sub-planet, there is the effort for self-preservation. People run and assemble at a place which yields good water, good fruits and fertile lands, because they find adequate materials for self-preservation. The bee flies around the flowers in quest of honey for the sake of preserving its existence. Every entity runs more towards that which is more lasting and secure and which will provide it with greater and longer safety. People run after money because they believe that they can maintain their lives under the shelter of money, that money alone can save them. They do not know that money can provide neither a permanent stability nor securely founded shelter. During the span of one&#146;s life money will come and go several times. At times its glamour will dazzle our eyes and at other times the lack of money will make one cry from hunger. Not only money, but all finite objects have this characteristic. One uses finite objects with the intention of enjoying only one of their portions, then sooner or later the residue will be reached. That which is finite cannot permanently remain the object of your enjoyment or your permanent resort. The existence of all these things is dependent on other things &ndash; bounded by the limits of time, place and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In philosophical terms the attraction for finite objects is called A&#x301;sakti and the attraction for the infinite is Bhakti. Ra&#x301;ga or Rakti means both the attraction for the infinite and attraction for the finite objects. &ldquo;Sakasmae parampremaru&#x301;pa&#x301;,&rdquo; that is, Bhakti is the symbol of love and this love is dedicated towards Iishvara, signified by the letter &ldquo;ka&rdquo;. In the vedic language the letter &ldquo;Ka&rdquo; means God. God is indescribable. God is the nucleus of the Universe and is supreme love personified.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="29..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. Where a change in Purus&#x301;a occurs on account of the influence of Prakrti, the mind comes into being. The senses and organs are the recipients and the vehicles of the workings of the mind; so the mind is the worldly knower or subject of all worldly acts. The mind is the object of the untainted knowing Purus&#x301;a, and Purus&#x301;a is its subject or knowing self. When the mind as an object merges into Purus&#x301;a as the subject, distinction between the object and the subject ceases to exist. This is the supreme state of the aspirant. However when the mind is guided by Avidya&#x301;, that is, when it a seeks enjoyment in the finite objects, then, that externalized energy of the mind is ultimately identified with the crude object. This is so whether this object is a creation of the mind itself or is taken from the crude quinquelemental world.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="29..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Pure Bhakti cannot be based on finite objects since the very existence of finite objects is derived from extroverted feelings. Nevertheless, I painfully observe that many people confine their love and devotion to finite objects and as a result they do not attain the pervasiveness which love confers. They do not realize that every tiny atom of this vast universe is a creative manifestation of Cosmic Consciousness &ndash; God&#146;s grand expression. They spend millions on the installation of idols and do not relent on seeing the afflictions of suffering humanity. They don&#146;t hesitate when killing in cold blood a young goat for the so-called satiation of a goddess.<!-- /block --></p>

The name and form of objects undergo changes with the change in time and place. The child changes into a youth, the youth into an old person, and the old person into a dead person. Wise people take every object of the world as the expression of one and single Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and are not be affected by pain or pleasure when they witness changes in the name and form of any particular object.

They are Sa&#x301;ttvika Sa&#x301;dhakas, in as much as they do not seek attainment of the Supreme. However, this Sa&#x301;ttvika Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is not a superior degree of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or the Supreme Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, because none of the above control the energies of the aspirant and direct them towards the adored, the Supreme Brahma. The aim of the aspirant is channelized in a different direction and he or she carries on with an inferior object. All the three such Bhaktas &ndash; Sa&#x301;ttvika, Ra&#x301;jasika and Ta&#x301;masika are Gaon&#x301;ii or inferior Bhakti. Where there is no object other than the Supreme Brahma, it is called Mukhya Bhakti. In Mukhya&#x301; Bhakti There the aspirant is free from the three gun&#x301;as. He or she is absorbed in spiritual practices to Nirgun&#x301;a Bhakti. In general then, Bhakti can be classified into many groups according to the object in view.<!-- /block --></p>

This attainment is known by the name of Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;namishra&#x301; Bhakti. This Bhakti also may be classed as Nirgun&#x301;a Bhakti, but due to the dormant vanity for wealth or knowledge, the supreme state is not attained. This is also called Pradha&#x301;nibhuta Bhakti.

This is the culmination of Bhakti, it is the highest pitch of Bhakti. If there is undivided knowledge with the object, then there exists one and only one entity, and that is why it is called Kevala&#x301; Bhakti.

<a name="29..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Bha&#x301;va is that whereby the Citta or mind-stuff becomes purged and is chiefly dominated by Sattvagun&#x301;a. Where all the ten directions become brilliant with the rays of the sun of love and the taste or anurakti for the Lord gets enlightened, then the Citta develops oneness with Him. As a result of this Bha&#x301;va, human beings direct their natural attractive tendencies towards the adored. The adored, however is not outside them, but is the life of their life, the mind of their mind and the life master of their entire existence. When this feeling of devotion for the adored awakens the introversion of one&#146;s tendencies, then one becomes absorbed in this Bha&#x301;va. One attains the state of realizing the self. In Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava philosophy this running into one&#146;s own self is known as Hla&#x301;dinii Shakti because in this path there is a progressive refulgence of the light of mellifluous realizations.<!-- /block --></p>

That is why, you are unable to reach the Parama Purus&#x301;a or the Cosmic Consciousness with the help of your mind. Your mind will have to come back disappointed repeatedly, if it tries to reach Him, for He is beyond the reach of your imaginative power. You cannot get to Him through any common knowledge.

Just as intellectual and scientific vision is necessary for seeing molecules and atoms, similarly spiritual vision is necessary for seeing the Supreme Brahma, i.e., He is attainable only through spiritual knowledge.

The one that you see as an ordinary man by your external sight, is actually a conscious entity, if you see him with your internal sight. The one that you see to be an animal or an inanimate object by your superficial sight, is really a sentient entity, if you apply your internal sight. That is why, I say, in order to see Him, one has to go deep into the seen object. He is deep &ndash; very deep and its is due to this intrinsicality that He abides in all the entities in an immutable form. While going to see Him in this state of supreme unicity, all distinctions of superficial objects thin away into air.

He abides in the innermost recess or the fundamental intellect as its Supreme Knower. He is the vital Entity of that cavity &ndash; that sense of ego, which is within you and that is why, He has been called &ldquo;caverned&rdquo; (Guha&#x301;hita).

Mind is the perceiver of pleasure and pain, but Brahma is even above the supramental stage. In order to attain Him you have got to outstep the limit of your mind and along with it you will have to leave behind all the pleasurable and sufferable junks of your distorted mind. He is ancient &ndash; He is beyond the scope of time. To Him the spatial, temporal and personal reputations are of no value, for each of these is a particular manifestation of the mind. You cannot possess Him through your worldly erudition or by the stamp of your degrees and diplomas for all worldly knowledge is subject to, time, space and person. Being spontaneous or self-manifest in spiritualism, He is not dependent on any second worldly entity. To achieve that Brahma who is the supreme goal of spirituality, one has to take recourse to spiritual sacrifice (Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;). Not with the eyes of others &ndash; not with the spectacles of others, you will &ldquo;see&rdquo; Him within you with your own &ldquo;eyes&rdquo;. You will move inward, not on any other vehicle but by virtue of your own inspirational propulsion. A calm and collected individual, who is a genuine spiritual aspirant, attains Brahma in this very manner and with the attainment of Brahma one goes beyond the reach of pleasure and pain &ndash; one does not have those mental distortions like pleasure and pain. He attains a state which is called the state of supreme bliss.<!-- /block --></p>

By dint of this intuitional science man learns to understand thoroughly what is temporal and what is eternal. The scriptures call this power of understanding the eterno-temporal discrimination (Nityanitya&#x301; viveka). You will accept only the eternal and shun the temporal. It is on the strength of this intuitional science that man knows what is mortal and what is immortal, i.e., who or which is liable to destruction and who or which is established in indestructibility. With the help of this Nitya&#x301;nitya Viveka &ndash; this discriminating judgment about mortality and immortality, man pursues the path of virtue. What is the dharma or the characteristic of the living beings? It is the endeavour to attain happiness. Why does a living being crave for happiness? For self-preservation. Why do you eat and drink? To keep yourself alive &ndash; to attain happiness. From this you very well understand this too, that to love whatever little is lasting within your present entity &ndash; whatever is its essence, is your dharma. This dharma or sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; teaches you to keep your subtlest self aloof from all transitory objects, as the result of which your eternal self gets healthy nourishments - gets more and more developed on the path of progress. That is why, this true sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the self is defined in the scriptures as the path of nourishment (pus&#x301;t&#x301;ima&#x301;rga). He who does not understand or recognize this true dharma or characteristic, verily regards the body as the sole factor. I don&#146;t criticize those mentally undeveloped creatures, who regard their bodies as the summum bonum of their lives but for human beings to entertain such thoughts is nothing short of paying the mind a left-handed compliment. The funniest part of it is that such a person flouts the mind with the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->A display of such a perverse mentality we come across in the Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka philosophy. To them the transitory body is the supreme entity. The materialists are reluctant to give any importance to the mind in their philosophy. Not only that, they very often even hesitate to clearly admit mind&#146;s apperception or self-consciousness. Yet these materialists sometimes want to publicize themselves as pragmatists or behaviourists. They want to say that they will not tread the path of logic and reasoning, for in that path people &ldquo;make a day of night and a night of day&rdquo; - &ldquo;We are simple, toiling folk. We want to pass our days in peace with food to eat and clothes to wear and behind this simple demand the Supportology (!) or Practicology (!) that exists is our philosophy.&rdquo; Even by making such observation they get caught in their own net.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the practical field the utility of things is determined by the mind. The feasibility of the codes of procedure and conduct is also determined by the mind. &ldquo;To live in peace with food to eat and clothes to wear&rdquo; is also done for the satisfaction of mind. And above all, no matter what &ldquo;logy&rdquo; or &ldquo;ism&rdquo; is propounded, the supporting doctrine &ndash; the Supportology (!), must depend on imaginativeness (mental sanction). Every mental disease or every spiritual disease is not Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da or illusionism. Even by keeping contact between the earthy world and the human mind, spiritual philosophy can be established. Ananda Marga is a philosophy of this type.<!-- /block --></p>

Some identify the astral minds like atima&#x301;nasa, vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya and hiran&#x301;yamaya kos&#x301;as with it, but the real preceptor, possessed of the knowledge of the divine truth, from whom you will learn the Brahmic or intuitional knowledge, will make you understand that the soul is a lot subtler than these Kos&#x301;as or shells of the mind, each of which is mutable and so evanescent or transitory - the soul alone is eternal. So the happiness that you will get in the worship of the spiritual knowledge, will be permanent happiness, and that is why it is called A&#x301;nanda or divine bliss. A&#x301;nanda is not to be had from transitory objects. The transitory or temporal objects will come and go; sometimes they will make you laugh and sometimes they will make you cry. No matter how endearing the temporal things be, one day they will surely and undoubtedly leave you in the lurch, and abjectly beggarly. But He will not make you wail He is an eternal, non-evolutive, immutable Entity. The Yama said, &ldquo;O Naciketa&#x301;, the broad gateway to the realm of God lies open before you. One who has acquired a thorough knowledge of mortal objects, has verily acquired the knowledge of the both the perishable and the imperishable ones.&rdquo; With the development of mental faculties as one proceeds from the transient happiness to permanent happiness or A&#x301;nanda, one gets more and more inclined towards his mental happiness in preference to the physical joy. For the love of country or many such subtle happinesses, a person makes no bones to lay down his life. These are actually the signs of preponderance of the human mind. The happiness of cats and dogs is purely physical. In such receptacles as their mental happiness cannot have the priority. Beat them and then call them to eat some delectable food, they will come running after it. But human beings are reluctant to stand the least dishonour or any little blow to their mind. A person who serves you under circumstantial pressure and keeps your mind constantly humored by his sycophancy, is actually at heart not very pleased with you. He constantly tries to escape the bondage of slavery. You cannot conquer human mind through circumstantial pressure.<!-- /block --></p>

In this seity &ndash; in this characteristic self he/she gets real A&#x301;nanda. So, I say, learn the intuitional knowledge from a proper preceptor. You cannot learn this through empirical knowledge. Intuitional knowledge cannot be gained from books. For this one has to go to a preceptor with devotion and reverence.

At the time of an earthquake a mother runs out of the house, leaving her sleeping child in bed and then half way down when the thought of her child arises in her mind, she runs back again to save her child. The quicker the mother&#146;s remembrance of her child, the less her attraction for her own body. A mother who is above such attraction will think of her child first and take it away along with her.

His existence is beyond the precincts of life and death. How is birth possible of an entity, who is supra-temporal? When will He take birth? Aren&#146;t place and person necessary for a life to be born? That which is the Absolute Truth, can never be subject to time, space or person. That is why, the soul is free from birth and death. Death occurs to relative entities, not to consciousness. No birth is possible for the one, which is immutable, i.e., which has no second existence, and such an impeccable entity cannot be anything but the soul. The natural tendencies of worldly objects are: The death of one brings about the birth of another, the renunciation of one form begets the formation of another, the loss of one means the gain of another. In this endless process of building and re-building of the successive order the one that remains, we call, new or the new-born. We cannot call Brahma new, for He is not the effect of any previous cause. Through this process of building and re-building the whimsical hand of time has not been able to touch Him, for He is birthless, eternal and sempiternal aeon. Through the destruction of this physical body, i.e., through its metamorphosis He is neither destroyed, nor gets transformed.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->This A&#x301;tma&#x301;, or Soul, which is indestructible &ndash; which is immortal &ndash; is smaller than the molecule or atom, smaller than the small ultra-microscopic. Due to its smallness you cannot feel it with your sensory power. In the language of science, if you take molecule as the English equivalent of An&#x301;u, you will find a series of other things, even smaller than the atom, like proton, neutron, electron, etc., which are too subtle for your senses to grasp. Apprehension is possible only through the power of imagination. If you further try to analyse them, your imagination will stop functioning or will be compelled to get engrossed in a deep reverie. On the last Pha&#x301;lgun&#x301;ii Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301; (the full-moon of the month of Phalguna) I told you that the apprehending capacity of your organs for the small and the big things was limited. The organ concerned can apprehend only a particular wave-length, i.e., from one particular point of movement to another particular point, neither more nor less. Just as the soul is the molecule of the molecule on one hand, similarly it is greater than the great on the other. This being ultrasensual, you cannot apprehend it as it is. Just as you cannot see things properly in a dim light, similarly a blazing light dazzles your vision and you cannot see either. The soul abides in your mental horizon as the knower of your world of imagination and as the certifying witness or your existence. If you direct your sentimental entity towards Its great sentiment, then your emotion or thought, being on the higher plane, loses its pettiness. Your existence then is hardly distinguishable from It. If you direct your sentimental entity towards Its micro-atomic sentiment, then also your mind goes out of action. If you cherish the sentiment of attaining Him, you will have to be devoid of all sensuous desires by carefully and deftly bringing under control the selfish, individualistic frivolities of your mind. In such an event you attraction for the finite objects will disappear. You will bask in the sunshine of Macrocosmic favour. Your mind will then be installed in the super-celestial region of abiding tranquillity beyond the pale of weal or woe. Then alone you will be free from grief &ndash; then alone you will realize that Grand Glorious Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

In your mind you go out to London or America in a jiffy. But who actually goes there? Your objective mind of course &ndash; the mind, which is His object. Along with the mental travel to and fro, His knowership also remains, does it not? Now you understand that, inwardly and on His own, He goes on traversing distant and yet more distant countries. When the mind sleeps i.e., when the organs are inactive and all epithymetic actions (desires) are also at a standstill, He is supposed to be asleep also in the mind, isn&#146;t He? Well, does He have any movement? Yes, of course He has His movements. He is the Omneity &ndash; the all knowing seed. Even without an object He maintains His Supreme Existence. So you see, you cannot bind him with a single strand of quality. He imbibes different contrary attributes. Your mind, however, cannot have two contrary qualities like the refulgence of pleasure and the shadow of pain simultaneously. His mind being free from any singular bondage. He alone has been able to become the ultimate refuge of all kinds of contradictory objects. He is the wonderful conglomeration of pride and non-pride. The Yama said, &ldquo;None but I can attain Him&rdquo;. Yama means controller. The Yama is the prototype of restraint. Really speaking, without &ldquo;Yama&rdquo; or regulated sadhana, it is impossible to attain Him. A&#x301;tma or Soul is not attainable by one devoid of control. You will certainly realize the significance of this observation after you have pursued the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for some time. But then I have already told you many a time and I repeat again that restraint does not mean running away, giving up everything. Adequate and proper use of everything is what is called restraint. You can honour adequately every obligation of domestic life but you must never lose your head. When the animal instinct of hunger is there, you must eat but you must not invite a disease by taking excessive food out of greed.<!-- /block --></p>

He has neither a body nor a receptacle. It just cannot be nor is there any need for it. But how about these countless fragmentary manifestations which do have their bodies and yet they are His manifestations and are all within Him? Yes, that is the reason why He is the possessor of countless bodies, being bodiless Himself. The spiritual entity is not subject to any time, place or person, but the finite unit entities are their cooperative creations. He, being beyond their purview, i.e., outside the scope of mind, is absolutely free from all sorts of mental modifications of pleasure and pain. So one who identifies oneself with Him after attaining Him, becomes free from all sorts of pain. His mind gets stilled. He merges in the Macrocosmic Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>

For the benefit and salvation of human beings, He has been teaching Him through the media of limitless forms. So the existence of every created thing in this world has its value &ndash; has its mundane as well as spiritual utility. None is useless &ndash; none is a burden on the world. Knowingly or unknowingly all are working together as one beautiful team and one mind for the collective good of all. All are beaming in their self-surging glory. The giver knows the efficacy of charity, since the receiver is there. The advanced person is getting an opportunity to serve, since the backward man is there. He has evolved so many forms as per necessity. In each of these forms we see the different contours of His love, get scope for learning many things and are getting impetus to move towards Him. His radiance is being refracted through the veins and venules, molecules and atoms of every evolved object. Treating every microcosmic tendency as His own object for the good of the world, He has been afflicting Himself day in and day out with the painful affliction of their lives &ndash; suffering for them, and His diverse, manifested organisms are bowing down in reverence to His glory. All the loquacity of these ignorant beings is getting silenced before His exalted greatness. What a non-sa&#x301;dhaka regards as his or her wealth, son, husband etc., are in the eyes of a sa&#x301;dhaka, but the waves or the brilliant, activated expressions of the Cosmic Sea, wherein the sa&#x301;dhaka feels himself/herself consciously installed. He knows that the very Sea, in which or on whose breast those expressions are waking up and dozing off, is to him the Truth itself &ndash; has been making the beauty of his soul more charming every moment by encompassing him form all the ten directions. In that Sea of Love he has fearlessly laid afloat the heavy onus of his own entity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->The Supreme dharma &ndash; the paramount act, of merging one&#146;s self in the Absolute Entity in full realization of Its charm, will not be accomplished by mere listening to religious dissertations. You must have noticed, there are many people in our society that constantly keep track of great men and run up to them soliciting, &ldquo;Give us some advice. Tell us something about religion.&rdquo; Such religious discourses will cut no ice, if not substantiated by sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. It is wrong to think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is realizable by man through empirical knowledge or through study of a few dozens of philosophical books, rather, there is a greater possibility of one&#146;s receding from the path of spirituality. In such a case vanity becomes the chief characteristic of his nature. Brahma or the Supreme Entity cannot be attained through tall religious overtures to the human society nor through interesting recapitulations before it as to which and which great man said such and such things &ndash; as to how they walked, or through writing volumes of books. Do not entertain such silly ideas that you can hit the bull&#146;s eye so cheaply by dint of your intellect, for you shall not achieve Him through such shady means. To attain Brahma you shall have to do Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual meditation. You should make Him the only goal of your life. For this you require integrity, devotion and singular and earnest love for Him. He is not attainable without reverence and unflagging and unflinching devotion. When the devotional depth will come, love, too, will be out-brimming with high sentiments - will be full and over-flowing. When love will reach its completeness &ndash; its saturation point, self-immolation will become easy and simple. In that state alone will come your final realization of the Supreme Consciousness. Where &ldquo;I&rdquo; is, &ldquo;He&rdquo; is not&#8230; where &ldquo;He&rdquo; is, &ldquo;I&rdquo; is not. Remember, devotion is the pre-requisite of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Maturity of devotion is love and maturity of love is He.<!-- /block --></p>

In such a state no one can attain Brahma. When the mind preoccupied with finite objects, can one get the integrated whole? When your longing is towards the crude, you will undoubtedly become crudified yourself. Your mind will leap from one crude desire to another - will run form one object after another in a wild pursuit. Such is the way of the materialistic, isn&#146;t it? But an aspirant, being in the midst of all and making the right use of everything, proceeds towards the supreme goal. Learn the Intuitional Science from the competent preceptor and proceed accordingly.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma (or the Supreme, unsubjectivated Pure Consciousness) is your supreme goal. Even Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (the Subjectivated Transcendentality) is devoured by Nirgun&#x301;a. The Brahma-Sa&#x301;dhaka knows that Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, who is a composite of cognitive faculty and operative principle &ndash; a combination of introversive consciousness and introversive force, eventually turns into food for the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. That is to say, with His death all His feelings and emotions also disappear and so death serves as ghee (clarified butter) for the ultimate food of the Nirgun&#x301;a. Just as flour alone does not make a good food by itself and it requires ghee to make eatable, similarly the ghee-like death makes the Consciousness-cum-principle like food delectable and palatable to the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. So I say that this death too is a benevolent system. When the overall sentiment (the subjectivated and objectivated state) of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma merges in the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, that is to say, when a Sa&#x301;dhaka attains salvation, soleness or absolute identity with the Divine Essence, i.e., final liberation, all the onus of his ego lightens. Prakrti, the xylem or the root or plastic cause of creation, can no more throw him into the pit of pleasure and pain. So in order to attain Him &ndash; whom you cannot attain through empirical or worldly knowledge anyhow &ndash; get busy and be up and doing from this very moment and get proper guidance from a proper preceptor.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="32..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->When things had become intolerable for the people, they approached Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, still tied to the tree, and recounted their miseries, requesting Him to do something. Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u pleaded helplessness, as He Himself was in a precarious condition! Then the devotees reminded the Lord that He had given the boon of immortality to Gaya&#x301;sura in the physical realm only. The devotees urged Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u to use His psychic and spiritual power to defeat Gaya&#x301;sura, and relieve the people of their miseries. Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u assured them that He would do something in the matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->When Gaya&#x301;sura returned to Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u to offer his prayers, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u said, &ldquo;Gaya&#x301;sura! I once gave you what you asked, and you have defeated me. You should now give me a boon.&rdquo; Gaya&#x301;sura readily agreed to it. Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u then asked that Gaya&#x301;sura be turned into stone. Gaya&#x301;sura had no alternative but to say, &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Gradually Gaya&#x301;sura&#146;s legs started turning to stone. When he was stone up to his waist, he said, &ldquo;Wait! I have three conditions!&rdquo; His first condition was that the Lord put His two feet in Gaya&#x301;sura&#146;s heart. The Lord agreed to it, but asked the reason for such a condition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Gaya&#x301;sura said, &ldquo;So that people should know that the feet of the Lord are always in the heart of a devotee, good or bad.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The second condition was that all those who had the Lord&#146;s feet in their hearts would surely get liberation. The Lord agreed to this also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The third and last condition of the almost petrified Gaya&#x301;sura was, &ldquo;If even a single person having the Lord&#146;s feet in his heart fails to get liberation, then this petrified Gaya&#x301;sura will again become a living Gaya&#x301;sura.&rdquo; Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u agreed to it. Very soon Gaya&#x301;sura was turned completely into stone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->This story, from one of the Pura&#x301;n&#x301;as [ancient scriptures] has the following three lessons for humanity. First, the Lord will seat Himself in the heart of the devotee without bothering Himself about the nature of that person, good, or bad. It is enough to be a devotee, in order to have the Lord inside. Second, all those who have the Lord&#146;s feet in their hearts are bound to get liberation &ndash; liberation is a sure guarantee for them. Third, since Gaya&#x301;sura had been turned to stone by the Lord, and since He would again arise if anyone having the Lord inside failed to be liberated, the Lord would have to grant liberation to all such persons for all time to come; it is a matter of the Lord&#146;s prestige!<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Virtue and vice are temporal entities. These things have nothing to do so far as a person&#146;s relationship with the Supreme Father is concerned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Suppose several boys are moving along a particular road and one particular boy falls into the drain. His dress, his body, become dirty; other people, passers-by, will laugh at him, but when the boy&#146;s father sees his boy in that condition, what is he to do? Will he laugh at his own son? No, no, no. What will he do? He himself will go there, into the drain, and take his boy in his own lap, and clean his dress, clean his clothes, clean his body; and after that he will say, &ldquo;My boy, you should walk carefully.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sinning persons are just like those boys in the drain. Now, high or low, upgraded or degraded, all are equal, all are equal for Him, because heaven is His creation, and hell is His creation. If we say that He is only in heaven, it will not be a correct utterance, because He is in hell also. His sons, His daughters, are never alone. He is with you even in hell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What are you to do? You are always to remember that you are the child of a Great Father. You must not think that you are a sinner, you are a degraded person. If you think that you are a sinner, it means you are meditating on sin! And when sin has become your object of meditation, actually you will become a sinner, because a person becomes just like his or her object of ideation, object of meditation. If you always meditate on sin, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner,&rdquo; actually you will become a sinner. The psychological approach is, you should forget it &ndash; even if you are actually a sinner, you should think, &ldquo;I am the son of a Great Father, I am the son of a Great Father, I am the son of a Great Father.&rdquo; And thus you are meditating on the Great Father, and a day is sure to come when you will become one with your Great Father. But to think, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner, oh Father, save me, oh Father, save me,&rdquo; is a defective approach! You should say, &ldquo;I am your son, I am your daughter, oh Father, take me on your lap, I am your son, I am your daughter.&rdquo; This will be the approach. You should forget what you do not want.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now in the phase of creation, the first point of creation is called Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga. Liun&#x32D;ga means &ldquo;the point, the supreme point, the terminus of all expressions, all movements&rdquo;. And that terminus is a singular entity. In the phase of extrovert, it is the starting-point, and in the phase of introvert, it is the culminating point. It is the Supreme Desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->At this starting-point, wherefrom the first expression takes place in the first phase of creation, what happens? In that triangle of forces, triangle of principles, sentient, mutative and static, what happens due to their intertransmutation? All of a sudden the triangle becomes unbalanced, and the released resultant force comes out from one of the vertices of the triangle. There are three vertices, and it comes out from one of the vertices. And the point from which this extroversial force comes out is called Shambhu&#x301;. In the phase of extrovert, in the phase of creation, it is Shambhu&#x301;; and in the phase of introvert also it is Shambhu&#x301;. In the phase of creation it is the starting point, it is the fundamental positivity. It is the fundamental positivity because in it lies the seed of all creation. And in the phase of introvert, it is the Supreme Desideratum, because here in this point all the aspirations, all the hopes, all the desires, of all living beings terminate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Similarly, in the unit structure, in each and every unit structure, there is a starting-point, a microscopic expression of Shambhu&#x301; in the entire Macrocosm. That is, in the entire Cosmological order there is a Shambhu&#x301; point, the starting-point, and similarly, in the unit expression, in the microcosm, there is Shambhu&#x301; in miniature form, in microcosmic form, controlling the microcosm. And it is this point [crown of the head], the controlling point of the pineal gland. It is the site of Parama Purus&#x301;a, Paramashiva. And in the phase of creation, while Shambhu&#x301; is the starting-point, the last point of creation, the crudest point, is called Svayambhu&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Shambhu&#x301; and Svayambhu&#x301;. In Sanskrit, sham means &ldquo;to control&rdquo;, and bhu&#x301; means [&ldquo;created&rdquo;]. So shambhu&#x301; means &ldquo;the controller, self-created controller&rdquo;. And Svayambhu&#x301; &ndash; svayam means &ldquo;self&rdquo;, [so svayambhu&#x301; means] &ldquo;self-created&rdquo;. But it is not the controller, because it is the crudest point. It is the last point, the crudest point.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, wherever there is any expression or wherever there is no expression, the Witnessing Entity is there, just like the light of a stage, a theatrical stage. When there is an actor, the light is there, witnessing the activities of the actor. The actor says something, recites something, and the light of the stage witnesses the activities of that particular actor. And when a singer comes, that light witnesses the activities of the singer. A dancer comes, and that very light witnesses the activities of the dancer. And when nobody is present &ndash; no actor, no dancer, no singer &ndash; the light, that very light, witnesses that &ldquo;Nobody is present here now.&rdquo; It expresses the fact before the audience, before the spectators, that there is nobody on the stage. Similarly, where there is expression, that Cosmic Light, that Cosmic Father, is there. And where there is no expression, the Father is there to say that nobody is present now &ndash; just like that light of the theatrical stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now in the case of Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, the fundamental positivity from where the creation starts, the Supreme Entity is there. And where the creation terminates, the last point, the crudest point, the Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga &ndash; the Witnessing Entity is there also, the Supreme Father is there also. Now in [Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga], the human entity, the entity of a living being, is in subtlest form, is in purest form, is in unadulterated form. And in Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, in the lowest point, in the lowest bone, of your body, the created being, the living being, is in crudest form. Because of that crudest expression, the living being will also be in crudest form. That is, all one&#146;s divinity, one&#146;s divinity in its entirety, is sleeping there, is in latent form there, in the last bone of the body. That sleeping divinity &ndash; actually it is divinity, but it is sleeping &ndash; is called kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii in Sanskrit, &ldquo;coiled serpentine&rdquo; in English. &ldquo;Coiled serpentine&rdquo;. It is just like a serpentine loop.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now, by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; what is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? Whenever a sa&#x301;dhaka gets his or her own peculiar incantation from his a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya, his or her own mantra to be practised, that sleeping divinity, kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, is aroused by the vibration of that mantra. And by dint of the person&#146;s constant practice, regular practice, what happens? It moves that serpentine loop upward. Its original residence is in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra, the lowermost cakra. Now when the sa&#x301;dhaka by dint of his or her sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, intuitional practice, exalts that kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, and when the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii crosses the sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra, the next higher cakra, the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s feeling, his or her expression, his or her status, is known as sa&#x301;lokya. It is the first stage of sama&#x301;dhi. A sa&#x301;dhaka by constant practice is sure to attain that status. But you know, the yogis say that a sa&#x301;dhaka cannot attain that status without the special favour of the spiritual guru. This is what they say. That stage is called sa&#x301;lokya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;lokya means that the sa&#x301;dhaka feels that in the stratum, or sphere, where he or she is, where that person&#146;s exalted mind is, he or she is not alone; the Supreme Father is also there. This sama&#x301;dhi, where the feeling is that in the stratum, or status, where the person is, that person&#146;s Supreme Father is also there, gives the person very much pleasure. This first pleasure is called sa&#x301;lokya sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Then when this coiled serpentine, sleeping divinity, crosses the man&#x301;ipura cakra, just near the hub, the controlling point, of the pancreas, the person enjoys another sort of pleasure, and that pleasure is called sa&#x301;miipya sama&#x301;dhi. Sa&#x301;miipya is a Sanskrit word. It means &ldquo;proximity&rdquo;. That is, the sa&#x301;dhaka feels his or her proximity to the Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the first stage, the sa&#x301;dhaka felt that the Supreme Father was there in the same status. He is not in the sky, he is everywhere, He is with you. If you are here and He is in the sky, then you are alone here, and He is also alone there. No, no, no, no. In the first phase the feeling was that &ldquo;Where I am, He is also with me.&rdquo; And in the second phase, &ldquo;I have come very close, very near, that Supreme Father; I am in close proximity to the Supreme Progenitor. By dint of my sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the gap between my Father and myself is being bridged.&rdquo; It is the second phase, known as sa&#x301;miipya. Sa&#x301;miipya means &ldquo;proximity&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Then when that sleeping divinity, that kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, crosses the ana&#x301;hata cakra, this plexus, this &ldquo;solar plexus&rdquo; (in Latin), the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s feelings are known as sa&#x301;yujya. Sa&#x301;yujya means &ldquo;in close contact&rdquo;. In Sanskrit sa&#x301;yujya means &ldquo;close contact, just side by side, just touching&rdquo;. In sa&#x301;lokya He is with you. In sa&#x301;miipya you feel the proximity, the nearness. And here in sa&#x301;yujya what do you feel? A tactual experience. You get a tactual experience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Then when by dint of your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the divinity, the sleeping divinity, the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, crosses this point [the throat], one will experience another sort of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a subtler sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, subtler sama&#x301;dhi. And that one is called sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya. In sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya the feeling is &ldquo;I am one with Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am one with Him&rdquo; &ndash; not close contact, but oneness. &ldquo;I am one with the Supreme Progenitor, I am one with the Supreme Cognition.&rdquo; This is sa&#x301;rupya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Then by still more sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, when the sleeping divinity crosses this point [between the eyebrows], the controlling point of the pituitary gland, the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra, the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s feelings, or experiences &ndash; another sort of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, still more high &ndash; are known as sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi in Sanskrit. At that point, the feeling is that &ldquo;I am He;&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;He&rdquo;, these two entities, have become one. &ldquo;I am;&rdquo; but &ldquo;He&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; have coincided.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;He&rdquo;. There is one gap. &ldquo;I am the Supreme Entity, I am the Supreme Entity.&rdquo; There is still the connecting link &ldquo;am&rdquo;. But when &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Supreme Entity&rdquo; coincide, the gap &ldquo;am&rdquo; disappears. &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;Supreme Entity&rdquo;, and the connecting link &ldquo;am&rdquo;. When this will coincide with this, the connecting &ldquo;am&rdquo; will disappear, because there is no gap. &ldquo;I&rdquo; becomes one with &ldquo;He&rdquo;. Clear? Or &ldquo;He&rdquo; becomes one with &ldquo;I&rdquo;. This stage is called sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->And the last stage is when that kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii comes here [crown of the head]. I said that in the unit structure, Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, Parama Purus&#x301;a, is here, at the controlling point of the pineal gland. The divinity, the sleeping divinity, is to be exalted to that point, to the controlling point of the pineal gland. And there is the final stage of sama&#x301;dhi. That final stage of sama&#x301;dhi is called nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi in yoga, and kaevalya in Tantra. In Sanskrit kaevalya means &ldquo;only&rdquo;. Kevala means &ldquo;only&rdquo;, and the noun of kevala is kaevalya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->That is, only one entity exists. That entity may be I, that entity may be He. But the differentiation between &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;He&rdquo; disappears. So &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; and &ldquo;He exists&rdquo; &ndash; these two ideas disappear: &ldquo;exists&rdquo;. That is, it is the stage of non-attributional consciousness. It is the supreme stage of yogic sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. It is the supreme stance for a yogi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Now by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, one is to arouse and exalt that sleeping divinity. That Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga becomes one with Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->But for this one requires divine help. And I know one is sure to get divine help. And I know further that one is getting divine help. And I know still further that in future, for infinite time and infinite space, one will be getting this divine favour. And you are all sa&#x301;dhakas. You will certainly attain that supreme stance and enjoy that divine blessedness. You are sure to enjoy it, my sons and my daughters.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="34..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->To a person of average intelligence, water and ice are two different entities, but one who knows a little of the truth knows that ice is only a crudified form of water. Similarly, where the average person sees a big difference between a pot and the potter, the knower of Brahma sees only oneness between them. Are the world and Brahma two different entities, or are they indivisible? Is the one true, and the other false? Is the difference that appears between the two the truth, or illusion? Such questions or ways of thinking never arise in the mind of a person with Cosmic outlook.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Whether the world and Brahma are two entities, or the one is not different from the other &ndash; such thoughts are wrong in themselves. The knower of Brahma feels that the world is indeed His own manifestation; he knows that all is He. Do you know how that difference looks from the Cosmic perspective? Not any bigger than the difference between &ldquo;person&rdquo; and &ldquo;human being&rdquo;, between &ldquo;sea&rdquo; and &ldquo;ocean&rdquo;. From a sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s [spiritual aspirant&#146;s] standpoint the distinction does not exist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Brahma is the lord of the evolved objects; He is the controller of every one of them. This very Lord moves in the womb as the [foetus] and when it is born, the event, in fact, should be called the birth of Brahma, because all creations are but manifestations of Brahma Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is one moon, but its reflections, falling in countless puddles of water, appear as countless moons. No new moon is born. The same moon is being reflected or is taking birth in many receptacles. Similarly the one and the same Brahma is being manifested as limitless unit entities in countless mental receptacles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The union of a sa&#x301;dhaka with Brahma has been expressed in an excellent [metaphor]. A river gives up its name and identity and completely merges in the sea; thereafter it cannot maintain its own existence, it is the sea. Similarly, a sa&#x301;dhaka, after merging himself or herself in Brahma, can no longer think of himself or herself except as Brahma. Seeing the Ganges River we can tell that it is the water of the Ganges. We can tell the water of the Yamuna River, or the water of the Sarasvati River. But once they merge in the sea, we cannot separate them, nor can we distinguish the one from the other. They all have lost their respective name-entities in the entity of the sea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->When a knower of Truth merges in the Supreme Being, his or her petty sense of existence is lost, and, attaining unity with the Supreme Entity, the person becomes supreme himself or herself. Spiritual practice is the means for the expansion of the soul, not for its annihilation; so sama&#x301;dhi does not mean suicide but self-transcendence. One who has known Brahma becomes Brahma Itself, for the unit entity takes on the very form of its object of ideation. One who has Brahma as his or her object of ideation becomes Brahma Itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->If a salt doll goes to fathom the sea, it will certainly melt and become the sea itself. Similarly, if the knower of Brahma goes to fathom Brahma, he or she merges in the sea of Brahma and becomes Brahma Itself. Be constantly absorbed in the thought of Brahma and you too will become Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Vedas are the unique manifestation of human intellect. The etymological meaning of the word &ldquo;Veda&rdquo; is knowledge. This knowledge is of two types. One type is subject to time, space, and person, and the other is the realization of the self, independent of all subjections. The former is called Relative Knowledge or Apara&#x301;jin&#x301;a&#x301;na, because it is related to objects, and the latter, spiritual Knowledge or para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Here the word, Veda, is of course used in the sense of spiritual knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Last Shra&#x301;van&#x301;ii Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301; I told you some thing from the Shukla-Yajurveda. Today I will tell you something from the Atharva Veda. Learned persons say that there is nothing important in the Atharva Veda. It is only a collection of mantras or incantations about ghosts and spirits, composed by people in prehistoric times. It is up to you to judge the veracity of the opinion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->One day, Vaedarbhi, the son of Bhrgu, asked the learned sage Pippala&#x301;da, &ldquo;My Lord what is Intuitional Science (Brahmavijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na)? What is the relation between Brahma and the world? Please tell me something about them.&rdquo; The sage replied:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ara&#x301;iva rathana&#x301;bhao pra&#x301;n&#x301;e sarvam&#x301; pratis&#x301;t&#x301;itam<br>Rco yaju&#x301;m&#x301;si sa&#x301;ma&#x301;ni yajin&#x32D;ahks&#x301;atram&#x301; Brahma ca.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Just as the spokes are attracted to the hub of a wheel, similarly every object in this universe is Brahma-centric and thus has kept up its individual existence. The nucleus of the Cosmic System is the source of all entities from the highest of created being down to the lowest insect. Rk. (Incantations), Yaju (invocations), Sa&#x301;ma (songs) or the individuals engaged in Viprocita or Ksa&#x301;trocita service (i.e. service befitting a Brahmin or a Ks&#x301;atriya) &ndash; all are dependent on Brahma, the source of their existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Praja&#x301;patishcarasi garbhe tvameva pratija&#x301;yase<br>Tubhyam&#x301; Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a praja&#x301;stiima&#x301; balim&#x301; haranti yah pra&#x301;n&#x301;aeh pratitis&#x301;t&#x301;hasi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word, Praja&#x301;, means evolved objects. Brahma is of course Praja&#x301;pati or the Lord of evolved objects for He is the controller of all of them. Praja&#x301;pati-brahma&#x301; moves about in the womb as the embryo and when it is born, the event, in fact, should actually be called the reflex birth of Brahma instead of His birth, because all created entities are merely manifestations of Brahma Himself. For instance, there is only one moon, but its reflection falling in the countless footprints of cows (Gos&#x301;pada) appears as countless moons. No new moons are created. The same moon is being reflected in several receptacles. Similarly one Brahma is manifesting Himself over an infinite number of units in countless mental receptacles. Brahma is Absolute Bliss. That is why the units or microcosms are always racing with the help of their sensory and motor organs towards their inner selves, i.e. towards the attainment of happiness. So it is said that knowingly or unknowingly the units are moving towards Him to attain Him, filled with inspiration from Him. (Several times in the Atharva Veda the word, &ldquo;Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;, has been used to mean Purus&#x301;a and the word, &ldquo;Rayi&rdquo; to mean Prakrti).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Deva&#x301;na&#x301;masi bahn&#x301;itamah pitrn&#x301;am&#x301; prathama svadha<br>Rs&#x301;iin&#x301;a&#x301;in&#x32D;caritam&#x301; satyamatharva&#x301;ungirasa&#x301;masi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Here the word, Deva, means the carrier of sensations, i.e., organs and nerves. Through the organs and nerves the body expresses a sensation or feeling and that is why they are called Devas or gods of the microcosmic body. But these organs and nervous systems are completely dependent on the spine for their existence and functions. Sensation is transmitted along the spine and that is why without a spine the unit would be a motionless, inert, fleshy mass. The above Shloka declares that, what spine is to the unit, Brahma is to the universe. Without Brahma the universe would be utterly destroyed, the seed of the imagination would be completely obliterated. According to an ancient custom, the death rites in honor of the deceased used to be performed by using Svadha&#x301; mantra (i.e., an invocation chanted while offering a sacrifice to the spirits of the dead). That is why, it is said that Brahma, as the first and foremost point in order of succession, is as important to all mundane objects as the first recipient of obsequial oblations is to the subsequent ones. To the sages He is as sacred as the vow of truthfulness. By Rs&#x301;is or sages I mean those who have hastened the advancement of human civilization by inventing or discovering things through their Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practices. Such sages make the base of their lives on truth; without truthfulness intellectual expansion towards the Supreme is not possible. Let us here discuss the meaning of the word, Truth. People generally use four words, Satya, Tothya, Samyak and Rta synonymously or in an identical sense. But in reality there is a great difference in their meanings. The English equivalents of Tathya, Samyak and Rta are &ldquo;Fact&rdquo;, &ldquo;Correct&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; respectively. But in other languages &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; (Truth) has no equivalent. The Philosophical meaning of the word &ldquo;Satya&rdquo;, is unchangeable, i.e., that which has no distortion, that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person. Human life progresses through different stages &ndash; from childhood to adolescence, from adolescence to youth, youth to old age and old age to senility. It is through these changes that people progress. That is why human life or its receptacle, the body, is not Satya&#x301; or Truth. There is yet another philosophical meaning of the word, &ldquo;Satya&rdquo;, which is Citsvaru&#x301;pa (the Supreme consciousness) or Purus&#x301;a. In the field of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice the meaning of &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; is &ldquo;Parahit&#x301;artham&#x301; va&#x301;unmanaso yatha&#x301;rthatvam&#x301; satyam&rdquo; i.e., Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others. No matter what meaning of &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; we accept, a benevolent sage has got to be truthful. The creation of one who has not learnt to regard the blissful, unchangeable Entity as the ultimate goal is no creation &ndash; is a veritable negation of creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="35..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The great sage, Mahars&#x301;i Atharva&#x301;, who lived in ancient times, while he was practicing Brahma-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, was the first to gain intuitional knowledge by the grace of Brahma. He taught that knowledge to Mahars&#x301;i Aun&#x32D;gira&#x301;, who taught it to Satyava&#x301;ha. Satya&#x301;vaha in turn taught A&#x301;un&#x32D;girasa. So the sage says, Brahma, the source of all existing entities, is as important to them as Atharva&#x301;, the expounder of intuitional science, is to Aun&#x32D;girasa and his other students.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The word Indra means great or a king. Brahma is the controller of the vital force which keeps the organisms alive; we call Him Indra, when He controls our lives and our energies through His expressions.  We call Him Rudra or the God of thunder, when He, as our friend, saves us from the jaws of calamities through His affectionate and tender touch. He exists everywhere; He is present about us sometimes as a sound, sometimes as a thought or emotion and sometimes as a crude individual entity. There is not a place in the universe where He is not manifest.<!-- /block --></p>

Take for instance, the backbone of the nervous system, the Svadha&#x301; of departed ancestors, the satya of the sages or Indra, Rudra, the sun &ndash; are all these separate entities? No, all is He, all is He, all is He. The person whose apparent name is Dhruvajyotih, whom a son calls &ldquo;father&rdquo; for he sees in him a father-like manifestation, a father calls &ldquo;Dheva&rdquo;, for he sees in him a son-like manifestation, a school boy, &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;, for he sees in him a teacher-like manifestation, and a tongawalla, &ldquo;Hey, Topee&rdquo;, for he sees the Topee (cap) as the all-important thing, in reality, are these addresses such as &ldquo;father&rdquo;, &ldquo;sir&rdquo; or &ldquo;hey topee&rdquo;, so many different persons? Actually, they are the result of looking at one Dhruvajyotih from different angles of vision.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="35..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->There is nothing inanimate or insentient in this world; everything is animate and sentient. In some places consciousness is condensed and in other places it is uncondensed. Where consciousness is condensed, we say &ldquo;animate&rdquo; or &ldquo;sentient&rdquo;, and where it is uncondensed, i.e., where the influence of Prakrti is more predominant, we say, &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; or &ldquo;insentient&rdquo;. The difference between this so-called sentience and insentience is that the so-called sentient, due to its consciousness being condensed, is capable of controlling itself, but due to the uncondensed state of consciousness the so-called inert or insentient is entirely dependent on the wishes of Prakrti, i.e., it is compelled to behave according to the thought-process of the Macrocosmic Mind. This may stimulate a question in our minds. If the so-called inert object is subject to the wishes of the Cosmic Mind, then the Cosmic Grace must necessarily have to be on it only. If the sentient is capable of thought by itself, why should Brahma think for it at all? There is hardly any ground for Brahmic mercy to be showered upon it. The world is crude, and that is why He has kindly regulated its course of movements, so that it may not be smashed to smithereens by the impact of a comet. But to a sentient person He has allowed discretion to take poison or nectar. Is this consciousness then a curse to the living? No. To Him &ldquo;animate&rdquo; and &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; make no difference. He has no partiality for one or the other. The insentient do not work by themselves, and so they are not vulnerable to punishment or eligible for reward for vices or virtues, but the sentient attain the good or bad consequences of their acts&#8230; they experience pleasure and pain. Let one suffer or enjoy according to one&#146;s deed. He stands by His duties, why shouldn&#146;t He? With the birth of a child He provides milk in the mother&#146;s breasts, affection from the father and love from friends. Aren&#146;t these His mercies? After the scorching summer of the month of Vaesha&#x301;jha come the showers of the rainy season. These merciful showers are also His. From such changes rocks, iron or gold do not perceive pain or pleasure. It is living beings who endure or enjoy them. It is through these showers for their enjoyment that various things grow, and through them they all feel and enjoy the self-same Bliss Absolute, which Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. And so He has not only forgotten you, rather He gives you compassion and mercy for no compulsive reason &ndash; much more mercy perhaps than you even deserve.<!-- /block --></p>

This Nucleus (Purus&#x301;ottama) can be explained briefly thus; Suppose you are thinking of Monghyr internally. Now a part of your consciousness is changed into mind-stuff, and this mind-stuff takes the form of Monghyr. The remaining part of your mind-stuff remains as the witness of your mentally created Monghyr. Now the part of your consciousness which plays neither the role of a witness nor of being witnessed and yet remains as the knower of your observation, that subtle part or bearing, if taken in the Brahmic or theistic context, will be regarded as Purus&#x301;ottama. If this effulgent entity of Brahma be realized, the imperishable Brahma or nuclear sonic expression can also be known. The person of calm and sedate intellect becomes Nirain&#x32D;jana or flowlessness itself after gradually giving up both virtue and vice. At that time there comes in him the proper equilibrium &ndash; there remains no frivolity of any sentiment nor the high waves of any manifestation. All the clashes merge in the ultimate tranquillity of the fathomless Ocean of Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

The word niiti has been derived from the root verb nii and the suffix ktin. It means &ldquo;that which has the capability to lead&rdquo;. But &ldquo;to lead&rdquo; to where?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The definition is Ks&#x301;ema&#x301;rthe nayanam ityarthe niiti. Nayana means &ldquo;to lead&rdquo; &ndash; as for instance the organ of the body which leads people toward external objects [the eye] is called nayana &ndash; and niiti is that which leads a unit being towards ks&#x301;ema.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And what is ks&#x301;ema?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->There are a number of  words that seem to have the same meaning as ks&#x301;ema. But there is some subtle difference among the various words. For instance, there is a word hita whose colloquial meaning is &ldquo;good&rdquo;, but which actually means the desire for physical, mental and spiritual progress. But since no real progress is feasible in either the physical or the intellectual realm, the word hita has no meaning. Another word is shubha. It is used for progress in the intellectual and spiritual realms, but since there cannot be any progress in the intellectual realm, this term also becomes meaningless. And as regards spiritual progress, there are two words, kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a and ks&#x301;ema. Kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;mastu  means &ldquo;Let there be spiritual progress&rdquo; &ndash; and ks&#x301;ema means the same as kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->So, Ks&#x301;ema&#x301;rthe nayanam ityarthe niiti &ndash; that is, &ldquo;That which leads you in a particular direction for your ks&#x301;ema is called niiti.&rdquo; That which teaches you how to thieve, how to rob, and how to take bribes, is not niiti, for there is no intention of ks&#x301;ema there. This is the definition of niiti as in the scriptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In common speech niiti means simply &ldquo;that which leads&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the entity which possesses the capability of leading&rdquo;. So in common speech we can use terms such as kuniiti, durniiti, suniiti, satniiti, ran&#x301;aniiti, etc. But in a spiritual [context] the words suniiti [niiti conducive to welfare] and kuniiti [niiti conducive to harm] cannot be used, since the word niiti means only Ks&#x301;ema&#x301;rthe nayanam ityarthe; that is to say, since niiti [is automatically conducive to welfare and] can never be harmful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;morality&rdquo; is generally used as the English synonym for niiti (niiti as scripturally defined). Morality is that effort or idea which keeps a person away from sin &ndash; sin being that which is not prescribed in the Bible. Niiti is different from morality. There is no exact synonym for niiti.<!-- /block --></p>

But pa&#x301;pa is explained in the phrase Paropaka&#x301;rah pun&#x301;ya&#x301;ya pa&#x301;pa&#x301;ya parapiid&#x301;anam &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Any action by one individual which leads to the development of others is pun&#x301;ya [virtuous deeds], and any action which does the opposite is pa&#x301;pa.&rdquo; Bhagava&#x301;n Shankaracharya has said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="36..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Tyaja durjanasam&#x301;sargam &ndash; avoid association with the durjana (wicked). Who are durjana? Those who bring about the spiritual degeneration of others are durjana. But durjana is also a relative term.

Suppose that in one person the righteousness is twenty percent and the unrighteousness is fifteen percent &ndash; the resultant five percent will be righteousness. But if in another person the righteousness be ten percent and the unrighteousness two percent, then the resultant eight percent will be that person&#146;s righteousness &ndash; which means that that person turns out to be a greater moralist, though he or she is possessed of only ten percent righteousness. What counts is the [resultant quantity] of righteousness, not the righteousness in itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now suppose that in Mr. X [the resultant] unrighteousness is fifteen percent, and in Mr. Y it is ten percent. If a third man possessing less than ten percent resultant righteousness comes in contact with them, he will become degenerated. But if in this man the righteousness is twenty-five percent, he cannot become unrighteous in contact with X and Y, on the contrary he will make those two righteous. Therefore one person cannot be durjana for all other persons. A person may be durjana for those who possess less of righteousness than he or she does of unrighteousness, but the same person cannot be durjana for those who possess more of righteousness than he or she does of unrighteousness &ndash; rather the latter persons will make the former person good.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->If, when making an effort to reform a person, your righteousness is not much more than the unrighteousness in that person, you should take with you a few other moralists when you go to reform the person. The collective righteousness will gain in strength, and it will have its impact on the person, and the person will be reformed. The person could be reformed not by the influence of one good person but by that of an assemblage of good people.

Those who have the capability of leading others towards sa&#x301;dhuta&#x301; [saintliness] are alone sa&#x301;dhus. One may be a sa&#x301;dhu even wearing a suit.

(Praca&#x301;ra can be done only by those who themselves are spiritual aspirants.) Doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and rendering social service are also pun&#x301;ya karmas. But for ordinary people who work in [government] offices or in businesses (not very spiritual activities), what is the way out? Even while working in the world, they should take their worldly work to be the work of the Lord. The worldly work as well will then become a pun&#x301;ya karma. If they keep their minds engaged in the thought of the Supreme, they will not be able to do anything wrong. The feeling of rendering service to others will remain in their minds.

If even one of these three aspects of time be absent, the thing is not nitya. For example, that which is in the present and will continue to be in the future, but was not in the past, is not nitya, but anitya. From among beginning, middle and end, if even one is not there, then that is not nitya. A thing which was born will die one day; that which is unborn will not die.

So one will tend not to perform any work improperly, and one&#146;s mind will not be attached to crudity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Niiti has a very close association with dharma. What is dharma? That which sustains the jiiva is dharma. And the practical side of dharma is expressed in the words A&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t dharmah, that is, &ldquo;Dharma is the assemblage of all your conduct&rdquo; &ndash; the way you eat, the way you speak, the way you perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. If your conduct is good, dharma is with you; if your conduct is not good, dharma is not with you. And if dharma is not with you, what comes about is your sarvana&#x301;sha, or sarva&#x301;tmaka vina&#x301;sha &ndash; that is, your physical, mental, and spiritual ruin. Now you may say that your a&#x301;tman cannot be ruined. That is correct, but your a&#x301;tman will not remain in the form of a&#x301;tman. It will become crudified.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In the first stage of dharma, the greatest helping factor is niiti. In other words, the function of niiti is to help dharma, to help dharma&#x301;caran&#x301;a [practice of dharma]. Therefore niiti plays a vital role in the life of a sa&#x301;dhaka. But niiti is not the culminating point of life, it is simply a starting point. In order to enter a house one has to pass through the gate, and this passing through the gate is niiti. But one has not gotten into the house simply by passing through the gate; to get in, one has to knock on the door. The entering into the house after knocking on the door is dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Just to be a moralist is not enough, it only provides one with a passport to enter the house. As said above, A&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t dharmah [&ldquo;Dharma is the assemblage of all your conduct&rdquo;], and the first phase of your conduct is niiti. Therefore those who are bereft of niiti cannot be dharmic, and those who are dharmic cannot go against niiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Now the question crops up whether niiti is a relative factor or an absolute factor. Niiti is not cent percent relative, but it is not absolute, either, because niiti does not have any direct relation with Parama&#x301;tman &ndash; it cannot by its own force help one attain Him. Niiti is a happy blending of relative and absolute.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->The final goal of dharma is Parama&#x301;tman, so for a dharma sa&#x301;dhaka there can be no other end. Those sa&#x301;dhakas who think that through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; they will acquire occult powers, are wrong. Or, they may attain supernatural powers, but those powers will not help them to attain Parama&#x301;tman. Those powers will not satisfy human longings, because even those powers are something worldly. That which we call supernatural is not really so, &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; is rather loose terminology; any power or object which has come within the bondages of the world is not supernatural, but natural. Those who think that sitting in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; they can obtain an&#x301;ima&#x301;, laghima&#x301;, mahima&#x301;, pra&#x301;pti, praka&#x301;mya, etc. [names of occult powers], are in delusion. They are simply wasting their valuable time. A devoted sa&#x301;dhaka never aspires for these things. Even if Parama&#x301;tman comes to such a sa&#x301;dhaka and says, &ldquo;My child, take all these powers,&rdquo; the sa&#x301;dhaka will reply, &ldquo;Parama&#x301;tman, keep those powers for Yourself. I don&#146;t need them. I want You, and You alone. I long for You and not for Your powers.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->A mother tries to coax and cajole her crying son, and offers him some toys to divert his attention, so that she can work in the kitchen. The child stops crying and forgets his mother for the time being. But if he is a bit naughty, he will again resume his effort to reach the breast of his mother. He will throw away the toys and cry for Mother only. And the mother ultimately has to come and take the child on her lap. A devoted sa&#x301;dhaka is like this child. He or she will say, &ldquo;O Father, this world that I see all around is a plethora of toys. This world took its birth at a certain time, so it will also come to an end at some time or other. This world has not been given permanently to anybody.&rdquo; If God is asked whether He has given this world-toy to anybody forever, He will not be able to answer, for He does not give things forever. He gives with the right hand and takes away with the left.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Lord Buddha has said, Konuha&#x301;sa kiimananda nittam pajjalite sate. This means that Parama&#x301;tman has given you a rope, one end of which you are holding, and on the other end of which He has lit a fire. Sooner or later the fire will burn all of the rope and your hand as well. Hence one should not ask anything from Parama&#x301;tman.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..35"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Niiti and Dharma<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->In niiti there is a happy blending of the relative and the absolute. So niiti is based on certain mundane and supra-mundane principles. Dharma, on the other hand, is a&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a [conduct] &ndash; A&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t dharmah. It is, therefore, something practical. It is a cult. It is not a theory but a desire, a will to do something.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->But the question arises, what to do. As regards niiti, one can deliver some speech, say something on Yama and Niyama, and that too can be understood. But as regards dharma, one has to actually do something. So what to do and what not to do? What are people&#146;s dos and don&#146;ts?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->In the case of niiti, indeed, there are certain dos and don&#146;ts. In Sanskrit these dos are called vidhi, and the don&#146;ts are called nis&#x301;edha. The collection of dos and don&#146;ts is niiti. But as regards dharma there are no don&#146;ts, everything is do; that is, everything is a conduct which has to be performed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->For example, &ldquo;Serve the patient,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&#146;t steal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak the truth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&#146;t tell a lie&rdquo; &ndash; such a combination of [observances and restrictions] is niiti. Dharma, on the other hand, is a&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a, not ana&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a &ndash; that is, it is only &ldquo;do this,&rdquo; &ldquo;do that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for Parama&#x301;tman like this,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sing bhajans like this,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma like this,&rdquo; &ldquo;Do nya&#x301;sa [a kind of breath-control] like this&rdquo; &ndash; there is only vidhi and no nis&#x301;edha. This is the fundamental difference between dharma and niiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->So in dharma there are only dos. Now common people will naturally ask, What is it that we are to do?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="36..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Shrutayo vibhinna&#x301;h &ndash; Among the different Vedas and sha&#x301;stras there are mutual differences. There are differences even between the mantras of the Rgveda and those of the Yajurveda. In the one it says pitrasva and in the other pitrasta&#x301;m. The one says sarvatomukha and the other says vishvatomukha. So the Rgveda and the Yajurveda are not identical. They have differences wide and deep. So what should common people do? Which should they accept? Similar is the case with niiti. One person will say that sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; must be done facing the east, and another will say facing the north &ndash; will say that instead of facing the sun while meditating, one should face the polestar. Yet another person will say that sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; should be done facing the west [from India], that is, facing Mecca. Only poor south has not received anybody&#146;s sanction. But really Parama&#x301;tman is in all the directions. Do not all these directions belong to Parama&#x301;tman? How could Parama&#x301;tman be only in the east and not in the west? But niitiva&#x301;diis (exponents of principles of niiti) will quarrel among themselves. As said earlier, there is something relative in niiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->As far as the controversy regarding the four directions is concerned, sa&#x301;dhakas will say,<!-- /block --></p>

So this one Parama&#x301;tman appears in the form of the six pradisha and the four anudisha. Which directions will you accept and which reject? If you speak in favour of the east, it means you are speaking against the west &ndash; and haven&#146;t you then gone against the Lord manifested in the form of the west?

<a name="36..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->So we see that there are differences of opinion even in the shrutis &ndash; shrutayo vibhinna&#x301;h. The smrtis also differ. What is a smrti? That which controls the worldly life of a person is called smrti, and that which controls the spiritual life of that person is called shruti. Shruti means dharmasha&#x301;stra (spiritual code), and smrti means sama&#x301;jasha&#x301;stra (social code). In ancient times there were the Parashar Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;, the Na&#x301;rada Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;, and the Manu Sam&#x301;hita&#x301;; and today you will find the Hindu Code. All of these are smrtisha&#x301;stra. Smrtisha&#x301;stra is more relative than shrutisha&#x301;stra, for society changes with the change of time. But there are differences among the shrutis also, and, Naekamuniryasya matam&#x301; nabhinnam &ndash; &ldquo;There is no muni [saintly intellectual] who does not differ from other munis.&rdquo; Some munis will say to offer pin&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; [oblations] in a particular way, and some in some other way. (But actually, not all of these people are [even] real munis. Only &ldquo;those who have merged their minds&rdquo; in Parama&#x301;tman are real munis &ndash; Munih dugdhaba&#x301;lakah munih sam&#x301;liinama&#x301;nasah.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->A modern person might ask whether it is really possible to merge one&#146;s mind in this way.

<a name="36..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The essence of dharma is hidden in the guha&#x301;.&rdquo; The term guha&#x301; in Sanskrit has two meanings. The first is &ldquo;cave&rdquo;. So does the shloka mean that Parama&#x301;tman is concealed in a cave in some mountain; does it mean that to realize Him one will have to leave the world and go to the wilderness? No, it would not be wise to leave the world, to leave off service to humanity, and go to the Himalayas to attain Parama&#x301;tman. This world itself is Parama&#x301;tman&#146;s &ndash; where will you go if you leave it? In the world one may believe that one will be unable to concentrate their mind because of the din and bustle; but in a cave in the Himalayas, one will start thinking that one was unable to get sweet fruit in a particular jungle, and that hence tomorrow one would have to go get ripe plums in a different jungle two or three miles away. Either in the world or in the wilderness one will not necessarily be free. If Parama&#x301;tman does not want you to know Him, then you will not be able to attain Him in either place; whereas if He wishes you to attain Him, you can get Him here and now. What He sees is your aspiration for Him. Remember that at every step of your life He is testing you to see whether or not you have been able to arouse love for Him in your mind. He is testing you as to whether you want Him or want worldly objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->There should be oneness in thought and speech. If there is some difference between the two, one will not be able to arouse love for Him. Suppose that in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one says that one requires only Parama&#x301;tman. If then, when before the Lord, that person prays for the cure of his or her asthma, that will not serve the purpose.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->The other meaning of guha&#x301; is &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Dharmasya tattvam&#x301; nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;ya&#x301;m&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;The essence of dharma, that is, Parama&#x301;tman, is hidden in your own &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness.&rdquo; Is it essential for you to go to the Himalayas in search of that which is hidden in your own &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness? Do you require the help of a mirror to see the wristwatch on your wrist? No, and neither for Parama&#x301;tman, who is hidden in your &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness, do you need go to the Himalayas. Live in the world and put forth your entire self for the service of society, and then you must attain Parama&#x301;tman. Parama&#x301;tman is hidden in you, and He is witnessing all your activities, physical or mental, and seeing whether you aspire for Him or for worldly objects. So what will sa&#x301;dhakas do? Maha&#x301;jano yena gatah sa pantha&#x301;h. The cover of &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness is to be removed [from Parama&#x301;tman, the essence of dharma] &ndash; those who try to remove it are maha&#x301;janas, practical people, practical sa&#x301;dhakas. And whatever these practical sa&#x301;dhakas have done and are doing, you have to follow. This cannot be brought about with niiti. This is entirely a spiritual cult. You are sa&#x301;dhakas, you have to follow the maha&#x301;janas, and achieve your end by removing the cover of your &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness. You will find that your goal is hidden in your own &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="36..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->Hence niiti will help you, but only through dharma  sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; will you be able to attain Parama&#x301;tman.

<a name="37..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the beginning, there was sound, and the sound was with God, and the sound was God. You know, amongst different expressions, the expression of sound is the subtlest, subtler even than light, and that is why the karn&#x301;endriya, the ear, is treated as the subtlest organ. Now, these acoustic expressions are of two kinds: one is divine, or spiritual, acoustic expression, and the other is physical acoustic expression. The sound you hear is physical acoustic expression, and similarly there is spiritual acoustic expression in the divine realm, in the spiritual campus. But in the case of the Non-Attributional Entity, in the case of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, there is no expression, because Nirgun&#x301;a means &ldquo;where there has been no expression&rdquo;. But in the case of Sagun&#x301;a [Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, the Attributional Entity] and even starting from Purus&#x301;ottama [the Nucleus Consciousness], there is expression. And that expression, till it reaches the physical sphere, is spiritual acoustic expression, spiritual sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You know, whenever you think something, you create mental sound. What is thinking? Thinking is mentally speaking. Is it not a fact? You are thinking, &ldquo;Oh, my visa will expire on such-and-such day.&rdquo; Actually you are speaking mentally. Mmmm. And when you speak physically, others can also hear; when you speak mentally, others may or may not hear. [Much laughter among the audience.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now, one may catch this physical sound according to the capacity of one&#146;s acoustic organs, one&#146;s ears. You cannot catch  very short or very long sounds. Similarly, in the inner sphere there are several stages, several strata, several phases; and when the inner senses develop by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, one will hear that divine sound, that inner sound. It is known as the sound of silence. The what? The sound of silence. And it is what is known as on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra in Sanskrit &ndash; pran&#x301;ava or on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When those inner senses develop, then in the first phase sa&#x301;dhakas [spiritual aspirants] can hear the sound, that inner sound, that inner voice, that divine sound. In the first phase it is like the sound of crickets. [Imitates the sound.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->You know, the cricket is an insect that creates a pauseless sound [imitates] in the fog. You have seen [it in] open fields, particularly in the rainy season. Mmmm&#8230; one will hear a cricket sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Then in the next phase, as if somebody is dancing with ghun&#x32D;ghur [ankle bells]. (You know, ghun&#x32D;ghur &ndash; you use it during the ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava dance. In Sanskrit it is called nupur.) Next you will hear the sound of flutes &ndash; as if somebody is playing a flute. Then the sound of the ocean, you know? A particular sound is created by the sea. And then, in the fifth phase, tam&#x301;, tam&#x301;, just like bells, the sound of bells. And finally, the sound is just like oon&#x32D;n&#x32D;n&#x32D; &ndash; the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra in pure form. And after that there remains no sound, because after that there ends the realm, the scope, of Sagun&#x301;a. After that there is the scope of Nirgun&#x301;a. In the realm of Nirgun&#x301;a there cannot be any sound, because there cannot be any expression. Not even divine expression, not even supra-psychic expression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="37..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->By dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, in the last phase you will hear the sound, the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra &ndash; oon&#x32D;n&#x32D;n&#x32D;. You will hear that sound. It is known as the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra or pran&#x301;ava. In the Vedas it has been said, Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma [&ldquo;Brahma is of the same nature as pran&#x301;ava&rdquo;]. When one can hear that pran&#x301;ava, in the next phase one will come in contact with Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. That&#146;s why pran&#x301;ava is called Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma. Pra&#x301; &ndash; nu + al = pran&#x301;ava. Pran&#x301;ava means that entity that helps the sa&#x301;dhaka to come in contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a. In Sanskrit another name for pran&#x301;ava is Shabda Brahma &ndash; Brahma expressed as shabda. Shabda means sound. So a day will come when this pran&#x301;ava will become a crude reality for you. Now, for some of you, pran&#x301;ava is in dreamland [much laughter], [but actually] it is a crude reality.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="38..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Where there is existence, there is speed, movement.  And this dynamism is always relative.  This movement is begotten by actions (karmatattva).  What is action?  Where the speed of the object together with its movement with the relativities is towards a desideratum (Laksyabhimukii), it is Karma.  The factor (Tattva) which enables an action to be accomplished is termed as Prakrta Shakti.  The action cannot be accomplished where these three factors such as space, time and person are not there i.e. before performing action these three factors (Tridanda) are indispensable for Prakrta Shakti.  Whatever is performed in the expressed world, is effected by Prakrta Shakti. This Prakrta Shakti gets its inspiration from the Sentient Principle, the action is accomplished by the Mutative and the existence of an action is by the Static i.e. action is the collective result of these three factors.  Where Prakrta Shakti performs actions without results, there she is known as Avyakta.  Where the action is expressed, where Prakrta Shakti is expressed (Vyakta), there Consciousness (Purus&#x301;a Bhava) is operated (Karmanvit) by it.  But where Consciousness is not operated by Prakrta Shakti i.e. Prakrta Shakti does actions but the result is not begotten, there Purus&#x301;a Bhava is known as Citi Shakti.  This is known as Citi Shakti only because Karma Shakti is vibrated (Pratisamvedit) by it.  Hence Purus&#x301;a Bhava is also known as a Principle which is Citi Shakti.  It is because in His absense Karma Shakti can&#146;t get expression.  This Karma Shakti or Prakrta Shakti is a principle within the Citi Shakti.  Where Citi Shakti is vibrator (Pratisamvedii), there alone action is expressed.  And where Citi Shakti assimilates (Grasa) Prakrta Shakti, there Prakrta Shakti is Avyakta (unexpressed).  Therefore the vibration (Pratisamvedan) is only due to Citi Shakti.  So the Citi Shakti is the Supreme Vibrator (Parama Pratisamvedii).  This is the law of the vibration &ndash; the vibrator vibrates the object but without vibrating when it engulfs (Grasa), there it is known as unexpressed.  Hence in the practical world we cannot get anything unexpressed because whatever vibrator is there is engaged in the work of vibrations.  Hence the supreme vibrator is only that unexpressed Consciousness (Avyakta Purus&#x301;a Satta).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When the speed of human intellect becomes pointed, there people search one in many.  Whatever they find behind that they search its vibrator.  Getting the same they try to find out the vibrator of the previous vibrator.  Like this when they attain Citi Shakti or Parama Purus&#x301;a, they find that Citi Shakti has not its vibrator as that is beyond time, space and person.  Therefore Citi Shakti and Parama Purus&#x301;a are known as Supreme Vibrator (Parama Pratisamvedii).  When we see the expressed world, there we see not the synthetic process but the analytic process.  In analysis what we find is the vibrator of one object, and so another one is the vibrator of the first vibrator, and so on and so forth.  From Sambhu this expressed universe comes to Bhaerava and then to Bhava. These all are vibrators and Prakrti is vibrated.  What is the idea (Bhava) in this vibration?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->About Prakrti it is told that she is Nitya Nivrtta &ndash; &ldquo;Prakrti sa nityanivrtta&rdquo;.  When Prakrti tries to be vibrated but instead she is engulfed, there she is Nitya Nivrtta, there she is waning, she is merging into Purus&#x301;a Bhava (Consciousness).   Though she is merging into Purus&#x301;a Bhava yet she is not being annihilated, for her being infinite.  The cruder the vibrator we get, the cruder the Prakrti tries to make it.  Actually Prakrti tries to make that her own but this makes the object still cruder.  So gradually it becomes crude from the subtle.  Behind this a principle works &ndash; &ldquo;Abhoga Samsargat Praptiresana&rdquo;.  You must remember it.  When near an object of enjoyment (Abhoga) another object reaches, a desire is begotten to get that object.  For instance a man when in town has dress, living as per the dress and living of the urban people and when in a village he has as per the villagers.  This is effected because of his desire begotten out of his association with people in town and villages respectively.  When some persons take tea, there you also get the desire to take the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In Pratisain&#x32D;cara process there is a movement from crude to subtle and behind that there is only one vrtti (tendency).  &ldquo;Abhoga Samsargat Praptiresana&rdquo;.  With the association of the enjoyable object there is a desire to get it.  In this cosmic cycle (Brahma Cakra) everyone has his individual pabulum (Abhoga).  And after that they are running.  Those who have got several pabula, run after all of them and get exhausted and in the long run they get none.  Those who have got only one pabulum get the same very easily. Therefore it is told.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Ananyamamata visnormamata brahamasamgata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Instead of running after several objects, run after Visnu and get Him because there is only one pabulum here.  When more than one pabulum is there, the mind gets divided and none will be achieved.  This goes on.  When first of all from Sain&#x32D;cara comes Pratisain&#x32D;cara, when Citta comes into being, or Citta and Ahamtattva come or Citta, Aham and Mahat Tattva come, men run after their respective pabula.  This they do either because of inborn instinct or imposed Samskara or any other reason.  And according to Prakrta Liila several pabula are kept before man. He runs after them and forgets Parama Purus&#x301;a and gets away from Him and thus the Liila of Parama Purus&#x301;a goes on.  And when the movement towards the pabulum is stopped, men start moving towards the Nucleus of these pabula.  Running after the pabulum is known as Esana.  Because of this Esana the promptness for action (Karmatatparata) is begotten.  Hence in no case man should be freed from Esana.  Without Esana there will be disturbance.  One has only to see the type of Esana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The subject matter is &ldquo;Astitva and Shivatva&rdquo;.  Esana, aforesaid, has deep relationship with Astitva.  Where there is no Esana, there is annihilation of existence.  Hence the existence of Esana is essential.  It is said above that when a man runs after varieties, he gets none.  Sometimes a man thinks to be a Minister, sometimes a Secretary, sometimes a poet.  There are thousand and one desires.  Because of this Esana is not made fully.  A man gets exhausted after running after the material objects and ultimately there is no Karmasiddhi (success in action).  When Esana is indispensable for existence of life, a man has to see what kind of Esana should be made.  Behind this Esana is Karmatatparata.  These two go side by side.  Then what is Karma?  &ldquo;Karma Brahmeti Karma bahukurviita&rdquo;.  Karma is Brahma, therefore, do as much Karma as possible.  The real Karma is to move towards Brahma and that Karma is nothing but another name of Brahma.  It is His metamorphosis.  Hence taking Karma to be Brahma, go on performing actions.  The action which you will do in that stage, behind that will be the right Esana.  And that Esana will only be one and not many.  Now the spatial transformation of the object is Karma and together with Karma only that Esana is there i.e. to attain Brahma.  In such a case there will be much more acceleration in the process of Prati Sain&#x32D;cara.  As is said above, when the Esana is only one, the work will be done.  When there are so many, the work will not be done at all.  If one desires to take milk and smoke at once, it can&#146;t be possible.  A man has to do either of these two.  Hence the object of Esana is Parama Purus&#x301;a and nothing else.  &ldquo;Ananyamamata visnormamata brahmasamgata&rdquo;.  The Esana for other objects has to be channelized towards Parama Purus&#x301;a.  This will be the right Esana.  And &ldquo;Ananyamamata visnormamata brahmasamgata&rdquo; &ndash; that is love, that is Mukti.  Hence, the correct Esana for men is Bhakti (Devotion).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If a man wants to become a devotee of the lord but in the mind of his mind, if he thinks that God will make him pass his examination &ndash; here the Esana is not one but two.  Here the work will not be done, &ldquo;I want Paramatman and from Him I want nothing&rdquo;.  When something is demanded from God the Esana becomes two.  Hence the time is completely wasted.  Where this Esana is towards Paramatman there it is known as Devotion.  Where there is Bhakti there will be the success in action and there will be victory for devotees.  This world is for devotees and for nobody else.  When the Esana is not for Paramatman but for something else, it is known as Asakti (Attachment) and not Bhakti.  As for example, the Esana for wine.  This Esana will be termed as Panasakti, the attachment for wine i.e. attachment is always in bad sense and devotion is always supreme.  Therefore the correct Esana is devotion.  It does not mean that the devotee will do only Bhajan and Kiirtan.  They are not seasoned devotees!  It is because that Sadhaka who moves on speedily on the Pratisain&#x32D;cara path towards Parama Purus&#x301;a will never blind to the sufferings of numberless persons around him because of the lack of solid social system, solid economic system and the lack of humanity.  If he is blind to the ill-management in the social system, he has not been able to understand Parama Purus&#x301;a fully.  If he does so, his will be subjective approach but not the objective adjustment i.e. when a devotee will move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a his approach will be &ldquo;Atma moksartham jagat hitaya ca&rdquo;.  He goes on moving towards Parama Purus&#x301;a while serving the humanity.  When the humanity is neglected, the &ldquo;Atma Moksartham&rdquo; is also destroyed.  Hence he must be ready to serve the humanity. Therefore the Sadhakas who don&#146;t render social service don&#146;t have real devotion.  In their devotion lies selfishness (Khudaparasti).  The devotees who are selfish (Khudaparasti) don&#146;t attain God (Khuda).  Hence the correct Esana is devotion.  Those who are devotees are workers (Karmii).  They will never be afraid of the work.  They will do maximum work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now when you go to perform an action, you will have to learn the skill of performing it.  Hence the need for knowledge is there.  Hence those who are real devotees will not neglect Karma and whatever knowledge is necessary in performing real action will be also acquired by them.  Knowledge and Karma cannot reach a devotee to Paramatma &ndash; devotion can.  But for serving the humanity, knowledge and action are essential.  Devotees must have to learn it.  As long as men perform subjective approach and for the objective adjustment acquire knowledge for doing correct action, till then they have their existence (Astitva) and movement towards Shivatva.  How does this Astitva become meaningful (Sarthaka)?  The more he nears Paramatma, the more meaningful his life becomes.  The existence of a crude minded man is not valuable.  The existence of germs and insects is not valuable though they too have the feeling of their existence.  Everybody&#146;s existence hasn&#146;t the same value.  On the death of a certain man everyone weeps but on the death of another man people feel themselves relieved.  By action, knowledge and devotion the existence is made valuable.  This alone is true practicality.  The more existence of man merges in Parama Purus&#x301;a, the more valuable he becomes.  The person who does not have objective adjustment and fails to take Jiiva to be Shiva will never reach Parama Purus&#x301;a.  He can never be great.  Some Shastras name such persons as Prakrtiliina and some Videhaliina.  What is Prakrtiliina?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Persons who are self-centered (Khuda parasta), don&#146;t have Paramatman as their goal, but something else.  Outwardly they say that Paramatman should be obtained but in their inner mind they have the desire for something else.  Such people who outwardly say that Paramatman should be obtained but in the inner mind they desire for fame, riches, have the crude object as their goal.  Whatever the inner mind says is the goal of the Jiiva (microcosm).  Whatever is the feeling in the external mind is not the goal.  But in the inner mind, because of his goal being the crude object his ultimate achievement is known as Prakrtiliina.  Prakrti means the phenomenal world.  Their existence will be transformed into the phenomenal world i.e. the conscious man gets transformed into crude object.  There is one more word for the Samadhi in the Prakrta Shakti and that is Jada Samadhi.  Jada Samadhi is very much below human existence and to be free from that is also very difficult.  After crores of years there will be human life.  Just see how dangerous it is!  So with Parama Purus&#x301;a, don&#146;t have two personalities, inside something and outside something else.  Become the same as you are within.  Entire mental structure, entire ectoplasmic stuff will be converted into the quinquelemental world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There are also some people who have correct Esana but don&#146;t have correct direction.  They know that Parama Purus&#x301;a is the goal but they don&#146;t have the real direction.  It is said that spiritual practice should not be performed studying from books.  For it, Preceptor is essential.  Reading the book or hearing from other if a man starts doing Sadhana, that too is dangerous because in that case a clear conception about the goal is not formed.  Hence one does not know where one is going.  The boat is sailing but the sailor does not know where the boat will go to.  The sailor will get exhausted ultimately and will have some accident in the long run.  In that case when such persons die, the state after death is known as Videhaliina.  Their existence is not finished herein, but their feelings remain in the ideational world as an abstract.  This too is as dangerous as Jada Samadhi. The difference between Jada Samadhi and Videhaliina is that in the former there is a folly because of a hidden desire but in the latter there is no folly but the correct direction could not be had.  Hence everybody should know that without direction nothing should be done.  Everything should be done with proper direction, proper guidance.  As for instance, people utter loudly the word revolution, revolution, but revolution does not mean putting buses and trains on fire or removing the railway lines.  This causes damage to government and government is people&#146;s.  Therefore it is a damage to the people themselves.  All these are destructive approaches.  The persons who do such destructive approaches lack in knowledge.  Just like that, in Sadhana if some hodge-podge is made, it means the lack of knowledge.  Because of this, both the individual and the society are harmed.  So this is Videhaliina.  Hence Videhaliina is sure to be there if there is no love for Paramatman.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->And where there is love for Paramatman, there is action and knowledge also, service to humanity is also there, Sadhana is also being performed, in that sense if there is duality (Dvaeta Bhava) between Parama Purus&#x301;a and the devotee &ndash; in such a case if there is excess of Iishvara Bhava (Cosmic Ideation), Sadhaka enjoys Bliss and temporarily he becomes free from miseries.  That state of Bliss is Bhava Samadhi.  The persons who attain Bhava Samadhi are devotees but the duality exists.  Everybody is born out of Parama Purus&#x301;a, so how can there be two &ndash; the devotee and the Parama Purus&#x301;a?  Hence in Bhava Samadhi much higher stage is not attained.  As long as there is Bhava Samadhi there is Bliss, but after this the aspirant is an ordinary human being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Some devotees, who go still ahead and feel the oneness with Him, but instead of loving Paramatman Himself, think more of His Gunas (qualities).  In such a case they attain Gunatmaka Samadhi.  In that case the devotees also attain so many qualities, but permanent unification with Paramatman is not attained.  What happens in Gunatmaka Samadhi is that the devotee has much more the feeling of the qualities.  Secondly, the man having Gunatmaka Samadhi has the standard from where he thinks that his coming in this universe should be justified.  He wants to justify his body, mind, Atman, and the whole life.  These are the sentient feelings indeed &ndash; but they are also not seasoned devotees!  The feeling should be that the body and mind which have been given by Parama Purus&#x301;a will be utilized in the service of the society for pleasing Parama Purus&#x301;a.  Devotees are known as Gopa.  Persons who please Parama Purus&#x301;a are Gopa &ndash; &ldquo;Gopayate Yah Sah Gopah&rdquo;.  Their very nature is to please Parama Purus&#x301;a.  Gopa does not mean the persons who rear cattle.  Devotee of the first order will not want Gunatmaka Samadhi.  They will want to utilize their body, mind and their qualities for the service of humanity.  It is because everything belongs to Paramatman.  He has expressed Himself into every object of the universe up to the blade of grass.  A devotee will serve the humanity because Paramatman will be satisfied.  Those persons who utilize themselves fully for pleasing Paramatman are A-class devotees.  They alone are devotees and the others are not.  Where the only aim is to please Paramatman there the devotee completely forgets himself because Khudaparasti is pleasing oneself.  Up to Gunatmaka Samadhi even this sense of self-centeredness exists.  But where there is no personal desire but the only aim is to please Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Khudaparasti does not exist at all.  And in the absence of Khudaparasti only Khudaparasti remains.  The final merger (Pranasha) of the existence (Astitva) is there.  With the extinction of Astitva, there is the establishment of Shivatva.  Everything is done for the happiness of Shiva.  This establishment of Shivatva is known as Shiva Samadhi.  The Supreme Goal of human life is Samadhi.  People are established in Shiva Samadhi by being guided by &ldquo;Atma moksartham jagat hitaya ca&rdquo;.  There is no other way out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->It can be questioned how an illiterate, weakling man will do action and acquire knowledge.

The man who does not have compassion, the man who does not shed tears at the miseries of others, is not a man but a stone.  He cannot do any great work.  Be happy with the happiness of others and troubled with the trouble of others.  This alone is natural.  Don&#146;t be unnatural.  The effort to make everybody one&#146;s own culminates in love for the Lord, i.e., devotion is love-for-God personified.  &ldquo;Bhakti Anandarupashca&rdquo; &ndash; devotion is the ecstasy of Bliss, the ocean of Bliss.  And &ldquo;Bhakti Bhaktasya jiivanam&rdquo; &ndash; devotion alone is the life for the devotee.  The greatest enmity against devotees is to take away their devotion.  Don&#146;t ever try to snatch devotion from devotees since devotion is their life.  Paramatman himself will teach knowledge and the technique of doing the work.  It is not the devotees&#146; headache.  Surrender everything to the Lord.  Because man has not been able to solve his problems by his efforts, nor will he be able to, hence a devotee has not to be disturbed.  And if one requires  something from God, one has to require only Parabhakti (Absolute Devotion).  When devotion is attained, God is attained.  If God is attained, everything is attained.  What remains unattained!  Therefore from ancient time learned people have been accepting that the wisest man in the world is the devotee.  Devotee is not bereft of intellect.  On the contrary he is the wisest  If you want to remain in the world remain like a devotee.  As long as devotion is not there one&#146;s heart is like a desert and when the devotion is attained, an oasis in the desert advents.  You have not to be afraid of anything when devotion is with you.  Nothing is to be afraid of when Parama Purus&#x301;a is with you.  When devotion is there, Parama Purus&#x301;a is there.  And when He is there fear none.  In no case you have to be disturbed.  You must remember that devotion is a unique creation of Parama Purus&#x301;a.  And for getting this, learning, intellect, money etc. are not all needed.  Ask and you get the cheapest but the most invaluable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="38..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Hence, be a devotee and establish the ideology. If devotion is with you, whatever you want, in whatever way you want, you will establish your ideology.  Those who are devotionless, will go on blinking and can never do anything against you, if devotion is with you, victory is with you.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="39..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Kos&#x301;a means A&#x301;dha&#x301;ra or base. Are the Saptaloka (seven spheres) and pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a (five sheaths) separate from the A&#x301;tman (soul)? Is the relation between them that of the container and the contained? If we say; &ndash; Eko Brahma Dvitiiya na&#x301;sti. (There is only one Brahma and no other), then of A&#x301;dha&#x301;ra and A&#x301;dhrta, which is Brahma and which is not? If either the container or the contained is considered as Brahma does that mean that the other is not Brahma? If it is argued that Saptaloka and Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a are the base of Brahma, then the existence of some other entity outside of Brahma has to be acknowledged. For instance, suppose there is a person in a house. The house and the person exist separately. The house is the container and the person is the contained. Hence, the house is separate from the person. In the Pain&#x32D;cakosa&#x301;, A&#x301;tman is the contained and the Kos&#x301;a is the container. Clearly the container must be bigger than that which it contains. There is nothing bigger than Parama&#x301;tman; hence it cannot have a container. Should we then consider that the Saptaloka and the Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a do not exist? Yes, for the Saptaloka is included in Brahma. Their aggregate is Brahma. The Jiiva is included in the Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a. There is a subtle difference between the Jiiva and Brahma. In the Jiiva there are two types of &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling &ndash; one is its mind created by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and the other is [[its knowledge-filled state &ndash; the reflected expression  of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; Himself &ndash; that is, its (the jiiva&#146;s) jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;.]] Jiiva&#x301;tman is the real &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling of Jiiva or unit soul. Of the seven spheres, Brahma is unaffected only in the Satyaloka and in the remaining six Lokas, Brahma is affected by Ma&#x301;ya. It can also be explained in this way, that the six Lokas are created within Brahma which itself pervades the expressed universe as imperishable Brahma. Brahma has no base. Excepting Satyaloka, the remaining six Lokas are created within Brahma, in the very midst of Brahma. Is it the case then that the light is different from its original source? The Saptalokas are its evolution &ndash; these are the manifestation of Brahma &ndash; the relationship is not that of the container and the contained. The difference between the Jiiva&#x301;tman and Parama&#x301;tman exists only so long as there is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling of the unit soul. (Jiiva bha&#x301;va).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is the relationship between Jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;n and Parama&#x301;tman? What is Jiiva (unit soul?) The base of the physical body is the Kos&#x301;as. Here, the base is bigger than that which is based upon it. The Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a is bigger than the Annamaya Kos&#x301;a. Then the Manomaya Kos&#x301;a is bigger than the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a. The Atima&#x301;nas Kos&#x301;a is bigger than even the Manomaya Kos&#x301;a. The Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya Kos&#x301;a is larger than this. The Hiran&#x301;maya Kos&#x301;a is bigger than the Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nmaya Kos&#x301;a and the biggest of all is the Satyaloka. All of these aspects are limited to the unit soul and all of them are its bases. Now, what is the relationship between the base and the based? The relationship is that of a subject and an object. For instance, the physical body is the object of enjoyment and the mind is the enjoyer. That is, our body is the object of enjoyment of our mind and the mind remains attached to it. The body is the base of the mind and the mind is intimately attached to its base.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Mahattattva is the pure &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling of the subtlest state of the mind.

In every living being all the spheres &ndash; right from the Ka&#x301;mamaya to the Hirammaya kos&#x301;a &ndash; are to be meditated upon. The knower behind the meditative power of the mind is the A&#x301;tman. The relationship of the A&#x301;tman and the mind is that of a subject and an object. The mind is the thinking subject of the body and the A&#x301;tman is the knowing subject of the mind. Then, are there really innumerable souls and what is the difference amongst them? The difference is that a soul is taken in different aspects due to the difference in its objects. When there is a singular knowing entity (Sagun&#x301;a Brahma) behind all minds, then taking the collective view Brahma is the knower of all the knowers in the perishable and imperishable states (i.e. within or without the influence of Prakrti) of the Jiiva. Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is the knower, the perishable and the imperishable. He who is absolutely perishable and absolutely imperishable is Brahma. The fragmentary or reflected perishable, or fragmentary or reflected imperishable is Jiivabha&#x301;va. Nirgun&#x301;a is neither perishable nor imperishable. It&#146;s beyond these. It is absolutely liberated. Does Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (Collective Imperishable) have no influence over the unit imperishable? Most certainly it has.<!-- /block --></p>

What is the object of a Jiiva (unit soul)? Suppose I am Ram or Shyam. Now Ram and Shyam look upon the world with their own respective viewpoints. The mind takes the shape of its object. When the mind makes Him its object, it is transformed into Him. By suffusing itself with Cosmic feelings it attains infinitude and sees the entire universe contained in Him. It has been said in the scriptures: &ldquo;Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati.&rdquo; (The knower of Brahma becomes Brahma.) When the unit &ldquo;I&rdquo; is transformed into the collective or Cosmic &ldquo;I&rdquo; then the Atman attains oneness by fusing into the soul of the collective &ldquo;I.&rdquo; That is, it unifies or becomes one with the A&#x301;tman of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

Crude matter forms the object of enjoyment of the mind. On account of the crude matter being its object of enjoyment, the mind itself becomes crude. Humankind&#146;s primary concern regarding food and clothes is the concern of Ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a and inevitably the mind is in association with crude objects.

<a name="39..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Human beings advance from subtle to the subtlest or degenerate from crude to the crudest, according to their own propensity. Many isms are based on the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a. In one socio-economic theory, the economic factor is the only factor. But the Ka&#x301;mamaya is only one Kos&#x301;a. Even trees also possess Ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a and that is why they derive their vital energy from the earth, water and air. Where the Annamaya Kos&#x301;a dominates, all the remaining kos&#x301;as are dormant. The mind identifies itself with crude objects and therefore has no &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. For this reason, the A&#x301;tman is also devoid of perception. While the mind is sleeping in the dormant or latent state, it does not permit the Jiiva&#x301;tman, which is but a reflection of Parama&#x301;tman, to reveal itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Confinement to the Annamaya Kos&#x301;a tends to crudify a person since it does not allow for psychic elevation. There is some scope for discussion of philosophical controversies, which have arisen with respect to the Mamomaya Kos&#x301;a, On account of mental difference, different philosophical thoughts have sprung up e.g. Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Christianity, and so on. Only in spirituality do we find discussions on subjects from the subtle to the subtlest, including the A&#x301;tman. The mind is the object of A&#x301;tman. To attain A&#x301;tman, blend the mind with its original subject. Unify the object with the subject. The relationship between them is the same as between you and your hand. There is only one way to self-realisation and that is to fuse the mind with the knower of the mind and eliminate the crude manifestation of the A&#x301;tman. How is this possible? It is only possible by the introversion of the tendencies, which can be achieved through knowledge and Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. It is not possible to be introverted until each and every cell (kos&#x301;a) is realized. When the mind realizes that the physical body is the vehicle of the mind, then you will know that there is progress in Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In other words it is necessary to have perfect conception of each kos&#x301;a and for this it is necessary to know where one kos&#x301;a ends and another begins. There are two minds &ndash; one immature and the other mature; one introverted, the other extroverted. Only the knowledge of these five Kos&#x301;as (pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;as) can be the perfect knowledge. Take a ripe mango, for example. Although the pulp and the seed of a ripe mango remain together they are in fact, separate. Ripeness means perfection.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->This is the difference between Dharma and Sectism. Dharma makes each Kos&#x301;a perfect and enables a person to achieve perfection in Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Only through the achievement of perfection are different portions differentiated from the original stuff. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is based on philosophy and supported by logic. In olden times people were under the impression that the world was comprised solely of matter and they never thought to go beyond the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a. Had they contemplated a little deeper, they would have realized that they were totally mistaken. Similarly, many modern philosophies are solely materialistic. Their propounders did not fully apply their minds and hence they cannot be deemed to be perfect philosophies. Only those philosophies which carry us to the highest levels of the soul by observing every current of the mind are the real philosophies. The rest are only academical logics.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->What is sectism, mazhab or religion? Some people encourage us to worship idols, others encourage us to have a dip in the Ganges. All these things are created within the mind and are destroyed there. Happiness and heaven, afflictions and hell &ndash; all are mental conceptions in the physical world. They are all destroyed in the Mamomaya Kos&#x301;a. The proponents&#146; souls are confined to the Ma&#x301;nomaya Kos&#x301;a and they are &ldquo;Bhuktaye na tu muktaye&rdquo;, seekers of enjoyment and not the seekers of salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Some sects hold that happiness comes after death, but who will enjoy that happiness? The mind, of course. But where does the mind go after the destruction of its vehicle &ndash; the physical brain? Who will enjoy the pleasures? The A&#x301;tman pervades as an indivisible form, as an all-knowing entity. There is no A&#x301;tman in the grave, nor does the question of its waking up arise. In such sectism the Manomaya Kos&#x301;a is called the soul, however if there is only the soul, then there would be no fear of pain or pleasure.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="39..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Ordinarily sectisms terminate in the Ma&#x301;nomaya Kos&#x301;a. Idolatry can elevate a person up to the A&#x301;tima&#x301;nas Kos&#x301;a, but no further. Many persons aspire to achieve happiness by devoting themselves to idolatry. They do not aspire to get absorbed in Paramatman and remain close to Him. Buddhism rises above this, since it also provides for the annihilation of samska&#x301;ra. Annihilation of the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feelng is called merging into the Supreme. Buddhism does not recognize the soul, but speaks of annihilation of the ego; but who will annihilate the ego? It is the ego which will obliterate the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling. So egoism then, must be considered as the subtlest expression of mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The subtlest expression of mind is in the Hiran&#x301;maya Kos&#x301;a, which is the first expression of Mahattattva. Establishment in this Kos&#x301;a in a universal manner is Savikalpa  Sama&#x301;dhi. When after emerging from the Sams&#x301;kara, the Hiran&#x301;yamaya merges in attributeless Brahma, then this is called Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi. Those who have attained the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a will say that it is not proper to steal since, if we steal, others may also steal from us. This is the trend of thought of the materialists. Their thinking is distorted with selfishness. One should not steal for the sake of keeping the mind pure. That is the correct approach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;as shall have to be perfected, but how is it possible? They can be consummated only through the practice of Yama and Niyama. The Annamaya Kos&#x301;a is perfected through A&#x301;sanas (physical postures). Yama and Niyama Sa&#x301;dhana perfect the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a. The Manomaya Kos&#x301;a is perfected through Pra&#x301;na&#x301;ya&#x301;ma. Through Pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra the Atima&#x301;nasa Kos&#x301;a is perfected. The Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nmaya Kos&#x301;a is perfected through Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; and the Hiran&#x301;maya Kos&#x301;a through Dhya&#x301;na. Only Dhya&#x301;na Sama&#x301;dhi gives access to the soul. Pious persons are those who are earnest in their efforts to perfect the Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a. Human existence consists of the five kos&#x301;as and spiritual practice is eightfold. This spiritual practice is Dharma. That which does not provide for the explanation of the Pain&#x32D;cakos&#x301;a is not Dharma, but sectism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="39..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Why is As&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;un&#x32D;ga Yoga called Dharma? The purpose of Dharma is to attain perfect happiness and perfect happiness is the attainment of the soul, there being only partial happiness in each Kos&#x301;a. So long as the soul is not attained every Kos&#x301;a has to be perfected. Each Kos&#x301;a has to be taken care of. One Kos&#x301;a cannot be perfected to the exclusion of the rest. Where there is perfect happiness there is Dharma. Everything else yields only partial happiness and is therefore sectism. Sectism leads to preya (superficial and immediate gains) and only Dharma leads to Shreya (ultimate and real gains.) Everything else leads to crudeness. Dharma leads to Supreme Consciousness and only that which upholds and sustains the soul is Dharma. The Dharma of fire is to burn and the Dharma of living beings is to attain happiness. Where there is pursuit of Preya there is Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya. The happiness of heaven and the fear of hell are creations of the mind. Dharma has no fear since through Dharma one attains the original state. A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga alone is Dharma and all the rest are sectisms.<!-- /block --></p>

The Supreme Being is calling you in the roar of the ocean, in the thunder of the clouds, in the speed of lightning, in the meteor&#146;s flaming fires. Nothing good will come from  idleness. Get up and awake the clouded chivalry of your dormant youth. It may be that the path is not strewn with flowers and that inferiority complex will be attempting to hold fast your each advancing step, but even then you have to proceed onwards tearing the shroud of darkness. You will tear the thick darkness of despair as you advance in the racing chariot radiant with the Sun&#146;s brilliance towards the attainment of the Supreme state.<!-- /block --></p>
