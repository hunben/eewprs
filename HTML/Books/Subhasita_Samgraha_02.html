<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In ancient times when the desire to worship awakened in the minds of the primitive people for the first time, at that initial stage they took men of great wisdom and strength as the objects of their adoration. Before this they had been Nature-worshippers or physiolaters. When their mental hunger was no longer satisfied by the worship of mountains and rivers, trees and creepers, forests and seas, dawn and dusk, or thunder and lightning they took their first step towards the contemplation of God through the medium of hero-worship. As a result, a kind of incarnation doctrine came into being, ascribing full Brahma-hood to an aspect of manifestation. This practice was adopted in the name of religion, and was popular in society for many generations after. But the urges of the human heart are limitless. The desire to know their inner nature led human beings to the philosophical path, and as a result of philosophical dissertation and discussion their way of thinking gradually changed. They began to think how it was possible to attain the beginningless, indivisible, super-exultant self through such unit-worship &ndash; through the worship of the finite. When the realization dawned in their minds, they felt a great agitation &ndash; a mighty inner stirring in their hungry hearts, a longing to know the beginningless, endless, unmanifest, all-pervading Entity. How and what is that which the mind will apprehend with its entire being?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The first hint of Brahmabha&#x301;vana&#x301; or intuitional science was mentioned in the ancient writing of the Rgveda. That first seed grew into a huge tree in the Yajurveda with numerous branches and twigs. At that auspicious moment, human intellect saw through the radiance of its supra-mundane knowledge, through its clairvoyance, that whatever it wanted in the material world emanates from and belongs to the Supreme Absolute Bliss &ndash; all are but the unit-manifestations of the Supreme Entity. None of these are its whole self. But it cannot neglect these units, for they, too, are not outside it. They too, are an inseparable part of the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The common people could not grasp the deep Brahmatattva or Intuitional Theory, and so they tried to hold on to the superficial, extroversial trappings of religion such as sacrifices, rites and rituals, making them the medium for their religious expression. But wise and educated people realized that as a result of this worship of the crude, people with a developed intellect and consciousness would gradually revert towards crudeness and gradually be transformed into crudeness. We must however admit that it is not possible to give up the effort to attain the crude in the form of physical necessities. Nevertheless, having food and clothing and other physical needs cannot completely satisfy the hunger of the human heart. At different times human beings have gone without clothes or anything for years or voluntarily renounced the world when it proved antagonistic to the deepest urges of their heart. So it will not do for human beings to think only of providing themselves with the crude necessities. If anybody leads this type of life, they will never experience bliss &ndash; they will always feel inside them the aching void of the desert.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So human beings concluded after due cogitation: since it was not possible to give up the units and since they would have to go in for the &ldquo;whole&rdquo; after all, they would just as well forestall their attachment for the finite by always keeping awakened in their minds, even while making use of the units, a sense of their being the image of that very Supreme Spirit. The pleasure-ward trend of the attachment would then be diverted towards the Bliss-ward course itself. By ascribing divinity to everything and thereby eliminating the limitedness of its littleness, humans would realize and enjoy the Supreme Bliss. In the Va&#x301;jasaneyii Samhita&#x301; (Code) of the Yajurveda it is said, &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Isha&#x301; va&#x301;sysamidam&#x301; sarvam&#x301; yat kiin&#x32D;ca jagatya&#x301;m&#x301; jagat<br>Tena tyaktena bhuin&#x32D;jiitha&#x301;ma&#x301; grdhah kasyasviddhanam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This world is changing, moving. The word jagat (world) is derived from the root, gam-kvip, which means moving. This universe is the psychic manifestation of Brahma. All thought processes are moving and restive, and that is why this world, the psychic manifestation of Brahma. All thought processes are moving and restive and that is why this world, the psychic manifestation of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (the Subjectivated Transcendentality), is moving and restive. A thing that appears beautiful today is not necessarily so tomorrow. A sandesh (sweetmeat) that is delicious today will not be fit for consumption after a few days. Indeed one cannot even vouch for its shape still being intact. Every unit is in a state of change, and that is why the pleasure derived from unit objects cannot last permanently. So what should a Sa&#x301;dhaka (spiritual aspirant) do? He or she must ascribe divinity to every unit object. Everything is the manifestation of God. Whether it is land, home, river, mountain, respect, insult, day or night &ndash; everything is He and His manifestation as a unit. Make proper use of all objects thinking that they are His gifts to us. To enjoy or endure anything is to enjoy or endure Him. Avoid the attraction of the unit and make contact with the integral whole. When you are able to live this way, the desire to steal the property of others will completely disappear. In Ananda Marga there is a special process through which one can dedicate everything to God. The ascription of divinity to objects means the pursuit of the Infinite, leaving the finite behind. Are you feeding your son? No, no, you are feeding the son-like manifestation of Brahma. Are you tilling the field? No, no you are serving the finite manifestation of Brahma with your plough. Really speaking, the ascription of divinity to objects precludes their material enjoyment, as the objects then merge in the non-material Supreme Brahma. Thus the mind of one, who has established him or herself in real Vaera&#x301;gya (the renunciation of all sensual pleasures) can never become attached to finite objects. Even in their midst he or she remains beyond the reach of their attraction and gains eternal peace after death.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Here the spider represents the little unit, the Sa&#x301;dhaka.

<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Life is intimately bound up with work If people do their work ascribing divinity to each object they are involved with, then, because of their non-attachment to material pleasure, they cannot be bound by the reactions of their actions. Life also cannot be the cause of such bondage, nor for that matter can the reactions of one&#146;s actions be the cause of future lives. Otherwise a person who lives a long life will perform many actions, thus creating many reactions of greater sorrow to be experienced, and one will be a victim of the actional cycle life after life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Always ideate on Brahma and nurture the desire to live for a hundred years.

<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The ascription of Brahmahood to all activities is only possible for a Sa&#x301;dhaka &ndash; it is only possible through spiritual practices or the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the a&#x301;tman (soul). To establish oneself in Brahma is not possible through the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the mind, racing up and down at the beck and call of the senses. The person who busies himself with the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of the mind instead of that of the A&#x301;tman&#x301; is, in fact running after darkness or an uncertain future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Asu&#x301;ryya&#x301; na&#x301;ma te loka&#x301; andhena tamasa&#x301;vrta&#x301;h;<br>Ta&#x301;m&#x301;ste pretya&#x301;bhigacchanti ye ke ca&#x301;tmahano jana&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Those who are sensually and materialistically inclined destroy themselves because through their actions they deny their own souls. Whether they profess to recognize the existence of the soul or not, their actions are certainly detrimental to their self-development. In this material world you may have come across many people who acknowledge the existence of Brahma, who say that they recognize the existence of soul, argue over it and are not afraid even to shed blood for the preservation of their religion, yet in their individual lives they are always chasing after sensual pleasures. They are of the above type. They gradually drift away from light towards darkness, regressing from a developed human life towards animal life. Although they have attained a human body, they have not shown any interest in behaving in a way that is worthy of a human being. The foremost duty of a human being is Brahma-sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or the worship of God.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Essentially the soul and the Supreme Soul are the same. It is the objects of the mind that are different. A person whose mind has accepted the Infinite as its object has indeed identified himself with the Supreme Soul. Now the question may arise; when the Supreme Soul is infinite in nature, how does the distorted idea of individuality come about, and what relation is there between the unit-soul and this observable world? The Dharma or characteristic of an individual is to advance from the finite towards the infinite, from a part to the whole. This characteristic emanates from the desire to attain happiness &ndash; for self-preservation. As long as the goal is not limitless, one cannot gain the eternal happiness of all the imaginable and unimaginable entities. The Supreme Soul alone is beginningless and endless, and that is why limitless happiness is only possible through the Supreme Soul. The pain of losing unit objects is far greater than the pleasure they give us. The suffering that one sees in the world is merely the pain caused by that loss. But a persons of wisdom are never affected by the pain of loss for they know that the cause of all suffering is one&#146;s own Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. These Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are the reactions resulting from one&#146;s actions, past and present.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra born of pleasure and pain or the consequential momentum that creates the state of microcosmic subjectivity in the Macrocosmic Consciousness and stamps the Integral Body with the seal of limited unit-hood, has got its rudimental cause in the Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras acquired by the Supreme Being in the state of bondage. Actually, it would be more accurate to call it the mental reflection of action and reaction instead of calling it the distortion of the Supreme Soul.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The individuality of the unit is not complete in itself. So until one merges in the Whole Entity, one&#146;s suffering cannot be alleviated. I have already said that the Sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s sufferings are caused by the Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which one created oneself. One should therefore not be afraid of experiencing these reactions or accuse Brahma of injustice on this account. Humans very often complain, &ldquo;God, so you had this in store for me. Is this my reward for so much worship and so much charity?&rdquo; Such complaints are foolish, even sinful. At the time of suffering a Sa&#x301;dhaka should reproach himself for his past misdeeds and refrain from evil actions in order to avoid more suffering in the future. Everyone should bear in mind that as long as the fire of woes is not extinguished &ndash; so long as the Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are not burned one has got to suffer. That is why I say you must not find fault with others because of your Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras; they are merely the reactions caused by your own mistakes and misbehaviour. Do you not see in the reflection the same wreath that you put around the neck of a shadow? Poet Vidya&#x301;pati said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Countless miles and ages lie<br>Life to life, between me and Him.<br>Dogged by Fate and here am I!<br>The fault not His, but mine and grim,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Don&#146;t get upset over your suffering and difficulties. Learn from your painful experiences and acts, and behave wisely in your next life. Accept the beginningless and endless entity as the object of your ideation and behave accordingly.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->He is the only entity which does not move. Where there is no difference of places, there is no movement. How can the all-pervading entity in whom everything exists, have movement? He is faster than the mind, as the motive force that exists in His psychic body, i.e. the motive force of His thought process, dictates the movements of all the entities of the world; it is from this that they get the impetus to move. The senses are not capable of understanding. This is because the movement of the senses is towards objects, and so-called motionless objects are merely external forms of His mental expressions, His efferent thought-waves. His Blissful Entity is resplendent in its original state beyond the sphere of the mind. It is because of the cognitive Entity that life and energy exist in the world and that all processes of creation are continuing in a planned way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Tadejati tannaejati tad du&#x301;re tadvantike;<br>Tadantarasya sarvasya tadu sarvasya&#x301;sya ba&#x301;hyatah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->He is moving. No, no, He is not. He is motionless like the stump of a tree. He is far away. No, no, He is not. He is very close. He is the life of my life. He is within you and me. He is inside and outside everything everywhere. When a Sa&#x301;dhaka becomes well-acquainted with His Blissful Entity, we say that he or she is established in Brahma. At that stage there is both internal and external unity. The mind remains indifferent to worldly attractions and one makes real acquaintance with the Supreme Being. Although the body remains in the mortal world, the soul is merged in the Supreme Soul. The mind then becomes unrecognizable. Whose mind is it after all? Poet Cand&#x301;ida&#x301;sa has written, &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->What pangs reside in Radha&#146;s heart,<br>Unlistening she sits alone in solitude.<br>Even in reverie, her eyes fixed, skyward rest<br>Like a saffroned recluse, averse to food.<br>Unleashing strands, she watches the braid<br>Of her hair rich and flower-bedecked<br>With smiling gaze at the clouds staid<br>She whispers something with hands outstretched.<br>Like a pavonine couple, with eyes unmoved,<br>Exchanging thoughts with passioned glance,<br>Wooing Kaliya as though renewed,<br>Candidasa says, a novel stance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->This manifestation of this observable world is called Sain&#x32D;cara or Extroversion during its movement from the subtle to the crude, and the movement of the created units and the world from the crude to the subtle is called Pratisain&#x32D;cara or Introversion.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Thus goes the cycle of evolution from the subtle to the crude and from the crude to the subtle. The movement of the unit is from the crude to the subtle. The path comprised of the extroversial movement away from and the introversial movement towards Brahma, is called the Brahmic or Cosmic System, which is revolving under the forces of Sain&#x32D;cara and Pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Under the influence of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; (Introversive Force or Force of Macrocosmic attraction) the unit activates the centripetal or introversive momentum of His thought-process through his Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and by worshipping Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; (Extroversive Force or Force of microcosmic distraction) he extends the centrifugal or extroversive action of His thought-process and prolongs its duration. In Vidya&#x301; cognition predominates, whereas in Avidya&#x301; there predominates action (Vidya&#x301; is a Cognitive force, and Avidya&#x301; is an activating force devoid of cognition). Cognition and action should be balanced in the life of a Sa&#x301;dhaka, or else it will be difficult to move towards Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

People with calm and collected intellect, Sa&#x301;dhakas with developed intuition, who could very well understand such things due to their judgment, have made the above declaration with regard to Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301; i.e. salvation is not possible through the cultivation of only one of these two principles. For the attainment of salvation, there must be balance between Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301; to move forward. Although the movement towards Brahma must be introvertive (Vidya&#x301;), one should not give up Avidya&#x301; completely in relation to the practical world. This also has got to be made compatible with one&#146;s own spiritual way of life by ascribing normal and divine bearing to it. Here the balance between Vidya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301; refers to the equitable conduct and behaviour during the period of material enjoyment.<!-- /block --></p>

The Sa&#x301;dhaka or the practitioner of intuitional science gets installed in Him, and with His bearing the sa&#x301;dhaka eventually identifies himself with hIm. In that bearing of His abides the splendour of all-fulfilment &ndash; the seed of all-knowingness. &ldquo;Tatra niratishavam sarvajin&#x32D;avijam.&rdquo; The Supreme Being has no crude body. He is absolutely faultless, pure, sinless, all-mighty, all-observing, all-knowing, self-controlled and Svayambhu&#x301; or self-creating. He is not comparable to anything or anyone &ndash; &ldquo;Na tasya pratima&#x301; asti,&rdquo;, i.e., He has no image. In Him there is unlimited forgiveness. From the very beginning He has been giving everything to the units and will continue to do so. Such, is the attitude of that Great Being. One who is dazzled by the superficial splendour of His creation and gets entangled in it through one&#146;s extroversial tendencies forgets the great, noble Creator behind this creation. Is it not foolish to forget the Lord of the creation for the created? Mother is cooking. The son suddenly cries for his mother. Mother gives him a toy, and the son is so fascinated by the toy that he forgets all about his mother. But when a son does not forget his mother and stop crying in spite of the toy in his hand, then the mother is compelled to embrace him and take him on her lap.<!-- /block --></p>

Scientists who are wholly and solely dedicated to the worship of Sambhu&#x301;ti and hermits who live in constant fear of destruction are both on the wrong path: they are not on the path of salvation.

In each of the five different stages of mind i.e. (1) Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a (Crude or Conscious mind), (2) Manomaya Kos&#x301;a (Subtle or Sub-conscious mind, (3) Atima&#x301;nas Kos&#x301;a (Supra-mental mind), (4) Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya Kos&#x301;a (Subliminal mind), (5) Hiran&#x301;yamaya Kos&#x301;a (Subtle-Cosmic Mind) &ndash; (the last three are collectively called causal or astral or unconscious mind) some sort of finite object directly or indirectly remains, and this object becomes the cause of bondage &ndash; &ldquo;Mana eva maus&#x301;ya na&#x301;m ka&#x301;ran&#x301;am bandha moks&#x301;ayo&rdquo;. In other words the unit attains salvation only when she/he empties her/his mind of all objects. Just as an iron sword can perform acts of cruelty or merely cut the rope tethering and animal, similarly, according to its objective tendencies, the mind can also be the cause of both bondage and liberation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->All unit objects are external. Love for such unit objects can never be lasting, for the mind always keeps hopping from one object to another. That is why I say, withdraw your love from the unit and merge yourself in the whole. Don&#146;t mistake the unit for the soul or God. The attainment of one&#146;s inner self is only possible through love for the Infinite. Don&#x301;t pretend to be inferior and as a result become lazy. Fill your heart with love of the Infinite, and your soul will be transformed into the Supreme Soul. No worldly happiness is limitless. Dedicate yourself completely to the blissful ocean of the Supreme Soul. Then alone will you realize what happiness really is. This path to attain happiness, this Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of self-surrender I call absolute devotion. Carry on performing your worldly duties with sincerity, and at the same time think about the pure self within you. Then alone will your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; be justified. The constant thought of your pure inner Self will certainly one day establish you in your original source, and this is the ultimate aim of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The Soul is by nature characteristically pure. The mind gets tied to Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (potential reactions) due to its actions, and that is why the unit becomes the slave of life and death. When all the Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are destroyed through spiritual Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and mental purification, one goes beyond life and death to the eternal region of immortality, where there is no difference between the soul and His Supreme Soul. Amen!<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Vedas are the unique manifestation of human intellect. The etymological meaning of the word &ldquo;Veda&rdquo; is knowledge. This knowledge is of two types. One type is subject to time, space, and person, and the other is the realization of the self, independent of all subjections. The former is called Relative Knowledge or Apara&#x301;jin&#x301;a&#x301;na, because it is related to objects, and the latter, spiritual Knowledge or para&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Here the word, Veda, is of course used in the sense of spiritual knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Last Shra&#x301;van&#x301;ii Pu&#x301;rn&#x301;ima&#x301; I told you some thing from the Shukla-Yajurveda. Today I will tell you something from the Atharva Veda. Learned persons say that there is nothing important in the Atharva Veda. It is only a collection of mantras or incantations about ghosts and spirits, composed by people in prehistoric times. It is up to you to judge the veracity of the opinion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->One day, Vaedarbhi, the son of Bhrgu, asked the learned sage Pippala&#x301;da, &ldquo;My Lord what is Intuitional Science (Brahmavijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na)? What is the relation between Brahma and the world? Please tell me something about them.&rdquo; The sage replied:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Ara&#x301;iva rathana&#x301;bhao pra&#x301;n&#x301;e sarvam&#x301; pratis&#x301;t&#x301;itam<br>Rco yaju&#x301;m&#x301;si sa&#x301;ma&#x301;ni yajin&#x32D;ahks&#x301;atram&#x301; Brahma ca.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Just as the spokes are attracted to the hub of a wheel, similarly every object in this universe is Brahma-centric and thus has kept up its individual existence. The nucleus of the Cosmic System is the source of all entities from the highest of created being down to the lowest insect. Rk. (Incantations), Yaju (invocations), Sa&#x301;ma (songs) or the individuals engaged in Viprocita or Ksa&#x301;trocita service (i.e. service befitting a Brahmin or a Ks&#x301;atriya) &ndash; all are dependent on Brahma, the source of their existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Praja&#x301;patishcarasi garbhe tvameva pratija&#x301;yase<br>Tubhyam&#x301; Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a praja&#x301;stiima&#x301; balim&#x301; haranti yah pra&#x301;n&#x301;aeh pratitis&#x301;t&#x301;hasi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The word, Praja&#x301;, means evolved objects. Brahma is of course Praja&#x301;pati or the Lord of evolved objects for He is the controller of all of them. Praja&#x301;pati-brahma&#x301; moves about in the womb as the embryo and when it is born, the event, in fact, should actually be called the reflex birth of Brahma instead of His birth, because all created entities are merely manifestations of Brahma Himself. For instance, there is only one moon, but its reflection falling in the countless footprints of cows (Gos&#x301;pada) appears as countless moons. No new moons are created. The same moon is being reflected in several receptacles. Similarly one Brahma is manifesting Himself over an infinite number of units in countless mental receptacles. Brahma is Absolute Bliss. That is why the units or microcosms are always racing with the help of their sensory and motor organs towards their inner selves, i.e. towards the attainment of happiness. So it is said that knowingly or unknowingly the units are moving towards Him to attain Him, filled with inspiration from Him. (Several times in the Atharva Veda the word, &ldquo;Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;, has been used to mean Purus&#x301;a and the word, &ldquo;Rayi&rdquo; to mean Prakrti).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Deva&#x301;na&#x301;masi bahn&#x301;itamah pitrn&#x301;am&#x301; prathama svadha<br>Rs&#x301;iin&#x301;a&#x301;in&#x32D;caritam&#x301; satyamatharva&#x301;ungirasa&#x301;masi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Here the word, Deva, means the carrier of sensations, i.e., organs and nerves. Through the organs and nerves the body expresses a sensation or feeling and that is why they are called Devas or gods of the microcosmic body. But these organs and nervous systems are completely dependent on the spine for their existence and functions. Sensation is transmitted along the spine and that is why without a spine the unit would be a motionless, inert, fleshy mass. The above Shloka declares that, what spine is to the unit, Brahma is to the universe. Without Brahma the universe would be utterly destroyed, the seed of the imagination would be completely obliterated. According to an ancient custom, the death rites in honor of the deceased used to be performed by using Svadha&#x301; mantra (i.e., an invocation chanted while offering a sacrifice to the spirits of the dead). That is why, it is said that Brahma, as the first and foremost point in order of succession, is as important to all mundane objects as the first recipient of obsequial oblations is to the subsequent ones. To the sages He is as sacred as the vow of truthfulness. By Rs&#x301;is or sages I mean those who have hastened the advancement of human civilization by inventing or discovering things through their Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practices. Such sages make the base of their lives on truth; without truthfulness intellectual expansion towards the Supreme is not possible. Let us here discuss the meaning of the word, Truth. People generally use four words, Satya, Tothya, Samyak and Rta synonymously or in an identical sense. But in reality there is a great difference in their meanings. The English equivalents of Tathya, Samyak and Rta are &ldquo;Fact&rdquo;, &ldquo;Correct&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; respectively. But in other languages &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; (Truth) has no equivalent. The Philosophical meaning of the word &ldquo;Satya&rdquo;, is unchangeable, i.e., that which has no distortion, that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person. Human life progresses through different stages &ndash; from childhood to adolescence, from adolescence to youth, youth to old age and old age to senility. It is through these changes that people progress. That is why human life or its receptacle, the body, is not Satya&#x301; or Truth. There is yet another philosophical meaning of the word, &ldquo;Satya&rdquo;, which is Citsvaru&#x301;pa (the Supreme consciousness) or Purus&#x301;a. In the field of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice the meaning of &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; is &ldquo;Parahit&#x301;artham&#x301; va&#x301;unmanaso yatha&#x301;rthatvam&#x301; satyam&rdquo; i.e., Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others. No matter what meaning of &ldquo;Satya&rdquo; we accept, a benevolent sage has got to be truthful. The creation of one who has not learnt to regard the blissful, unchangeable Entity as the ultimate goal is no creation &ndash; is a veritable negation of creation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The great sage, Mahars&#x301;i Atharva&#x301;, who lived in ancient times, while he was practicing Brahma-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, was the first to gain intuitional knowledge by the grace of Brahma. He taught that knowledge to Mahars&#x301;i Aun&#x32D;gira&#x301;, who taught it to Satyava&#x301;ha. Satya&#x301;vaha in turn taught A&#x301;un&#x32D;girasa. So the sage says, Brahma, the source of all existing entities, is as important to them as Atharva&#x301;, the expounder of intuitional science, is to Aun&#x32D;girasa and his other students.<!-- /block --></p>

We call Him Rudra or the God of thunder, when He, as our friend, saves us from the jaws of calamities through His affectionate and tender touch. He exists everywhere; He is present about us sometimes as a sound, sometimes as a thought or emotion and sometimes as a crude individual entity.

No, all is He, all is He, all is He. The person whose apparent name is Dhruvajyotih, whom a son calls &ldquo;father&rdquo; for he sees in him a father-like manifestation, a father calls &ldquo;Dheva&rdquo;, for he sees in him a son-like manifestation, a school boy, &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;, for he sees in him a teacher-like manifestation, and a tongawalla, &ldquo;Hey, Topee&rdquo;, for he sees the Topee (cap) as the all-important thing, in reality, are these addresses such as &ldquo;father&rdquo;, &ldquo;sir&rdquo; or &ldquo;hey topee&rdquo;, so many different persons?

<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->There is nothing inanimate or insentient in this world; everything is animate and sentient. In some places consciousness is condensed and in other places it is uncondensed. Where consciousness is condensed, we say &ldquo;animate&rdquo; or &ldquo;sentient&rdquo;, and where it is uncondensed, i.e., where the influence of Prakrti is more predominant, we say, &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; or &ldquo;insentient&rdquo;. The difference between this so-called sentience and insentience is that the so-called sentient, due to its consciousness being condensed, is capable of controlling itself, but due to the uncondensed state of consciousness the so-called inert or insentient is entirely dependent on the wishes of Prakrti, i.e., it is compelled to behave according to the thought-process of the Macrocosmic Mind. This may stimulate a question in our minds. If the so-called inert object is subject to the wishes of the Cosmic Mind, then the Cosmic Grace must necessarily have to be on it only. If the sentient is capable of thought by itself, why should Brahma think for it at all? There is hardly any ground for Brahmic mercy to be showered upon it. The world is crude, and that is why He has kindly regulated its course of movements, so that it may not be smashed to smithereens by the impact of a comet. But to a sentient person He has allowed discretion to take poison or nectar. Is this consciousness then a curse to the living? No. To Him &ldquo;animate&rdquo; and &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; make no difference. He has no partiality for one or the other. The insentient do not work by themselves, and so they are not vulnerable to punishment or eligible for reward for vices or virtues, but the sentient attain the good or bad consequences of their acts&#8230; they experience pleasure and pain. Let one suffer or enjoy according to one&#146;s deed. He stands by His duties, why shouldn&#146;t He? With the birth of a child He provides milk in the mother&#146;s breasts, affection from the father and love from friends. Aren&#146;t these His mercies? After the scorching summer of the month of Vaesha&#x301;jha come the showers of the rainy season. These merciful showers are also His. From such changes rocks, iron or gold do not perceive pain or pleasure. It is living beings who endure or enjoy them. It is through these showers for their enjoyment that various things grow, and through them they all feel and enjoy the self-same Bliss Absolute, which Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. And so He has not only forgotten you, rather He gives you compassion and mercy for no compulsive reason &ndash; much more mercy perhaps than you even deserve.<!-- /block --></p>

Here the fruit-eating bird is the jiiva&#x301;tman or the unit soul, for the unit-soul is taking the exact impression of whatever auspicious or inauspicious (good or bad) fruits that grow in the mind-like tree, or is getting smitten by them, and the Supreme Soul, as the Knower of all mundane entities, is also perched on the same psychic tree, but He is not eating its fruit. He is just continuously witnessing as the Omniscient Entity. He is the Original Manifestation, and the jiiva&#x301;tman is His psychic reflection.<!-- /block --></p>

Now a part of your consciousness is changed into mind-stuff, and this mind-stuff takes the form of Monghyr. The remaining part of your mind-stuff remains as the witness of your mentally created Monghyr. Now the part of your consciousness which plays neither the role of a witness nor of being witnessed and yet remains as the knower of your observation, that subtle part or bearing, if taken in the Brahmic or theistic context, will be regarded as Purus&#x301;ottama.

The One Who is the ultimate refuge of each and everything, animate and inanimate, movable and immovable, from the Supreme creation&#8230; Brahma &ndash; to the lowliest blade of grass, is the supreme goal, the final beatitude. The universe has been created within Him and is indeed radiant with His radiance. That the universe is created within Him is not all that can be said. It is the transformation of His own Self. It is evolved by Him. He is the substance as well as the cause of this universe. It is the cooperative creation of the sixteenfold distortions (ten sensory and motor organs, the mind and the five Tanma&#x301;tras or inferences) and the eight binding factors of Prakrti that are there as the cause and effect of His qualitative manifestations. The seeds and potentials of this universe are also inherent in them. It is for this vastness that He has been called Brahma, which means Great (Brahatva&#x301;d Brahma). Then again the One who makes another great, the One with whose thought and bearing the small unit establishes itself in the vastness, is also called Brahma (Brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d Brahma). When this world is within Him, then He must necessarily be greater than the world. Suppose there is a box in a room; then the room must be greater than the box. That is why there is space for the box, otherwise it could not have been accommodated. That in which this universe is implanted is naturally greater than the universe. The entire universe is pivoting around its knower, its Nucleus, in a cyclic order in the vast body of Purus&#x301;a. Revolving thus in this cycle the one who progresses towards the knowing Entity by virtue of one&#146;s spiritual force attains unity with Him, becomes one with Him. They become Brahma themselves, and that is why He has the quality of making one great.<!-- /block --></p>

If we say Ra&#x301;ma has such and such qualities or Shya&#x301;ma has such and such qualities &ndash; aren&#146;t the individuals and their qualities two absolutely separate entities? Such distinctiveness is not applicable to limitless, integral, Brahma, who is without a second. Brahma and His radiance are not two separate entities, for He is autophanous &ndash; self-luminous.

The game of the three attributes goes on in everything and everywhere in the universe, and they have not spared the human body. The region below the navel is dominated by Tamogun&#x301;a (Static principle), the region from navel to throat, by Rajogun&#x301;a (Mutative influence) and the region from throat to Trikuti (the junction of the two eyebrows, where the seat of the mind is located,) by Sattvagun&#x301;a (Sentient influence). Normally, a particular region in the body becomes more active in accordance with the Vrtti or epithymetic influence or the inter- and intra-ectoplasmic occupation of an individual. When a Sa&#x301;dhaka is established in his/her mental seat by virtue of his/her hearing, thinking and profound meditation, he or she being then established in Sattvagun&#x301;a (Sentient quality), realizes the Supreme Being in His Super-white glory, as is the wont of Sentient quality. When one goes beyond the mental sphere, one merges in the objectlessness of the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma in the Brahmarondhra (An aperture in the crown of the head) and thus reaches beyond the scope of colors. Bharga or white color also disappears from him. A desireless person, who worships this Supreme Purus&#x301;a absolves himself from the momenta of rebirths due to mind being objectless or desire-free. Such an individual goes beyond the cycle of ordinary birth and death. In other words, one&#146;s mental force goes beyond the stars (&#146;Shukra&#x301; means Venus, a planet) due to one&#146;s being established in the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>

Even during the life-time as well it is seen that the mind-stuff of a drunkard, which imbibes within it an indomitable desire or Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra for wine, turns into a vantage ground for undergoing the next Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or momenta of pleasure and pain. That is to say, such a person gets scent of the wine shop by the sheer propulsion of his acquired mental propensity, if he happens to go to a new and unfamiliar place. A man who has cultivated dog-like or swine-like desires all his life, dies with the same dog-like or swine-like frame of mind. Thereafter with the help of Prakrti&#146;s Mutative force he acquires the form of a dog or swine in order to undergo the dog-like or swine-like Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. The great ascetic, King Bharata, died thinking of a fawn, and that was why it is written in the Pura&#x301;n&#x301;as (Indian mythologies) that he had to take the body of a deer at his next birth.<!-- /block --></p>

It has neither the power of action nor the sensation of mind. What is the reason? It is because hitherto there has been no manifestation of mind in the stone at all. Thought-wave or sensation can take place or an action can take a form only if there is a mind. Take, for instance, trees and plants which are more animate than stones. There are activities in them. They grow, draw the vital juice from the earth, maintain their species by creating seeds in their own bodies and enjoy and suffer pleasure and pain, when taken care of or smitten. We see in them the manifestation of consciousness or animation, for the mind has awakened in them. Thus progressing on the path of psychogenesis or mental development we see in humans the greatest manifestation. Just as during the Cosmic thought-process the evolution takes place from the subtle to the crude, similarly the unit retroverts step by step from the crude to the subtle, towards the same Absolute Consciousness from where it had come. It is just like the waves of the sea rippling back from the shore to the ocean from where they had originally come. Now, just how much should a person strive on his return journey? He has got to be alert, so that he may easily end the journey in his characteristic Self. Then alone shall we call him self-purified.

The word, Sannya&#x301;sa, means to dedicate oneself for the attainment of God. When Brahma is everything, whatever you are, you must behave properly with everything around you. Hence to be callous about family and society is completely contrary to Brahma Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (Divine Contemplation). One cannot know Brahma through showy, superficial knowledge. You can only attain Brahma, when your knowledge has become strong and powerful through austere devotion to Truth. Only the soul of the one whose knowledge is identified with austerity, enters the abode of Brahma.

So long as a Sa&#x301;dhaka does not attain Brahma, there exists in him a feeling of incompleteness. Suppose you want a thousand rupees. If you are given a thousand rupees, will you be contented? No, you will then ask for more. Such is the characteristic of human mind. Man has a limitless thirst. He keeps on harping ceaselessly, &ldquo;I am hungry.&rdquo; The hunger for a thousand will change into hunger for a lakh, and hunger for a lakh will make room for hunger for a crore. Thus the amount of hunger goes on increasing until a limitless amount of money is attained. This limitlessness is inherent in Brahma, and so your hunger can be satiated in Brahma alone. Hence when a &ldquo;Rs&#x301;i&rdquo; attains complete self-control (krta&#x301;tman), he goes beyond the sphere of attachment and detachment, and attains full realization of his characteristic Self. He becomes imperturbably tranquil, i.e. he reaches the stage which lies beyond the momentum of rebirth or regeneration. Attachment and repulsion exist so long as the proclivities of fascination and contempt exist. For instance, a puritanical sa&#x301;dhaka will consider wine as an object of disdain and will regard touching it as an act of impiety. A wine addict, however, regarding it as an object of greed, will run after it with total disregard for all social conventions and norms. But he who has become really desireless as the result of self-realization, will keep himself above these two. He will take wine as medicine under medical advice, otherwise he will carefully keep it away from the sight of people. He will have neither attachment nor aversion for the wine.<!-- /block --></p>

Pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita Ra&#x301;mana&#x301;tha of Navadvipa was a self-oblivious man. The King of Nadia, with a view to giving him some financial help, had once asked him, &ldquo;Are you in want of anything?&rdquo; The Pan&#x301;d&#x301;ita had then been absorbed in the world of ideas. He took the word &ldquo;want&rdquo; for his want of knowledge and replied, &ldquo;Yes, I did feel the want of an explanation of a shloka but now it is clear to me.&rdquo; The Maha&#x301;ra&#x301;ja&#x301; then said, &ldquo;No I am talking about want of money.&rdquo; Ra&#x301;mana&#x301;tha replied, &ldquo;Look, you had better ask my wife about domestic affairs.&rdquo; Then the Maha&#x301;ra&#x301;ja&#x301; enquired of the wife. As is husband, so is his wife. She informed the King point blank, &ldquo;Look, there is rice in the house and there are plenty of leaves on the tamarind tree. My husband relishes the stew of those leaves immensely. I don&#146;t know of any other necessity.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

The magician also sees the magic play but he does not get affected or overwhelmed. He only witnesses the play. Why? His only duty is to see if the play is being enacted properly. This world is also a magic play like this. Similarly the knower of Brahma only witnesses this game but he remains unaffected, by it. He remains unattached in spite of his being in the midst of the world, living beings etc., &ndash; in spite of his being in the midst of sufferings and enjoyments.

To a person of average intelligence water and ice are two different entities, but one who knows a little knows that ice is only a crudified form of water. Similarly where an average person sees a big difference between a pot and a potter or the religion and the religious, the knower of Brahma sees only the homogeneous oneness among them. Are the world and Brahma two different entities or are they indivisible? Is the one true and the other false? Is the difference that appears between the two, the truth or the lack of it?

He feels that there exists no second entity in the universe. &ldquo;No tasya pratima asti,&rdquo; i.e., He has no comparison. Comparison calls for two objects and this means that there are two Brahmas. Hence Brahma is incomparable. Brahma is beyond the scope of words and mind and yet even that verbally and mentally incomprehensible Brahma is attainable by effort. You have got to touch Him with your innermost heart of hearts, got to hold him with your intuition, got to attain him by merging your soul in the Supreme Soul. His body is not a quinquelemental, finite entity that you can see with your eyes. He is indeed subtler than the subtle, vaster than the vast. To see Him you have got to use the lens of knowledge, moving aside the blinding obstructions or bondage of Avidya&#x301; or the forces of microcosmic distraction. If a salt doll goes to fathom the sea, it will certainly melt and become the sea itself. Similarly if the knower of Brahma goes to fathom Brahma he will merge in the Sea of Brahma and become Brahma Himself &ldquo;Brahmavid Brahmaeva bhavati.&rdquo; Constantly absorbed in the thought of Brahma, you too will become Brahma. Constantly thinking of a cockroach you will eventually become a cockroach. You cannot see Him with your crude eyes, for He is super-sensual, He has no pedigree or family line. This is so because He is unborn, beginningless and without causality. He is shapeless and formless. He has no form, for to ascribe a form to Him would be to impose a limit of demarcation around the infinite entity. As soon as the limitless Brahma is given form and turned into a limited entity, He ceases to be Brahma or the Great.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a is with Uma&#x301;, Uma&#x301; means Prakrti His operative principle. Brahma is the combined name of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. When the influence of Prakrti expresses itself upon the Purus&#x301;a, the cosmic thought process goes into action and by virtue of this activation by Prakrti, the sound of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra can emanate. But when Prakrti is inactive, i.e., when Purus&#x301;a is predominant, in that case the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra&#x301; sound also stops. By a slight transposition of A. U. Ma the three constituent letters of the ideogram ([DEVANAGARI CHARACTER] or On&#x32D;m&#x301;), i.e., placing, &ldquo;A&rdquo; at the end, we get the word UMA&#x301;. That is why Umapati (Pati means husband) means Purus&#x301;a. Brahma, in conjucation with Prakrti, is the cause of creation. In a particular content He may also be called Iisvara, means Controller Brahma is the controller of the organs and their gods directly and indirectly. His cognitive eyes are not two but three, i.e., He is the seer of all the three &ndash; past, present and future. He is Niilakan&#x301;t&#x301;ha or blue-throated, i.e., the vast bluish sky is in the region of His throat. His initial extroversion or expansion from the subtle to the crude is the sky. The sky is of blue color and is capable of imbibing and carrying the sound. Hence Niilakan&#x301;t&#x301;ha is a very suitable epithet for Brahma. His throat is not limited and demarcated like that of a unit. The entire creation is within Him. His depth is unfathomable and hence He is calm and tranquil. Reaching the original cause of all elements by virtue of their meditation and ideation the sages eventually attained the very Brahma Himself. His place is above all extroversive forces. He is all-knowing, all-witnessing and self-effulgent.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn1">1</a></b>) Ra&#x301;hu being the head itself. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn2">2</a></b>)  Of the countless number of veins or tubular organs of the human body, thirty-three are most important. The controlling entities of these thirty-three veins or tubes are called thirty-three gods, vid, eleven Rudras, eight Vasus, twelve Adityas, Indra and Praja&#x301;pati. The Chief manifestation of the Cosmic Force is called Indra, which controls the human body entirely.<br> <br> (a) The eleven rudras: Ten organs (sensory and motor) and the mind. &ldquo;Rudra&rdquo; means that which makes one cry. At the time of death when all the organs merge into their corresponding counter-gods, the mind becomes inactive and the human body becomes still and immobile. Due to this near and dear ones of the dead person cry piteously. These eleven gods make the human cry, and hence they are called Rudras. <br> (b) The eight vasus: Vasu means the habitat of the units; that is to say, those that are receptacles, shelters, or objects of the organs are called Vasu. The sun, the moon, the stars, the sky, the ether, the air, the fire and the earth are the eight Vasus. <br> (c) The twelve A&#x301;dityas: A&#x301;ditya means Collector. Here it means that all those which takes or take away the consequences of deeds and life. Every moment the duration of life is being reduced, and the unit is being compelled to undergo the process of metamorphosis in order to enjoy or endure the consequences of his deeds. All these are taking place through the passage of time. Hence time is A&#x301;ditya, for it takes away the life and the consequential moments of deeds. The twelve months are the twelve A&#x301;dityas. <br> (d) Indra: Indra means lightning, thunder or actional force. <br> (e) Praja&#x301;pati: Praja&#x301;pati means Yajin&#x32D;a (sacrifice) or action.<br> <br> Some are of the opinion that the veins of the human body are uncountable. Others say that they are a few crores, as if they had counted them all. Many people say that the number of veins totals thirty three crores and so the gods are also of the same number. Truly speaking it is due to ignorance and blind faith that the controlling nerves and veins of the human body have been converted into thirty-three crores of gods, having so many different names and forms. Sham&#x301;kara said in reference to gods &ndash;<br> <br> &ldquo;Sarvadyotana&#x301;tmaka akhan&#x301;dacidaekarasah.&rdquo;<br> <br> Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;avalkya said &ndash;<br> <br> Dyotate kriidate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divi<br> Tasma&#x301;ddeva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<br> <br> The gods are of two kinds &ndash; (1) Daehik Devata&#x301; (the physical gods). The manifestation of soul is accomplished through the organs, and so the organs are called Daehik Devata&#x301; and (2) Brahmik Devata&#x301; (Cosmic gods through whom the whole universe is manifested and controlled). Both are thirty-three in number. Each of the Cosmic gods is the counter-god of the respective physical gods. These physical gods get merged into the counter-gods, which again merge in Brahma, and that is why the liberated Sa&#x301;dhaka becomes Brahma Himself.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn3">3</a></b>)  Author&#146;s footnote on the other two meanings of kula omitted here. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="3.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.3.fn4">4</a></b>)  It is the Supreme Brahma Who is the creator of the universe and to create is also an act. Where there is action, there is sound. The pran&#x301;ava or On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is indeed the sound of the creative thought-process of the Supreme Spirit and he who has merged himself in Brahma due to the absence of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra or reactive momentum, has attained a position even above Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Maheshvara. <br> Of the three letters (A, U, Ma) of the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra &ldquo;A&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x0985;</span>) is the seed of creations, &ldquo;U&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x0989;</span>) is the seed of stability or preservation and &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AE;</span>) is the seed of destruction. &ldquo;A&rdquo; being the creative alphabet, Brahma is called Brahma&#x301; (Brahma + a) in reference to creation. Suppose a man&#146;s name is Ra&#x301;mbabu. His son will call him &ldquo;father&rdquo; and his pupil will call him &ldquo;sir&rdquo;; these are but the titles of Ra&#x301;mbabu applied to his specific occupational conditions, Actually Ra&#x301;mbabu is one, Sagun&#x301;a&#x301; Brahma imbibes three chief acts, viz., creation, preservation and destruction. These acts of creation, preservation and destruction are taking place in the psychic sphere of Brahma. With the termination of its thought process all the manifestations of these three kinds of acts will also cease. For instance, when we think of Bhagalpur, a clear picture of Bhagalpur gets projected on our mental plate and when we give up the thought of Bhagalpur, the picture of Bhagalpur gets lost in that very mental plate. If afterwards we cease to think at all, the mind also loses its existence. So Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Mahesh are the nomenclatures of the different psychic acts of Brahma Himself. When a Sa&#x301;dhaka, having gone beyond the mental stratum, gets ensconced in the immutable, pure Brahmic region, he certainly enjoys greater importance or superiority over these three gods. That state is the characteristic state of the unit &ndash; the supreme state of Shiva or Cosmic Transcendentality. Asked to reveal his identity, Lord Sam&#x301;kara&#x301;car&#x301;ya said &ndash;<br> <br> Manobuddhyaham&#x301;ka&#x301;ro cittani na&#x301;ham<br> Na ca shrotrajihave na ca ghra&#x301;n&#x301;a netre<br> Na&#x301;vyoma bhu&#x301;mirna tejo na va&#x301;yuh<br> Cida&#x301;nandaru&#x301;po&#146;shivo&#146;ham&#x301; shivo ham.<br> <br> That is,<br> <br> Not mind nor I-feeling nor ego am I<br> Nor ear nor tongue nor nose nor eye<br> Nor air nor earth nor sun nor sky<br> The Soul Eternal am I, am I.</p>

<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Matter or object is indispensable for the existence of the mind, for mind thrives on matter. Mind exists only as long as it is concerned with matter. As soon as it becomes objectless it dies. The unit mind accepts the unit objects around it as its objective or livelihood with the help of the organs. The unit entity cannot conceive any integral, infinite object in its mind. Brahma alone is integral, and other objects are but fractions of Him and can be brought within the jurisdiction of the mind. Take the Himalayas Mountain range for instance. The mind finds it difficult indeed to comprehend it straightway; although vast, but it is not limited, also only a part, and so it can be brought within the mental compass easily through the medium of a map. But we cannot draw a map or picture of the integral entity, Brahma. We cannot bind Him to an image from the ten directions. That is why the scriptures say, &ldquo;Na tasya pratima&#x301; asti&rdquo; i.e., He has no image. Mind cannot apprehend this integral Brahma, for every object that is encompassed by the mind is demarcable from the ten sides. To demarcate Brahma would be totally antagonistic to the concept of limitlessness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If holding or apprehending Brahma is beyond the capacity of the mind, how then can man attain Him? When, through spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the mind is gradually transformed from crude to subtle and goes on advancing on the path of withdrawal, it (the unit mind) gradually goes on surrendering itself unawares to it Hiran&#x301;yagarbha or subtle Cosmic mind. And when this self-surrender reaches its apex, the unit mind, i.e., the sense of Ra&#x301;ma, Shya&#x301;ma jadu, Madhu etc. meets its waterloo. What remains then is only the Supreme Mind of that Supreme Purus&#x301;a. This state is called Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi or determinate concentration of the mind. So we see that the first and last word of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice is total surrender of the unit mind to the Supreme Mind. Similarly when the unit mind has been dedicated to the Supreme Consciousness, and as the result of this there remains only an objectless unity, the Lord of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, this state is called Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi i.e., supersensual or total suspension of the mind. The first and last word of this Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; also is total surrender. To the unit mind Brahma is unthinkable,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->He is unimaginable, for He is beyond the sphere of imagination. Not only is he unimaginable He is also unmanifest because He is inapprehensible to the sense organs through sound, touch, form, taste, smell etc. Any object, having the above five qualities like sound, touch etc., no matter how huge it is apprehensible by the sense-organs. He is formless, as we cannot give a form to infinity. But then, is not this perceptible world His form? Yes, it is, but these countless forms of this observable world are but His psychic manifestations. Only unit entities are evolved in the sphere of His mind as the objects of the unit minds, whereas countless and endless, big and small unit entities are being created and recreated in the imagination of Brahma the possessor of the infinite mind.  Apparently they are His &ldquo;form&rdquo; in this observable world. But none of these forms of His psychic flow &ndash; none of these bubbles that are originating, rising and bursting are the ultimate entities. They are all progressing through spatial, temporal and personal changes with a view to merging in that Supreme Bearing, the Nucleus of the Thought-Cycle. That is why none of these mundane manifestations of Brahma can be taken to be permanent and held on to as such. No matter how charming or captivating a form of His may be, one day it must take its leave from us must go away to some unseeable region in response to the beckoning call of time, leaving us behind to rue and wail in profuse tears. So none of His unit forms can give us any perennial peace or real, abiding happiness. That is why a Sa&#x301;dhaka is taken aback at the sight of the infinite, manifest form of form of the infinite of the Infinite Brahma. Shrii Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; said &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->He is the selfsame Shiva. The word, Shiva, means Purus&#x301;a. It is also used in the sense of benevolence. Here &ldquo;Shiva&rdquo; is used in the latter sense, for his psychic manifestations. The evolved objects, are all employed for the good alone and so. He is Shiva, He is benevolent, He is the image of benevolence. Does He punish us to afflict us with pain and suffering? No, there too, His benevolent wishes abide. It is for the rectification of our character, that the benevolent penal dispensation is there. He is perfectly free from the stigma or darkness of Avidya&#x301;, etc. Hence He is perfectly in peace &ndash; in absolute tranquillity. The Avidya&#x301;-like gale creates stormy waves in the sea of the mind, destroying its equipoise and tranquillity. In the sea of Brahma shocks and clashes of Avidya&#x301; (forces of microcosmic distraction) or (distracting forces which act upon the microcosm) do not exist and so there is no wave at all. The more the Avidya&#x301; evolved ego, the greater the agitation of the waves &ndash; the greater the shallowness of its knowledge. One can observe that a Kanya&#x301;kuma&#x301;rii, on one side there are the surging waves of the Shallow Bay of Bengal and the calm serenity of the very deep Arabian Sea on the other, He is deathless and free from distortion mutation. Distortion cannot take place in an object, unless there is the influence of a second object or of an outside agency upon it. If you want to transform milk into curd you will have to mix some thing sour into it.  As nothing exists outside of Him, He precludes the possibility of being distorted by any outer influence or agency.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The word, Brahma means &ldquo;uniquely Great&rdquo;. He is the greatest of all &ndash; Brhattva&#x301;d Brahma, By absorption in His thought, all become Brahma, i.e., He has the power of making one and all Brahma &ndash; Brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->He is the original Cause of everything, for He has been creating the world in His mind by virtue of His imagination. He has neither beginning, nor middle, nor end, for He is indeterminate and infinite. If He had a beginning, it would not be possible to call Him endless and infinite. For one that has neither a starting-point nor a last point there cannot be a middle point. If he possessed those three aspects, there would have been a possibility of something else existing &ndash; a second entity beside Him, and such entities could have either existed before or after His point of origin. In such an event it would have been possible to apprehend Him through the mind and the organs, for in that case He would have been a mere entity made up of the five elements. If we consider an image to be God, then behind the pedestal, under His feet and habare the crown on his head, must some other entities exist. To call such an image beginningless and limitless is rank madness, for we can see both its first and last points and can also apprehend it by our minds, as well as by our organs. This is because it made of the quinquelemental ingredients like earth, stone, metal etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As everything is within His psychic body so He is the real Supreme Controller of everything. He is Consciousness &ndash; Bliss Absolute. All mental feelings are either pleasant or painful. When the mind remains associated with any object for a long time we call that state &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; and when it is repulsed by any absent (while is characteristically inimical) for long, we call such a state sorrow. When the mind is neither concerned with the feeling of happiness nor with that of sorrow, it ceases to exist. In such a state here remains only an objectless soul, when the soul revels in the happiness of the soul.  That is why He is the self-same Consciousness &ndash; the Bliss Absolute &ndash; the ever-blissful Spirit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->I have already said that limitlessness cannot be given particular form, therefore He is formless, and shapeless. The countless perceptible unit forms are all within the formless Whole aren&#146;t they? Differentially and severally they are so many countless forms but integrally, they are He, Who is beyond the ambit of forms. So sang the great Sa&#x301;dhaka, Ra&#x301;maprasa&#x301;da &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

He cannot be attained through any other means except through such a cosmic vision. Now the question arises as to how it is possible for a man to see all (elements) in him and him in them.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The word, aran&#x301;i, means mantra-sanctified wood used for sacrificial fires, by the friction of which people of olden days used to produce fire. The main wood was known as Aran&#x301;i and the striking wood by which the friction was to be accomplished was called Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. A&#x301;ran&#x301;i used to grow in the forest, the place of meditation for the Rs&#x301;is of those days. Metaphorically, one is advised to use one&#146;s soul as the Aran&#x301;i or [[main wood]]. But to light up the Brahmic fire it is necessary to have Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i or the striking flint for friction. Here the Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i is the Pran&#x301;ava or On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. The roots pra plus nu plus al make the word, Pran&#x301;ava. The root, &ldquo;Nu&rdquo; means to worship. That is to say, pran&#x301;ava is one by which worship is carried out in an excellent manner. The on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra-mantra itself is the pran&#x301;ava. It is after coming in contact with this excellent medium of worship that the Cosmic sentiment is roused in the soul. Many of you know that listening to the refrains of the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra-sound man gets lost in sama&#x301;dhi [the trance of absorption] &ndash; gets absorbed in Brahmabha&#x301;va [Cosmotheistic trance].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;That I permeate everything, that my ego or I-ness pervades the world&rdquo; &ndash; such a state of sentiment or thought, such a mental bearing is what is called knowledge. &ldquo;Stirring up this vast vista of knowledge by reasoning, I have come to understand that, from the spiritual standpoint, all that exists is Brahma and that I am all and everything.&rdquo; It is by such constant inculcation and practice of this sentiment alone (whose easiest method has been taught to you at the very outset of your Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;) that the empyrean fire of Brahma is lit and realized out of the contact between the soul-like Aran&#x301;i [[main wood]] and the Pran&#x301;ava-like Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i [[the striker]]. In other words this churning by reasonings represents the act of friction between the Aran&#x301;i and the Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. [[When]] the fire of Brahma is lit up in the heart, man&#146;s mind is freed from its fetters or pa&#x301;shas which are its chains of bondage. These pa&#x301;sha or fetters are eight in number:<!-- /block --></p>

During the time of determinate concentration the sentiment of &ldquo;I am Brahma&rdquo;, exists in the mind of the Sa&#x301;dhaka. In the Sam&#x301;skrta language the state of &ldquo;I am Brahma&rdquo; is called Pan&#x301;da&#x301;. The one who has Pan&#x301;da&#x301; is called Pan&#x301;dita.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->If Brahma is one and without a second (Ekameva advitiiyam), then why is there the distortion in Him? This question is quite natural and its answer is also very easy. Distortion comes on account of the Prakrti, the Operative Principle, and this distortion takes place within the Body of Brahma, not outside It. Hence on final scrutiny His oneness remains unassailed. The unit beings that have been in possession of the Cosmic Mind in part and that have been progressing within It, are also conscious of their smallness and this very sense of smallness is their individuality &ndash; unit-hood. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice means an effort to break through the barrier of this smallness, and Siddhi or beatitude is the state, wherein the barrier has been broken through. Under the influence of Prakrti there exist three conditions or states between the small conscious unit and the unfathomably great Brahma. These three conditions are wakefulness, dream and sleep. None of these three are permanent, for they are evolved by the influence of Prakrti&#146;s three gun&#x301;as or attributes, viz., Sattva (Sentient, Rajah (Mutative) and Tamah (Static). In all these three conditions macrocosm and microcosm remain apparently separate. But the influence of Prakrti being absent in the fourth condition, which is known as Turiiya (the state of non-duality) or Kaevalya (absolute identity with the divine essence), there remains no distinction between Brahma and the unit. Both are one consummate Whole, Wakefulness, dream and sleep &ndash; these three conditions feature in the game of evolution. It is to these three attributes, viz., Sattva (Sentient), Rajah (Mutative) and Tamah (Static) that Prakrti owes her creation. When the influence of Sattvogun&#x301;a (sentient attribute) is greater on Purus&#x301;a, He is called Ks&#x301;iira&#x301;vdhi or Ks&#x301;iirasamudra&#x301; or the Sea of Milk. The comparative condition in the unit is called the wakeful state. People generally think that Knowingness only exists in the awakened state. It is not correct. Knowingness does also exist during dream and sleep. I shall clarify this point for you later.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The part of Brahma, which is knowable, i.e., which has been objectivated under the influence of Prakrti, is called Ks&#x301;ara or decaying, i.e., when distortion has taken place, and that part of Brahma, does not undergo distortion itself but remains as the knower of the Ks&#x301;ara, whilst apparently involving itself with distortion, is called Aks&#x301;ara or undecaying. This Aks&#x301;ara remains intermingled with Ks&#x301;ara. The part of Brahma, which is neither Ks&#x301;ara nor Aks&#x301;ara and which bodily exists as the nucleus or the central point or sovereign point of the Cosmic System, is the Controller of both the knowable (Ks&#x301;ara) and the knower, (Aks&#x301;ara). He is not directly connected with anybody&#146;s action or its consequences &ndash; Him we call Supreme Soul or the Purus&#x301;ottama.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The word, Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, can also be used for Purus&#x301;ottama. &ldquo;Na&#x301;ra&#x301;&rdquo; means Prakrti (it is also used in the sense of devotion or water) and &ldquo;Ayan&#x301;a&rdquo; means refuge. So Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is used for Purus&#x301;ottama, since He is the refuge of Prakrti, the Operative Principle or Cosmic Energy. The Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a (Hindu Mythology) says Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is lying in the ocean of milk and Laks&#x301;mii (the Goddess of wealth and prosperity) is massaging His feet. I have already explained to you that Ks&#x301;iirasamudra&#x301; or the ocean of milk means he state of wakefulness of Brahma. Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a means Purus&#x301;ottama. He is lying, for He is the cognitive force. He has nothing to do except to think only &ndash; &ldquo;Pure shete yah sa puru&#x301;sah.&rdquo; Laks&#x301;mii massaging His feet, i.e., the introversive Prakrti is subservient to Purus&#x301;ottama. This great Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is beyond the purview of words and mind. To create His image is tantamount to sheer madness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->When the influence of the Mutative principle affects the Supreme Entity, He is called Garbhodaka or the Fluid of Creation. The corresponding state of the unit is called the state of dream. When the static Principle of Prakrti is manifest in the Supreme Purus&#x301;a, He is called Ka&#x301;rana&#x301;rn&#x301;ava or the sea of Causality. The corresponding state of the unit is called the state of sleep. Out of the Static condition of Brahma comes the first expression of the wakeful creation. That is why this condition is called Ka&#x301;rana&#x301;rn&#x301;ava or Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a Samudra&#x301;. Ka&#x301;rana means cause and Arn&#x301;ava means &ldquo;sea&rdquo;, the central point of which is the Purus&#x301;ottama, around whom the waves of the Sea of Creation are rolling and billowing with extreme alacrity &ndash; found the panoramic pageantry of Ks&#x301;ara Aks&#x301;ara is moving fast. Centering round the small egos, amidst the crowd of Ks&#x301;ara and Akas&#x301;ra sits the coolly cognitive Purus&#x301;ottama, the cosmic nucleus.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In the wakeful state the unit beings consider themselves distinct and separate from Brahma. In the dream state such a sense of distinction diminishes a little. In the &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; state it is still less. The fevers and frets of the small ego being absent in sleep, a sort of calm tranquil happiness or static passive pleasure is felt. But in the dreamful state where mind&#146;s internal sufferings and enjoyments go on as usual, such a pervasive sense of happiness cannot be felt due to the existence of various kinds of pains and pleasures.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Why are the unit entities more vulnerable to Avidya&#x301; (Force of Microcosmic Distraction) during the wakeful state? Because within their minds there are eight fetters and six passions, which are ever susceptible to the captivating charms and deceitful superficialities of the external world. Every mental action of his is vulnerable to both internal and external influences. Under the influence of the passions and fetters of their minds he races towards objects related to the body like, women, food, drinks etc., thinking them to be the objects of self-gratification. The Sa&#x301;dhakas (spiritual aspirants) have to scrupulously guard themselves against the glamour of these external baits. They have to be self-controlled. But will self-control be possible unless it becomes firmly established within their minds? It is certainly not possible by becoming a hypocritical Sa&#x301;dhu, tramping about with a smear of ashes on the body and a Kaman&#x301;da&#x301;lu (bowl) in hand. Without going in for the external paraphernalia and formalities one has to prepare oneself internally, maintaining the balance between the internal and the external? One has to remain alert so that the external environment will not be detrimental to one&#146;s purity of mind. A high-thinking man may meet his downfall within a short time, if he continually associates himself with bad company. Hence it is necessary to maintain a balance between internal and external expressions. Although bodily pleasures are perceived by the mind in the wakeful state, the objects of such pleasures always come from without, with the result that the privations of the external world will always stand in the way of real happiness, as the external world cannot always supply objects in accordance with the desires and wishes of the mind. Due to this the mind has to run up and down in search of them. It becomes very agitated in the process and peace becomes and impossibility. The influence of the external world is absent during the dreamful state, accordingly the amount of pleasure is due to want of efferent desires in the mind or increased organs (for that matter here the desire is not afferent either). In the state of sleep, as the internal activities of the mind are substantially less, the amount of happiness (Static happiness) is proportionately increased.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->I have already said that the unit can perceive more pleasure or pain during his dreamful state, for in that state there is no possibility of a clash between efferent desires and the external world. Normally, even during the dreamful state the unit keeps themselves aloof from Brahma, for there remain dual sentiments of the perceiver and the perceivable. The difference in the dreamful state as distinguished from the wakeful state is that during this state none of the perceivable objects are taken from the external quinquelemental world. Whatever perceived are all self-conceived. Ordinarily we are acquainted with three aspects of the mind, conscious mind, subconscious mind and unconscious mind, that are generally called Cetana mana, Avacetana mana and Acetana mana, the respective proper terms of which should be Ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a, Manomaya kos&#x301;a and Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a mana. All the three conditions being in the right order during the wakeful state, the imagined objects do not appear to be true during imagination (as is the went of the subtle or sub-conscious mind), for the unit can very well understand that the actions of the sub-conscious mind are all simply imaginary. For influenced it&#146;s by the conscious mind, the perceiver of the perceivable quinquelemental objects with the help of the organs. But during the dreamful state the crude or conscious mind lies quiescent and the relation of the unit being with the external world is disrupted. At that time the imaginary, perceivable objects appear to be real. That is why it is said that during the dreamful state the unit being becomes the perceiver of imaginary pleasure and pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Can a dream ever be true?&rdquo; Such question arises in the minds of many. What the unit entities imagines or do during the wakeful state are recorded in their subconscious minds. In any condition, when concerned with similar sentiments acts or things, the unit being determines the character or shape of the subsequent things, acts or sentiments in the light of the recurrence of his previous acts. In the absence of any comparison with already perceived objects, the unit is unable to recognize subsequent objects. Where there is negligible difficulty in comparing things, then people think within themselves: &ldquo;Yes, this thing appears to be similar to that thing to some extent &ndash; perhaps this may be the changed form of that&rdquo; &ndash; thus they come to recognize an entity. In the language of psychology this is called consciousness of identity. For example, suppose we had once seen a boy of 12 or 13. He had was merely a lad at the time. Now we come to see him after twelve years, as a fully developed youth. A great change has come about in his form and features. Still in most cases we can recognize him with a little difficulty. We come to the conclusion within ourselves that that very boy of 12 may now look like this. We call it pratyabhijin&#x32D;a&#x301; or consciousness of identity. But if the difference between the two forms be very great, Pratyabhijin&#x32D;a&#x301; does not occur. So we can see that the accumulated experiences of the subconscious mind help us a great deal in our daily lives. The non-recurrence of these enlightening vibrations would have created great difficulties in this common world as well as in the world of imagination, had they not expressed themselves according to necessity. In sleep if the flatulent gas moves upwards on account of stomach trouble or if there is some nervous disturbance, the brain and the sub-conscious mind will become agitated. Our previously imagined or felt objects reappear in our subconscious mind in a disjointed form. This we call a dream. Obviously such a dream is of no consequence. Not only that, the story formed therein will not be well-knit as it consists of merely the re-appearance of the objects, stored in the different parts of the brain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->There is yet another type of dream. The Atima&#x301;nas kos&#x301;a (supramental mind) is the store-house of all knowledge. At times a premonition of a coming be great happiness or sorrow, which only the omniscient causal frame can visualize, is created during deep slumber in the subconscious mind of an individual, who is deeply concerned with that particular happiness or sorrow. Such dreams do not take place very often. Nevertheless such a dream does carry the prognosis of a true event.<!-- /block --></p>

The inordinate unconscious mind in spite of its being the receptacle of all knowledge cannot be the knower of any object due to its being surrounded by darkness. Whatever be the reasons behind it, in spite of being objectivated, it is unable to maintain its objectivity (objectivity) and so it remains in a particular stance of satiation &ndash; in a particular state of happiness. In spite of a person&#146;s heart being rent asunder by hundreds of shocks, sorrows and insults he or she forgets everything during sleep and lapse into a condition of ease and comfort.  Such comfort or happiness is static born our of ignorance. Sleep is devoid of all feelings. The person then realizes only after waking up that his wood-like condition of sleep was an objectless state.<!-- /block --></p>

This variegated world continues to vibrate in these three states within each individual unit mind. The creation of this vast world of Tripura, which is meant for the enjoyment of the unit entities and which is know as Ks&#x301;iirasamudra&#x301; Garbhodaka (The Fluid of Creation) and Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;rnava, lies in the imagination of the Supreme Purus&#x301;a due to His sentient, mutative and static principles. The base of these three states is what we call the fourth state (Cathurtha-Pura). This fourth state is beyond the ambit of the three attributional principles, it is beyond the scope of time, space and person beyond the scope of the Tripura. This fourth state is called the State of Nirgun&#x301;a (objectlessness), Kaevalya (absolute identity with the Divine Essence) or Turiiya (the state of non-duality). As long as any Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras remain, the unit entities have to wander about the three regions of Tripura &ndash; wakefulness, dream and sleep, undergoing pleasure and pain.

The proper enjoyment of objects through the sense organs is possible only in a wakeful state. So the Purus&#x301;a of this state is called Subjectivated Purus&#x301;a. Similarly in reference to the microcosm, the Purus&#x301;a, of the dream state is called Taejasa or subtle unit mind; and that of the state of sleep is called Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a or spiritually dormant cognition. The Purus&#x301;a subjective of Ksiira&#x301;vdhi, Garbhodaka and Ka&#x301;rn&#x301;arnava is respectively called Vira&#x301;t&#x301;a (causal Cosmic Mind). Hiran&#x301;yagarbha (subtle Cosmic mind) and Iishvara (Crude Cosmic Mind). Hence we find that &ldquo;A&rdquo; is the seed or primary cause of Vishya or Vir&#x301;a&#x301;ta; &ldquo;U,&rdquo; Taejasa and Hiran&#x301;yagarbha; and &ldquo;M,&rdquo; of Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a and Iishvara. In the state of non-duality (Tu&#x301;riiya) there is no distinction between the unit entity and the supreme entity, for the I-feeling is absolutely nil; and so there is no seed or acoustic expression of this state. The seed or acoustic expression is the cause of origination; and so where there is no question of origination or non-origination, creation, preservation or destruction, the question of seed also does not arise. The knower, known and knowledge, the contemplator, contemplated and contemplation &ndash; all become one in the state of Turiiya. Hence that supreme state of final beatitude which is denoted by the Sonic Dot, is called Iishvaragra&#x301;sa &ndash; that state in which even Ishvara or the Lord of the universe is devoured. Here the three purus&#x301;a also merge in the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma or the supreme Non-attributional Entity. Hence it is absolutely correct to call it Iishvaragra&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>

The vital energy or vital air begotten, or the union and disunion of the five fundamental factors active in the microcosmic body, are but the products of His own imagination. At the embryonic stage, human beings derive vital energy from the bodies of their parents and from their mother&#146;s food and drink delivered from the five fundamental factors. Then after birth, they receive vital energy directly from their own food, drink, air, light etc. Hence the source of the life of unit beings lies in Brahma. He is the Life of the life of the microcosms. (The word Pra&#x301;na&#x301; or life, when used in singular number, means functional energy, and when used in plural, means vital energy). The quinquelemental manifestation is the crudest expression of His psychic action and so the microcosms have to draw vital energy from the quinquelemental world. Vital energy is generated in the unit body through the media of five internal and five external Vayus (airs). Of the five internal Vayus, viz., Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, Apa&#x301;na, Sama&#x301;na, Ud&#x301;ana and Vya&#x301;na, the Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, situated between the navel and the throat controls the functions of lungs, heart etc.; the Apa&#x301;na, situated below the navel (i.e., between the navel and the anus) controls the excretion of stool, urine etc.; the Sama&#x301;na&#x301;, situated within the navel, maintains the equilibrium between Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a and Apa&#x301;na; the Uda&#x301;na, situated in the throat, controls the vocal cord (power of speech) and the Vya&#x301;na, permeating the entire body, controls the circulation of the blood, vital secretions etc., and, with the help of the nerve fibres brings the sensory and motor organs into contact with the knowable i.e. the objects to mentally dealt with. The vibration necessary for the faculty of contemplation is also supplied by Vya&#x301;na Va&#x301;yu. The five external airs, viz., Na&#x301;ga, Ku&#x301;rma, Krkara, Devadatta and Dhanain&#x32D;jaya, control expansion and contraction, yawning and hiccup, hunger and thirst, sleep and drowsiness. Hence it is clear that it is with the help of the Va&#x301;yus by created Parama Purus&#x301;a, living beings derive their mind-stuff from the Cosmic Mind. The Indriyas find their expression when the Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a comes into contact with the mind. Ether, air, fire, water and earth are all created and sustained in the Cosmic Mind. That is these five factors, the psychic creation of Brahma, are preserving the existence of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>

In fact, the Entity or that which has neither beginning nor end and is devoid of any form, can hardly be called masculine or feminine. He is the Life of all lives, the Soul of all souls, and that is why He is Param&#x301;a&#x301;tma&#x301; or the Supreme cognition. The finite objects require a shelter, a base. Only the Infinite does not requite a base. All the finite objects of the universe are but the unit-manifestations of this Brahma. They are all sheltered in Him. All of them are the objects of His imagination. Inconceivably vast as His fundamental intellect is His existence-cum-cognitive Entity. It radiates as the Knowing Entity through His mind-begotten, subtler than the subtle, smaller than the small unit objects also. The One that abides in the unit entities as the Knower, also abides thus in the vast cosmos. Actually the faculty of His Knowership does not undergo any change. The change appears only in the receptacles because we see Him differently, because we imagine Him to be a separate Entity, abiding in separate receptacles. A Sa&#x301;dhaka, however, knows that by knowing One&#146;s own self, one can know the Supreme self, for they are essentially one. Shrii Ra&#x301;makrs&#x301;n&#x301;a Paramhamsa once said that if Sa&#x301;dhakas can know themselves, they can also know the Supreme Consciousness.

At that time nothing existed which we would call &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and so there was also no existence of the relative factors like Time, Space and Person. To investigate the time of His origin involves the necessity of the existence of a being endowed with a mind at that time. It is because His origin, existence and extinction are beyond the scope of mind, as well as of time, space and person, that He is called eternal. The intuitional science is beyond the realm of causality. Nothing exists outside Brahma and so nothing can be the cause or primal form of Brahma, for the transmuted form of the cause is called action. Milk is the cause of curd, for it is the primal or former state of curd. As nothing is outside Brahma, so nothing can be the cause of any subsequent action. The change in an object takes place out of contraction and expansion and for this contraction and expansion the influence of a second entity upon that particular object is necessary.

That is why the Rs&#x301;i (sage) has said, &ldquo;He is you and you are He.&rdquo; The objects, which undergo metamorphosis are all made of the five fundamental factors &ndash; ether, air, fire, water and earth, which must be present in some form or another; and they remain in one or another of the three conditions &ndash; wakefulness, dream and sleep.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->Objects which are made out of the combination of the five factors are called Prapain&#x32D;ca. The differences in the forms of objects occur due to the momenta of the Cosmic thought process, and proceed from the subtle to the crude (Sain&#x32D;cara or the process of Extroversion) and then retrace their path, from the crude back to the subtle (Pratisain&#x32D;cara or the process of Introversion). That is why they are perishable, for any of their forms is dependent on the three factors of time, space and person. Their manifestative, active and inert states are all respectively ensconced in the states of wakefulness, dream and sleep of microcosms. But what is the source of their different kinds of expressions? What are their main ingredients? They all originate from the Supreme self, the Supreme Subjectivity, that limitless centre of energy of the ego. So in spiritual terms all these states of wakefulness, dream and sleep, as well as this quinquelemental world, are all I. Those who have understood the real meaning of this &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness, do not consider anything to be a bondage, nor are they afraid of anything.<!-- /block --></p>

The fourth abode, which is unmentioned is of course, undistorted, unchangeable &ldquo;I&rdquo;. Whatever objects there are in these abodes, appear as enjoyable, enjoyer and enjoyment. The fourth entity, with characteristic opposite to those of the above three, is their witnessing Consciousness, Sada&#x301;shiva. &ldquo;I am that Sada&#x301;shiva.&rdquo; Generally in Tantra, (the Esoteric Science) Ardhana&#x301;riishvara Shiva is addressed as Sada&#x301;shiva. The word Sada&#x301;shiva, is not used here in that sense. Here Shiva means Purus&#x301;a, benevolent or benign.

Each of them is unique in its own individual glory. Each of them, manifesting my grandeur differently, is rushing in various speeds towards formlessness from the world of forms.

No harmful or malevolent thought can enter into me. I wish only good to all beings.&rdquo; When sa&#x301;dhakas are established in such an awareness they get lost in themselves, realizing the Infinite form within themselves &ndash; their external awareness is lost. This stage we call Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi. In this the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s microcosmic ego merges in the Cosmic Ego completely and totally. The difference between this state and the state of Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi, is that in Nirvikalpa no I-feeling, whether small or great, exists at all; everything is lost in the integral Consciousness. Since external awareness is absent during Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi, the sense of duality does not exist in the sa&#x301;dhaka. For those who are established in introspective trance the objects which are visualized internally appear to be indistinguishable from their own ego. Onlookers cannot comprehend such a state as this. Some ridicule such sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s, some call them crazy or mad. They do not know that to become like them requires the merit of several births, and demands a concentrated yearning to attain the One to the exclusion of all.

Whatever, finite objects there are in this observable world, they are nothing but the manifestations of my very own self.

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->During the last Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (Spiritual Congregation) I told you something about the cosmological system. There I also explained the Cosmological system, vis-a-vis solar, earth and atomic systems. The sun is the nucleus of the solar system. The different planets, such as earth born out of the sun, are revolving around the sun as their nucleus. They are neither approaching the sun by coming close to it, nor are they moving away from it, for their centrifugal and centripetal forces are on the whole in an equipoised state. If this equipoise is lost, the planet or planets will either merge in the sun due to the intensity of their centripetal force or gradually recede from it due to their centrifugal force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Similarly the nucleus of the earth-system is the earth. The moon is revolving round the earth as its nucleus. Here, too, the centrifugal and centripetal forces are functioning with equal intensity. In the same way the electrons are moving around he nucleus of the atomic system. There, too, the same play is going on the same system is working.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->By cosmological system we mean this vast universe, whose nucleus is the Aks&#x301;ara or the immutable Purus&#x301;a as the witness, around whom are revolving His psychic objects like the sun, the stars, etc., in His imaginative flow. Here too the centrifugal and centripetal forces are maintaining equilibrium. This balanced state of the forces is what we call Prakrti. To the cosmic system the centrifugal force which is dominated by the static principle (Tamagun&#x301;a) is known as Avidya&#x301; and the centripetal force dominated by the sentient principle (Sattvagun&#x301;a) is called Vidya&#x301;. When these objects, revolving around the nucleus, were initially created out of the nucleus, there must have been the predominance of the centrifugal force, and in the evolutionary process the static principle must have been dominant. Then again, when its created objects rush in intense yearning towards it with lightning speed, defying all hostile forces, surely at that time the equipoise of forces is lacking. Just as the meteor races down to the surface of the earth, similarly the unit object also races towards, and merges in, that Macrocosmic nucleus, leaving its own orbit in the Cosmic System. Certainly this movement towards the Cosmic Consciousness is dominated by the centripetal force: Hence the path of liberation is the path of the Sentient Principle (Sattvagun&#x301;a). Why do we call it the path of liberation? It is because after the merger with its nucleus, an entity&#146;s individuality ceases to exist. After the earth merges in the sun, the earth no longer remains.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The unit entities have been moving around the cosmic nucleus throughout eternity and this movement will continue as long as an entity maintains the feeling of distinctions; that is the rotation will not cease until their sense of separateness from the nucleus is dissolved. When the intensity of their attachment for the nucleus will reach its climax &ndash; when they will seek to forget everything but Him &ndash; no force whatsoever can then dissociate them form Him. This intense attachment is what we call devotion. This momentum towards the Supreme One becomes easy and smooth, when unit entities realize that He always wants to get them back on His lap. His desire to bring them to Himself is simply His grace. In fact He is showering this grace on all. But when peoples eyes are blinded with materialistic enjoyment, they cannot realize this. The great Sage Na&#x301;rada said, &ldquo;Mahat krpa&#x301;yaeva bhagavat krpa&#x301;lesha&#x301;dva&#x301;&rdquo;, for this His grace is essential. I already said that He had been showering His grace on all. One has only to realize that grace with one&#146;s intensely concentrated mind. His imagination is incessantly flowing. As long as you are incapable of realizing His grace, as long as you do not try to move towards Him you will have to go round and round like the bullocks in the oil-mill in the endless cycle of creation, life and death.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The nucleus of the cosmic system is called Purus&#x301;ottama. He is the Supreme Lord of this imagination-born world of the mutable (ks&#x301;ara) and immutable (aks&#x301;ara) aspects of the Cosmic Mind. In Him is knowership as well as the doership. He Himself is never metamorphosed into any action. We cannot call Him Nirgun&#x301;a or non-qualified, in Him lies the witness-ship of the entire universe. Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is the name for the combination of the Purus&#x301;ottama and His psychic object, the universe. Judging from attributional point of view, the difference between objectified form of Brahma and the witness-ship of Purus&#x301;ottama is that in His objectified form He is under the bondage of the gun&#x301;as (gun&#x301;a&#x301;dhiisa). Yet in both Brahma and Purus&#x301;ottama He is related in some way with the gun&#x301;as. Thus I have said that He is the transcendent controller of the gun&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>

The first three syllables of the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra (a-u-m) have also been used to describe Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. In ancient times, however, only Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa mantras were used for Purus&#x301;ottama, the Nucleus of the Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. It should be mentioned here that of the seven metres, Ga&#x301;yattrii, Usn&#x301;k, Annus&#x301;t&#x301;upa, Vrhati, Pam&#x301;kti, Tris&#x301;tupa and Jagati, Ga&#x301;yattrii and Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa commanded the greatest importance. Ga&#x301;yattrii-mantra is composed in three lines of eight letters each, totalling twenty-four letters, and Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa of eight letters, dedicated to Purus&#x301;ottama, stands for each of the syllables of On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>

To this little earth the sun is Ugra or merciful, for the sun is the cause of its creation, preservation and destruction. Similarly, Purus&#x301;ottama is the cause of the Cosmic Cycle.

Approaching Him, the Fire said by way of self-introduction, &ldquo;I am Fire &ndash; I am Ja&#x301;taveda. To consume everything is my dharma (characteristic).&rdquo; The Supreme Being then said, offering him a blade of straw, &ldquo;Here, burn this.&rdquo; The Fire, whose inherent characteristic was to burn, could not burn it, howsoever it tried. Then the air approached and said [[by way of self-introduction]], &ldquo;I am Air, I am Ma&#x301;tarishva&#x301;, to blow everything always is my strength.&rdquo; Even the vainglorious Air could not blow away that piece of straw. Finally Indra was able to know the identity of that Purus&#x301;a. Thereafter the gods could very well realize that the power they wielded was not actually theirs.

Thus countless deaths come to them, countless number of times.  But those who have attained the Purus&#x301;ottama, attain a supreme death; their worldly death is the last one for them.

Wherever there is manifestation of creation, wherever there is the imaginative flow of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, time, place and person must also be there. The existence of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is impossible without this On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra produced by His imaginative flow. That is why I have said that the existence of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma and even the existences of all the objects, are dependent on the measurement of the motivity of their action. The mind&#146;s measurement of the motivity of an action is Time; the measurer of this motivity with the help of the mind is person; and that which establishes the relation between time and person is space. The existence of these three is dependent on the mental activity, i.e., on the thought-process or On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. Sunrise to sunset, the beginning of the year to the end, all belong to the vast periphery of Time; hence they are but the manifestations of the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. From any one extreme point to another extreme point, no matter how short or long the distance, all belong to the sphere of space, and hence they too are the manifestations of On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. So, as I have said, all that we can or cannot think of within the compass of Time, all belong to On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, being subject to time, place and person is Sopa&#x301;dhika or qualified. It is not a Nirupa&#x301;dhika or unqualified Entity like the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma.

<a name="5..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->In all these three conditions one thinks oneself separate from Brahma. This distinction between unit entity and Brahma is dependent on their attributional differences. The difference in the states of wakefulness, dream, sleep are due to the greater or lesser dominance of Sentient, Mutative and Static Principles. The unit entities are concerned only with their crude physical existence; while the Cosmic manifestation, however is concerned with the entire, vast universe. I have already said that the Cosmic manifestation is also affected by the three binding principles. The existence of these three states in the unit entities is only possible when these three attributes of the Cosmic manifestation are explicitly evident. This is because the crude, subtle and causal existences of the unit entity are wholly dependent on the cosmic thought-process. The crude unit-body is made of the quinquelemental, earthly ingredients, begotten of the Cosmic thought-process; that is to say, it is created in His Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a or Conscious Mind. It is out of this crude Cosmic Mind that innumerable unit bodies have come into being, for in order to preserve their individualities, the distinctiveness of the receptacles (bodies) has to be maintained, or else the units lose their individual freedom. In order to maintain the continuity of the Cosmic thought-projection, the distinction among objects in the sub-conscious world are unavoidable necessity; this also accounts for the creation of innumerable bodies, or else the thought process becomes Stha&#x301;nu or static for lack of material distinctions. Since Sagun&#x301;a Brahma has to take recourse to imagination for the exhaustion of His unserved Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, it naturally becomes incumbent on Him to evolve a heterogeneous world. The experiencing of actions and reactions by the unit entities are done, to be sure, through the medium of the bodies or receptacles; and when these unit entities abjure their sense of separateness or separate existence from the Cosmic Entity, they no longer have to undergo the consequences of their actions. Being emancipated from the worldly bondage, their separate physical entities cease to exist.<!-- /block --></p>

Its thought-wave and its resultant action also is crudely materialistic, and so in the wakeful state it thrives on the crude; i.e. crude world is its pabulum, its food. In the wakeful state it also thrives on the subtle, for the source of its materialistic acts actually abides in its subtle mind. Actually, its real bhaga (the experience of pleasure and pain) takes place in the mental sphere. If the mind is disturbed, one cannot properly enjoy a beautiful sight, a tasty food or a delectable drink. In this wakeful state the A&#x301;tma&#x301; or soul is called catus&#x301;pada or four-phasic; that is, in this state all its four phases are present either explicitly or implicitly. In other words the wakeful state is explicit and within that are latent the dream state, sleep state and the state of Turiiya. This wakeful condition is concerned with the cognizance of the crude; that is, its function is to acquire knowledge of the crude. This relatively crude wakeful state is sevenfold or septilateral; the quinquelemental citta (mental plate), the Mahatattva (fundamental intellect) and the ego. It is nineteen-faced, for its manifestation are in nineteen directions &ndash; ten sensory and motor organs, five va&#x301;yus, mind, the fundamental intellect, ego and Mu&#x301;la Prakrti (the primordial Prakrti in equilibrium). In the wakeful state all objects are the food for the mind, thus, it is called Vishva or Vaeshva&#x301;nara. It is the first pa&#x301;da or phase of the soul. Microcosmically the witnessing Purus&#x301;a of the wakeful state is called Vishva and Macrocosmically He is called Vaeshva&#x301;nara or Vira&#x301;ta.<!-- /block --></p>

The soul at that time is hungry for the subtle; it accepts only those things apprehended in the realm of the mind. The appearance of such mental objects does not depend on the inferences or tamma&#x301;tras received from the senses at that time but on the reactive momenta or seeds of previously acquired tanma&#x301;tras upheaving waves of the Omniscient seed.

In the wakeful state both the conscious and the sub-conscious mind are functioning: Thought-waves originate in the sub-conscious mind and are translated into action through the medium of the conscious mind. In the wakeful state the role of the conscious mind is solely predominant, but due to physical inertness in the dream condition, the sub-conscious mind cannot properly control the conscious mind and so here the sub-conscious mind alone is predominant. But during sleep the imaginative power, the sub-conscious mind &ndash; also becomes as inactive as the physical body: There remains only the unconscious or causal mind, the Atima&#x301;nas Kos&#x301;a, Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a and Hiranyamaya Kos&#x301;a. Then how does dream occur during sleep &ndash; how does the stage of dream come between sleep and wakefulness?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->What is dream? When certain impressions perceived by the sense organs, agitate the conscious mind and sensory or material thoughts are thereby vehemently awakened in the conscious mind, the nervous system, the crude receptacle of the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a and the mind itself becomes unsteady and restless. This leaves an impression on the cells that is short-lived or long-lasting depending on the degree of its intensity. Sometimes even a significant impression being compelled to give way to a newer one under the impact of some other sense-agitation or restlessness, loses its previously acquired permanence. In the sleep state, if a person&#146;s nerve-tissues are agitated due to some physical cause, often either as the result of this or on account of cerebral heat caused by some vehement thinking, the nerve cells also become tired and disturbed. Such agitations give rise in the mental sphere to desires similar to those impressions, accumulated in the nerve-cells. Thus the agitated citta (the sub-conscious mind) accepts as real the stream of thoughts arising from one or more such impressions. The crude organs having stopped functioning, the identical desire arising from the previously acquired desire, do not then seem to be imaginary but appear to be quite real.  Such dreams often do not come true, for these are actually pure imaginations or a mere stringing together of different disjointed thoughts, a confused or inconsistent dream. Only those whose nerve tissues have become weak due to some ailments of the brain or head or to some protracted illness, or those whose digestive system are malfunctioning, generally experience such confused dreams, which we may call Sensual Dreams. These dreams, as I have already said, are the true reproduction of previously imagined objects or the disjointed expressions of previous thoughts. Excessive eating also gives rise to such dreams in a person. Those who have purity of thoughts and also restraint over their diet, are generally less susceptible to such dreams. Such dreams never occur during sleep.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->There is still another type of dream. Even when people are in a deep slumber, there may arise in their sub-conscious minds through their dreams, the prognosis of some good news or bad news, or even a huge calamity. The all-knowing causal or unconscious mind usually cannot express its all-knowingness due to the unsteadiness of the conscious and sub-conscious minds as well as due to its own expressional inability, but sometimes it can awaken in the calm conscious and sub-conscious minds of people in deep slumber visions of past, present or future and those visions overwhelm the sleepers&#146; minds. A surging vibrational flow emanating from the fountain head of the unconscious mind and vibrating the sub-conscious mind, is also a sort of dream; and that dream is not insignificant for its cause is the all-knowing causal mind. This type of dream we may call a supramental vision. Sometimes even in the wakeful state the cognitive flow of the unconscious mind penetrates into the subtle mind, as the result of which people even in the wakeful state, with a little concentration, can know events concerning their distant near and dear ones, this is called telepathic vision. Through the concentrated state of this telepathic vision, when conscious mind is more calm and sedate, people can visualize events concerning their distant beloved ones, enacted before their eyes in the external world or feel as if they are seeing them; this is called telepathic clairvoyance. Mistaking such acts as those of spirits many people come to believe in spiritism or spiritology. Truly speaking such incidents have no connection at all with spirits or ghosts. Telepathic vision and telepathic clairvoyance are intrinsically the same as supramental vision. They are born of the inspiration of the unconscious mind, the knower of the universe. To believe in ghosts and spirits is merely to perpetuate the cowardly mentality of the pre-historic people. But compared to supramental vision, the incidence of telepathic vision is very much less frequent, and still less is the occurrence of telepathic clairvoyance due to the activeness of the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a or the conscious mind. Nevertheless the supramental vision itself does not occur more than 8 to 10 times in the life of a person. The greater or lesser frequencies of such experiences wholly depends on ones sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (intuitional practices) or sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (reactive requitals). (One, however, must bear I mind that self-acquired telepathy or self-acquired clairvoyance is something different.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->Even in supramental vision people often do not rasp things properly for such cognitive waves are generally expressed through the media of their personal sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Suppose, for instance, in some country cows are necessary for various indispensable jobs like cultivation, the milling of oil-seeds, or bearing conveyances; normally people of suck countries will have very great regard for cows. Having lived on cows milk since their childhood, they will revere as mothers, and regard healthy, strong cows as symbols of good fortune and prosperity. These sentiments about cows are the resultant sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras born out of their day-to-day necessities. Once someone in such a country had a dream about a cow growing leaner and thinner by subsisting only on the dried straws of the paddy field. Then another cow appeared who met the same fate. Then appeared still another cow, and that too fared no better. From such a dream he may infer that his next three years will be inauspicious. As the cows and paddy were symbols of good fortune and prosperity, lean cows and dried paddy plants in the dream were a premonition of misfortune. So for the prescience of the truth through the medium of dreams it is necessary for people to control their conscious and sub-conscious minds. Those who have brought both these minds under control through spiritual practices can, with a little effort, visualize pictures of the past, present and future even in their wakeful state. This accounts for the meditational clairvoyance or intuitional foresight of the stages regarding distant objects or events. Some power of visualizing past, present or future or distant events may also be found in an average person through crystal-gazing, mirror-gazing, etc. These are nothing but the expansion of the cognitive field as the conscious and sub-conscious minds are partially absorbed in the unconscious mind, as the result of earnest concentration on a particular bright object. In the hypnotic state or during planchette-concentration (ouija board) also, the activities of the conscious and sub-conscious minds become stilled, and the range of a particular individual&#146;s knowledge is expanded at least for a short duration. But here one must bear in mind that in the hypnotized state or in mirror-gazing one sees only the reflections of one&#146;s own sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or previous bias. This occurs in almost cent percent of the cases; for instance when a hypnotized person utters, words according to his own sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras while people gaze at him in awe and with folded hands, taking his utterances as absolute truth. Those who feign theophanic or demonical trances are total frauds &ndash; all that they do or say are tricks and hoaxes. But even those who invoke the spirits of gods with devotion or sit around the planchette &ndash; even their statements are almost entirely the expressions of their respective sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras and previous bias. One or two percent of their predictions may even come true due to their mental concentration; but such chance truths may not always be the expressions of the unconscious mind, for there is nothing unusual about one or two predictions out of many, coming true &ndash; it may happen to any ordinary person. There is a Bengali proverb, &ldquo;The crow dies of storm, the Fakir strikes his form.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->The state in which conscious and sub-conscious minds do not function, when the unit entity is not motivated by any longing or any desire nor is seeing any dream &ndash; this in the language of the scriptures is known as the state of sleep. That is to say if there is any desire or dream, we cannot then call it sleep. In the absence of any particular conceptual or external expression, such a state is one of absolute cognition for the individual. Due to this absolute cognition people enjoy a special kind of bliss. In the absence of any crude or subtle function of the mind, they do not experience any happiness or sorrow, any pleasure or pain. That is, why in that state they feel special type of joy in the crude as well as in the subtle spheres of mind, and so in such states material distinctions do exist. But in the state of sleep, the crude and subtle functions of the mind are absent, and thus the awareness of material diversities is also non-existent. All worldly objects become one. This state of absence of distinction creates a special kind of bliss which the individual goes on enjoying in the sleeping state. But this unicity of sleep is not actually the state of self-expansion or absolute identity with the Divine Essence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->The knowledge of material distinction can be dispensed within two ways. In a very brilliant radiance the perception of differentialities is lost, for at that time all objects appear radiant. Then again, in absolute darkness material differences as well vanish for them there is only a cimmerian darkness in which all objects lose their respective outlines.  The unicity of sleep is the same as that of the stupefying cimmerian darkness; that is to say, the power of vision is intact and so are the objects, but there is no visualization. Hence the joy of sleep is static or passive, and gradually this state gives way to dream or wakefulness. The seven-sided and decennoval (nineteen) outlets of the wakeful and dreamful states are not lost but remain as seeds in the state of sleep. And so there can never be happiness in this state either. Such a state is called Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a or the quiescent state of cognition, and that of the Supreme Spirit is called Ishvara or the Crude Cosmic Mind. Since the entire world is linked together in Him just as the pearls are strung on a thread or su&#x301;tra, so He is called Su&#x301;treshvara. It is this thread that has encircled the individuality of the unit. The reason for calling the Purus&#x301;a in the sleep state as Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a is that in this state the seed of all knowledge is embedded. Yet due to darkness, discrimination is nil &ndash; such is the state of sleep. The seeds of the wakeful and dreamful states abide in this state too, and so its happiness is not absolute but merely, a fragmental or partial one.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->Turiiya is neither Omniscient nor the Lord of all, for to know anything the presence of different entities like knowledge, knower and knowable is unavoidable. Likewise, the Iishvaratva or the right of control over anything is not possible without the existence of a controller, control and the controlled, so the state of omniscience or all-knowingness exists only when one&#146;s cognitive self remains separate from all the rest, from the knowable entities.  Similarly, in the state in which one experiences &ldquo;I am&rdquo; the Iishvara or the Lord of all, here too the separateness of ones characteristic self from all others is necessary. But in the Turiiya state the sense of existence of all other entities does not exist at all; there remains only one entity and that is why, an individual in this state cannot be the knower of any object nor the Iishvara of anything. An individual endowed with omniscience or Lordship, we shall call Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a not Turiiya. The Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; is the root of all, the giver of inspiration, the cause of the existential ratification of the world. That is why His body is known as the Causal Body. He Himself is the Quiescent Soul or the Causal Soul. Turiiya is the Witnessing Consciousness, and the Causal Body or Causal Brahma is the qualified manifestation is expressing itself through the media of endless unit manifestations in the hope of finally attaining the great union in the Supreme Perfection &ndash; in the Absolute Supreme Bliss. The qualified thought projection of the Cosmic expression, that is the initial stage of the centrifugal action (Sain&#x32D;cara) is called the Causal Body, and the Purus&#x301;a, which is the subject of this Causal Body, is the Causal Soul, for the word &ldquo;cause&rdquo; here actually means seed. His Body is the seed of the universe and thus He is the Causal Soul. The manifestativeness of the entire universe lies covert in this stage and that is why He is the Controller of all manifestations.

<a name="5..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->Earn your deathlessness by establishing yourself in Him. He is the real Soul. If any condition is worth attaining at all then it is this condition &ndash; the Turiiya condition. In such a condition there cannot be any distinctions of microcosm or macrocosm. In this condition there is no form for action, inaction or counter-action &ndash; no scope for extroversive or introversive vagaries. This bearing is the natural characteristic of the soul, its characteristic Self. In wakefulness the collectivity is called Vira&#x301;ta (the subjective counterpart of the Causal Cosmic Mind) and the individuality is Vishva (the subjective counterpart of the causal unit-mind). In the dream state the collectivity is known as Hiran&#x301;yagarbha (the subjective counterpart of the subtle Cosmic Mind) and the individuality is Taejasa (the subjective counterpart of the subtle unit-mind). In the sleeping state the collectivity is Su&#x301;treshvara (the subjective counterpart of the crude Cosmic Mind), the individuality is Prajin&#x32D;a (the subjective counterpart of the crude unit-mind), the dormant cognition, being completely free from all attributes or the semblance thereof, the states of collectivity and individuality cannot exist due to the absence of all kinds of differentiations. In this condition He is called the One unique Iishvaragra&#x301;sa or the Cosmic Finality regardless of any collectivity or individuality. Only in the soul is He experienced. He is the summum bonum of all sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice. He is not attainable through arguments or science. When one is ensconced in Him, wakefulness, dream and sleep are but mere imaginations and illusions &ndash; merely the mistaken recognition of untruth for Truth. Even the entire quinquelemental or Pain&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tatmaka world is lost during this Turiiyabha&#x301;va, in such a supreme state all elemental bearings recede into nothingness. In every human being there are the states of wakefulness, dream, sleep, the unit soul and the Supreme Soul. It is that Soul we must know.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->He is the ultimate Finality, the Iishvaragra&#x301;sa. The range of the dream state is greater than that of the wakeful one, and the range of the sleep state much greater than that of the dream state. And the state encompasses the entire vast extent of the sleep state, and that is why Turiiya state is the vastest of all, the all-devouring. Even the Supreme Purus&#x301;a (Iishvara), the subjective witnessing entity meets His end in Him and that is why His name is Iishvaragra&#x301;sa or the Cosmic Finality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->This Turiiya or non-dual state is beyond all gun&#x301;as or attributes. No language can describe Him. The scriptures have only tried to elucidate and explain Him, but the language for the proper explanation is not within the bounds of the scriptures. In the state of Turiiya not only does subjectivity not exist, but in the fourth aspect of the turiiya, the Avikalpa, there is not even a semblance of witness-ship. No matter how assiduously the wavering and indecisive mind exerts itself to reach that Turiiya, it can never hold Him within its grasp. To attain Him one has to do the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of self-surrender, one has to surrender oneself wholly &ndash; giving the full sixteen annas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Withholding of even a single anna will not do.<!-- /block --></p>
