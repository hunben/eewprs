<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the physical, psychic and spiritual strata there is ample scope for yatama&#x301;na. But remember, without freedom of intellect, physical and psychic progress are impossible. Of course one may attain a certain degree of progress, but that will be hard to maintain. The other day I said that the mind of a person who does not get sufficient food will always think about food. This is normal, for food is necessary to sustain the physical body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The inner spirit of yatama&#x301;na is to sincerely try to advance. The greatest obstacle on the path of progress is a lack of intellectual freedom, for it prevents one from planning independently how to advance in the physical and psychic spheres. When one is aware of this one thinks negative thoughts. It has been mentioned in the yoga sha&#x301;stra that yogis would go to countries ruled by powerful kings to be able to practice their spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; without harm or hindrance. If the king was strong the society he represented was also strong. It was only natural for those sa&#x301;dhakas to seek a well-knit and stable society to further their spiritual advancement. So for the full expression of yatama&#x301;na society should be structured in such a way that the physical and psychic needs of the people can be met.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The second stage of psycho-spiritual progress is vyatireka, which concerns human psychology. The human mind can be compared to the ayogava&#x301;ha&#x301; letters of the Indo-Aryan alphabet. These are letters which cannot be uttered independently without the support of other letters. In our alphabet there are three such letters: am&#x301;ushvar (m&#x301;), visharga (ah), and chandrabindu (nasal sound). Am&#x301;ushvar has no independent pronunciation, but if written after the letter ka, for example, will be pronounced as kam&#x301;. Similarly, when visharga comes after the letter ka it is pronounced as kah, and likewise, when chandrabindu is written above ka we pronounce it as kan.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The human mind can be compared to these ayogava&#x301;ha&#x301; letters because it, too, cannot exist alone but always remains attached to some object or other. Suppose you are walking along a road without looking at the houses, animals, traffic, etc. Does this mean that your mind is disassociated from all objects? Not at all. You may be thinking that if you don&#146;t hurry up the ration shop will be closed. So the ration shop is your mental object. You are unable to keep your mind in a state of objectlessness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The human mind attaches itself to three types of objects: physical, psychic and spiritual. In the mundane sphere the mind jumps continuously from one object to another. For example, on seeing some rasogolla&#x301;s (delicious Indian sweets) you immediately feel a desire to eat them. But maybe you think, &ldquo;No I shouldn&#146;t eat any. I shouldn&#146;t be so greedy. That would be very unbecoming of me.&rdquo; Perhaps the following couplet comes to mind:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Lobhe pa&#x301;p pa&#x301;pe mrtyu sha&#x301;strer vacane<br>Ata-eva kara sabe lobha sam&#x301;varan&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[Greed leads to sin, sin leads to death,<br>This is the teaching of the scriptures.<br>Therefore, Oh human beings, control your greed]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So you tell yourself, &ldquo;No, I won&#146;t eat any rasagolla&#x301;s.&rdquo; But the moment you withdraw your mind from the rasogolla&#x301;s you happen to smell the aroma of freshly made tea and think how nice it would be to have a cup. Your mind drops the object of rasagolla&#x301;, but now embraces another object: tea. You tell the tea boy, &ldquo;Two cups of tea please&rdquo;, even though you may feel a little ashamed that you have succumbed to the influence of yet another object of desire. While sipping your tea you decide to never again allow your mind to be swayed by the desire for any other object &ndash; never, never again. But, alas! the very next second you think, &ldquo;Oooh, what a beautiful shirt that boy&#146;s wearing. I should get myself one like that.&rdquo; So now the mind is running after a shirt. It cannot stay attached to any one object for long but jumps uncontrollably from object to object. Then, you think, &ldquo;Oh dear, I&#146;m going to be late in getting home today. I bet mum&#146;s complaining already, &lsquo;How long will I keep the food warm for him. What a nuisance. I won&#146;t wait any longer&rsquo;. What shall I say when I get home? Let&#146;s see&#8230; yes, I&#146;ll say, &lsquo;Sorry I&#146;m late today mum. I won&#146;t be late again in future.&rsquo;&rdquo; So now you are thinking about the conversation you&#146;ll be having with your mother. And the mind continues to jump from one object to another. Most of the objects in this example are physical &ndash; the rasagolla, the tea, the boy&#146;s shirt &ndash; but your planned conversation with your mother is psychic, for after picturing the image of your mother in your mind you use your mental ear to hear her words.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Thus it is clear that the mind requires an object. The initiative to act comes from the mind-only after thinking about an action do we actually do it. One should also remember that if the mind constantly thinks a thought for a long time, it will certainly be materialized sooner or later. If one&#146;s mind thinks about something for a short time and then jumps to another object, that thought may or may not be materialized. But if a person cherishes a desire for a long time to eat something he will certainly it eat it one day, whatever the hurdles he has to cross. That is why the mind should not remain attached to a particular object for a long period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The best psychological cure for addicts is to put them in an environment where they will be unable to think of their object of addiction for any length of time. To proclaim, &ldquo;Don&#146;t do this, it&#146;s bad,&rdquo; is futile, for it is a negative approach. If you say, &ldquo;Don&#146;t drink wine&rdquo;, you are still injecting the concept of wine into the alcoholic&#146;s mind, thus making it impossible for him to forget it and kick his bad habits. You are giving alcohol negative publicity, and it again becomes his mental object. Thus whenever he gets the opportunity he will certainly drink it again. And it may be that this negative approach encourages the alcoholic to become even more addicted. It is a defective approach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->These days the sign &ldquo;No smoking please&rdquo; is placed in many public places, but it will not reduce the amount of smoking. If society wants people to stop smoking, its approach should be to divert the smoker&#146;s mind to other objects. A chain smoker should be encouraged to get involved in various pursuits such as music, dance, songs, culture of fine arts, etc., for if the mind remains engaged in these things it will forget its object of addiction. But the person who thinks, &ldquo;I&#146;ll stop drinking wine the day after tomorrow &ndash; no, let me see, why not tomorrow&rdquo; can never kick the habit, for wine remains the mental object. The mind will try to materialize whatever it thinks about in the external world &ndash; this is its nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->There is a good story. An alcoholic saw the sign &ldquo;Drinking is bad&rdquo; everywhere he went so he decided to stop drinking. After a moment&#146;s contemplation he decided to go and see an astrologer. &ldquo;Can you please tell me when the next auspicious day is?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Certainly&rdquo; replied the astrologer, &ldquo;it&#146;s du&#x301;rga&#x301;saptamii, in about four months time.&rdquo; The alcoholic thought that would be a wonderful day to give up drinking, so why trouble himself with abstinence before it arrived. Four months later, that auspicious day arrived. At six in the morning, after drinking a bottle of wine, he resolved, &ldquo;That&#146;s it! No more wine for me from this moment.&rdquo; Soon after he was marching past the wine shop. &ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I&#146;ve decided to stop drinking from today.&rdquo; That evening when the clock struck six he congratulated his mind for being so strong. &ldquo;Well done mind, even when I marched past the wine shop you didn&#146;t ask for wine, and even though it&#146;s already six in the evening you still aren&#146;t asking for a glass. Such self-discipline deserves a reward &ndash; let&#146;s open two bottles of wine.&rdquo; This is human psychology!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Not only does the mind remain attached to physical objects, psychic ones are equally dear to it. Great scholars probe deeply into highly intellectual subjects, and as a result of their continued study, gain success. Since ancient times human beings have aspired to fly in the sky. The lymphatic glands of the human group are developed, and thus the monkey, proto-ape, and ape groups can jump a lot, but they cannot fly. But today this human desire has been fulfilled with the help of aeroplanes. Whenever people probe deeply into fields of thought in the psychic sphere it influences the subtler sphere, and comes to eventual fruition. Similar is the physical sphere, for whatever people think is materialized if their desire is intense.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The same thing also happens in the spiritual sphere. In the physical sphere the mind may run after rasagolla&#x301;, a cup of tea, or a boy&#146;s shirt; and in the psychic sphere after mother&#146;s words. In the spiritual sphere, if the mind is withdrawn from all such objects and directed to Parama Purus&#x301;a, it will eventually become one with Him. But it will have to take a firm decision: &ldquo;I will think only of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and not any of the thousands of other objects.&rdquo; So the mind must be withdrawn from all objects and directed towards Parama Purus&#x301;a In this process, and after some time, it will become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. At that stage it will cherish no further desire for rasogollas, tea, fashionable shirts, or the mother&#146;s words. Parama Purus&#x301;a alone will be the greatest object of happiness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->It is the characteristic of the mind to remain attached to one object at a time. It cannot remain attached to one object for a long period of time, nor can it remain objectless. As the mind has to select an object to maintain its existence, it would be wise to select the biggest, the best, the most lasting, and the most loving object. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the only such object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->What is vyatireka? The mind may strive to concentrate on one object for a long period, but it will have difficulty remaining attached to that object permanently. Perhaps you have had an experience like the following one. You have been ideating, on Parama Purus&#x301;a for a long time and feel immensely blissful. Then suddenly the idea flashes in your mind, &ldquo;Oh, I&#146;ve got to go to Burdwan right now &ndash; my train&#146;s about to leave&rdquo; and you get up quickly. The mind now switches over to the thought of Burdwan. This is the science of vyatireka. The way it works will be discussed in the next discourse.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The mind cannot exist without an object (vis&#x301;aya). In the case of an object which is related to the physical sphere the Sam&#x301;skrta terms vis&#x301;aya and a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra can be used, but for a mental object there is a special term.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Suppose there is a rasagolla&#x301; &ndash; you can see or you can eat it &ndash; it is your mental object. But the mind sometimes remains attached to certain objects which cannot be eaten or touched. Even though such objects are not related to tanma&#x301;tras the mind still remains preoccupied with them. Suppose your house is in Haldibari (a place in N. Bengal), and you have gone to Jaipur (a place in Rajasthan about 1500 kilometres from Haldibari). While visiting the important sites of Jaipur &ndash; the Hawa&#x301;mahal, the observatory and other places of historical importance &ndash; you suddenly think, &ldquo; My paddy plants are ripening so I&#146;d better get back soon and prepare for the harvest. And I&#146;ve still got to sow the wheat seeds&#8230; I shouldn&#146;t waste any more time here.&rdquo; At that moment your mind is no longer seeing the sights of Jaipur but has returned to your paddy fields at Haldibari. Actually it is as if your mind has been split in two: one part is enjoying the tourist spots at Jaipur, while the other part is concerned about Haldibari. Such is the plight of the mind. Even though one of your mental objects has no inferences of its own &ndash; neither taste, smell, touch, form, etc. &ndash; yet the mind remains preoccupied with it. Such an object is called the pabulum of mind (a&#x301;bhoga). A&#x301;bhoga is derived as prefix a&#x301; &ndash; bhuj (root verb) + ghain&#x32D; (suffix). In such a case it is the mental body as opposed to the physical body which gets food. Thus the outer mind is working in one way while the inner mind is divided into two parts resulting in nothing being done properly: neither can you enjoy the sights of Jaipur, nor can you think deeply about your paddy fields at Haldibari. When the mind is split in two, not only is it rather disturbing, it hampers mental progress. That is why the mind should be withdrawn from all unnecessary objects and concentrated only on one object. During study if one is disturbed by so many things, one will lose concentration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The other day I said that the mind cannot exist without an object, and keeps jumping from object to object. The person in the example I gave thought it would be good to have a rasagolla&#x301; (the rasagolla&#x301; became his mental pabulum) so he went to a sweet shop to eat some. But while in the shop he felt that he really shouldn&#146;t have any at all &ndash; it was pure greed on his part. Then, suddenly, the smell of a fresh tea reached his nostrils (the mind made the smell tanma&#x301;tra its pabulum) and he decided to have a cup. The very next moment a very fine shirt caught his attention and he thought he would like one just like it (the shirt then became his mental pabulum). Then he thought about the scolding his mother would give him for being late and prepared his reply.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->These examples show how the mind is continuously switching over from one object to another. Without an object the mind itself becomes non-existent. In this context a fundamental question arises: When the mind jumps from one object to another &ndash; say, from rasagolla&#x301; to tea &ndash; what happens to it during the intervening period? What is the mental pabulum at that time? It is an important question. A very interesting thing happens. When your mind starts to move from rasagolla&#x301; to tea it still remains attached to rasagolla&#x301; for a certain time. It has taken a decision to move, but nevertheless hesitates a while before moving towards tea, because it is not completely sure that it wants to leave rasagolla&#x301; altogether. If the attraction for tea is stronger than the attraction for rasogolla&#x301; it will be able to jump to tea. But if the attraction for rasagolla&#x301; is extremely strong, according to one&#146;s inherent sam&#x301;skaras, it will take up more mental space than the attraction for tea, and the mind will be unwilling to take tea as its mental object. If, on the other hand, the attraction for tea is stronger, the mind will prefer to take it as its mental object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In between those two extremes there is another state &ndash; a state of mental balance (of course it may not be perfectly balanced). At that stage the latent human sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of mind becomes more active, that is that type of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which one has been expressing for many years becomes more assertive. At this stage of one&#146;s mind becomes expanded, one&#146;s resolve becomes stronger, and one decides, &ldquo;No, I shouldn&#146;t drink tea because it&#146;s a stimulant. Rasagolla&#x301; is much more beneficial for health so I should be more partial to it.&rdquo; When this discriminating faculty asserts itself the person will shun the tea. In this balanced state of mind one&#146;s acquired sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras become more active.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Those who strive regularly to elevate the mind through the practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; thus acquiring the state of balance, remain unaffected by sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. They immerse themselves in a serene flow.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Human beings wish to express themselves in so many ways through the different inferences of sound, touch, taste, form, and smell. And they wish to derive joy from the many inferences they receive from the external world. They exclaim in joy, &ldquo;How tasty this dish is! How delightful its smell! How delicious the vegetables.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It is a fact that human beings are connected with the material world through the inferences (tanmatras). But the human capacity of assimilating these tanmatras is rather very limited. For example a very loud or very soft sound cannot be perceived by the ear. Human beings can only perceive the medium range of tanmatric vibrations. Lord Buddha called it &ldquo;majjhima&#x301; ma&#x301;gga&rdquo;, the middle of the road. It is a fact. The poet Giirish Ghosh said in this context,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[If you don&#146;t tune the string tightly enough you won&#146;t get the required note, and if you tune it too tightly it will break.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Those of you who play string instruments are well aware that if the strings are tuned too high they will break, and if they are too loose they can&#146;t produce the proper notes. Although the human mind can be compared to the strings of an instrument, it would be more precise to compare it with a cloud which fills up the sky, bringing all objects within its domain. How does the human mind expand? It can best be explained with the analogy of the cloud. Imagine there is a tiny patch of cloud in a corner of the sky. Gradually it expands its size until it covers the whole sky. This is ectoplasmic expansion. As the mind expands in all directions, it brings all objects within its periphery. It is essential for the mind to maintain a perfect adjustment between itself and its objects. The other day I told you that the mind always seeks an object and jumps from object to object depending on the degree of attraction. Take the case of this bolster beside me. If I pick it up and move it from left to the right will the mind remain associated with it for the entire duration of its movement. Remember, before I said that the mind remains attached to the object for which its attraction is greater. In the case of the bolster the mind is more attached to having it on the right side then the left because that will be more comfortable, and thus its preoccupation is with putting the bolster on the right.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the ekendriya stage, which is the third stage in pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra one expands one&#146;s ectoplasmic sphere just like a cloud filling the sky &ndash; whenever the cloud passes over an object it brings it within its sphere of influence. But this is not so in the case of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Whenever His mental sphere increases, numerous entities emerge within His mind, remain in a state of flow for some time and subsequently dissolved back into Him. The microcosms which are created, maintained and dissolved within the Cosmic Mind are qualitatively almost the same manner as Parama Purus&#x301;a, but of course they differ quantitatively. The Cosmic Mind is extremely vast; the unit mind is tiny. The unit mind only expands in the ectoplasmic sphere, like the cloud filling the sky, and in the process of expansion brings other unit minds within its sphere of control. When it expands tremendously it can also assert some influence on the Cosmic Mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Suppose two people, Mr. A and Mr. B, have small minds. After the practice of deep meditation Mr. A succeeds in expanding the periphery of his unit mind and can influence the mind of Mr. B. Not only that, he can also influence the vast mind of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This endeavour for mental expansion is called Vidya&#x301; Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The scientific process of expansion of mind is called Tantra. Tantra is derived as tan + trae (root verb) + d&#x301;a, and literally means to attain liberation through expansion. Suppose you are sitting immobile in one place having have been bound by ropes. Now you can either free yourself by cutting the rope with a knife, or by taking such a deep breath to expand the chest that the rope snaps. On the path of Tantra one expands the mind to snap the bondages of vrttis, ripus, pa&#x301;shas, etc. This is the goal of Vidya&#x301; Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Suppose a person is trying to expand the mind, not to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a, but a crude goal such as name, fame or wealth. In that process the science is the same but the actual path is different. One who follows this path becomes mentally degenerated. This state is called Prakrtiliina avastha&#x301; in scripture. For such people become as crude as matter. A person whose mind is engrossed in money becomes money itself. Yes, a conscious human being gets converted into crude money. Human beings are aware that they are human, but a rupee doesn&#146;t know it&#146;s a rupee. There are other categories like this such as yaks&#x301;a, gandharva&#x301;, kinnara, vidya&#x301;dhara, vidhehaliina and siddha which have been categorized according to the degree of ectoplasmic crudity or subtlety. You are the master of your ectoplasm &ndash; you can expand it across the vast sky, or you can confine it to the horizon of a solitary cloud. It depends on your will.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The seven categories mentioned above have sometimes been described in scripture as devayoni. They are not exactly gods, but are somewhat similar to them, so devayoni is the precise term. Similarly, the ghost-fearing people never use the word &ldquo;bhuta&rdquo; (ghost) at night lest they anger the ghost. Instead they refer to them as &ldquo;upadevata&#x301;&rdquo; (demi-god), to appease them. Likewise, on a dark night people never use the word &ldquo;sap&rdquo; (snake but &ldquo;lata&rdquo; (rope) instead! And in case of certain diseases they say that &ldquo;such and such goddess has shown mercy.&rdquo;! It can hardly be described as mercy; more precisely the goddess is inflicting pain. But people still call it, &ldquo;the mercy of the goddess.&rdquo; I won&#146;t mention the names of the diseases, but you all know what they are.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Let us resume our original discussion. Suppose a person who does spiritual practice constantly ideating on money (i.e., is following both shreya and preya) even while he is meditating. If he were to die while ideating on rupees, the solid and liquid factors of the body would perish but the mind would continue to operate through the remaining three fundamental factors - luminous, aerial and ethereal. This body of three factors is not clearly visible to the eye, yet the mind born out of one&#146;s inherent sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras still functions through it. The &ldquo;disembodied mind&rdquo; expresses its mental longings through vibrations. If one could establish vibrational contact with those entities one would be able to communicate with them. Not having a solid body or a vocal cord (like a so-called ghost) they cannot speak audibly. So to give expression to their longings they have to use vibrations. The person whose goal in life is not Parama Purus&#x301;a but a pot of riches, will, after death, live near a source of money in its invisible body of three factors. You may call such phenomena &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; as they are not visible to the eyes, but the proper term is &ldquo;yaksa&rdquo;. In colloquial Bengali people sometimes say &ldquo;yaks&#x301;er dha&#x301;n&rdquo; or &ldquo;the wealth of a yaks&#x301;a&rdquo;. A yaks&#x301;a often guards treasure lying hidden under the earth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->This notion of yaks&#x301;a has been in vogue since the pre-Jaena period. At most sites of Jaena temples there are invariably effigies of yaks&#x301;a and yaks&#x301;inii. In the Jaena temple which has been excavated near A&#x301;nanda Nagar (the headquarters of A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga) effigies of yaks&#x301;a and yaks&#x301;inii have been found. In olden days a class of people use to worship yaks&#x301;a. Even now in Mithila there is a designated place either a banyan or peepul tree either inside or outside the village which is called Brahmasta&#x301;n Here Brahmasta&#x301;n means the place of worship of a yaks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The second type of devayoni is gandharva. Suppose a person is sincerely cultivating the science of music (a branch of aesthetics &ndash; nandana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na) Nandana means to give and derive pleasure. While one cultivates the science of music one derives pleasure and simultaneously gives pleasure to Parama Purus&#x301;a. But if one believes nandan vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is everything in life and neglects the Supreme One from whom it originates, one will remain absorbed in it even after death. Such entities are called gandharva. The science of music is called gandharva vidya. In many places in northern India the music schools are called gandharva biddyala&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The third category of devayoni is called kinnara. People who have an extraordinary fascination for beauty become kinnaras after death. They have an immense weakness for fashionable clothes, expensive ornaments and so on for they believe that if they are well dressed they will be treated as gods. Some people used to ask, &ldquo;Kim&#x301; purus&#x301;a?&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Is he a man?&rdquo; In those days people believed that there was a group of people living in the northern part of the Himalayas who were always well dressed. Out of superstition they were treated as one of the devayonis. That area was known as Kinnara Desha. The name of one of the districts in Himachel Pradesh is also Kinnara. To the north of Kinnara district is Kim&#x301;purus&#x301;a, the Sam&#x301;skrta name for Tibet. Kim&#x301;purus&#x301;a means &ldquo;Are they humans?&rdquo; In ancient India the general belief was that they were superior to humans, that they were devayoni. So Tibet was named Kimpurus&#x301;a Vars&#x301;a. Some people have a different interpretation. They say that the clothes worn by men and women were the same so it was difficult to clearly identify the sex of a person. Thus the country was called Kimpurus&#x301;a (is he a man?). I will give you a better interpretation for the sake of history at a later date.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The fourth type of devayoni is vidya&#x301;dhara. Suppose some people acquire vast knowledge through intense study. Such bookish knowledge is theoretical, not practical. Such scholars may be compared to the pages of an almanac. Its pages may predict heavy rainfall this year, but if you wring them out not a single raindrop will fall. These scholars maybe highly pedantic, but remain far away from Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Without even knowing the procedure for worshipping the goddess S&#x301;ashtii (goddess of children&#146;s welfare) some priests would memorize the entire Sidda&#x301;nta kaomudii (the most authentic grammar book written by Panini). It was not unknown for some priests to recite vyakara&#x301;na kaomudii (the grammar book written by Iishvar chandra Vidyasagar while worshipping the deity Satyanarayan! They knew that the simple followers were not conversant with Sam&#x301;skrta, and would believe that since they were reciting Sam&#x301;skrta so beautifully, they must be well versed in the scriptures! The people who remain absorbed in such bookish knowledge throughout their lives and never use to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a are called vidyadhara after death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The fifth type of devayoni is Prakrtiliina. If a person continually gloats over crude material things, his entire existence will be converted into crude matter. In mythology the story goes that Ahalya&#x301; was converted into a stone due to his constant crude ideation. So people who accept matter as their goal, totally denying the existence of Parama Purus&#x301;a, treads the path of degeneration and become prakrtiliina devayonis after death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The sixth type of devayoni is videhaliina. Some people have such an insatiable thirst for material gain that their minds run continuously from object to object, leading them far far away from Parama Purus&#x301;a. Their minds are in perpetual motion, but they don&#146;t get anywhere, rather like bullocks trudging endlessly around the oilman&#146;s mill. After death such people become videhaliina.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The last type of devayoni is the siddha Suppose a person practices spiritual science with deep sincerity &ndash; his only goal being to serve humanity and attain Brahma. But if he threads the spiritual path with a sense of vanity, feeling superior to common people, he too will become a devayoni after death. Had he controlled his vanity, Parama Purus&#x301;a would have helped him to exhaust his remaining sam&#x301;skaras. But if he indulges in vanity Hari (when Parama Purus&#x301;a steals others sam&#x301;skaras he is called Hari) will not steal it. His sins may be pardoned, but not his vanity. One of the names of Narayana is Darpaha&#x301;ri or destroyer of vanity (and that destruction may be laborious and painful). Narayana takes away an individual&#146;s unburned sam&#x301;skaras, but if one basks in the glory of being a spiritual practitioner one will have to become a Siddha devayoni after death. According to the scriptures the siddhas play a rather strange role. Either by entering the mind or by some external means their duty is to help sadhakas realize their mistakes. Thus, they assist sa&#x301;dhakas in the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Suppose a sa&#x301;dhaka develops a strong feeling of ego &ndash; the siddha will create a strong feeling in his mind to realize his mistake. Or suppose a sa&#x301;dhaka is about to step onto the path of sin. The siddha will create an awareness in the sadhakas mind to inspire him to desist from following the negative path.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Let me tell you a story. Once two Ananda Marga tantra sa&#x301;dhakas from Muzaffarpur were going by bus to a place on the other side of the river Buriigan&#x301;d&#x301;ak, which flows by Muzaffarpur town, to do their sa&#x301;dhana. Suddenly there was a flash flood so the bus was unable to cross the river. However they had to find some way across because that particular spot was the appointed place for their meditation. Then they saw a light flickering near the river bank and thought that if there&#146;s light there must be some people, and perhaps those people will be able to tell them how to get to the spot for meditation in such adverse conditions &ndash; being the new moon night it was pitch-dark. As they approached the light they noticed to their consternation that it was moving ahead of them. They decided to follow it. The light then started to float across the river, the sa&#x301;dhakas who were following close behind were surprised to discover that at that point in the river the water was only knee deep. The Bu&#x301;riigan&#x301;dak is a deep river but not very wide. The light guided them safely to a tree on the other side of the river and then disappeared. Those two a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas sat at some distance from the tree and performed their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. There was an understanding between them that afterwards they met under the tree, as planned, and were surprised by the reappearance of the light, which lead them back across the river. Once they reached the other bank the light again disappeared. This was not the work of a ghost for ghosts do not exists &ndash; it was the work of a siddha devayoni.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Last Sunday I started discussing ekendriya. I said that the human mind is like a cloud spreading slowly and gradually across the sky; bringing everything it encounters within its periphery. This subjectivization is called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na (knowledge) in Sam&#x301;skrta. The process of knowing has a few stages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What is knowledge? It is psychic assimilation of external projections. Parama Purus&#x301;a has been creating countless projections in the external world &ndash; the sky, the wind, the hills, the mountains and numerous other entities. We may or may not be able to see them, but they do exist. There are innumerable subjects (the unit &ldquo;I&#146;s&rdquo;) witnessing and innumerable objects being witnessed. These unit &ldquo;I&#146;s&rdquo; are thinking, &ldquo;I am the projection of Parama Purus&#x301;a and the objects I perceive are also the projection of Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo; This is the first stage of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the next stage human beings develop a desire to know more about those external objects. They question what they are, where, when and how they originated, and so on. Likewise they seek to discover more about themselves and pose the same fundamental questions. Kasya tvam&#x301; va&#x301; kuta a&#x301;yatah. &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; they ask. &ldquo;Where have I come from? And why? Where shall I go from here?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Jur&#x301;a&#x301;ite ca&#x301;i kotha&#x301;y jur&#x301;a&#x301;i<br>Kotha&#x301; hate ese kotha&#x301; bhese ya&#x301;i<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[I want to get peace, but how?<br>Where have I come from and where do I drift?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In their search for the answer human beings strive to realize that Supreme Entity. This is the second stage of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->On seeing an ant, you may ask many questions; Where do ants live? How many legs have they got? How do they see and hear? You study the ant in various ways. The ant becomes subjectivized and its image is created in your mind. You can easily visualize its different parts, allowing you to form an idea about it. This is the process of acquiring knowledge, a process divided into three stages: ava-a&#x301;tmasthiiksa&#x301;ran&#x301;a, upa-a&#x301;tmasthiikaran&#x301;a, and samyak-a&#x301;tmasthiika&#x301;ran&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the first stage (ava-a&#x301;tmasthiikaran&#x301;) you form a rough idea about an object in the external world, but do not try to enter its psychic sphere. This is the normal process regarding most objects. You may say, &ldquo;This species of palmyra grows in abundance in northern India. It has such and such characteristics. But this species of palmyra is common to southern India. It looks quite different from its northern cousin.&rdquo; So in the process of ava-a&#x301;tmasthiikaran&#x301;a (superficial assimilation of projection) we study the external characteristics of an object. If someone asks you, you can easily give a description of different species of palmyra, but you will not be able to go any deeper because you have not entered its psychic sphere. From external observation you can determine the nature of a person, but without penetrating his psychic sphere you will be unable to tell whether he is truly good, or merely a wicked person in the guise of a good man.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Penetrating the psychic sphere can be done in two ways: through applied psychology and through Cosmic Grace. When you attain the quality of macrocosmic omniscience, by His grace, your mind can easily enter the minds of others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Most people can reach the stage of superficial psychic assimilation. With this superficial knowledge the pandits debate amongst themselves, scholars write theses, and groups of intellectuals repudiate each others arguments. Strangely, many so called intellectuals have grossly inflated egos even though they have only attained this superficial knowledge. Actually they know so little.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;tmajin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam&#x301; vidurjin&#x32D;a&#x301;nam&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na&#x301;nyanya&#x301;ni ya&#x301;nitu;<br>Ta&#x301;ni jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na&#x301;vabha&#x301;sa&#x301;ni sa&#x301;rasyanaeva bodhana&#x301;t.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Internal knowledge, that is self knowledge, and not the knowledge of the intellect, is the real knowledge. Other knowledge is merely the shadow of knowledge. Through intellectual knowledge one cannot attain anything.&rdquo; No matter how learned people might be in this world, they are all throwing mud in the realm of superficial psychic assimilation. They remain ignorant of the reality behind each object. This sort of superficial psychic assimilation takes place due to study, intellection cultivation, direct perception, inference, testimony and authority.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Perception takes place when the sensory organs assimilate external objects. It&#146;s accuracy depends on the degree of assimilation. If our eyes are defective, for example, perception through them also becomes defective. If one glances hastily at tomato seeds, brinjal seeds and chilli seeds, one may mistake one for the other. So perception is not always a reliable source of information.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The second source of knowledge is inference, which is even more unreliable in conveying information from the external world. In winter smoke rises from many sources. Suppose water is suddenly converted into vapour, it appears as if smoke is rising. If you take that vapour to be smoke you are wrong. Thus inference is not a reliable source of knowledge. Suppose you see smoke coming out of a thatched hut. You may conclude that the hut is on fire, but on further investigation will realize that the family is lighting the oven. So through inference one cannot arrive at a safe conclusion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The next source of knowledge is authority (a&#x301;gama). People normally accept the words of a teacher or the printed words as being factually correct. When someone points out that some of the informations printed in a particular book are wrong common people will refuse to believe it, because for them the printed word is sacred. I read in one page of Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram&#x301;, Suniilakomalacchavim&#x301;. According to Sam&#x301;skrta spelling it should &ldquo;laks&#x301;abim&rdquo;, but has been wrongly printed as &ldquo; lacchavim&#x301;&rdquo;. Ordinary people will say that they have seen it spelled that way in a book so how can it be wrong? Thus authority is not a reliable source of knowledge. So superficial psychic assimilation of external objects through direct perception, inference or authority is very unreliable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->In the upa-a&#x301;tmasthiikaran&#x301;a&#x301; stage one enters the psychic stratum. Take the case of the palmyra tree. What group does it belong to? It belongs to the palm group. What are the physical characteristics of the trees of the palm group? What are their psychic wants? By posing such questions you will gain knowledge about the palmyra and its special psychology. You will realize that if the saliva of any animal touches the palmyra tree, its growth gets stunted. Suppose an animal eats the leaves of a palmyra sapling and drops a little of its saliva onto the plant. The speed of its growth will certainly be hampered. So according to its peculiar psychology, it reacts when the external saliva comes in contact with its internal psychic juice. Consequently its natural growth and fruit bearing capacity will be decreased. This is the general rule of all the trees of the palm group. Coconuts and betel-nut trees have the same characteristics. You will understand these facts through upa-a&#x301;tmasthikaran&#x301;am because you become acquainted with it&#146;s basic psychology. When you sit beside a tree you will intuitively understand what the tree is thinking. Of course, the tree won&#146;t say anything loudly, but you will be able to communicate with it because your mind has established a link with its mind. Regarding the characteristics of trees in the palm group, [[Ks&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301;]] said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Ba&#x301;ra batsare phele ta&#x301;l,<br>Yadi na&#x301; la&#x301;ge gorur na&#x301;l.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[The [[palm]] tree bears fruit at twelve years of age provided it is not touched by the saliva of cows.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[[The palm tree cannot tolerate cow saliva.]] So in the stage of upa-a&#x301;tmasthikaran&#x301;a one comes in contact with the inner heart, the inner life and the inner mind of all objects, leading to one&#146;s knowledge becoming deeper and more confirmed. The mind derives much contentment from its contact with the inner mind of certain plants, animals and human beings, for through such contact one can render better to service to them. One will develop a certain degree of self satisfaction for one&#146;s psychic assimilation will have been of some use. This is also a step in the acquisition of knowledge. But it does have a particular disadvantage. This contact with the inner mind of a tree, animal or human being depends on the freshness or strength of your mind. If for some reason your mental power is lost the capacity to acquire knowledge through superficial psychic assimilation and upa-a&#x301;tmasthikaran&#x301;a will also be lost. Suppose you are a very experienced psychologist. If your mind ceases to function properly, you won&#146;t be able to utilize any of that knowledge you had acquired. People who have practised the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of avidya&#x301; tantra can develop the power to know the minds of others. But such acquired power is short-lived &ndash; it will desert them one day. If they misuse even a small amount of this acquired power, they will lose it immediately. Perhaps you have heard of certain instances when this has happened.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The last stage is samyaka a&#x301;tmasthiikaran&#x301;a. When the sky filling cloud of the mind is directed towards Parama Purus&#x301;a it is called dharmamega in scripture. Human beings come in close proximity with Parama Purus&#x301;a through the science of dharmamega. That stage is called samyaka a&#x301;tmasthiikaran&#x301;a. It is the stage in which sa&#x301;dhakas form a clear understanding of the physical, psychic, and spiritual realms of life. They thereby come to know of everything of this universe. Their knowledge is lasting, final and absolute. The scripture says, rtambhara&#x301; tatra prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;, i.e., their knowledge is filled with veracity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Permanent knowledge is not possible through perception, inference, or authority, or by studying books or discourses. The knowledge which one attains by expanding one&#146;s mind in the psychic sphere through the practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, which I gave the name upa a&#x301;tmasthiikaran&#x301;a is also not everlasting, although it does last for a certain period. Knowledge only becomes permanent when the human beings withdraw the entire intuitive element and focus it on their spiritual point of ideation. At that time the entire universe comes within the scope of their mind, and they become omniscient.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the previous discourse I discussed the process of acquiring knowledge. And in the discourse before that I explained the seven types of devayoni. They all come within the scope of ekendriya. To have a clear understanding of this stage of ekendriya, some discussion on the mind stuff is required.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->While analysing the nature of the mind, I remember something which is not totally out of context. In Bengali the Sam&#x301;skrta word mana (mind) is pronounced &ldquo;mon&rdquo; and not &ldquo;man.&rdquo; The letter &ldquo;a&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x0985;</span>) has three styles of pronunciation. sam&#x301;vrta, vivrta and tiryak.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The Sam&#x301;vrta style of pronunciation is [[<span class=Bengali>&#x0995;</span>-<span class=Bengali>&#x0985;</span>. The vivrta is <span class=Bengali>&#x0995;&#x09CD;</span>, <span class=Bengali>&#x0985;</span> and the tiryak is <span class=Bengali>&#x0995;&#x09CB;</span>-<span class=Bengali>&#x0985;&#x09CB;</span>]]. Take the word &ldquo;aman&rdquo; for instance: &ldquo;a&rdquo; is pronounced in the Sam&#x301;vrta style and &ldquo;ma&rdquo; in the tiryak style. Take another example: &ldquo;kakhan&rdquo;. Here the letter &ldquo;ka&rdquo; is pronounced in the sam&#x301;vrta style while &ldquo;kha&rdquo; is pronounced in the tiryak style. In the languages of Bihar, Angika, Maithili and Magahi, &ldquo;ma&rdquo; is pronounced as [[&ldquo;mo-a&rdquo;]].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->However mind is a particular ectoplasmic state. Here I do not often use ectoplasm or endoplasm. Mind is a flowing entity which wants to surround to engulf any object. What do you do with the object of a person whom we love so much? You want to control that object or that person according to your mental will. Each and every mother wants her son to be within her control. If her child goes out of control she complains, &ldquo;Well, my son used to be obedient to me, but no more &ndash; nowadays he is under the control of his wife.&rdquo; So everyone wants to control objects or human beings. This is the actual state of psychic affairs. Then what is ekendriya? When you develop a fascination for a particular object or person your mind encircles it. In this process of expansion your mind develops a special liking for the object or person it comes in contact with. This occurs when the internal sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra of the person or the object is in perfect adjustment with your own samskaras. You notice that the rhythmic vibration of that entity and your own psychic rhythm are parallel (there is no imposition from anywhere) and you develop a love for it. I have already explained to you the difference between &ldquo;fascination&rdquo; and &ldquo;love&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->What is the actual import of ekendriya? At first the mind is drawn towards the entity in a particular way &ndash; it flows unhindered across the boundary of liking and enters the sphere of love. At that time the mind neither has the desire nor the scope for any distraction whatsoever. All it wants is to flow towards the object it loves. If it encounters a second entity on the way it will ignore it, so strong is its one pointed pursuit for its object of love.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Uca&#x301;t&#x301;an man na&#x301; ma&#x301;ne ba&#x301;ran&#x301;,<br>Shudhu ta&#x301;ri pa&#x301;ne chut&#x301;e ya&#x301;y.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[The mind is extremely impatient &ndash; it listens to no one,<br>But rushes towards its object of love.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So the mind moves towards that Supreme One. You may know some people whose minds always run after money. You might have asked them to sit down for a while and have a chat, and been surprised by their excusing themselves, saying they were so busy and had to rush off to the stock exchange. If their pursuit of money is hampered in any way, if it eludes their grasp, if they are totally severed from it, their minds will lose their base and they will die.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->All crude objects on which people base their hopes and aspirations will certainly disappear one day, for the nature of this relative world is &ldquo;Yah a&#x301;gacchati sah gacchati&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Whatever comes, goes.&rdquo; When people are deserted by their crude objects of desire they are eaten away by frustration and disappointment, and die a miserable death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->I heard that once, when the currency was devalued, a wealthy jute merchant suddenly died because all the aspiration of his life were based on money. He could not face the prospect of having to part with his cherished object of desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This is ekendriya. One should concentrate one&#146;s mind on the Supreme One to the exclusion of all mundane objects; for they can give no lasting support. To come and go is their intrinsic nature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->If one focuses all the flows and moods of the mind on a certain object, idea or philosophy to fulfil one&#146;s hopes and aspirations, can that be called ekendriya? You know in the past in India there was a debate on the theory of pure non-dualism (vishuddha advaetava&#x301;da) which continued for a long time. Today this theory has been almost totally rejected. Those who accepted it as their cherished philosophy, investing all their accumulated mental energy on its different branches and ramifications, met a tragic end. They discovered that the trunk of the tree, in whose branches, twigs and foliage they had been taking shelter, had been felled! They joined the ranks of the living dead, their hopes and aspirations shattered forever. The life of a person obsessed with philosophical theory, who denies the existence of Parama Purus&#x301;a, is bound to become wrought with frustrations. That&#146;s why in the ekendriya stage it is unwise to accept any physical object or intellectual doctrine as one&#146;s object of ideation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->When an intellectual doctrine is proven invalid in the battle of logic, and ultimately shown to be dogmatic, what happens? The characteristic of dogma is to expand more and more. Do you know what expands when it is cut? The answer is a pencil, a pond and dogma. If someone tries to root out a dogma from people&#146;s mind they tend to use even more dogma to justify their present dogma. Even when they are defeated they refuse to accept defeat. There are some so-called scholars who meet with a crushing defeat, yet never admit to being defeated. They call it a &ldquo;voluntary retreat&rdquo;. So, if you accept any mundane object or any dogmatic idea as the goal of your life, you will find yourself locked in the darkest dungeon.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The real spirit of ekendriya is this: the mind, having discarded all physical objects, ideas and dogmas, embraces the Supreme One as its supreme and only goal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In my previous discussion I explain that the mind can accept something physical as its object. The difference between these two is minimal. An object which has less inter-atomic and inter-molecular space is what we call matter. In the physical sphere differences in thought occur due to the variations in ectoplasmic or introplasmic space.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->No physical goals of human life can ever be permanent. No two entities of this world have a uniform velocity. Take the sense organs and physical objects. The velocity of these two is not equal &ndash; one moves forward while the other lags behind. They are just like two vehicles &ndash; one accelerating, the other slowing down. But after a while the one that was behind catches up with the other one and overtakes it. Thus there is a constant conflict between the physical entities you cherish as your objects of desire today, and the physical objects which will have the position of paramount importance in your life tomorrow, When you move ahead on your path, one advances, the other falls behind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Once, in my childhood, I stayed in a village in Bhagalpur district which I grew to love immensely. Forty years after I returned to the village. I looked for my favourite river and ponds but was unable to trace them. Nor could I find the playground or the houses I remembered. And the house we lived in looked so different I hardly recognized it. The river where we bathed and played was unseen for it had changed its course and was flowing about two miles from the village. Naturally I did not feel the same for the village as I had before. Actually I felt bored and left the place soon after. Why did this happen? Because my life and the life of the village were not moving at the same speed. There was a gap between myself and the village. The &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; were dead and gone. In the material world human beings must carry out their duties without being bound by the binding fetters. The mind should not get helplessly attached to anything undesirable, otherwise it will have to undergo severe afflictions. The wise person carries out his or her duties in the world without getting attached to anything. One must always remember,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Always remember that you have to discharge your duties while remaining fully aware of your Supreme goal. As I already mentioned the philosophy which is accepted as infallible today will be rejected through logical argumentation tomorrow. The vast structure based on that irrational philosophy will crumble like a house of cards. No intellectual notion should be accepted as Supreme goal of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Mana eva manus&#x301;ya&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;m ka&#x301;ra&#x301;nam&#x301; bandhamoks&#x301;ayoh,<br>Bandhasya vis&#x301;aya&#x301;saungimuktonirvis&#x301;ayam&#x301; tatha&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The mind is the cause of bondage or liberation of human beings. A person under bondage is attached to a mental or physical object, whereas the liberated one is free from all objects.&rdquo; If the mind is confined to something physical or psychic it is bound to be assailed by either pleasure or pain &ndash; it is inevitable. However hard you may try you can not avoid it, because you are so inseparably bound to your objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->It is also true that you will not remain associated with your object forever because the speed of movement of both cannot be equal forever. The person with whom you live with all the warmth of your life will ultimately desert you &ndash; it is a cruel game. Confronted with this grim reality one should be very cautious about selecting one&#146;s goal. One thing is clear &ndash; the Supreme Entity alone should be accepted as one&#146;s goal. The question of difference in speed does not arise in the case of Parama Purus&#x301;a for He is beyond speed. This is extremely important. When there is the question of speed one either advances or falls behind. Speed differs between those entities which come within the domain of time, space and person. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is beyond the relative factors for He is the relative factors (they are embedded in Him) and thus the question of speed does not arise.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->A pertinent question arises here &ndash; how do the fundamental relative factors emerge? Space emerge when the Supreme Entity is converted into five fundamental factors sue to the binding influence of the sentient, mutative and static principles of Prakrti. The state in which Parama Purus&#x301;a is not transformed into the five fundamental factors is beyond the scope of space.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Time is a mental measurement of the motivity of action. To a common person it appears as if the earth is fixed and the sun moves around the earth. He or she understands that the earth moves the sun, but from perception, it appears that the sun moves around the earth. The mind measures the movement of the rotating sun. It calculates the different position of the sun in the morning, at midday and in the evening. If the mind or the rotating entity were to perish, time would also cease to exist. So time will only cease to exist when Parama Purus&#x301;a is no longer transformed into the manifested universe in the flow of His cosmic cycle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The third relative factor is person. In fact, only Parama Purus&#x301;a exists. But when He metamorphoses Himself into many in a sportive mood and plays with his created manifestation, the personal factor emerges. There was no personal factor before the creation, neither will there be after its dissolution. When Parama Purus&#x301;a remains in His original stance, He is the Supreme psycho-spiritual pabulum of the human mind. But the problem is that this Impersonal Entity cannot be meditated upon. Only when He changes His original stance (nitya&#x301;nanda) into His playful stance (liilananda) can human beings make Him the Supreme goal of life and an object of meditation. When the Supreme Entity is metamorphosed into His playful stance the relative factors are bound to exist, otherwise how will He play with his creations?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->You cannot see electricity directly (no one has ever seen it), but can see its effect in the revolving fan and illuminated bulb. When Parama Purus&#x301;a remains preoccupied with all His objects, animate and inanimate, in His playful stance, then you can easily meditate upon Him. Any material or psychic object that one adopts as one&#146;s object of adoration will certainly perish one day leaving one totally devastated. But the Supreme Entity who has been playing with His created microcosms since eternity will remain. He is the only object of adoration for human beings. Hence intelligent people will accept Parama Purus&#x301;a as their goal and nothing else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->There is another important factor for consideration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;nanda brahmeti vyajana&#x301;t a&#x301;nanda&#x301;dheva khalvima&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni ja&#x301;yante<br>A&#x301;nandena ja&#x301;tani jiivanti a&#x301;nandam&#x301; prayantyabhisam&#x301; vishantiiti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->One should know Brahma, the embodiment of bliss (a&#x301;nandam). All created entities have emanated from a&#x301;nandam, are preserved in a&#x301;nandam and will finally dissolve into a&#x301;nandam. At the initial stage human beings try to attain this Supreme Entity through the medium of one indriya at a time, but at a final stage attain Him with their entire existence (that is, all thoughts, propensities and urges), which is not possible in the first stage. While sitting in meditation one closes the gateway of one particular indriya (the organ of sight, for example) and prays, &ldquo;Oh Parama Purus&#x301;a please manifest yourself in me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Asado ma&#x301; sadgamayo tamaso ma&#x301; jyotirgamayo.<br>Mrtyorma&#x301;mrta gamayo a&#x301;viraviramayaedhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<p class="plain"><center>* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</center></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Rudra yatte daks&#x301;in&#x301;am&#x301; mukham tena ma&#x301;m&#x301; pa&#x301;hi nityam.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Oh Parama Purus&#x301;a please appear suddenly in the dark corners of my mind. Let me see you with my mental eyes&rdquo;. This type of &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; with one&#146;s mental eyes is called ekendriya. The eyes are as indriya. Similarly, the rs&#x301;i prays, &ldquo;Oh Lord, come still closer to me so that I can serve you&rdquo;. Here the devotee wants to attain the Lord through the indriya of touch. Or the rs&#x301;i may pray, &ldquo;Oh Lord, play your sweet flute so I can hear your divine tune and be absorbed in you, forgetting myself. Please come to me in the form of a blissful melody.&rdquo; This is an attempt to attain Him through a different indriya &ndash; the auditory organ. So these are examples of the initial attempts to come into the closest proximity of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is not the first but the third stage of sadhana.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->We were discussing ekendriya, the third stage of spiritual practice. Sa&#x301;dhakas reach this stage having advanced step by step along the spiritual path.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Let us discuss the nature of the indriyas. In Sam&#x301;skrta &ldquo;indra&rdquo; means &ldquo;greatest&rdquo;, and thus according to mythology Indra is the king of the Gods. Sal trees are called &ldquo;indra brks&#x301;a&rdquo; due to their huge size.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The human body is composed of eight main parts and is thus called as&#x301;t&#x301;aun&#x32D;ga. Prostration is called sas&#x301;t&#x301;aun&#x32D;ga pran&#x301;a&#x301;ma. Some teachers of ayurveda include the navel area and the back in the list of the body&#146;s main constituent parts, but this is not totally appropriate. Of the five sensory organs (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin), one, the skin, can be omitted, and of the five motor organs (vocal cord, hands, legs, excretory and genital organ), one, the vocal cord can be omitted. This leaves the eight constituent parts. And the prostration made with these eight body-parts is called sas&#x301;t&#x301;aun&#x32D;ga pranama. Now the question is why have these eight indriyas been selected and the chest, back and navel area omitted? The reason is that without the help of the indriyas one&#146;s inherent characteristics cannot be manifested. They also play a dominant role in giving expression to one&#146;s physical characteristics. For example, when you see or hear something you may become happy or angry. The changes in mood (one&#146;s excitement or tranquillity) in the psychic sphere are due to the activity of the indriyas. The indriyas are the centres of activity, the main gateways of the physical world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now you may ask, what is mind? The mind is neither something physical nor something purely spiritual. That which is directly related to the quinquelemental world and simultaneously related to the psychic world is called &ldquo;indriya&rdquo;. Take the indriya of sight. The gateway of this indriya is the eyes themselves, but it is the optical nerve which connects it with the psychic world. Judged in this light the indriyas are superior to the physical body since they are connected with the psychic world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The mind does not have any physical or psychic gateway. What we call the eye is not the real eye, but is merely the gateway of the eye organ. The optical nerve which is connected to the psychic world is the actual eye. So what is the mind? The mind is not perceived from outside since it has no physical or psychic gateway, but at the same time it is connected to the indriyas. That&#146;s why after proper deliberation, the experienced philosophers of the past recognized mind as a special indriya, [the eleventh indriya. The difference between this eleventh indriya] and the other ten is that it has no external gateway as the eyes have. Because of this subtle difference the mind is recognized as a subtler indriya and Because of its subtler power it exercisesa far greater influence on the human body than the ten indriyas. These ten indriyas always convey information to the mind. The mind on receiving the information creates reactions to it in the physical body, and in the process gets reacted to itself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If you want to get good service from the mind, you must keep it in a state of tranquillity. For this you must send information through the ten indriyas and the eight limbs which will maintain the equipoise and equilibrium of the mind. Suppose someone is seated at dining table. If you were to break the news of a relative&#146;s death at that time it would definitely destroy his composure, and he will leave the table, having lost all appetite. Even those of you who practice sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; say, &ldquo;I&#146;m feeling a little troubled today, I won&#146;t eat anything.&rdquo; If you feel disturbed mentally why shouldn&#146;t you eat physically? After all, it is the body which eats. The reason is that the mind exerts a tremendous influence over the body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Those who wish to elevate the mind, should knowingly bring the indriyas within the contact of someone whose inspiration will cause only positive information to be sent to the mind. The influence of positive inferences will have such a beneficial effect that the ectoplasmic stuff will be powdered down and converted into cognitive faculty.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->I said that the mind is also an indriya, the eleventh indriya but one without a gateway. Thus we cannot say it internalizes a certain external vibration or externalizes any internal thought through a particular gateway. That job is done by the other ten organs. The eyes take the image of an external object to the mind. The ahamtattva portion of the mind &ldquo;sees&rdquo; the imagine and relays its reaction to the indriyas through the citta (mahattattva, ahamtattva and the citta are the three functional chambers of the mind). Thus the mind is surely the lord of the indriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Who is the lord of the mind? The vital energy (pra&#x301;na&#x301;). The mind &ndash; a very peculiar entity &ndash; moves within the domain of the abstract and material worlds. It&#146;s location is within the brain, which is something material and it&#146;s controller is the vital energy. When the human mind is calm, the respiration slows down. But conversely, when the mind is agitated, the breathing becomes rapid. When one runs the whole body is active and so the breathing is rapid, and when breathing is rapid, the mind is restless. While running quickly you cannot think deeply about anything due to the mind being in state of motion. During pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma the vital energy controls the mind.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The flow of breath continues according to the shortening or lengthening of the period of one&#146;s thought. By channelizing the natural system of respiration into a particular rhythm one controls one&#146;s mind through pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The indriyas are the controller of the body, the mind the controller of the indriyas, and the vital energy the controller of the mind. That&#146;s why on the path of spiritual practice, and particularly in the practice of asta&#x301;un&#x32D;ga yoga (the eight fold path consisting of yama, niyama, a&#x301;sana, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, pratya&#x301;ha&#x301;ra, dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, dhya&#x301;na, and sama&#x301;dhi) pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma plays a very significant role.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->So when the respiratory system becomes restless, due to one&#146;s individual reactive momenta, the mind also becomes restless. When the mind becomes restless a particular propensity or sense organ also becomes very restless, and another particular propensity or indriya also remains inactive. This is the general rule. But, if one&#146;s respiratory system becomes rhythmic and calm through the process of pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma then a particular propensity or sense organ becomes tranquil. This is something which is very important to remember. Through prolonged practice of pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;yama one learns which propensity or indriya becomes more active due to the restlessness of the respiratory system and which propensity or sense organ becomes more tranquil due to the pause of the respiratory system. This regular practice is known as yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->If a person becomes agitated, causing his respiration to speed up, and his fists to close tightly the propensity (vrtti) of anger can easily get expressed. If this situation continues for long[[, what will happen? Among the propensities of lust, anger, greed, vanity, attachment and jealousy,]] anger will easily dominate the other propensities, and the hand indriya (in Sam&#x301;skrta the palm is called pa&#x301;n&#x301;i and its action is called shilpana) will become active resulting in him angrily slapping or punching another person. It often happens that a person will be able to control all the ripus (psychic enemies) except one, say the ripu of anger. This is also the same in the case of the indriyas &ndash; all the indriyas may be under one&#146;s control except one, say the hand. Or conversely, a particular ripu or indriya may be perfectly controlled while the others are not. There are some people whose only weakness is greed. They have an uncontrollable desire for food, for pickles or rasagolla. They don&#146;t even care what other people think about them. That is they have totally lost his control over the instinct of greed. Some people have trouble controlling the movement of their legs, and even move them while sitting down To have control or lose control over a particular vrtti may be both temporary and permanent. Some people are totally free from greed, neither greed for money, nor greed for food, but cannot control their other vrttis. A person may have no problem observing a vow of silence for two years, but is unable to control his legs and often kicks people indiscriminately, or if he controls his legs, cannot control his hands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->That particular psychology, when a particular vrtti or indriya is under control is called &ldquo;ekendriya.&rdquo; That is in the process of psychic development sa&#x301;dhakas reach a stage where a particular sense organ or propensity either hinders their spiritual progress, or leads them towards extreme subtlety. This stage is called ekendriya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Before arriving at the stage of perfect ekendriya one may attain it temporarily. For example, one may be able to observe a vow of silence for a few days will break it after a few days due to boredom. Often after a quarrel two people decide never to utter a word to each other again. However, after some time they find some excuse to make amends. Again, someone may angrily refuse to eat anything. The other family members try at length to persuade him to forget everything and eat his food, but to no avail. When they stop pleading with him, however, he feels neglected and writes on the wall, &ldquo;If you ask me one more time I&#146;ll eat my food.&rdquo; Obviously he is not fully in control of his whole being and before his control finally collapses wants to be requested publicly to eat one more time. He will then say that he had no other choice but to break his vow to fast because he was persistently requested to do so.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->So one particular propensity or indriya may be under control, but not the others. This is termed negative ekendriya. One of my cousins was an avid supporter of Mohan Bagan football team. Whenever he went to the match and saw them score a goal he would shout &ldquo;gooaaal&rdquo; with the other spectators in a frenzy of excitement. One night he shouted &ldquo;gooaaal&rdquo; while dreaming and kicked my uncle who was sleeping beside him. This incident shows that although my cousin had control over the other parts of his body, he had no control over his legs. When a player wants to score a goal his leg mechanically kicks the ball. During sleep when his subconscious mind was functioning and not the conscious mind, the memory of the football match came alive on his mental plate. As the conscious mind was inactive, the subconscious mind could activate the nerve cells directly, so as soon as his vocal chord shouted &ldquo;goal&rdquo; his legs, in adjustment with rhythm of the nerve cells and fibre, kicked the ball into the goal. In life such things happen quite often. These are the expressions of ekendriya tattva during the dream stage. I am sure you have experienced such things yourself. Try to compare these experiences with the actual reality.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->So far we been explaining the different stages of psycho-spiritual practice. Last Sunday I discussed ekendriya and in that context I analysed the science of indriyas and discussed the circumstances in which people act and think.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->By the way you should know that sama&#x301;dhi does not only occur as a result of a certain realization; other sama&#x301;dhis can occur on indriyas or the five fundamental factors. When the mind is focused on a particular object and becomes intensely concentrated it is called sama&#x301;dhi. According to spiritual science the sama&#x301;dhi attained when the entire mind is pin-pointed on Parama Purus&#x301;a is called prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->When a sa&#x301;dhaka focuses his or her mind on the solid factor (solid is one of the five fundamental factors) and thinks &ldquo;I am the earth&rdquo; he or she attains ks&#x301;itibhaetik sama&#x301;dhi, losing all practical intelligence in the process. Those who constantly think about rupees or dollars attain a kind of sama&#x301;dhi, too, for they become completely identified with their crude object of attraction. If such people incur heavy losses due to the collapse of their business or bank, they will die an instant death, for the pillars on which their life was built crumbled beneath them. So, once they lost their wealth, they lost their lives too.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So sama&#x301;dhi can be attained if one focuses one&#146;s mind on a particular thought, sense organ or inference (sound, form, touch, taste and smell). The sama&#x301;dhi on inferences is called tanma&#x301;trik sama&#x301;dhi. Sometime ago I gave a practical demonstration of tanmatric sama&#x301;dhi. I demonstrated the type of physical and psychic changes which occur when the mind is withdrawn from a specific inference or tanma&#x301;tra. [refer to Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell, Part IV]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Suppose there is a rose. If the entire mind is focused on the colour of the rose it will become totally identified with it and will ultimately think, &ldquo;I am the rose.&rdquo; Similarly, sama&#x301;dhis on the indriyas is also possible. One who attains sama&#x301;dhi on a particular indriya consciously bring it under one&#146;s control and get one&#146;s work done accordingly to one&#146;s sweet will. This was widely practiced in avidya&#x301; tantra in the past. The indriyas can function within and beyond their immediate surroundings. For instance, from here you can physically see a part of Calcutta. But if you have been to Naiha&#x301;ti (a small town about thirty miles from Calcutta) you will certainly be able to visualize a part of Naiha&#x301;ti town while sitting here in the room. In this case there should be proper adjustment between the eyes and the previous perception. In this case it is the mental eye which actually visualizes part of Naiha&#x301;ti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Avidya tantriks make use of this sort of process. With the help of their sense organs and ectoplasms they create positive hallucinations. In Sam&#x301;skrta this science is called raks&#x301;asi vidya&#x301;. Raks&#x301;asa does not refer to any monstrous type of animal, but to a particular group of humans. With the help of your mental eyes and your psychic power you can create an image visible to the eyes of an ordinary person. You can actually suspend the power of vision of another person so that he sees the object you want him to see. This is called raks&#x301;asi ma&#x301;ya&#x301; (a kind of hypnotic spell) Such negative practices are common in avidya&#x301; tantra. For example, a wicked person is sitting in a lonely place with bones scattered around him. Using his psychic power he can create &ldquo;ectoplasmic hands&rdquo; and command them to throw the bones into the house of that person he wishes to harm. The inhabitants of the house, ordinary people no doubt, will certainly be terrified by such occult phenomena. They will think it is the work of a ghost and will probably decide to move out of the house. Instead of bones, bricks and stones could also be hurled. To do this one does not require great power &ndash; raks&#x301;asi ma&#x301;ya is an occult power of an inferior quality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The Ramayana, the great Indian fictive epic, contains some stories which illustrate ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asi ma&#x301;ya. The golden deer is one such a story. Of course, there was never a real golden deer could you ever think of such a thing? &ndash; it was the demon Ma&#x301;riic who made a golden deer out of his occult power. Another such story goes as follows. Prince Angad, the son of the King Bali, was about to present his credentials to King Ravana in the court. The nineteen ministers present wanted to humiliate him in some way, and decided to use their ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asi ma&#x301;ya&#x301; for the purpose. Present in the court at the time were Prince Angad, King Ravana and his son Indrajita, and the nineteen ministers. In order to baffle Angad, the ministers created a form tanma&#x301;tra, a type of positive hallucination, through which they all assumed the form of King Ravana. So, his vision distorted, saw that there were a total of twenty Ravanas beside Indrajita. Nineteen of them were the ministers, of course, but due to the hypnotic spell exercised on his unit mind (a kind of tanma&#x301;tric sama&#x301;dhi) they all looked like Ravana. The best way to disturb someone&#146;s mental concentration is to make him or her angry by being provocative. Be it vidya&#x301; tantra or avidya&#x301; tantra, everything depends on the degree of psychic concentration. So Angada thought, &ldquo;I have to disturb their mental balance by provoking them in some way. If I make them angry they will certainly lose their ectoplasmic support and simultaneously their tanma&#x301;tric sama&#x301;dhi, and will revert to their original tanma&#x301;tric form&rdquo;. Angad did just that. He said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Angada Kahila tave shuna indrajita&#x301;<br>Vishti ra&#x301;van dekhi vishti ki tor pita?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->[Listen Indrajita. I can see twenty Ravanas. Are they all your father?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->All of them become furious lost their mental balance and became their original selves permitting Angad to single out the real Ravana and submit his credentials.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Sama&#x301;dhi on the indriyas is much higher than tanma&#x301;tric sama&#x301;dhi. Tanma&#x301;tric sama&#x301;dhi is higher than the sama&#x301;dhi on the fundamental factors, even though the tanma&#x301;tras are only five in number. The reason is that these five tanma&#x301;tras have countless expressions. For instance, a single rose plant may have twenty flowering roses, each with its own size and colour. Each and every object of this colourful universe has a certain speciality of its own. This speciality divides the tanma&#x301;tras into numerous fragments &ndash; that is, in one form tanma&#x301;tra there are countless forms; in one sound tanma&#x301;tra there are countless sounds. In the musical world we hear of six ra&#x301;gas and thirty six ra&#x301;giniis but actually their number is much more than that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The sama&#x301;dhis on indriyas are concerned with the five motor organs. If the six indriyas (sensory organs) are controlled then people can easily elevate themselves to higher states of existence. That&#146;s why this sama&#x301;dhi is greater than other sama&#x301;dhis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->While explaining the concept of ekendriya, I consider it important to explain something about the sama&#x301;dhi of the indriyas. In my next discourse I would like to discuss some interesting things about ekendriya which might have happened in your personal lives, but which your intellect could explain how and why it happened.<!-- /block --></p>

For example if the organ of hearing is properly controlled it can attract many things from the external world through the ectoplasm, and conversely can project many internal thoughts and make others listen. This phenomena comes within the scope of ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asi vidya&#x301; of ancient Indian psychology. I have already told you that ra&#x301;ks&#x301;asi vidya&#x301; is not the black magic of the so called demons, but a kind of occult science. Perhaps you know that Tantra is divided into two branches, and similarly, occult powers are expressed in two ways. Sa&#x301;dhakas who have reached iishvarakoti, (but not Brahmakot&#x301;i, the highest stage of human realization) through intense spiritual practice attain both vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301; shakti, both positive and negative occult power. Common people usually call it aeshvarya [divine power] but this is not completely true. The other day while discussing that phenomenon with a few people I said that some of these occult powers are related to space while others are beyond it. Iishvarakoti sa&#x301;dhakas, through special efforts, can master some negative and positive powers, and may apply them on certain human beings, places, or ideas. But a brahmakoti sa&#x301;dhaka can apply those powers on the entire universe at the same time, through his prota-yoga. Moreover, with the help of ota-yoga, he can also apply his power on an individual place or person if he so wishes. The same thing, when applied on a crude level, may take the form of magic. This explains the eternal side.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If people remain satisfied with the attainment of these occult powers and stop advancing along the supreme path, the fullest expression of their human potentialities will be checked. To bring about the greatest fulfilment of life, sa&#x301;dhakas will have to reach the pinnacle of the state of ekendriya. That is, instead of directing their mind-stuff towards crude objects, they must channelize their minds towards the Macrocosm, and embrace the Macrocosm fully as their goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..4"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Pran&#x301;avo dhanuh sharohya&#x301;tma&#x301; Brahma tallaks&#x301;yamucyate<br>Apramattena vedhavyam&#x301; sharattanmayo bhavet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;A sa&#x301;dhaka who utilizes his spiritual practice as the bow his self as the arrow, and Parama Purus&#x301;a as the target and then tries to pierce the target with undivided attention, attains the Supreme Goal&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;dhakas who accept this sloka as the supreme and final guidance and move accordingly along the path of ekendriya sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; are capable of devoting the mind to the highest stage of spiritual realization. Their lives become so meaningful. It is not enough to only ideate on Brahma, one must also practice ekendriya sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Here ekendriya means that all the expressions of the sensory and motor nerves and all the energy and subtle power of the organs should be focused on one point. The consolidated power of the nerves, indriyas, and mind stuff should be directed towards the supreme goal. This unidirectional movement towards the goal is the stage of ekendriya. In this stage the sa&#x301;dhaka does not attach any importance to any particular indriya, idea or thought, but attaches paramount importance to the supreme goal. Such a sa&#x301;dhaka ultimately arises above both vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301; Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301; Tantra is a positive approach to the world, whereas avidya&#x301; Tantra is a negative approach. People who tread the path of negativity tend to become crude. And if they follow the positive path they may attain name, fame, social prestige, etc. but will fail to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. They even fail to attain higher lokas (realms of existence). The person who follows neither of these two paths and thinks only of Parama Purus&#x301;a will attain Him one day and will be elevated from the ekendriya stage to the vashiika&#x301;ra stage. This path, of transcending positive and negative ideas is called madhyamma&#x301;rga (middle path) in Tantra (Buddha called it majjihima&#x301; ma&#x301;gga). This is the only path, that leads to the highest fulfilment of human life. Na&#x301;nyah pantha&#x301; vidyate ayana&#x301;ya. There is no other path. At that stage the sensory world has no attraction for a sa&#x301;dhaka whatsoever. But those sa&#x301;dhakas who dabble with the positive and negative aspects of Tantra readily become engrossed in mundane affairs. The time and energy employed to master the positive and negative aspects is a waste for it diverts the mind and delays its movement towards the higher planes of existence. In my opinion it is better not to waste one&#146;s time on such inconsequential pursuits. Instead it would be wiser for people to utilize their time and energy for the attainment of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If I were to analyse the positive and negative paths you would be fascinated, but it would be if no use whatsoever in attaining Parama Purus&#x301;a. To attain Him you must reach the vashiika&#x301;ra stage.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Movement is the essence of existence. Existence is pushed from behind, and moves forward towards the Supreme pole star of all movement. This guiding force is not linear but systaltic. The degrees of its systalsis in one stage is not the same as in the subsequent stage. The reason behind this non-uniformity is that the path of movement is divided into a few stages. Any systaltic or pulsative movement within the realm of the relative factors starts from one point and terminates in another point within the domain of space. The intervening space between the two points is measured by the time factor and substantiated and sustained by the personal factor.<!-- /block --></p>

One cannot think of anything secretly, what do speak of doing anything without His knowledge. This pinnacled entity who remains as the silent witness of all phenomena is Shiva. He plays the role of the hero in all dramas, He is the unblemished, omniscient one, pervaded with the thought of the welfare of all at all times. So His role is not only that of a witness. &ldquo;Shiva&rdquo; also means the embodiment of welfare. Had He not played the role of a Supreme Benevolent Father, microcosms would not have been able to live for even a single moment. Human beings survive because they feel His benevolent touch every moment. In Him all movements culminate, in Him the supreme faculty of benevolence lies embedded, and thus He is the most lovable object in this universe. And He is not only the Supreme Cognitive Faculty, the embodiment of absolute well-being &ndash; He is much greater, much deeper than that. For He lies in the subtlest thoughts of one&#146;s mind and exists as the limitless sphere beyond the periphery of the limited human mind. Whatever human beings want or whatever they receive is His manifestation. Yet He is beyond the capacity of the human mind to comprehend. So, one should only prostrate before such an entity. The amount of bliss which human beings attain after surrendering their everything to Him is too deep to be measured by the small human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In the above shloka Parama Purus&#x301;a has been described as Sha&#x301;nta. As long as the human mind is attracted towards the glamorous external objects, as long as mental progress is checked by the pursuit of gross physicality, the human heart remains restless, and utters mournfully &ldquo; I am hungry. I am hungry&rdquo; This insatiable hunger cannot be satisfied by anything from the mundane world, and that is not possible either. So what is the solution? Only Sha&#x301;nta, the Supreme Tranquil Entity, in whom all the objects of this universe, whether animate or inanimate, positive or negative, take shelter and controls all His latent potentialities by dint of His unfathomable valour can satisfy the unlimited hunger of human beings. Only He can establish human beings in the world of supra-aesthetic joy, the abode of bliss, by applying the balm of inner peace. Another name of this Tranquil Entity is Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the field of manifestation, there are crude, subtle and causal expressions. The entity which appears as crude to me is necessarily so, for it too is saturated with the sweetness of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Whatever I consider subtle is the subtler sweetness of Parama Purus&#x301;a. He is at the root of everything of the universe. In the causal world His sweet smiling form is being transformed according to His wish and radiating divine effulgence throughout the universe. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Supreme Entity who is the seed of the three worlds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I surrender myself unto you, Oh Lord because You are the Supreme Shelter. I offer my everything at Your feet&rdquo;. There is no second entity in the universe to whom everything can be surrendered. If human beings surrender themselves to mundane or psychic objects they will ultimately be converted into crudity in their lives &ndash; misery will be their fate. No wants this. All human beings want to attain lasting happiness. But for this they will have to surrender themselves at the altar of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The culminating point of the path of movement where every manifestation culminates is also Parama Purus&#x301;a. He is the Supreme terminus of all movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Thus the psycho-spiritual path is divided into four stages: yatama&#x301;na, vyatireka, ekendriya and vashiika&#x301;ra. When the mind hovers between the crude and the subtle it is the yatamana stage. When, after vacillating between petty gains and losses one wishes to want to snap the bondage of gains and losses for good and plunge into the world of psychic bliss, it is the second stage, vyatireka. When bliss comes like a flood of light on a moonlit night, it is ekendriya. And when one strives hard to establish oneself in the absolute word by suspending all the mundane longings through psycho-spiritual endeavour it is vashiika&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="12..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Last Sunday I was discussing vashiika&#x301;ra, the last stage on the path of psycho-spiritual movement. I said that the path of human movement is divided into four stages. This movement is only successful when Parama Purus&#x301;a is accepted as the ultimate goal. This can be illustrated with an analogy. Suppose an expert boat man is rowing a boat, but is totally undecided as to where he will land, and moves aimlessly here and there. Without a fixed destination, and in spite of his skilled rowing hand, all his labour will be in vain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Tantra, as you know, is divided into two branches &ndash; vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301;. Shiva formulated all the tantras and thus all tantriks regard Shiva as their supreme and final shelter. In all schools of Tantra there are certain rules, and these are compulsory for practitioners of both vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301; tantra. The difference between these two is that avidya&#x301; tantra invariably leads one towards crudification, and ultimate annihilation, whereas vidya&#x301; tantra leads one from crude to subtle, and invigorates the human life, mind and soul &ndash; in fact the whole existence &ndash; with exuberant joy. In the initial stage of progress in spiritual sadhana the human mind becomes more subtle, enabling one to achieve a certain degree of control over the physical world as well as the mind. This realm of existence, where psychic control is exercised to some extent, is called ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a (crude mental world). Through such psychic control one can gain material wealth, or earn a certain degree of name, fame, etc. Now, where do these things come from? They come from the cruder manifestation of the Cosmic Mind. (This perceptible world is in itself a cruder manifestation of the Cosmic Mind). Thus in this stage sa&#x301;dhakas may attain and establish supremacy over certain things in the crude world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->One may also strive to make the mind more subtle while endeavouring to exercise greater control over the mundane world. This is the path of avidya&#x301; tantra. In this endeavour the practitioners remain totally preoccupied with the attainment of name, fame, prosperity and material enjoyments &ndash; these are their goals. The purpose of their spiritual practice is to make the mind increasingly subtle to be able to exercise further control over not only the physical world, but the crude minds of the other microcosms. Their goal is not noble, and will result in them being ultimately converted into inert matter. So the final resultant of avidya&#x301; tantra is extreme crudity. I have attempted to explain things in some of my ghost stories. Try to find time to read them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The second stage is artha. What is artha? Suppose a person has been struck with afflictions (there are three types &ndash; crude, subtle and causal) and seeks to destroy them. The permanent cessation of these triple affliction is named paramartha and their temporary cessation artha. In this second stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; human beings also try to make their minds more subtle through spiritual elevation, but not to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a. Their goal is to develop the capacity to dominate the minds of others. Paradoxically they are trying to make the mind subtle while attempting to establish supremacy over others. This stage is neither vidya&#x301; nor avidya&#x301; &ndash; it&#146;s an intermediate stage. Sa&#x301;dhakas who tread this path cannot attain the supreme fulfilment of existence for they try to master the psychic occult powers of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and ignore Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself. Their fate is to move in the crude arena of the psychic sphere of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Until the day comes when they lose their psychic power and degenerate. Mahars&#x301;i Jaemini, formulated his philosophy, the Miima&#x301;msa&#x301; Darshana, on the basis of this type of psychology. But in this world, such philosophy does not stand the test of pragmatism or spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the third stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; sa&#x301;dhakas accepts the cognitive faculty as their goal. They wish to advance along the spiritual path while simultaneously serving the subtler expressions of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is the true dharma of human beings. The sada&#x301;vrata (mass feeding) which you organize comes within the scope of this practice. While performing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in this stage the human mind attains a greater proximity to Parama Purus&#x301;a and sees the entire universe as a divine expression of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Through this realization one enjoys pure unblemished bliss. When people served good food during sadavrata smile happily you feel inner joy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The fourth stage is when Parama Purus&#x301;a alone is your goal and you attain oneness with Him. Its spirit is, &ldquo;with the bliss I enjoy after attaining oneness with Parama Purus&#x301;a, or with the bliss I am giving to Parama Purus&#x301;a, or with whatever emanates from that blissful entity, I shall make my existence meaningful.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->I have introduced pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cajanya to help you derive bliss from this stage. At the time of doing pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cajanya the mind becomes filled with spontaneous joy. And no external object is required &ndash; just one&#146;s inner self. This self sufficiency which every human being can realize through pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cajanya, brings success and a new spirit of fulfilment to human life. One&#146;s life will shine with the divine effulgence of Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Let your advent in this world be successful in all ways. I want your existence to shine, to be resplendent with the joy of being alive. This is the reason why I introduced pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cajanya and sada&#x301;vrata &ndash; to bring supreme fulfilment to your lives. Let your advent on this earth be successful, individually and collectively.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_title>Yatama&#x301;na &ndash; 1</div>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="13..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->It is said that the path of human progress is chiefly divided into four stages: yatama&#x301;na, vyatireka, ekendriya and vashiika&#x301;ra (the four stages in the development of a spiritual personality). These stages are applicable to the three strata of human life: the material, psychic and spiritual worlds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Yatama&#x301;na&rdquo; is derived from the Sam&#x301;skrta root verb &ldquo;yata&rdquo; + suffix &ldquo;sha&#x301;nac&rdquo; and means &ldquo;one who is endeavouring&rdquo; (the effort is still continuing). In a previous Dharma Maha Cakra (a spiritual congregation) I spoke at length about yatama&#x301;na. Now is yatama&#x301;na only a mental effort, or only a physical effort, or does it emanate from a realm higher than the mind? When people perform actions consciously, those actions must have the sanction of the mind. But even if an action is sanctified by the mind, it does not necessarily mean that it has also been sanctioned by the self. Moreover, if the mind performs an action according to the guidelines of a noble philosophy, even then it does not necessarily mean that the psychic sanction is supported by the Self (A&#x301;tman).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There are many philosophies which tend to crudify the human mind, and make people violent and inconsiderate. They make people believe that they are God&#146;s favourite children, whereas the rest of humanity are cursed. Although these views have philosophical sanction, they do not enjoy the sanction of the A&#x301;tman.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is only one case when Parama Purus&#x301;a sanctions mental thought. What is that? It is when the human mind is dedicated to the welfare of the entire humanity without any discrimination, when the sole intention is to promote universal well-being. When the human mind, motivated by such sentiments, engages itself in action through the body, only that action can be treated as real yatama&#x301;na. Other endeavours should not be defined as such.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Sometimes it also happens that the body acts without the prior approval of the mind: a person frightened by a robber, for example. People do not always act voluntarily, but sometimes out of fear, just like the slaves in olden days. A slave would labour hard at the command of his or her master. Such actions are purely limited to the physical sphere. They are actions no doubt, but they do not enjoy the support of the mind, and naturally do not have the support of A&#x301;tman or Parama Purus&#x301;a. Such deeds do not bring any welfare to the slave, and thus cannot be categorized as yatama&#x301;na. So according to true spirituality, human beings should not be reduced to slavery.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->One may say that slavery has been totally abolished from today&#146;s world. It may be true in theory, but a handful of people who deserve no better name than &ldquo;intellectual satans&rdquo; have been enslaving people by propagating defective philosophies. In a way, these exploited people are no better than slaves for they have lost their intellect. Even when one tries to enlighten them with logical arguments, they refuse to listen. Are they any better than slaves? Intellectually they are certainly slaves, and hence in the material world also they are slaves. Thus, any action on their part will not be included in the category of yatama&#x301;na because it will never lead to well-being. The first stage of human progress yatama&#x301;na is not promoted by their activities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What should be done to bring about progress in the yatama&#x301;na stage? One should learn the proper philosophy from a competent person. In order to judge what is a proper philosophy and what is a pseudo-philosophy, one should see how far the philosophy goes in treating the entire humanity as a singular entity and promoting its unity. Only that philosophy which inculcates universal sentiments is acceptable to human beings, for it alone reflects the spirit of yatama&#x301;na. Other philosophies will spoil the human treasures resulting in humans, even though they are endowed with eyes, feet, hands, etc., degenerating to the level of animality, or even below that. Animals quarrel among themselves or with others to procure food, but these crude people, even though they do not need to procure food for their survival, misuse their authority to destroy or subjugate innocent humans being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The people of today must understand this basic fact and remain vigilant against the detrimental actions of the intellectual satans and blood-sucking exploiters. The people of today must move ahead while fighting against the two enemies &ndash; the bloodsuckers who exploit in the economic sphere, and the intellectual satans who not only exploit human beings but bring them down to the level of animality. I request the present human race to continue their endless fight on these two fronts. They should remember that on both these fronts they are fighting against enemies who, being guided by dogma, have no logic in their method of exploitation. Though they are exploiting people in the socio-economic, socio-intellectual and spiritual spheres, once their conscience is aroused against dogma, their exploitation will automatically cease. The gigantic demons of exploitation will vanish in a flash.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->While explaining yatama&#x301;na [the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;], I said that it is one of the four stages of human progress. I further explained that the different stages of human progress are concerned with the three strata of life: physical, psychic and spiritual. I also said that unless human intellect is liberated, human beings cannot attain substantial progress in the material sphere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The physical bondages which keep people confined to gross physicality and deny the fullest expression of human genius are called a&#x301;dhibhaotik. The endeavour to liberate oneself from these physical bondages becomes meaningless if freedom from psychic bondages [a&#x301;dhidaevik] is not attained. There are three types of bondages &ndash; physical, psychic and spiritual. [The means of obtaining] permanent liberation from these three bondages is called parama&#x301;rtha; and [the means of obtaining] temporary liberation from them is called artha. Bondages such as hunger, thirst, the need for clothes, accommodation, medical treatment, etc. are related to this quinquelemental world and are physical in nature. That which brings temporary relief from these bondages is called artha. Suppose a man is hungry &ndash; if he has money he can go and buy some food. In this case money is the medium whereby he attains temporary relief from the bondage of hunger. Hence money is called artha in Sanskrit because it brings temporary freedom from bondage. Human beings must continue their efforts to attain artha if they have not yet attained parama&#x301;rtha. Those who teach human beings that everything in this world is false obviously do not see themselves as unreal. They propagate such misleading teachings to exploit the masses to further their own selfish interests. Of course, I do not say that everyone is doing that, but I must point out that some religious and intellectual leaders have badly cheated their fellow human beings. I repeat again that what I say does not apply to all. I declare in unambiguous terms that people will have to continue their mundane efforts to attain artha, and will try in the future to do just that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Yatama&#x301;na should be applied in the attainment of parama&#x301;rtha, but at present it is being utilized for gaining artha. If you go one step below this you will find that it is not even being used for attaining artha because the intellect which lies at the root of yatama&#x301;na cannot function independently. We sometimes say in colloquial Bengali, &ldquo;He has even taken out a mortgage on his pigtail&rdquo;. Thus, even the intellect is in bondage and one has lost the power and capacity to think independently. Such an intellect can be likened to a bird used to soaring high in the open sky but which is suddenly confined to a tiny cage. If one opens the door of the cage the bird will think, &ldquo;I am quite comfortable here. Why should I risk flying in the vast blue sky? After all, I get all the water and bird seed I want inside my little cage&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the physical and psychic spheres people have been wrongly taught to avoid the attainment of parama&#x301;rtha. Even in the mundane sphere, they do not get sufficient opportunity to stand on their own legs. It is constantly drummed into their minds in such a negative way that they are unable to utilize any opportunity which comes their way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the social sphere (which comes under the scope of a&#x301;dhibhaotik) the same thing is happening. For ages together simple innocent people have been taught that they belong to a low caste. If one asks them to sit on a chair they will reply, &ldquo;No, I am fine here on the floor&rdquo;. Even if the mind gets an opportunity to become independent, it cannot function freely. Just as that little bird kept confined to a cage develops rheumatism in its wings, the human mind, due to constant negative thoughts, gets paralysed. It is not the so-called upper castes only who are to blame &ndash; the so-called lower castes have passively accepted this sad plight like the caged bird, and have even sometimes encouraged it. This is a shame, a matter of immense regret.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[Brahmans came out of the mouth, Ks&#x301;atriyas were born out of the arms, Vaeshyas came out of the trunk of the body, and Shu&#x301;dras were born out of the feet.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Even the Supreme Entity, that formless omnipresent Parama Brahma who equally belongs to all, who is the light of all light, the dearest and nearest One, is also denied. It has been said in the above shloka that the Vipras [Brahmans, intellectuals] have been born out of the mouth of Brahma&#x301; [the Creator]; the valorous Ks&#x301;atriyas [warriors] have emerged out of His hands; the Vaeshyas [capitalists] out of His thighs; and the Shu&#x301;dras [labourers] out of His feet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->If this were true, I would say that the Shu&#x301;dras are the greatest because everyone longs to touch the feet of Parama Purus&#x301;a. As the Shu&#x301;dras are born out of His holy, divine feet, they must certainly be the most adorable. So if the caste system has to be accepted, then the Shu&#x301;dras should be respected as the highest caste. And if you are reluctant to accept that, everyone should belong to the highest caste, then all will be equal. Due to the totally absurd dogma of the caste system, people have been paralysed mentally.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->It should be understood that if people want temporary or permanent relief in the socio-economic sphere, and parama&#x301;rtha [permanent relief] in the psycho-economic sphere, they should first liberate the intellect. If one attains socio-economic freedom, one may or may not attain psycho-economic freedom. Socio-economic freedom means that all members of the society are equal in the social and economic spheres. It is as if one is providing a cow with a full belly of fodder on the one hand, and on the other hand one is extracting maximum labour from the cow. This analogy illustrates that the cow has been granted socio-economic liberty. Simply guaranteeing freedom in the socio-economic sphere does not necessarily mean that there will be liberty in the psycho-economic sphere. That is, one has not gained full freedom of thought. In a word, one is guaranteed ample supplies of food but denied intellectual liberty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When psycho-economic freedom is granted, people enjoy material wealth as well as freedom of thought. But in order to attain true freedom in the psycho-economic sphere, one must attain the liberation of intellect, which is subtler than psycho-economic freedom. Without intellectual liberation, yatama&#x301;na will become meaningless in the intellectual sphere, just as it will be ineffective in the physical sphere, and one will be unable to do the noble tasks which are usually performed with the help of intellect. The fundamental necessity of the intellectual world is intellectual freedom, which you are lacking.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those who exploit human beings to serve their own self-interests do not want socio-economic freedom to be granted to people. That is why they continue their psycho-economic exploitation in such a way that people do not clamour for socio-economic freedom. They do not directly exploit the people in the social or economic sphere, but in the psycho-economic sphere, and they do it so intelligently that people are totally unaware of it, and hence are unable to develop their yatama&#x301;na outlook properly. Moreover, the exploited masses are also unable to develop economically because the exploiters control the economy in a subtle way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->However, a day comes when some intelligent people emerge from the exploited masses having detected the exploiters&#146; techniques to dupe the people, even though the media is controlled. At this stage the exploiters become active intellectually to prevent the germination of the seed of liberation. They take control of the education system, the printing presses and the propaganda agencies in a last and desperate attempt to raise high embankments to contain the surging tide of public discontent. But soon after comes the day of change when the viks&#x301;ubdha shu&#x301;dras [disgruntled masses] rise up in revolt and the high sand embankments get washed away by the floods of revolution. After this the masses make an independent appraisal of the type of socio-psycho-economic exploitation they were subjected to. Before the revolution they may have discussed social injustice in private amongst themselves, but if they had tried to propagate their discontent publicly their tongues would have been cut.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->To control the masses in the psychic sphere a fear complex was forcibly injected into their minds. Religious leaders openly preached: Binu bhay hoi na&#x301; piirit [&ldquo;Devotion cannot be aroused without an element of fear&rdquo;]. That is, if you want to love Parama Purus&#x301;a, you will have to fear Him also. This does not sound logical, of course. Logic says that you may fear Parama Purus&#x301;a and you may also love Him, but that does not mean that in order to love Parama Purus&#x301;a you must fear Him. Fear and love are two different things. One must fear Parama Purus&#x301;a and at the same time love Him as well. But it can never be said that there can be no love without fear. Parama Purus&#x301;a is a great administrator and so it is natural for one to fear Him. At the same time Parama Purus&#x301;a is your nearest and dearest One, so obviously you should have profound love for Him. The opportunists of the past injected this type of dogma into the human mind to perpetrate socio-economic and psycho-economic exploitation. Of course, it was an unsuccessful attempt on their part because human beings will definitely advance. No one can check their progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Hundreds of dogma were imposed on people: &ldquo;Do not do this, it is prohibited. If you do it you will go to hell.&rdquo; The effect of such a statement was to inject a fear complex into people&#146;s minds. According to mythology, the so-called upper castes were born from the mouth of god. It was stated that the so-called low caste people were not entitled to wear shoes on their feet or carry umbrellas over their heads in upper caste neighbourhoods. The common people believed these things. They were further told that the kings are incarnations of Lord Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u so their every command should be obeyed. Thus the kings also mercilessly perpetrated harsh exploitation and brutal dictatorial rule. This is how things continued in the past.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Women were subjected to countless impositions and restrictions, innumerable dos and don&#146;ts. Men were free to eat and drink anything, but not women, for that would be considered an act of sin on their part. Strangely, women calmly accepted these injustices. Women were not allowed to be educated so that they could not protest against these illogical impositions. Mr. Drinkwater Bethun&#146;s attempts to spread education among the women of Bengal met with violent protests from a group of selfish people. They argued that if women were taught western education, they would degenerate and end up in hell. And if they went to hell, who would do the housekeeping? A zealous poet wrote:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;geka&#x301;r sab meyegulo chila bha&#x301;la dharmakarma karta sabe;<br>Eka&#x301; Bethun esei shes&#x301; kareche a&#x301;r ki ta&#x301;der teman pa&#x301;be?<br>A-B-C shikhe bibi seje biliti bol kabei kabe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..18"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[Women of the past were good since they followed religious observances. But Mr. Bethun alone has harmed them immensely. Their ways are changed now: they have learnt the ABC, dressed themselves in European clothes, and started speaking English too!]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->If someone speaks English, what is the harm? Moreover the effect of education on women has been good &ndash; 100% good &ndash; and yet the attempt to educate them was opposed. Why? The reason was that the intellectual exploitation of women was perpetrated without any opposition. Obviously, if women remained illiterate, they could easily be exploited in the socio- and psycho-economic spheres of life. In the absence of education, women would remain ineffective, immobile pieces of living baggage, exploited by their male counterparts according to their sweet will. A man was permitted to marry as many as two hundred wives but a woman, even after the death of her husband, was not even permitted to remarry. Rather, the notion was injected into their minds that remarriage was a sin for a woman! Women were told that to remain devoted to their husbands in their present and subsequent lives was the greatest virtue. Even if a wicked husband were to go to hell after death to graze as a cow-ghost in a field, his educated, devoted and virtuous wife would have to go with him and graze beside the cow-ghost of her wicked husband. All this had to be accepted as mandatory. These are all mischievous attempts to inject a fear complex, to spread dogma, not into the body, but into the mind to paralyse it &ndash; an attempt which is cent percent anti-human.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Even in petty matters they resorted to dogma. For example, Amuker sinni kheye ye na&#x301;khay pani, Gala&#x301;y galagan&#x301;d&#x301;a hay caks&#x301;e par&#x301;e cha&#x301;ni [&ldquo;Those who do not drink water after eating the sweet of a certain deity will surely develop goitre in the throat and cataracts in the eyes&rdquo;]. These exploiters created a good number of deities, and around each deity emerged a powerful priestocracy. Through fear they instilled devotion in people, thus providing ample scope to perpetrate their exploitation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->If you analyse human history in all its aspects in a new way, in a new light, you will find that attempts were made to exploit others by injecting a fear complex in their minds. Parama Purus&#x301;a the life of your life, and obviously you will love Him, you will do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to attain Him. Why should you be terribly afraid of Him? What a nasty psychology it was to inject the fear complex in people&#146;s mind in the name of God! And here lies the difference between religion and dharma. You will find that everywhere in religion, the fear complex has been created in human minds. For women so many rigid rules and regulations were framed so that they would respect men and stand before them in awe with folded hands. But for men, there are no such rules and regulations. For example, women were forbidden to take the names of their husbands, and the husband&#146;s elder brothers. For what reason? To make women exceedingly reverential towards their men-folk. How can it be justified that a virtuous lady, with the border of her sari wrapped around her neck, should have to lie in prostration before her immoral husband? This is absurd, meaningless!<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->All these are examples of the injection of dogma to paralyse women&#146;s minds. Thus yatama&#x301;na becomes meaningless not only in the physical sphere, but in the psychic sphere too, due to religious bondage. It is very difficult for a woman suffering from an inferiority complex, which is a psychic ailment, to approach Parama Purus&#x301;a. She is bound to think, &ldquo;I am low-born. I am a woman. I have no rights. How can I go close to Parama Purus&#x301;a? At the most, I can stand in one corner of the verandah.&rdquo; The opportunists announce that women are not entitled to salvation, and if they want to attain it, they will have to be reborn as men. A few years ago I declared publicly that this notion is unsocial, and totally ultravires to humanism; and that those who utter such statements, being exploiters of women, seek to check the collective growth of humanity. You are to be vocal against these exploiters.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Do not tolerate injustice. This will not only harm women or a neglected and downtrodden segment of humanity, but will cause a serious carbuncle to grow on the vast body of society. That carbuncle will be so poisonous and infectious that it will infect the entire society. Do not allow such a thing to happen under any circumstances. Now that your eyes are opened, keep following the practical path.<!-- /block --></p>
