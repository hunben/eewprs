<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->A&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca [&ldquo;For self-realization and the welfare of the universe&rdquo;] is said to be the ideal of a sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s life. A person should do work and while doing work should remember that whatever one is doing is meant for self-realization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->If a person is doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; just for self-realization, no matter that the world is going to hell, will we not call such a person utterly selfish? If one is not doing service to humanity  and has no concern for them and is engaged only in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for self-realization, then he or she deserves to be called self-seeking despite his or her spiritual longing. So it has been said, A&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca. This is the purpose of life. You take much service from the world, by way of subsistence and maintenance, which you must return, or else you accrue a debt. If you are burdened with a big loan at the time of death, what will happen? You will have to be reborn in order to repay your debt with interest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->You take service from the world, therefore you can ill afford not to give something to the world; and you will receive interest in case you give more than you take. It is, of course, your prerogative to accept or not to accept the interest. But you have no such prerogative regarding the repayment of the debt. You will have to repay it. Remember, you have come to this world to render service to it &ndash; to render service to the world, and to practise the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of self-realization. [But] those who do only the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of self-realization, and refrain from social service, cannot make any headway in their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The two are invariably dependent upon each other.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What does it mean to be human? According to one old school of thought, a human being is a rational animal. But in our philosophy, human beings are not regarded as animals. Why call them rational animals? Mere possession of life does not mean one is an animal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->One with life [of a lower order] is called ja&#x301;nvar [animal] in Persian. There are many suffixes in Persian such as da&#x301;r, var, gar, and so on. For example, those bargaining (saoda&#x301;) are called saoda&#x301;gar; those possessing life (ja&#x301;n)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> are called ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r [living being]; one who invades (hamla&#x301;) is called hamla&#x301;bar [an invader]; a demonstrator of magic (ja&#x301;du) is called ja&#x301;dugar [magician]. So the existence of life makes one a ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r, but one does not become a ja&#x301;nvar [animal] simply due to being ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r [living]. Precisely for this reason I do not support the contention that humans are rational animals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->We say that human life is an ideological flow. Life should have an ideal, and when the movement is towards that ideal, we call it human. Where there is no ideal, nor any movement towards an ideal, we cannot call a life human in spite of any human appearance it may have. So appearance is not the criterion for recognizing humans. In fact we find some persons having more bestiality than the beasts themselves. Beasts do not wage world war. They do not inflict injury on the innocent. So where there is no ideology one becomes worse than a beast. Hence human life is an ideological flow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->It was said in olden times,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Andham&#x301; tamah pravishanti ye&#146; vidya&#x301;mupa&#x301;sate;<br>Tato bhu&#x301;ya iva te tamo ya u vidya&#x301;ya&#x301;m&#x301; rata&#x301;h.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Citation"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->&ndash;<i>Is&#x301;a Upanis&#x301;ad</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->We also say, &ldquo;Subjective approach through objective adjustment.&rdquo; Movement is towards Parama Purus&#x301;a, but at the same time maintaining objective adjustment. You have to move giving proper treatment to the objects of the external world. There must be subjective approach, but at the same time objective adjustment; that is, adjustment with the objective world is essential though one&#146;s movement is towards supreme subjectivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When Prakrti is in a balanced state, She is called simply Prakrti. When this balance is lost, She is called Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. In Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, when tamogun&#x301;a [the static principle] is predominant, it is called Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and when sattvagun&#x301;a [the sentient principle] is predominant, it is called Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->What is this Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, this movement towards the crude? What is this crude world? Soul-ward movement is the subjective world. What happens to those who are only concerned with the crude world, who are merely involved in the pursuits of name, fame, money, house, prestige, and so on? Andham&#x301; tamah pravishanti &ndash; &ldquo;They are led into darkness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And the state of those with sole concern for Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is still worse. They live in the world &ndash; take food, clothes and service from the world &ndash; and, like hypocrites, declare that there is no world. They say, &ldquo;All this is unreal. Give it up.&rdquo; They preach to give up this unreal world, but they themselves eat the food, drink the water and wear the clothes of this unreal world &ndash; yet still say that the world is unreal. What state are they in? You know that the owl rules the night. It is powerful only during the night. When the sun rises it cannot see anymore &ndash; so it gives no recognition to the sun, it denies the existence of the sun. Likewise, through sheer hypocrisy, some call the world unreal, though they are very much dependent on it to remain alive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->One is a hypocrite who escapes into vidya&#x301; alone and says, &ldquo;I shall do only sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.&rdquo; If there is no world, from where does one derive the means of sustenance? Suppose a man has renounced the world and has gone to live in a Himalayan cave. There too he will have to eat. He is sitting and constantly thinking that there are fruits on a particular tree. &ldquo;I saw some the previous evening.&rdquo; He proceeds to the tree and finds the fruits still there. He thinks, &ldquo;I must pluck them, otherwise they may be plucked by another sa&#x301;dhu [spiritual aspirant].&rdquo; See, he is practising hypocrisy. Or else he is thinking, &ldquo;I have renounced my home and hearth, but maybe my cousins have let their buffaloes into my field and they are grazing the crops.&rdquo; Thinking all these things, what does he become? He becomes a hypocrite. That is why it is said that paying attention only to vidya&#x301; leads to greater darkness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->What then should one do? There must be an adjustment between the two. Sannya&#x301;sins<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> practise a&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca. These sannya&#x301;sins are not the ones living for their bellies alone. They are serving the society. Those serving this world do not strive for vidya&#x301; alone; they also serve the world. This should, in fact, be done not only by sannya&#x301;sins, but by family people as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->What is the difference between the two?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The life of a householder is a little troublesome. Why is it? A householder has two families &ndash; small as well as big. What is the small family? It includes one&#146;s parents, sisters, brothers, spouse, and other relatives such as aunts, uncles and so on. The Indian family is a [relatively] big one. In the Indian tradition, even the sisters of one&#146;s father and mother are included in the family. This is one&#146;s small family.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->And the big family is the whole universe and its suffering humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->What does a householder have to do? He or she has to maintain a balance between the two families. One invariably has to look after and expend for the small family, and, simultaneously, work for the big family. If one devotes all one&#146;s time and energy to the small family, totally ignoring the big family, one becomes a fallen and degenerated householder. Likewise, if one pays attention only to the big family and neglects the small family consisting of one&#146;s parents, brothers, sisters, etc., then again one falls.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Just see how difficult it is to keep adjustment between the two. A wife will be annoyed if a husband donates much money [to social service]. Therefore he donates twenty-five rupees with the wife&#146;s knowledge and another twenty rupees without her knowledge, and thus establishes adjustment. Sannya&#x301;sins need not establish adjustment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->You know our workers<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> have to collect [donations of] paddy, wheat, and so on for the children of our [children&#146;s] homes. The workers say that if they visit the farmyard, the farmer donates a bigger quantity, but if they are delayed and have to collect from the farmer&#146;s house, the farmer&#146;s wife donates a little less. Thus the householder has to maintain adjustment between the two. But the sannya&#x301;sin has only one family &ndash; the big family &ndash; so there is no question of adjustment there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Those who go by vidya&#x301; alone, that is, who endeavour only for self-realization, and deny the objective world (although in reality they cannot deny it since they have to eat, wear clothes and bathe) have been called hypocrites in the scriptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->And those who go by avidya&#x301; alone, guided by materialistic theories, like the materialists of the present age, what state are they in? Andham&#x301; tamah pravishanti ye&#146; vidya&#x301;mupa&#x301;sate &ndash; &ldquo;They gradually move from light into darkness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->What is materialistic philosophy? It is the product of an undeveloped brain. And what are its consequences? Those who follow it gradually move towards darkness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->A person becomes like his or her is&#x301;t&#x301;a [goal] and talks only about that. For example, Shabda Brahma [Brahma expressed as sound; on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra]. The first singer and dancer of India and of the world was Sada&#x301;shiva. He talked about Shabda Brahma. He named it na&#x301;da. His existence was indeed sonic. Likewise, one who thinks about matter will one day become matter. This is the natural law. The businessman who always thinks, &ldquo;money, money,&rdquo; will never again be born as a human. He will not be born as a dog, goat, or sheep, either. After death he will become money, and will remain confined in the box of a businessman. That was indeed his goal. So materialistic philosophy converts one into matter. After death, materialists will become shirts or wine according to the objects of their thinking.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The greatest wealth of a human being is his or her intellect. One should not drink. Why? Because drinking destroys the intellect. In the natural state, one thinks many thoughts in his or her unconscious mind. Knowledge is stored in the unconscious mind. One thinks in the unconscious mind and controls one&#146;s actions through the conscious mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Suppose there is a beggar in Nagpur city. He imagines that he is the emperor of Delhi. But since his conscious mind says, &ldquo;No, you are not the emperor of Delhi, you are the beggar of Nagpur,&rdquo; he does not say it openly. But if he drinks wine, his conscious mind stops functioning. Due to lack of control over his conscious mind, walking along the road he will say aloud, &ldquo;I am the emperor of Delhi.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Intellect controls every action of a person, but drinking destroys it. That is why wine is a bad thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Materialism is equally bad. It too destroys the intellect and converts it into bricks and stones. Therefore materialistic philosophy is more dangerous for the society even than a dacoit. You have to fight against materialistic philosophy tooth and nail, for it is the greatest enemy of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->[In one sense,] materialists are led into greater darkness [than the escapist sa&#x301;dhus]. Light obeys a rule: when scattered, it divides into seven colours &ndash; violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. Accordingly, there are seven lokas [levels of the Cosmic Mind]. The unmanifest universe above the seven lokas does not have kala [seed]. Brahma at this stage is called niskala [without seed]. And this, our world, is sakala [with seed]. This [world] is Sakala Brahma and that [state] Niskala Brahma. Now what exists beyond the seven worlds? Only white effulgence and no colour. White is not a colour. The combination of all colours is white.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Similarly there are [mythologically] seven worlds [netherworlds, hells] below bhu&#x301;rloka: tala, atala, vitala, tala&#x301;tala, pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, atipa&#x301;ta&#x301;la and rasa&#x301;tala. Rasa&#x301;tala is the lowest of all. The colour of all these seven worlds is black. Black is no colour. Want of colour is black, so there we find blackness. (But there are degrees even in blackness; all blackness is not the same. For instance, even the [blackest-skinned] people belonging to the Austric race are not as black as Negroes. Nor are they as black as Dravidians. [And mythologically, the upper hells are lighter shades of black than the upper hells.])<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Well, there is something! Those who have transcended the seven worlds [whether above or below] find no colour differentiation there. So they do not believe in casteism. All humans are one for them! The divisions of Vipra, Ks&#x301;atriya, Shu&#x301;dra and Vaeshya do not hold water for them. All are one and the same for them. So it has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..33"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama&#x301;bhima&#x301;nena shrutida&#x301;sye bhavennarah;<br>Varn&#x301;a&#x301;shramvihiinashca vartate shruti mu&#x301;rdhan&#x301;i.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->One then sits atop the scriptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->There are seven shades of darkness corresponding to the seven worlds below. What are these shades? Tamah [is the first and] means simply &ldquo;black&rdquo;, the second is tamasa&#x301;, third maha&#x301;tamasa&#x301;, fourth andhatamasa&#x301;, fifth tamishra&#x301;, sixth maha&#x301;tamishra&#x301;, and seventh andhatamishra&#x301;. What is this last, this andhatamishra&#x301;? It is the darkness in which it is not possible even to see one&#146;s own hands. When one becomes materialistic &ndash; extremely materialistic &ndash; one&#146;s intellect and conscience are all lost. One cannot see even the hands by which he or she accepts a bribe or holds a cup of wine. One thinks, &ldquo;Whatever I do is right.&rdquo; That is why it is said, Andham&#x301; tamah pravishanti [&ldquo;One who follows the path of avidya&#x301; falls into darkness&rdquo;]. He or she will go down to rasa&#x301;tala. Rasa&#x301;tala is a stage far below even dogs and goats. Dogs and goats never go below bhuvarloka. They are far superior to those in rasa&#x301;tala. For their physical bodies are in bhu&#x301;rloka and their crude mental bodies are in bhuvarloka. Animals do not fall. Humans fall down as well as rise up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->A river flows from high to low. The Gaun&#x32D;gottarii flows towards the Ganges, and the Ganges towards the Gangasagar [mouth of the Ganges]. But the Gangasagar never travels back to the Ganges, nor the Ganges to the Gaun&#x32D;gottarii; because rivers always flow downward. But the flow of the Ganges of the human mind is bi-directional. This mental Ganges can flow from the Gaun&#x32D;gottarii to the Ganges and vice versa. What, therefore, what should you contemplate? You should think, &ldquo;I will go from the Gangasagar to the Gaun&#x32D;gottarii.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Materialists, despite human form, do not practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Nothing is stationary in this world. Everything is moving. If one does not move upward, does not endeavour for the upliftment of his or her self, then one is bound to move downward, because movement is essential &ndash; if it is not upward, it has to be downward. So everyone should make an effort. One should not think to remain stagnant where he or she is. You cannot, in fact, remain where you are. If your movement is not upward, you are destined to fall. Therefore, wise men and women will make efforts to move upward.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->You must begin an upward march right now, no matter how great wrongs you have committed in the past. Proceed onward from this very moment. Forget the past. Think to become Parama Purus&#x301;a. Tomorrow may never come in your life, it is futile to think of tomorrow. You should contemplate now what you have to become [by] the following day.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In both sessions yesterday,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> I spoke mainly about the mind. The theme of discussion yesterday evening was that if at any time any undesirable thought arises in the mind, that is certainly an evil and should be forsaken, but it is not a punishable crime.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->How can human thinking be controlled? Occasionally some undesirable ideas arise in the mind that the mind wants to avoid. Even then they keep coming into the mind, despite the fact that the mind does not want them. Again, there are thoughts that the mind wants to have, but in fact they do not come. You must have noticed that some children sit down with their books and notebooks and try to study, but their minds are occupied with thoughts of the playground or the kitchen.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The flow of human thought is controlled primarily by one&#146;s inborn sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta] and acquired sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Acquired sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are of two types: (1) those coming from the environment; (2) those imposed by external sources. People&#146;s minds are generally influenced by the environment they live in. When you see your neighbour taking tea, and the scent of the tea wafts through the air to your nose, you also feel like taking tea. This is the influence of the environment. Again, when something is repeatedly told to you, that does have an impact on your mind. That will be an instance of an imposed sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->A person&#146;s sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are generally determined by the nature of the actions he or she performs. After death, the person gets a new physical structure corresponding to the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras one has acquired. If one acts like a dog, one will get the body of a dog, and one&#146;s thinking also will certainly be that of a dog. These will be the person&#146;s inborn sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. If one&#146;s thoughts are not entirely inhuman, one will be reborn in a human body. But in some cases of imposed sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, the person&#146;s thoughts will be like those of lower animals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->For instance, a child belonging to a family the members of which are frequently quarrelling with each other, also becomes quarrelsome by nature. Certain religious sects make common people firmly believe that certain actions are sinful, and certain others are virtuous. This kind of acquired sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra is called an imposed sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Another kind of relationship exists between human mentality and the environment, and that is the relationship of fear. The first thing an infant does immediately after birth is to start crying. By crying, its needs are immediately fulfilled. It observes that whenever it cries, a woman with bangles on her wrists, with a vermilion mark on her forehead, and with long hair runs to it and gives it milk. In this way it learns that crying brings fulfilment to all of its wants. The sound ma is the easiest that a human being can produce. Hence the little child addresses the caring woman as Ma&#x301;. Is it wrong for the newborn child to cry like this?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The same child, when grown up a little, wants toys, wants to go out of the house. Are these punishable crimes? When it attains adolescence, it wants romantic experience, and becomes fond of detective stories. When after some time it becomes a full-grown young man or woman, its thinking as well undergoes a change. In middle age its mind is occupied mostly with thoughts of its family, and with thoughts as to who will inherit its property after its death as well. And it thinks that throughout its life it has so far not done any virtuous deeds; so it begins doing a little sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, bhajana and ritualistic worship. All this kind of thinking is quite natural. Under certain circumstances it might be good to forsake this kind of thinking, but it is not  a punishable offence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Thought patterns change with advancing age. But one must be careful to see that these natural thoughts do not cross the line from that which it would be better to forsake, to that which is actually punishable. Very often children, when they get together, waste their time fighting with each other. So let them get together; but it will be up to the adults to see that they do not fight. No ideal society can be established if we go against nature. Natural principles of psychology should not be violated. There was a time when just to think of eating rice on Eka&#x301;dashii,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> or to eat non-vegetarian food on the new moon or full moon, was regarded as a punishable crime. But I would say that if anybody takes rice in a normal way, there is nothing wrong with that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Whatever thoughts any small child, or boy or girl, or adolescent, youth, middle-aged person or old person may have in their individual lives, in family life it is the responsibility of the guardians of the family to control them. Children are generally like their parents. But the overall responsibility of guardianship lies with the sama&#x301;ja gurus.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> They should see that no one&#146;s thoughts cross the line from that which it would be better to forsake, to that which is actually punishable. And as in individual life, so in social life, the sama&#x301;ja gurus should see that the collective thinking does not cross the line from that which it would be better to forsake, to that which is actually punishable. If, in spite of everything, people&#146;s defective thoughts do reach the stage of punishability, indiscipline will affect the entire social structure. To put an end to the indiscipline and restore order to social life is the major responsibility of a sadvipra. For this reason there is no place for carefree relaxation in a sadvipra&#146;s life. A sadvipra has to bear, and staunchly bear, the entire responsibility of protecting society. If the mentality of any group of the society reaches the punishable stage, sadvipras will have to form another and more disciplined group.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Yesterday[see beginning] I told you that there are three types of pa&#x301;taka [sin]. The first type is where atonement is possible. Suppose, for instance, that someone has stolen five rupees. Certainly that is a sin. But if the thief returns the money to its owner, and apologizes for his or her conduct, then it must be considered that the sin has been atoned for. The second type of pa&#x301;taka is called atipa&#x301;taka,  and for that there is no social atonement. Suppose someone has brutally cut off someone else&#146;s leg. To atone for that sort of sin will mean completely giving up all sorts of ease, comforts and pleasures of life for the sake of social welfare. The third category of sin is called maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka. For that also there is no atonement. That kind of sin brings recurring harm to society. An example is the adulteration of black pepper with papaya seeds; because, if one businessman does this, another will see the first and be encouraged to imitate the first.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a there is a beautiful story about maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka. A fierce battle was going on between Rama and Ravana. The defeat of Ravana was almost certain. So Ravana started worshipping Shiva. He was a great devotee of Shiva; and Pa&#x301;rvatii was highly pleased with Ravana&#146;s devotion and reverence. She said to Shiva: &ldquo;Ravana is not an atipa&#x301;takii. True he abducted Sita, but even then You should help him. Why don&#146;t you help him?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Shiva replied, &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rvatii, Ravana is not only an atipa&#x301;takii, he is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii. Because he abducted Sita in the guise of a sa&#x301;dhu [saint]. As a result a feeling of deep distrust of sa&#x301;dhus has developed in society, particularly in the minds of housewives.&rdquo; Ultimately Shiva did not help Ravana and Ravana was defeated in the fight.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Normally when the number of atipa&#x301;takiis and maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takiis increases out of proportion, the responsibility of saving society rests with the sadvipras. But when the maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takiis in society outnumber the atipa&#x301;takiis, Parama Purus&#x301;a descends on earth armed with His special power. That is why the Giita&#x301; says:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Yada&#x301; yada&#x301; hi dharmasya gla&#x301;nirbhavati Bha&#x301;rata;<br>Ca&#x301;bhyuttha&#x301;namadharmasya tada&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; srja&#x301;mya&#x301;ham.<br>Paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya sa&#x301;dhu&#x301;na&#x301;m&#x301; vina&#x301;sha&#x301;ya ca dus&#x301;krta&#x301;m;<br>Dharmasam&#x301;stha&#x301;pana&#x301;rtha&#x301;ya sambhava&#x301;mi yuge yuge.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The deviation of any object from its normal state is called gla&#x301;ni. The normal state of dharma means movement in accordance with dharma, not movement towards nature. When mental sin reaches the punishable stage, the gla&#x301;ni of dharma sets in. Hence Bhagava&#x301;n Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said: &ldquo;Whenever the decline of dharma sets in, that is to say, when the maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takiis in society outnumber the atipa&#x301;takiis, Parama Purus&#x301;a, assuming a quinquelemental body, descends on earth.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Here the word yuga means a period of disaster. In a period of disaster, Parama Purus&#x301;a comes to the world to save the virtuous and to complete the task that the sama&#x301;ja gurus and sadvipras fail to accomplish; He removes all evils by the root. The mission of Parama Purus&#x301;a is to restore dharma. He fulfils this mission yuga after yuga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->I want to tell you only this: That in your personal lives you should never let your wrong thoughts sink below the level of that which it would be better to forsake, to the level of punishabiliy. Do not even think of allowing them to. Remember that strong sama&#x301;ja gurus must be developed. A sama&#x301;ja guru simply means a teacher. That is why we in Ananda Marga lay great emphasis on education &ndash; in order to bring about a widespread expansion of learning, and remove all defects in the world of education. If the sama&#x301;ja gurus are unable to protect the society, then the sadvipras will have to take on that responsibility. If even the sadvipras are not able to cope with the social problems, then Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself has to appear in the world in a physical framework. Your duty is to cooperate body and soul with the sama&#x301;ja gurus, the sadvipras and Parama Purus&#x301;a in their joint noble work. This indeed is your dharma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The science of spirituality developed out of human beings&#146; innate desire to unravel the mystery of creation. Humans began to search for the secret causes underlying both the dreadful and the beautiful aspects of nature. They looked around them at the rivers and streams, the far-flung mountain ranges, the flashes of lightning; they heard the thunder; they listened to the roaring of ferocious animals &ndash; and they began to plumb the depths of these mysteries. These endeavours to get at the hidden truth of everything are what is known as Tantra. Since these endeavours were carried on at different times, in different places, and by different groups of individuals, we find some differences in methodology among the various schools of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Tantra originated in [South] Asia, and its propounders were the Austrics, [the Dravidians,] and the Mongolians.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Among these peoples, the Dravidians and the Mongolians were more developed, the Austrics less. The practitioners of the more-developed Tantra would look upon things from a broad point of view, renouncing all narrow thinking. They would always strive hard to advance the welfare of the masses. Through such selfless service, they would overcome the fetters of the mind, such as hatred and shame. The practitioners of the less-developed Tantra would behave in just the opposite way. They would indulge in casteism; in expressions of untouchability; and in expressions of hatred and envy in relation to other groups.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The overcoming of material bondages signifies the greatest human progress. The word tantra signifies that one &ldquo;frees oneself from the bondages of crudity;&rdquo; therefore Tantra is considered the best kind of spiritual practice. Lord Sada&#x301;shiva was the first propounder of this Tantra. He developed certain fixed rules, and thereby ensured all-round progress in the different aspects of human life. He brought about a perfect system, reviewing and coordinating all branches of Tantra. He researched and proved the efficacy of both the [external] and the [internal] aspects of Tantra.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> The [external] aspect of Tantra consisted of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; with skulls, in cemeteries. The [internal] aspect of Tantra consisted of the practice of yoga. [It is ultimately] through [internal] Tantra that human beings can reach the heights of spiritual success.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Human beings can never win liberation by flattering Prakrti. An entity which is flattered becomes proud. Human beings must not become the slaves of matter. If sa&#x301;dhakas will worship Purus&#x301;a and ignore Prakrti, they will find that Prakrti will automatically begin to flatter them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There is no such thing as &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; in this world. All sorts of powers lie dormant in human beings. Sometimes we get glimpses of these latent powers. In a more-developed terminology, these glimpses will be called &ldquo;intellect&rdquo; or &ldquo;intuition&rdquo;. Human beings can develop that which they have glimpsed, eventually attaining extraordinary powers. In the eyes of ordinary people, these powers appear to be supernatural, but actually they are natural. But it is a fact that ordinary persons cannot do these extraordinary things, and that is why they look upon these powers as supernatural.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Tantra is a source of such extraordinary powers. Within a short  period, all the pa&#x301;shas and ripus [fetters and enemies] which bind the mind become broken. As long as the mind is in bondage, it tends to move towards crude material objects; that is, the mind remains inextricably associated with matter. But once the bondages become snapped through the practice of Tantra, the mind becomes detached from those crude objects. This implies the elevation of human beings, because [it is through detachment that] physical, psychic, and spiritual progress becomes possible. Humans are predominantly-mental beings, and sometimes [certain of them] develop extraordinary intellect; because of their greater concentration of mind, their societies consider them to be a superior type of person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When we talk about the ripus [enemies] of the mind, we mean only the [internal, or, innate] enemies.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> For a human being to bring the ripus under perfect control signifies an important victory. Those persons who can do so attain greater control over the forces of matter, and can perform feats that in the eyes of the common masses betoken some kind of supernatural power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In Tantra the endeavour to establish control over matter or over external forces is called avidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And the practice which leads to self-realization is called vidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And that branch of Tantra which is neither vidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; nor avidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is called upavidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Only vidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; contributes to the welfare of humanity; the other two practices are merely a waste of time. Ma&#x301;ran&#x301;a, ucca&#x301;t&#x301;ana, sammohan, va&#x301;shiika&#x301;ran&#x301;a, etc., come within the definition of avidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The practice of avidya&#x301; leads to degradation. Sada&#x301;shiva, the original propounder of Tantra, collected and systematized all the branches of Tantra, but He did not encourage the practice of avidya&#x301;, because it is an inferior order of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. When people practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in order to attain &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; powers, their mental objects ultimately become crude, for after attaining such powers, they utilize them for self-aggrandizement or for revenge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; was almost extinct for the last 1200 years. And there are now only a handful of real Avidya&#x301; Tantrics left &ndash; the rest are charlatans and hypocrites. After death, these people will be reborn as worms and insects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Human beings practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in order to become one with Brahma, not to become ghosts or ghouls. To become one with Brahma, they must practise Vidya&#x301; Tantra, and not Avidya&#x301; Tantra. Of course through either kind of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, sa&#x301;dhakas gain freedom from the pa&#x301;shas and ripus. But the difference between the two sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;s is that the practitioners of Vidya&#x301; Tantra channelize their  spiritual powers towards the attainment of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, whereas the practitioners of Avidya&#x301; Tantra utilize their acquired powers for mundane benefits. Through Vidya&#x301; Tantra one &ldquo;binds&rdquo; [wins] Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, while through Avidya&#x301; Tantra one binds [dominates] living beings. Vidya&#x301; Tantrics accept Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; as their object of supreme adoration, and in order to become one with Him, they channelize all the powers they have acquired towards Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->From a medical point of view also, Tantra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; has its usefulness. In ancient times there were Vedic experts in a&#x301;yurveda.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> But as they were not Tantrics, they were handicapped in fully utilizing their medical knowledge to cure patients. Because of their prejudices &ndash; their hatred of certain groups, their belief in untouchability, their casteism, etc. &ndash; they would hesitate to touch the bodies of their patients; whereas the Tantric doctors, because of their control over [such enemies and fetters as] hatred, fear and shame, could render medical service in a proper way. The practices of dissection and surgery rested mainly in the hands of Tantric doctors.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today in a short discourse I shall try to say something about diiks&#x301;a&#x301; [initiation] and its importance relative to the existence of a microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You know that in every sphere of life there is a need for some goal, or for some guiding factors that show the way to a goal. And if the sphere we speak of is human progress, in that sphere also such factors are necessary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I have already told you that human existence is an ideological flow. To accelerate human progress, we need very powerful guiding factors. The factor of will, for example, connects the physical and physico-psychic existence of human beings to spiritual existence, and merges it into that spiritual existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Guiding factors should come from a subtler source, and in the case of the spiritual initiation of a human being, those guiding factors emanate from Parama Purus&#x301;a. And this is why in A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> it has been clearly stated, Brahmaeva Gurureka na&#x301;parah &ndash; that is to say, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a alone is the Guru.&rdquo; All kinds of inspiration for human beings come from that source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As far as initiation is concerned, there are two types. The first type is usually known as Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;, and the second type is usually called Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->As you all know, the word veda means &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. In this sense Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301; means that when inquisitive persons want to know what they should do, how they should do, and why they should do, they pray to Parama Purus&#x301;a, &ldquo;O Lord, I cannot see clearly because I am enveloped in blinding darkness. Out of Your grace, You show me the way. I cannot move by myself. Tell me, out of Your kindness, how I can move forward.&rdquo; When they receive a lesson in how to pray in such a way, this is called Vaedikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. The &ldquo;Savitr Rk&rdquo; [a Vedic rk, or verse, composed in Ga&#x301;yatrii rhythm and therefore often known as the Ga&#x301;yatrii Mantra] and a few other rks of the Rgveda are mantras of this sort.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->And thereafter, when the same persons, by His grace, learn the proper way to progress in the physical, psychic and spiritual spheres, that is called Tantrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

Going through a renewal, the person becomes a dvija, i.e., expresses the desire to become human. A person next becomes a vipra, an intellectual, by studying scriptures. And finally, when the person begins to realize Brahma (through psycho-spiritual initiation) he or she becomes a Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a.]<!-- /block --></p>

The person learns all these things. This is what is called Ta&#x301;ntrikii diiks&#x301;a&#x301;. After following this path, that individual reaches the zenith of spirituality. He or she becomes a Brahman.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The word diiks&#x301;a&#x301; in Tantra has been defined:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Diipajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na means &ldquo;torch&rdquo;, that is, the knowledge that takes a human being from the darkness of animality towards the effulgence of divinity. In the initial stage, human beings require a torch to light up the way for them. This is what is called diipajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. The initial letter of diipajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is dii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->And when a spiritual aspirant moves from the most negative point towards the ultimate positivity, what happens? His or her accumulated sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras start to become exhausted. That is, all his or her sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras start to wane. For this &ldquo;waning of sins&rdquo; the Sanskrit word is pa&#x301;pa&#x301;ks&#x301;ayam. The initial letter of ks&#x301;ayam [waning] is ks&#x301;a. So the dii of diipanii together with the ks&#x301;a of ks&#x301;ayam becomes diiks&#x301;a. And with the addition of the feminine suffix t&#x301;a, the word becomes diiks&#x301;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
