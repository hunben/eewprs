<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Q. 1.  Why is happiness sought for?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Citta or mind is governed by the collection of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. When mind is under the influence of a set of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras it can remain in that mental tendency for a long period.  Happiness is derived from being able to remain in a particular tendency or form for a long period.  For instance, a mind under the influence of evil Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras is happy only when evil talk is taking place; such a mind will find itself ill at ease in other environments. In other words, a mind which [[is]] under the influence of evil Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras can exist freely only in evil company; it will feel suffocated in other company and will try to return to that evil company where alone it finds happiness.  It is thus evident that happiness can be derived only in such circumstances which are conducive to its collection of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  To exist in any other set of circumstances is not only undesirable but also not even possible; for the set of circumstances which impart happiness are indeed necessary for existence.  The mind desires a particular environment to make its existence possible.  Since the existence of mind in any other form not in keeping with its collection of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, is not possible thus the mind seeks happiness to preserve its very existence.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Dharma is different from the English word &ldquo;religion&rdquo; or the Urdu &ldquo;Mazhab&rdquo; which means a system of faith of worship.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Dharma means property or characteristics.  It is derived from the Sanskrit root dhr + man: The verb form is dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a, to hold and the noun is Dharma, that which &ldquo;holds&rdquo; an entity in existence.<!-- /block --></p>

Fire must follow its Dharma of burning and if it does not, it will be extinguished.  Following one&#146;s Dharma is thus necessary for self-preservation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Q. 3.  What is Svabha&#x301;va?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Svabha&#x301;va is derived from the Sanskrit root: sva (&ldquo;own&rdquo;) + bha&#x301;va (&ldquo;idea&rdquo;).  Svabha&#x301;va therefore, means one&#146;s own ideas can only be formed in the mind, therefore the Svabha&#x301;va of a person can be only psychic and not physical.  The mind is influenced by various factors, primarily inborn or imposed Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  The Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of different individuals are different and so is their Svabha&#x301;va.  Svabha&#x301;va is one&#146;s own psychic creation, it is the habit or nature of an individual. Svabha&#x301;va unlike Dharma, is different in different individuals and undergoes change, while Dharma is unchanging and is a property common to one and all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Q. 4.  Why is Moks&#x301;a necessary?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Ans.  A&#x301;tman is a pure consciousness with no property or characteristic except that of knowing the existence of Prakrti, the creative Principle.  A&#x301;tman cannot perform any function by itself, rather Prakrti which creates Ma&#x301;nas or mind reflects its actions on the A&#x301;tman. [[The a&#x301;tman is not affected by any of the actions of mind or Prakrti. It only witnesses what the mind is doing; the mind&#146;s actions are reflected in it like reflections in a mirror.]] Just as a red flower placed in front of a mirror makes the mirror look red without affecting the mirror, similarly the actions of mind which form the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are reflected on the a&#x301;tman which remains unaffected (anupahata).  It is according to these sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras that the individual mind or jiivabha&#x301;va is created by Prakrti.  Prakrti in Its form of dormancy in cosmic consciousness or Brahma is called Mu&#x301;la&#x301; Prakrti.  When It becomes active and starts influencing the cosmic consciousness and transmuting it into Sagun&#x301;a Brahma.  Prakrti creates the following eight forms: 1. Mu&#x301;la Prakrti, 2. Mahattattva, 3. Aham&#x301;tattva, 4-8. Pain&#x32D;ca Bhu&#x301;ta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->When Prakrti is dormant in cosmic consciousness, no indriyas (sense or motor organs) exist, for cosmic consciousness is infinite or ananta and there is nothing beyond or outside It for which the indriyas are required.  In Sagun&#x301;a Brahma therefore, the seven Praka&#x301;ra of Prakrti form the Antahkaran&#x301;a while in the A&#x301;tman or unit consciousness only the mahattattva and ahamtattva form the antahkaran&#x301;a; the rest form vahihkaran&#x301;a.  When the a&#x301;tman is influenced by Prakrti it becomes vikrta or distorted, and the eight forms become sixteen in number, called sodas&#x301;a vikrti: the Citta (antahkaran&#x301;a vahihkanan&#x301;a), the ten indriyas, and the five tanmantras.  These sixteen forms of jiivabha&#x301;va or unit consciousness plus the eight of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma and the one combinedly form twenty five tattvas or factors.  The citta is a common factor for both the unit and the cosmic consciousness. The function of the citta in the cosmic consciousness is purely internal (antahkaran&#x301;ika).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->It is due to this vikrti or distortion in the a&#x301;tman that the mind or jiivabha&#x301;va is formed.  The a&#x301;tman is in fact in bondage due to this vikrti and desires to escape from it.  The a&#x301;tman has to perform Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but it cannot perform any function by itself; hence it has to seek some a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra or base through which it can perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.  A&#x301;tman can only give inspiration or prerana&#x301; as it is not capable of performing any function without the help of Prakrti, although the desire to seek freedom from the bondage of its vikrti is very great.  Jiivabha&#x301;va is created by Prakrti in the process of metamorphosis from crude to subtle. Jiivabha&#x301;va is capable of experiencing both duhkha and sukha (grief and happiness).  This characteristic or property of experiencing duhkha or sukha makes it dissatisfied with its present position. It is created by Prakrti and is thus under the influence of Prakrti; yet it tries to escape from the influence of Prakrti, not knowing that Prakrti is its creator, and escaping Her influence would mean destroying Prakrti and also itself with Her.  A&#x301;tman gives the inspiration and the mind perform the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of struggling against Prakrti.  Since both the a&#x301;tman or consciousness and the mind are in bondage and dissatisfied with their position they find it necessary to strive for moks&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Q. 5.  Why a&#x301;tman is called Citi-Shakti?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Ans.  A&#x301;tman is incapable of performing any function by itself, but is called citishakti or force of consciousness.  The a&#x301;tman or consciousness can only provide inspiration or prerana&#x301;; that is the only action it can perform without the help of Prakrti and while under the influence of Prakrti.  That is the only contribution of a&#x301;tman towards the endeavour to free itself from the bondage of Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->How does the a&#x301;tman give inspiration?  The a&#x301;tman is compared to a magnet and the mind to iron; the a&#x301;tman attracts the mind towards itself like a magnet.  The attraction makes the mind struggle against Prakrti and strive to merge with a&#x301;tman.  The inspiration that the a&#x301;tman gives to mind is the form of this attraction.  The question therefore arises that if the a&#x301;tman is like a magnet and the mind like a piece of iron, why should the mind not be always attracted towards a&#x301;tman &ndash; and why should it be necessary for mind to struggle in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to escape the influence of Prakrti?  The mind is not always attracted towards a&#x301;tman only due to its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  If a piece of iron is full of impurities it will not be attracted by the magnet, or even if it is attracted, it will move towards it only very slowly, depending on the degree of impurity in it.  The mind of an individual is constituted according to the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of the person.  If the influence of the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras on the mind is very great it will not be much attracted by the a&#x301;tman and the inspiration that the a&#x301;tman will be able to give to the mind will be limited only to making the mind aware of the need to fight against its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  The sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras in a mind are created by Tamogun&#x301;a because sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, like Tamogun&#x301;a, are static. When the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of mind are so great that the mind itself becomes dominated by Tamogun&#x301;a, there the inspiration from a&#x301;tman is not able to do anything and the mind goes on working under the influence of Prakrti.  Since the contribution of a&#x301;tman in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to attract the mind towards itself, this attraction can only be completely successful if the mind is free from sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  But the a&#x301;tman is not able to make the mind free of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras as it has no power to work.  The freedom from sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras has to be obtained by the mind itself.  The sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or the struggle against Prakrti, the mind seeks to free itself from the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which are created by the tamogun&#x301;ii influence by Prakrti.  The mind&#146;s role in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; therefore, is limited only to the effort to remove all sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  This effort is inspired by the power of attraction of the a&#x301;tman, it is because of this force of consciousness that the a&#x301;tman is called Citi Shakti.  The other name of the a&#x301;tman besides Citishakti are; Purus&#x301;a, Caetanya and Shiva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Q. 6.  Why did the Supreme Consciousness create the universe?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma has no qualities but the influence of Prakrti transforms some portion of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma into Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, that is, having qualities.  Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma is not devoid of Prakrti nor is Prakrti outside It, for It is Ananta there is nothing beyond or outside It. Prakrti remains in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma in the form of Mu&#x301;la Prakrti, in a latent or dormant stage and like the power of germination in the seed of a plant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->When Mu&#x301;la Prakrti becomes active in the infinite Sagun&#x301;a Brahma it manifests itself into the following eight Praka&#x301;ras: Mu&#x301;la Prakrti, Mahattattva, Vyoma (ether), Va&#x301;yu (air), Agni (fire), Jala (water) and Prthivii (earth). Mu&#x301;la Prakrti, although manifesting itself in these forms remains as Mu&#x301;la Prakrti in Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. These manifestations of Prakrti are from subtle to crude; and the final manifestation Prthivii is the ultimate in crudeness, since it includes the qualities of all the other forms.  In other words there is no further stage of crudeness which the Prakrti can adopt in its manifestation from subtlety to crudity.  It should be clarified here that all these manifestations of Prakrti are within Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, which is also infinite or ananta.  Since there cannot be anything beyond or outside Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, all these manifestations take place within It.  These manifestations, except Mu&#x301;la Prakrti, of which these are the different forms, are called antahkarana of Brahma as they all function with It only and have contact with anything outside.  However the antahka&#x301;rana in the unit consciousness comprises two vikrti only, mahattattva and ahamttattva; the rest are vahihkarana or outside.  In both the individual and the Cosmic mind the citta is the portion of mind where the thought waves occur; thus all the cruder manifestations of Prakrti occur as thought waves in the citta of Brahma.  The universe is thus created in the Citta of Brahma as thought waves of It, imagination (Kalpana&#x301;), proceed from subtle to crude, from Vyoma or ether to Prthvii or earth.  As stated above, Prthvii is the crudest manifestation, and thus there is no scope for these thought waves to adopt any cruder metamorphosis; the only course left for them is to go back to their source.  The crude thought waves therefore embark on their journey and have to pass through more or less the same stages through which they passed on their original journey from subtle to crude.  This portion of the cycle of thought waves in their return journey is completed through the different forms of unit beings from solid matter to plant life, from plant life to animal life, from animal life to human beings and finally back to the cosmic consciousness again.  It thus seems that there would be a time when all the thought waves will come to an end, when they will all return to their source.  Such a time can only come when Sagun&#x301;a Brahma attains moks&#x301;a (Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi).  In fact, Sagun&#x301;a Brahma would have attained nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi long ago, but due to the presence of tamagun&#x301;ii citta, Its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which are the result of tamogun&#x301;a have not been completely exhausted, and hence the cycle of thought waves continues as long as the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are not completely exhausted, their result (pra&#x301;rabdha) will have to be undergone.  The creation and maintenance of the universe is nothing but the requital or bhoga of the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Q. 7.  Which of the three qualities &ndash; Sattvagun&#x301;a, Ragogun&#x301;a or Tamagun&#x301;a &ndash; is predominant in Brahma?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Ans.  The whole universe is created by the Brahma manas or cosmic mind.  When the unit beings were created from the cosmic mind the practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; was given to them to free themselves from bondage.  The idea of the cosmic thought waves to inspire the unit being to perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for the upliftment of all, can only come from a source in which a Sattvagun&#x301;a, the sentient principle predominates.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Brahma attracts all entities towards itself.  This attraction, too, is with the intention of liberating all beings.  Brahma created minds in the unit beings to enable them to perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.  The mind has the characteristic of taking the form of its object.  If the mind did not possess this characteristic then its attraction for Brahma would not have been of any use; It is this dharma or characteristic of the mind and its attraction for Brahma, that ultimately helps it to attain liberation.  Brahma does all this only for the welfare of all; the thought waves of Brahma by which the mind in unit beings is evolved, in the unit beings have only the intention of doing good to all.  Only that entity in which Sattvagun&#x301;a predominates can perform actions for the welfare of all; thus Brahma cannot have any other quality but Sattvagun&#x301;a as its predominant quality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->These thought waves of Brahma are unending and the cycle of these waves goes on without a break.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Citation"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->&ndash;The Vedas<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Where such a constant action is occurring, rajogun&#x301;a (the mutative principle) must also be present.  But it has to take a second place, for the thought waves are not just occurring only for the sake of action, without any purpose; the purpose is the welfare of all, which is motivated by sattvagun&#x301;a and not rajogun&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Such thought waves which evolve minds for the unit beings to perform sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, require the presence of Citta in Brahma. Citta is created by the influence of tamogun&#x301;a, the static principle. Thus tamogun&#x301;a is also present in Brahma but it occupies a very unimportant place: It has no other influences on the actions or thought-waves and thus it occupies a very insignificant position compared to the other two gun&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Q. 8.  What is Dharana and Dhya&#x301;na and what is the difference between the two?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Citta has the characteristic of becoming like its object. For example, when Citta is in contact with a tree it becomes like the tree.  To do this citta has to depend on external sensations which convey that shape to the citta with the help of the indriyas or organs.  Citta performs two types of functions: gra&#x301;haka and vikshepaka.  The gra&#x301;haka function is performed with the help of the five jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nendriyas or sense organs with their afferent nerves, which carry sensations of external objects to the citta; then the citta takes the form of the sensations carried by the nerves.  The second function of Vikshepaka is performed with the help of the five karmendriyas or motor organs and their efferent nerves, which transform sensations into physical action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Thus the citta takes the forms of the image or sensation which is carried to it with the help of the sensory nerves.  The property of citta to become like its object is called dha&#x301;rana&#x301; which means &ldquo;to hold&rdquo;: the citta holds an image and becomes like that. The image is carried to the citta from external sensations, and since these sensations are not continuous, the image which is formed on the citta is also not continuous.  There is always a gap between two successive images, but due to the rapid succession of the images, the gap is not perceived.  It is just like the images of the cinema screen which appear to be continuous and constant; but when the film is examined it is seen that the images on the screen are formed from a succession of many different pictures.  In Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, citta becomes like that with which it comes in contact in the external world through the sensations; since the sensations of the external object are not continuous, the image in the citta is also not continuous.  Thus Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a is not dynamic, for individual images which are formed on the citta, are all static and will not remain unless immediately followed by another image.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Dhya&#x301;na is also a state of citta like Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;, but since dhya&#x301;na can never be of any external object so the citta does not have to depend on external sensations.  The object in dhya&#x301;na is always internal and so citta can take its form without the help of any external sensations.  When there is no necessity of external sensations, there is also no gap between one sensation and another; and the form which the citta adopts in dhya&#x301;na is continuous.  Dhya&#x301;na is thus not static but a continuous process; and this continuity cannot be broken because the citta exists in the same state and takes the same form throughout the period of dhya&#x301;na.  Since the form is the same throughout, no gaps exist as in dha&#x301;rana&#x301;, and there is no succession of individual static images either dhya&#x301;na is compared to the continuity of a stream of oil which flows without any apparent movement.  Taela dha&#x301;ra&#x301; vat ekata&#x301;nata&#x301;: &ldquo;Meditation or dhya&#x301;na is a constant remembrance, flowing like an unbroken stream of oil from one vessel to another.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

The process of dhya&#x301;na is so continuous that all capacity of action is exhausted in maintaining this continuity, and the resultant therefore is inaction.  When there is a cessation of action, the mind ceases to exist, and that is called sama&#x301;dhi.  Sama&#x301;dhi is also called karma sama&#x301;dhi &ndash; the actionless state when all karma ceases (karmana&#x301;sha).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; and Dhya&#x301;na are therefore quite different from each other although both take place in the citta.  Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; is process of the citta taking the shape of external objects, while dhya&#x301;na concerns internal objects only.  Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a is static, while dhya&#x301;na is full of dynamic form.  Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; is non-continuous and momentary, while dhya&#x301;na is continuous. Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; may result in action, but dhya&#x301;na results only in the cessation of actions.  Dha&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301; is purely a creation of citta and is tamogun&#x301;i or static, where as dhya&#x301;na is full of dynamism and is rajoguni or mutative by nature.  The resultant cessation of action in dhya&#x301;na shows that its final goal is Sattvagun&#x301;ii Sama&#x301;dhi through the principle of sattvagun&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Q. 9.  What is A&#x301;dha&#x301;ra?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Everything which is limited, which has particular shape or quality, needs an a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra or base.  It is only because of its a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra that one unit or individual is different from another. The a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra of two different individuals are not the same &ndash; they are different.  The a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra of an individual depends on its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->The a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra like everything in this universe, is evolved from the cosmic mind or Brahmamana.  Upon being qualified by the influence of Prakrti, the cosmic mind is metamorphosed into this universe into this universe of five fundamental factors.  And the a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra also is evolved from the cosmic mind according to the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of the individual.  Brahma required no a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra as it is not limited.  It has no demarcation lines.  An a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra is required only in units which are demarcated and distinguished from one another.  Thus Brahma has no physical body: it has only a mental body or Ma&#x301;nasadeha.  This manasdeha of Brahma is evolved due to the influence of Prakrti, which Brahma becomes full of qualities and acquires the three gun&#x301;as &ndash; Sattva, rajah and tamah.  It is because of the influence of these gun&#x301;as of Prakrti that the body come into existence.  The effect of the three gun&#x301;as are as follows: Sattva or the sentient principle gives the knowledge of existence; Rajah or the mutative principle commands the energy which brings about activity; Tamah or the static force is the stationary result of action, which makes things crude.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->The effect of these three gun&#x301;as is not uniform but different in different spheres.  For instance, in this universe the influence of tamagun&#x301;a is greatest on the objects created from the five fundamental factors.  But whatever may be the predominant gun&#x301;a, all that exists even in this universe of the five fundamental factors is derived from the cosmic mind, and this universe is in fact the physical body of the cosmic mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->None of these three gun&#x301;as can exist alone: all the three exist together in all entities, but in the different proportions.  For instance, in the physical world tamah is dominant, rajah is less and sattva is least.  We have discussed this universe, the physical body of the cosmic mind.  Apart from this purely physical sphere which we see with our eyes, and where tamah is dominant, there are other spheres or lokas of the cosmic mind as well.  It should be explained here that the cosmic mind means citta only and does not include Mahattattva and ahamtattva which are also formed as a result of the influence of Prakrti on Brahma.  The cosmic mind has the following seven lokas, from crude to subtle:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->1.  Bhu&#x301;rloka &ndash; the physical world exists within this loka: it is the crudest manifestation of the cosmic mind.  All that can be seen in this universe is located within this loka.  In unit beings, this loka is in the form of the physical body and is called annamaya kos&#x301;a, that is, the layer composed of food.  In this loka, tamah is dominant, rajah is less; and sattva is least.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->2.  Bhuvarloka &ndash; this forms the crude or lower mental sphere of the cosmic mind.  All the actions which are apparently performed by the physical body are actually governed by this crude mental sphere.  This loka in the human mind is called the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a or the crude mind, which controls all the actions of the body.  This sphere is therefore limited to all the actions connected with the body.  Here tamah is dominant, sattva is less and rajah is least.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->3.  Svarloka &ndash; this is the pure mental sphere on which sukha and dhuka are experienced; it is also called Manomaya Jagat, Manomaya Kos&#x301;a in individuals.  It is in this sphere that the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras exist.  According to mythology, after the death of the physical body or Annamaya Kos&#x301;a, people go to svarga or naraka&#x301;, heaven or hell.  The fact is that the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which determine the individuality of unit being situated in this svarloka.  The Christian and Muslim ideas of heaven and hell and also svarga in Hindu Karmakandi Jaemini Partna&#x301;, were derived from the fact that the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which determine the requitals of actions exists exits in this loka.  In reality no kos&#x301;a will remain after death. The sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras remains as the object of the a&#x301;tman.  Thus the ideas of heaven and hell of the Hindu, Christian and Muslim mythologies are completely false, because after death there remains no mind at all to experience heaven or hell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->In svarloka, rajah is dominant, tamah is less and sattva is least.<!-- /block --></p>

In this loka the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are first manifested, although they exist in the Svarloka.  In the same way, an idea of an event can exist somewhere while the actual happening occurs at a different place.  For instance, one may think, &ldquo;If I go there I will fall ill&rdquo;.  Similarly sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras originate from this loka but are actually experienced in svarloka where sukha and dukha are felt.  The desire for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; also exists in this loka.  In this loka, rajah is dominant, sattva is less and tamah is least.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->5.  Janah loka &ndash; This is also known as vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a in individuals.  In the English language no state beyond the supramental has been described, and hence there is no word in English for it.  In this loka, vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, viveka and vaera&#x301;gya are dominant.  This exists in every person but it is overshadowed by the predominant Bhu and Bhuvar lokas.  In this loka, sattva is dominant, tamah is less, and rajah is least.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->6.  Tapah Loka &ndash; This is also called Hiran&#x301;maya Kos&#x301;a in individuals.  In this loka, sattva is dominant; rajah is less and tamah is least.  This loka vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is hardly in evidence, and even the feeling of existence, the feeling of &ldquo;I&rdquo; is latent. But the actual existence of &ldquo;I&rdquo; is still present.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->7.  Satya Loka &ndash; all the three gun&#x301;as are present in this loka but they are dormant.  In this loka only Parama Purus&#x301;a exists; the gun&#x301;as exist only in dormant state just as in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. Thus, in this universe there are seven spheres of Sapta Loka&#x301;tmaka. Six of them possess qualities while the seventh is the state of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, without any qualities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->The unit consciousness or jiiva needs an a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra: without any a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra it would merge in the ocean of Brahma.

Hence as long as the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are present, an a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra is necessary to maintain one&#146;s identity.  Without any a&#x301;dha&#x301;ra the a&#x301;tman will merge with Brahma.  The five kos&#x301;as plus the physical body are as follows: Annamaya Kos&#x301;a &ndash; This crudest layer is the physical body which is made of the five fundamental factors and is dependent on food for its maintenance.  This is the crudest shell around a&#x301;tman.  In this Kos&#x301;a tamah is dominant; rajah is less and sattva is least.

<a name="1..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Truth is that which never changes: it always remains in the same condition throughout eternity.  Satya is not only unchangeable throughout eternity but it is also unlimited: there is nothing beyond it.  Satya also does not change from place to place: it remains the same whether in one place or another.  Thus Satya is not affected by time, place and person; it is Ka&#x301;la&#x301;tiita, Desha&#x301;tiita and Pa&#x301;tratiita.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->There is no difference in the portions of satya within itself; it is an unbroken undifferentiated continuity.  There is nothing outside it, and so there is nothing else which is different from satya, and there is nothing else which is like satya.  Thus Satya has no vija&#x301;tiita, svajatiita and svagat differences.  Satya is different from relative truth.  Relative truth is something which appears through a particular time of place or to a particular person.  It may not appear to be true for all time or at all places or to all persons.  For instances the size of the moon is a relative truth, it may appear to be of one size if seen from the planet Earth but if seen from another planet it will seem to be of different size.  This is called relative truth or Asatya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->Historical events are also relative truth.  An incident which happens on Earth in the last century is a historical event, but as the light from Earth will not have reached another planet for a hundred years, on that planet the event has not yet occurred. Thus historical events also depend on time, place and person and are changing from time to time, place to place and person to person.  This cannot be called absolute truth or satya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->Relative truth and falsehood are only shadows of satya; they can be mistaken for satya but if put to the test, they clearly reveal themselves as asatya.  Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the only way to remove the shadow of Asatya and reach Satya &ndash; to become trika&#x301;lajiana, the knower of past, present and future.  For such persons there is no difference in anything because they see satya in everything.  By dissolving the mind one can become trikalajin&#x32D;a and attain satya. But as long as the mind is present, one cannot know Satya, because the mind is limited and cannot realize an absolute entity.<!-- /block --></p>

Since actions are performed by the mind they are dependent on the existence of the mind which itself perishable and relative truth; hence time also is a relative truth.  Time is dependent on place and person, hence it cannot be absolute truth or Satya.  If place and person do not exist, time also will not exist.  The unit entity wants happiness, but relative truth will give only temporary happiness which will disappear in the course of time.  Hence to desire or strive for relative truth, something will disappear with time, is foolishness.  One&#146;s sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or effort should be only for that which is beyond time, and satya is the only thing beyond time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->Q. 11.  How are the Kos&#x301;as or layers of existence influenced?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->Ans.  The crudest of the five kos&#x301;as is the annamaya kos&#x301;a or physical body.  It is not capable of doing anything by itself: it is lifeless by itself.  Those organisms which have no consciousness and which are lifeless, are only annamaya kos&#x301;a. The other kos&#x301;as, even the a&#x301;tman are also there, but they are all in a dormant condition, and thus the object cannot perform any action. The annamaya kos&#x301;a can perform actions only when it is influenced by ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a or crude mind.  The ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a is a lifeless thing, just as a stone is dormant; and thus if any action is to be performed by a stone it must be influenced by the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of another entity.  When a stone is thrown, the action is performed by the influence of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the person who throws the stone.  Similarly, the physical body which comprises the annamaya kos&#x301;a cannot perform any function without the influence of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a.  All the actions that the body performs are carried out by the influence of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a.  Without this influence the body will remain a crude, lifeless object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->Just as annamaya kos&#x301;a performs all the actions by the influence of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a, the manomaya kos&#x301;a can also influence the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a.  When the manomaya kos&#x301;a of one person influences the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of another person the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a of the influenced person makes its annamaya kos&#x301;a work according to the dictates of the manomaya kos&#x301;a of the other person who is influencing it.  For example, when the manomaya kos&#x301;a of one person wills that another person should see seven o&#146;clock on his watch, when actually his watch shows fifteen minutes past seven, the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a is influenced, and this makes the annamaya kos&#x301;a of the influenced person see the time to be seven o&#146;clock on his watch.  This influencing of the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a is called Bhu&#x301;tavidya in Sanskrit, in English it is called hypnotism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->Similarly, manomaya kos&#x301;a or pure mental body can also be influenced by the Atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a.  This is known as Paesha&#x301;cii Vidya&#x301; in Sanskrit; there is no English equivalent.  By means of this influence a person can convert mental force into physical force and carry out physical actions by mental force only, without the use of the annamaya kos&#x301;a of another person.  When vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a of an individual influences the atima&#x301;nasa kos&#x301;a of another person or persons it is called Ga&#x301;ndharva vidya&#x301;.  By this influence other persons can be enchanted and attracted.  This is the influence which is expressed in arts like music, dancing, painting, etc.  In music and dancing the annamaya and ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;as of others are attracted, while in painting the attraction is purely mental; hence painting is said to be a higher art than dancing and music.  This influence can hold any audience spellbound if used in speech, music, dancing or painting.  When vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a of a person is influenced by the hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a of another is called Daevii vidya.  It is by this influence and also by Gandharva vidya&#x301; that lesser Gurus guide their disciples.  Gandharva vidya&#x301; is used in this way in the form of kiirtana and bhajana, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->When satya loka or a&#x301;tman of one person influences the Hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a of another person it is called Bra&#x301;hmii vidya&#x301; and when the a&#x301;tman of one person influences the a&#x301;tman of another person it is called Brahmii A&#x301;kars&#x301;an&#x301;a or Krpa&#x301;.  It is by means of these two, Bra&#x301;hmii vidya&#x301; and Bra&#x301;hmii A&#x301;kars&#x301;an&#x301;a or krpa&#x301;, that Sadgurus guide their disciples.  From the above description of how kos&#x301;as are influenced it is evident that the process is purely mental: it is a result of the activity of mind that the kos&#x301;as can be influenced.  It should not be forgotten here that the mind has the characteristic of becoming like its object.  If these processes of influencing the kos&#x301;as are used for crude objects, then the mind will also become crude and will ultimately lose its finer faculties.  As a result the finest kos&#x301;a will no longer be able to influence the cruder kos&#x301;as, and the greater portion of the mind will become crude.  To use the mind for influencing cruder objects is thus the very opposite of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practice, in which all the cruder manifestations move towards finer and subtler realms.  The use of these influences or vidya&#x301;s on crude objects not only deprives one of the powers which might have been developed, but degrades the mind to a lower kos&#x301;a, and degenerates the mind from subtler to cruder spheres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->Q. 12.  What is Karma and Karmaphala?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->Ans.  Karma is any action.  In the physical world when we see any action being performed, we say that a kriya is being performed. But behind every kriya there is a reason for the performance of such an action.  Karma can be purely psychic or it may be psychic and physical.  No action can be performed without psychic influence: any kriya or action performed by the physical body is always influenced by the mind.  For instance, even the feeling of pain in the body cannot be present if the mental influence which registers the sensation in the mind is absent.  Hence every action is psycho-physical, no action can be purely physical. Every physical action has a reason for its performance &ndash; and that reason is the psychic influence or wave which is called Samvedana.  It is because of this samvedana that the physical body performs an action which we call kriya&#x301;.  So for every action there is a sam&#x301;vedana; and for every sam&#x301;vedana there is a reason or ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a.  Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a is also of two types: the root cause or Mu&#x301;laka&#x301;ran&#x301;a and subsidiary cause or apa&#x301;tah ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a, A&#x301;patah ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a is further divided into two types: Upa&#x301;dana ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a (the material cause) and Nimitta ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a (the efficient cause).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->For instance, when a man sets fire to a house, there may be a reason behind his setting the fire, but to the immediate spectators the cause for the burning would be the fire and the hand which kindled it.  Here fire is Upa&#x301;da&#x301;na Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a and the hand is Nimitta Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a.  Actions or kriya&#x301;s and sam&#x301;vedana travel in waves.  At one end of the wave where the action is complete, the immediate cause appears to be the nimitta ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a. If one thinks beyond this, the cause appears to be the upa&#x301;da&#x301;na ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a.  Still further analysis will show that the immediate cause was the subsidiary cause or a&#x301;patah ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a; and thus the root cause or Mu&#x301;la ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a was something different.  The Mu&#x301;la ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a for all actions are the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of a person.  These sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras give rise to sam&#x301;vedana and then the sam&#x301;vedana is converted into psycho-physical actions.  The other causes which appear to be the immediate causes, are only due to the wave-like motion of the sam&#x301;vedana and kriya&#x301;, which makes the subsidiary cause, and then the upa&#x301;dana and finally the nimitta ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a, to appear to be the main causes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->Just as the upa&#x301;da&#x301;na and nimitta ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a appear to be the main and immediate causes when an action is performed, so the updatta karya&#x301; and naemittika kriya&#x301; appear to be the main action performed, so updatta karya&#x301; and naemittika kriya&#x301; appear to be the main actions performed.  It is said that every action or kriya&#x301; has a reaction or pratikriya&#x301;.  This reaction is physico-psychic and gives rise to a pra&#x301;ti-sam&#x301;vedana, or psychic reaction.  That is psychic reaction to every psychic action. These psychic reactions or pra&#x301;ti-sam&#x301;vedana give rise to the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of a person.  It has been said earlier that sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are the Mu&#x301;la ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a or root causes of action.  It is quite often observed that a child suffers from some disease without any apparent fault on her part.  The disease is attributed to her being affected by the germs of that disease, and thus the germs appear to be the cause.  In fact, the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of that child give rise to the sam&#x301;vedana or psychic action which then activates the germs of that particular disease in the body.  The mu&#x301;la ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a or root cause for the suffering of the child is sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, due to which sam&#x301;vedana arises and ultimately brings about the disease.  It is therefore wrong to think that the child is suffering without any reason and for no fault of its own.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->This wave of action and reaction, whether psychic or psycho-physical, goes on, and the sam&#x301;vedana manifests into physical action or kriya&#x301;.  Physical reaction results ultimately in psychic reaction which may result in the formation of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.  The combination of psycho-physical and psychic action is called karma.  Karmaphala is the result of an action in the form of a reaction.  Karmaphala to the observer is the reaction itself as seen immediately after an action; for example, the apparent Karmaphala of putting one&#146;s finger in the fire is that the finger gets burnt.  This is the immediate physical reaction and not the final Karmaphala.  This physical reaction or pratikriya&#x301; will give rise to pratisam&#x301;vedana or psychic reaction and this may form a sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra, which then becomes the Mu&#x301;la ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a or root cause for further psychic or physical actions (sam&#x301;vedana and kriya&#x301;).  In fact, the karmaphala of the previous karma will be experienced only then.  So just as nimiita and upa&#x301;da&#x301;na ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a appears to be the main cause, the immediate reaction of an action appears to be the result while it is only a physical reaction, and the actual result or phala will be experienced later on.  Karma and karmaphala travel in a wave and at one stage one becomes the ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a for the other.  This wave is unending, until karma ceases absolutely, karma and karmaphala are the ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a or causes for each other, which travel in a never ending waves, until the karma and along with it, the formation of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras finally ceases.<!-- /block --></p>

As Bhagava&#x301;n Buddha preached in the common language of village folk, Hindu pandits named his language <i>bha&#x301;kha&#x301;</i> [colloquial language]. Pali was also known as Pa&#x301;talii Bha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301; [<i>bha&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;</i> = "language"].

The word <i>atta&#x301;</i> is also used in place of "self".

<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><b>Charvaka</b>: At the time of Buddha, <i>na&#x301;stika mata</i> [the school of atheism] was predominant. Maharshi Ajita Keshakambali was the predominant pandit of the <i>na&#x301;stikas</i> [atheists]. Most of the books of <i>na&#x301;stika mata</i> were written in incomprehensible language, and so its propagation was not very widespread. Ajita Keshakambali believed in Charvaka, who propounded a materialistic philosophy. Buddhist philosophy is not a materialistic philosophy. The Charvaka school of philosophy believes in <i>caturbhu&#x301;ta</i> [four fundamental factors] only. This is also known as <i>deha&#x301;tmava&#x301;da</i> [the doctrine that the body is everything].

<a name="2..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->The universe has not been created and hence there is no <i>Sagun&#x301;a Brahma</i> [Qualified Supreme Entity]. Shankaracharya believes only in <i>Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma</i>. Shankaracharya says that the universe is like a dream and the dreamer is also <i>Brahma</i>, as he did not believe in <i>jiivas</i>. When <i>Brahma</i> is <i>nirgun&#x301;a</i> [non-qualified] how can He see, as seeing is also a quality. This was forgotten by Shankaracharya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Again, according to Shankaracharya, everything that is seen and experienced is due to the influence of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i>. This means <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> is also an entity, which <i>advaetava&#x301;da</i> [monism, or non-dualism, a key theory of Sham&#x301;kara Darshana] cannot accept.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->Again, Shankaracharya says that there is no such thing as <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> exactly, rather <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> Itself is an illusion. A person in the desert sees water, houses, trees, etc., from a distance, but actually there is nothing. In the absence of <i>jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</i>, the person experiences an illusion.

To overcome this Shankaracharya says that <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> is not even nothing, It is inexplicable (<i>anirvacaniiya</i>). Again the question arises, who created <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> if <i>Brahma</i> did not create It? Then <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> becomes <i>Sagun&#x301;a Brahma</i>.<!-- /block --></p>

This is also illogical since <i>Prakrti</i> is only energy, or the <i>shakti</i> of <i>Purus&#x301;a</i>, and like the <i>da&#x301;hika shakti</i> [burning capacity] of <i>agni</i> [fire], <i>Prakrti</i> cannot be a separate entity.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn1">1</a></b>)  This discourse was compiled from classes given to a select group of <i>ta&#x301;ttvikas</i> (those trained in elementary philosophy), hence the outstanding principles and beliefs of the important faiths were given little or no explanation by the author. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn2">2</a></b>)  <i>Darshana</i> literally means "philosophy". Hindu Yoga Darshana &ndash; one of the <i>s&#x301;ad&#x301;adarshanas</i>, or six major schools of theistic Indian philosophy, discussed later in this chapter &ndash; is also known as Pa&#x301;tain&#x32D;jala Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn3">3</a></b>)  The roots of both these words mean &ldquo;unmoving&rdquo;. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn4">4</a></b>)  According to Nya&#x301;ya philosophy, <i>jiivas</i> (living beings) and <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i> (Supreme Consciousness) are separate entities, and neither attracts the other. Both schools of Nya&#x301;ya philosophy &ndash; Gaotama Nya&#x301;ya propounded by Shrii Gaotama and Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da Nya&#x301;ya propounded by Shrii Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da &ndash; believe in Vedic rituals and are divorced from practicality. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn5">5</a></b>)  Elsewhere the author has said: "Thus the chief contention of Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy is that there are many <i>purus&#x301;as</i> but only one <i>Prakrti</i>." ("Vraja Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya Philosophy" in <i>Nama&#x301;mi Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asundaram</i>, 1996) &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn6">6</a></b>)   <i>Mukta Purus&#x301;a</i> here means Consciousness which has not been bound by <i>Prakrti</i>. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn7">7</a></b>)  <i>A&#x301;lambana</i> literally means "support", that on which something else depends. It is sometimes used to refer to <i>Parama Purus&#x301;a</i>, who is the ultimate shelter of everything. Here it apparently refers to objects of the physical world. On such objects depend formations of the <i>citta</i>, from which we can infer the existence of the physical objects themselves. &ndash;Eds.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="2.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.2.fn8">8</a></b>)  Creative Principle, <i>Prakrti</i> in Her phase of creation. One aspect of <i>Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;</i> is the power to cause the illusion that the finite created objects are the ultimate truth. &ndash;Eds.</p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->For the existence of human beings in society, the following fundamental factors are necessary: (1) unity, (2) social security and (3) peace. What is actually required under each of these fundamentals is discussed below.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Unity<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Unity among the members of any society or social structure is absolutely necessary, otherwise the structure will start disintegrating. Lack of unity among the members of society because of too much self-interest in the individual members, the formation of groups for economic or social advantage, and the lack of understanding of others, act not only to bring about the downfall of society, but also can wipe it out completely from the face of the earth. Instances of many groups and empires disappearing altogether are not rare in the little-known history of this world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The problem, therefore, is the preservation of unity in society. Unity in society will be ensured if it is possible to enthuse the members of society with the following: a common ideal, a casteless society, collective social functions, and no capital punishment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><b>A common ideal</b>: It is often heard that a particular country was never so united as during war. This is partly due to love of one&#146;s motherland, but more importantly, it is due to all the individuals having a common ideal: facing the perils of war. This common ideal is, however, a very temporary phenomenon and disappears when the dangers of war diminish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga the seed of a common ideal is sown from the very beginning of a child&#146;s life. At the age of five, when the child has acquired only a preliminary understanding of his or her surroundings, he or she is given the idea of <i>Brahma</i> [the Supreme Entity]. The entire society of Ananda Marga is thus founded on a common ideal or goal &ndash; <i>Brahma</i>. This foundation will never be lost like the dangers of war. Such an ideal will not disappear like the common ideal of facing the dangers of war; so the unity in a society founded on the ideal of <i>Brahma</i> will be everlasting.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga, even in the economic field, there is a common ideal, as the whole property of the earth is common property and is to be shared by all members of the society. This is instilled in every member by reciting the following <i>shloka</i> [couplet] at the commencement of every function held by the members of Ananda Marga:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Love for all &ndash; the ideal of the whole of humanity being one family, utilizing all the property of the world as one unit &ndash; coupled with the idea given to all those participating in the Na&#x301;makaran&#x301;a [baby naming ceremony] that the social, psychic and spiritual upbringing of the child is the common responsibility of all &ndash; provide an undying common ideal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><b>A casteless society</b>: Caste is another important factor which disrupts society. The evils of the caste system are nowhere better known than in India. For unity in society, there should not be any small groupings within the society claiming economic and social privileges.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga, where "love for all" and "humanity is one family" are the guiding principles, and where individuals identify themselves as <i>jiiva ma&#x301;tra</i> [living beings like any other], a casteless society is the only society which can exist. In all the social functions in Ananda Marga, the prominent guides and workers are <i>guru bha&#x301;i</i> [disciples of the same guru] and not <i>ja&#x301;ta bha&#x301;i</i> [members of the same caste] as is the prevalent custom. From the very beginning of a child&#146;s life, that is, when his or her worldly identity is established at the time of the Na&#x301;makaran&#x301;a, up to the Shra&#x301;ddha Kriya&#x301; [funeral ceremony], when his or her worldly identity is lost, the persons participating in all the functions as guides and workers are only <i>guru bha&#x301;i</i>, and may be from any caste.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->This, along with the common goal of <i>Brahma</i>, inspires the formation of a society where individuals identify themselves as <i>jiiva ma&#x301;tra</i> and do not belong to any particular caste, creed or sect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Also, no family is debarred from taking part in our social functions because of the fault of a member of that family. With this the chances of the formation of a society of outcaste families are eliminated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->In such a society, where belonging to a particular group or section is not necessary for marriage, for learning the Vedas, or for making efforts to achieve anything, the formation of castes is not possible. In Ananda Marga, where the upbringing of every child is a combined responsibility, where the whole property of the universe is to be collectively utilized, and where there is no caste bar for spiritual practices, the formation of castes for social, economic or spiritual reasons is not possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><b>Collective social functions</b>: Many of the ills of society develop because people do not care to know other members of society. This may not only mean ignorance of the condition and difficulties of others, but also leads to intolerance and a lack of interest in the affairs of the other members of society. Common social functions bring different members of society together and are therefore a great unifying force. By performing certain functions collectively, all the members are engaged in doing the same thing for some time, and this brings about a feeling of unity and interest in others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga such common social functions are especially encouraged. <i>Milita sna&#x301;na</i> [collective bathing] and <i>dharmacakra</i> [collective meditation] provide grounds for common social functions in the physical, psychic and spiritual fields. Common participation in such functions is a very great unifying force. The participants in such functions will have no intolerance for each other, and will instead get more united. Such functions are, therefore, a great unifying force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><b>No capital punishment</b>: Capital punishment<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> brings about deterioration in society and stops further progress of the individuals on whom capital punishment is inflicted. Such individuals<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  form sects or groups which become the lower or discarded groups of society, and give rise to discord and disruption in society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga capital punishment, whether social or physical, is not permitted under any circumstances. The only punishment permissible in the Marga is disallowing a defaulter to take part in social functions for a fixed period. After the period is over, the individual starts taking part in all the functions as usual. No dependents are to suffer the punishment inflicted on such individuals. This punishment leaves no mark on the individual after the period of punishment, as does outcasting a family or even imprisonment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The other punishment specified is to bring to the Marga, that is, to show the right path to, ten persons before the individual is allowed to attend social functions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Punishments of this type are corrective and, instead of retarding individual progress, give more chance to the individual to correct his or her conduct and to adopt correct pursuits during the period of punishment. As these punishments do not leave a permanent mark on the individual or the family, they do not bring about discord and disunity among the members of society. On the contrary, those undergoing such punishment are employing themselves in better pursuits than in their normal life by making efforts to show the right path to ten people. They are thus not only improving themselves, but are also making efforts to improve society, and are bringing about more unity in society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..22"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Social Security<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Lack of security in society leads to the disintegration of society itself. Any society where security against injustice is not provided to individuals cannot exist for long. Lack of security in society also arises because of indiscipline. If the laws of society are not obeyed, social security will not be possible. The most important requisites for social security, therefore, are that there should be no injustice and that there should be strict discipline.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><b>No injustice</b>: If security in society is to be maintained, there should be no injustice, whether economic, or because of the sex or race of a person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Economic injustice is usually the result of lack of appreciation for the dignity of labour. Trade-wise distinctions<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> in society lead to economic injustices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga it is laid down that it is better to work as a sweeper and earn one&#146;s own living than to be dependent on others for one&#146;s livelihood. If such importance is given to one&#146;s own earning and living, many economic injustices will cease to exist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Economic injustice also comes about because of the hoarding instinct in individuals. People want all property for themselves only. If they only felt that property should be shared by others also, many economic injustices would not be committed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->In the Marga all the property of the universe is to be considered as common property and has to be utilized jointly. This idea leaves hardly any scope for economic injustices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Another form of injustice in society is discrimination based on sex. Instances of one sex being considered inferior to the other are very common. Women in a considerable area of the world are considered to be the private property of men, meant for their pleasure only. In many other, so-called advanced, countries of this world, women do not have the right to vote in the general elections held by the government of the country. In other countries women are considered unfit to take part in spiritual practices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga both men and women have equal responsibility. In the manner prescribed for marriage in the Marga, both the man and the woman have to take equal responsibility. In Ananda Marga there is no bar on women being entitled to spiritual practices. Women and men are considered to be on the same footing, and there is no question of men considering themselves to be superior to women.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Members of a particular race who consider themselves superior to others also very frequently inflict injustices on other sections of society. The expulsion of the Jews from Germany by Hitler&#146;s so-called superior Aryan race is a glaring example of racial injustice in society. In this country, also, injustices on Harijans by the so-called superior races have caused a tremendous amount of disruption in society. To obviate this type of social injustice, the first attempt should be to do away with racial distinctions in society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga the first step that one takes is to forget one&#146;s race or sect &ndash; to no longer identify oneself with one&#146;s race, caste or sect &ndash; regardless of whether it was superior or inferior.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Racial prejudices figure very prominently in social functions based on racial considerations. In [Ananda Marga] collective functions members of all races, castes or creeds take part as equals. Community or caste, race or nation, is often the main consideration in arranging marriages, etc. In the Marga there are no such considerations. In the Marga these petty differences among human beings are not given any importance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->In the Marga the seeds of an ideal humanity are sown from the very beginning of life, and humanity as a whole is considered to be one family belonging to the race of <i>jiiva ma&#x301;tra</i>. In such a society injustices due either to economics or to sexual or racial considerations will be unknown.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph --><b>Discipline</b>: Lack of discipline in a society has often been seen historically to be the main reason for the extermination of that society. Indiscipline in some members of a society may make the peaceful existence of other members impossible. Discipline is, therefore, absolutely necessary for the preservation of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Indiscipline in a society arises when some members think that the laws of the society are wrong. If their thinking is confined to thinking and arguing only, and does not lead to breaking the laws of the society, there will be no indiscipline. In order to maintain discipline, the laws of a society should be rational and capable of change from time to time according to the development of the society, then alone discipline can be preserved.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->In the Marga anything which is not rational has no place. When reason is given so much importance and change due to reason is accepted, all chances of dissatisfaction leading to indiscipline are eliminated. At the same time, in the Marga reasoning or arguing comes only after obedience. This ensures discipline in society. If, after obeying the laws of society, one feels that they are wrong, one has every right to argue and have the laws changed, but argument before obedience leads to indiscipline.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->In a society such as the Marga, which is based on rationality alone and not on prejudices, there is no chance of indiscipline creeping in and undermining the social security of individuals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..39"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Peace<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Psychic equilibrium is peace. It is therefore to be seen what brings about psychic equilibrium and what disturbs it. Spiritual practices will bring psychic equilibrium, and a belief in superstition will disturb it. Hence, for the preservation of peace, spiritual practices and fighting against superstition are necessary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph --><b>Spiritual practices</b>: Relief from <i>duhkha</i> [suffering] is the main desire, and without the fulfilment of this desire peace is not possible. This remission is called <i>nivrtti</i> [the cessation of suffering]. <i>Nivrtti</i> is of two types: one is called <i>[sa&#x301;mayikii] nivrtti</i> [the temporary cessation of suffering], and the other <i>atyantikii nivrtti</i> [the permanent cessation of suffering]. One thing which helps in getting remission, or <i>nivrtti</i>, is called <i>artha</i> [that which provides temporary liberation from mundane desires]. But <i>artha</i> is purely physical, so it can bring only physical and temporary remission. For everlasting freedom from <i>duhkha, Parama&#x301;rtha</i> [that which provides permanent liberation] is the only remedy. <i>Parama&#x301;rtha</i> does not bring only temporary remission, but everlasting freedom from <i>duhkha</i>. <i>Atyantikii nivrtti</i> can be obtained only by <i>Parama&#x301;rtha</i> which relieves one of all <i>duhkha</i>: physical, mental and spiritual. This <i>Parama&#x301;rtha</i> can only be obtained by sadhana, that is, spiritual practices. For maintaining peace psychic equilibrium is necessary, and for maintaining this equilibrium freedom from all <i>duhkha</i> forever is necessary. Freedom from <i>duhkha</i> or <i>atyantikii nivrtti</i> can be obtained only from <i>Parama&#x301;rtha</i>, and <i>Parama&#x301;rtha</i> can be achieved only by sadhana, or spiritual practices.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->In the Marga spiritual practices begin when the child reaches the age of five. From the very beginning of a child&#146;s life, he or she is initiated into spiritual practices. With the advance of the child&#146;s life the spiritual practices also advance, bringing within their scope not only the mental sphere, but also bodily development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->The sadhana, or spiritual practices, of the Marga do not teach forsaking the world. They teach the right and correct use of all property, crude or subtle. Our sadhana is a systematic and scientific method for physical, mental and spiritual progress and advancement by which permanent psychic equilibrium, and thus everlasting peace, is established.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph --><b>Fighting against superstition</b>: The <i>svabha&#x301;va</i> [natural tendency] of mind is to become like its object. Superstition of any kind &ndash; social, psychic or spiritual &ndash; influences the mind to such an extent that the mind, due to its worries, leads a person into trouble. The mental equilibrium of one believing in superstition is disturbed, and the result is that one not only loses peace, but one is also led to do some action which is detrimental to oneself. This only further strengthens belief in superstition. Any ordinary incident is magnified and attributed to some <i>durlaks&#x301;an&#x301;a</i>, or bad omen, by the believers of superstition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->It is only because of the mind&#146;s nature to become like its object that people see ghosts, which are purely the mental creation of those who believe in this superstition. If only these persons had the courage and mental strength to catch the ghost, they would very soon realize that their mistake was believing nothing to be something.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Such superstitions have not left any field uncontaminated. In the social sphere there is no dearth of superstitions. Witchcraft, discrimination against widows, etc., are curses in society only due to such superstitions. In the psychic sphere there are deep-rooted superstitions such as the belief in ghosts (<i>bhu&#x301;t</i>), etc. Not only this, but superstitions related to <i>shra&#x301;ddha</i> [funeral ceremonies], etc., have also bound down even the progeny of a person. In the spiritual field, also, ignorant people have been forced to do many things only because of the deep-rooted superstition of heaven and hell. All these only disturb psychic equilibrium and bring about discord and worry in society. For the preservation of peace, the fight against superstition is of prime importance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->In Ananda Marga none of these superstitions have been given any place. In the social field witchcraft has been discredited as only a psychic creation of some <i>kusam&#x301;ska&#x301;rii</i> [evil] person. Widows have been given the same status as unmarried women, there being no restrictions on their dress, behaviour, living, etc. Exercising any influence on widows [to compel them] to adopt a particular pattern of life based on the social superstition of disallowing their presence in social functions, is strictly prohibited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->The psychic superstitions of ghosts, <i>shra&#x301;ddha</i>, etc., also do not find any place in the Marga. Ghosts are only imaginary, and performing <i>shra&#x301;ddha</i> by giving <i>da&#x301;na</i> [gifts] to Brahmans to take a departed soul across the Vaeta&#x301;rnii River [the mythological river which must be crossed to enter heaven], is only a psychic misrepresentation inculcated from the very beginning. These ideas are not rational, and therefore believing in them is not correct. This is the view taken in the Marga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->The spiritual superstitions of heaven and hell and fear of God make individuals suppressed, and they lose their peace. Not infrequently fear in terms of such superstitions creates a very undesirable reaction in people, and thereby causes a loss of peace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->In the Marga spiritual practices are based on rationality. Fear and superstition do not have any part in them. A systematic and scientific method of spiritual practices in the Marga leaves no place for these superstitions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->It can thus be seen that an ideal society will come into being only when there is unity, social security and peace. To provide for such a society, Ananda Marga is founded on <i>Brahma</i> as a common ideal. Unity in Ananda Marga is secured by evolving a casteless society where capital punishment is prohibited, and all take part unitedly in social functions irrespective of caste, creed or race. In such a society social injustice due to trade-wise distinctions, sex or race is not possible. Ananda Marga further strengthens society by refuting and discouraging all superstitions, whether social, psychic or spiritual, and by providing a systematic and scientific method of spiritual practices and codes for physical, mental and spiritual progress and advancement towards permanent peace in an ideal society.<!-- /block --></p>

In self-hypnotism all the indriyas come under the control of the mind and act according to the dictates of mind. But sama&#x301;dhi cannot be attained without mind being dissolved. The belief that sama&#x301;dhi is only self-hypnotism is not correct. There is however no doubt that self-hypnotism is a great help in attaining sama&#x301;dhi as it is easier to dissolve mind when it has full control over indriyas as in that stage indriyas do not remain the object of mind and hence do not become an hindrance to its being dissolved. Thus a&#x301;vesha or self-hypnotism is only a help for attaining sama&#x301;dhi and not sama&#x301;dhi in which mind is also dissolved.<!-- /block --></p>

In planchette for instance there is usually a heart-shaped small board, resting on two sticks and the point of a pencil. When the board is touched the pencil traces the alphabets on the board and makes sentences which are said to be the reply given by the spirit questioned. The movement of the pencil or the board is purely due to mental force of the persons taking part in it and the answer to the questions also has its origin only in the mind of the persons. The correctness of the answer depends on the knowledge of that person about the question. All other similar demonstrations are also purely mental where movement if any is due to mental force and any statements made are the creation of the mind of the persons making the demonstrations. The statements made as a result of such demonstrations do not even have the accuracy of the statements by other astrologers who arrive at their conclusions with the help of enormous statistical data available with them.

<p class="Para_Notes">This article originally appeared in English in <i>Ta&#x301;ttvika Praveshika&#x301;,</i> 1957.  Only one thousand copies of that book were printed; the author never instructed that the book be  reprinted in its original form. In 1968 a Bengali version of the  article appeared in the magazine <i>Pragati Pradiip</i> in the name of the  author; this version abridged a passage of the original that discussed  <i>sannya&#x301;siis</i> and householders. The <i>Pragati Pradiip</i> version was  reprinted in several subsequent Bengali periodicals and, in 1987-1988, the Bengali editions of  <i>A Few Problems Solved 7, Prout in a Nutshell 11</i> and <i>Ananda Marga  Philosophy in a Nutshell 3</i>. The Central Executive Committee and the Central Committee  (highest policy-making body) of Ananda Marga discussed the issue thoroughly and decided that the author  clearly preferred the <i>Pragati Pradiip</i> version, and therefore resolved in  March 2001 that that version would remain in future publications.  What appears here is the <i>Ta&#x301;ttvika Praveshika&#x301;</i> version, edited to conform with that  <i>Pragati Pradiip</i> version, and also with minor editing of the English.</p>

<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If we take each one of these important spheres of life separately as depicted in Ananda Marga, we will see how they are radically different from all existing ideas on the subjects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Economic System<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Ever since the beginning of this world, the power to rule has been in the hands of one class or another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the beginning of the world, when it was inhabited by animals only, mere brute force determined the capacity of a class to rule. For example, we find in the natural history of the world a period when enormous reptiles, the dinosaurs, ruled the world with the help of sheer weight and brute force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The rule of brute force did not end with the animals, but continued even in the age of earlier human beings. Even after the advent of civilization, in the early stages the knights, rajas, kings and maharajas depended on and ruled with the help of their physical strength. Every other faculty on the earth was subordinate to physical strength.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->With the passage of time, as mental faculties developed, physical force was replaced by the mental capacities of planning, forethought, etc., as the essential requirements of ruling over others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->With further economic development, money became important. The possession of money could even secure the use of the knowledge of the learned, and the courage and strength of the brave. Hence the authority to rule passed on to the moneyed class, the capitalists. The capitalists could not retain the authority to rule for very long as their income depended on the workers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The toilers, who had neither courage and strength, nor highly-developed mental faculties, nor money, had to depend on one of the above three classes for their maintenance. The classes with physical strength or mental faculties could do without the help of the toilers, and as long as their rule lasted the toilers did not realize their importance. The capitalists could not produce wealth without the help of the workers; the worker thus became an essential requirement of the ruler.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The workers did not fail to realize this, and consequently we find their attempts to rule manifest in the shape of the communist movement of the present age. A close study of this movement will show that it is not backed by individual physical strength, mental development, that is, reasoning or statesmanship, or capital, but by a unity of workers who have only one quality, that is, to work. This quality of work can be directed towards violence for snatching away the capital and the other attainments of the other classes. But whatever their drawbacks, the cycle of events shows that power is passing into their hands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Similarly, if Ananda Marga were only a development due to the cycle of events, the power to rule, according to it, should be vested in one of the classes. If the workers or communists have outlived their utility, power, according to the ordinary cycle, should pass to the brave or to the statesmen, and Ananda Marga should have also aimed at this. In Ananda Marga this is not so. Ananda Marga does not follow any of the old patterns of economic life. The power to rule is not bestowed on any one class. In fact, in the Marga there are no separate classes. The Marga has done away with the age-old system of classifying human beings according to their trade or even their capacity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The four classes which have ruled the world at one time or another are not of recent origin, but have been known ever since the beginning of humanity as <i>bra&#x301;hman&#x301;as</i> [or <i>vipras</i>],<i> ks&#x301;atriyas, vaeshyas</i> and <i>shu&#x301;dras</i>. These trade-wise classifications developed due to individuals being more suited for a certain type of work. The classes so formed started the fight for power and for their own comforts, and thus came the existence of one class ruling the rest. It would thus appear that the formation of trade-wise classes was a natural and logical development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->If that were so, how, then, would Ananda Marga be able to establish a classless society? Ananda Marga does not claim any achievement which is illogical, and hence a classless society, which would be illogical, cannot be achieved by Ananda Marga. The natural and obvious conclusion of those who do not know Ananda Marga will be that Ananda Marga is like many other societies of idealists and moralists who aim to establish a classless society. The attempt to establish a classless society by Ananda Marga is not confined only to those who are preachers of the Marga, or to those who understand the philosophy of the Marga and appreciate the necessity of a classless society; rather, every member of Ananda Marga practises a system of living which leads to a classless society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The revolutionary character of the Marga is seen from the very approach it takes to tackle one of the oldest vices of human beings: the vice of dividing themselves into classes for their own benefit. These artificial classes get logical backing from the fact that they have sprung up from the grouping together of persons of similar aptitude for the better utilization of their capacities. For instance, the learned and the statesmen combined together and formed the class of <i>vipras</i>. Similarly, the strong and the brave formed what is called the <i>ks&#x301;atriyas</i>. The <i>vaeshyas</i> and the <i>shu&#x301;dras</i> were formed in a similar way. Ananda Marga breaks all these classes, not by calling them bad, but by making all the members of Ananda Marga practise and develop the qualities of all these classes. For instance, the developed mind required by <i>vipras</i> is necessary for every member of Ananda Marga. Even if one is a <i>shu&#x301;dra</i> or a <i>vaeshya</i>, or a member of any other class, every person, after joining the Marga, has to work to have a developed and strong mind. Every person has to work to build a strong and healthy body. Every person has to work for a living. This has been given so much importance in the Marga that it is laid down that the work of a sweeper &ndash; the lowest form of work &ndash; is far more respectable than depending upon others for one&#146;s daily needs. Not only has earning money and having a balanced and dependable economic life been given importance, but even the lowest of all these classes, in whom people usually do not see any good, has been given equal importance. Every member of the Marga has to serve others physically. This is the work of the <i>shu&#x301;dras</i>, or the workers. Followers of the Marga cannot develop themselves completely unless they can also perform this work efficiently. In short, all the requirements of the four classes have to be mastered by each individual in Ananda Marga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->It is not only the mastery of these trades which is necessary, the regular practice of these trades is an essential duty of every member of Ananda Marga. Every individual thus becomes universally fit. One makes as good a <i>vipra</i> as a <i>shu&#x301;dra</i>. Thus, no scope is left for an individual to leave others behind and form a special group.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->A classless society is not aimed at in the Marga, but is evolved by practice. This approach, to break a society full of classes and sects, was never thought of before. The very classes which appeared as a logical development and evolution can be broken up by an even more logical method to form only one classless society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Ananda Marga is, therefore, not an organization of idealists or moralists who preach a classless society, but a method &ndash; a system or a dharma &ndash; which leads to a classless society. It has not been formed as a result of cyclic changes in the economic sphere of the world like the evolution of communism, rather it is a radical departure from all existing economic practices or theories conceived so far. It is a revolution in the economic sphere of the world&#146;s life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Social Structure<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In the social sphere, too, both the means and the end adopted in Ananda Marga are revolutionary. They show a change which had never been conceived of before &ndash; a change which is not a cyclic change due to the development of the social habits of human beings. It is a change based on the fundamental characteristics of the human mind, and hence it is a change which will last as long as the human mind lasts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Human beings, from time immemorial, have been framing laws and rules to govern themselves so that the fundamental rights of each individual are secured and all the members of society can live peacefully. Such laws have been framed from time to time by the ruling class, and every such law clearly shows that the ruling class has framed the laws keeping their own interests as the uppermost consideration in their minds. For instance, in the <i>Manusmrti</i>, the text of laws framed by Manu, it is stated that if a Brahman boy marries a Shu&#x301;dra girl, he is to be punished by shaving his head and taking him around the town seated on the back of a donkey, while the punishment for a Shu&#x301;dra boy marrying a Brahman girl is death. These laws were accepted only as long as Brahman supremacy remained, and started being questioned the moment Brahman supremacy was removed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Since Brahman supremacy there have been numerous lawgivers, and all of them have framed laws and rules to suit their own convenience. Some have placed allegiance to the king as the supreme duty of every member of society, others have placed the country or the state above the sovereign, while others have considered their religion most important. There is no one common bond in any of the numerous societies to keep all of them together. The laws for ensuring security are framed so as to provide security of varying degrees to members of the different strata of society, such as the difference [in degree of security provided] between the Brahmans and the Shu&#x301;dras or that between the white Americans and the black Americans. Such laws, lacking a common bond, cannot lead to the existence of a peaceful and everlasting society. Unfortunately, so far all lawgivers have done this, and the resulting society has been full of unrest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The approach to tackle the problem of developing an everlasting society is revolutionary itself. The persons who are to build the society of Ananda Marga are not mere idealists and moralists. They are a group of classless, casteless, practical persons who do not only preach and meditate on the principles of classlessness, but actually practise them so as to be fit to be a member of any of the classes of the world, based on the individual capacities of human beings. With this background, they are bound together by the common bond of accepting <i>Brahma</i> [the Supreme Entity] as their common and foremost ideal. The ideal is everlasting, and equally important for any class of persons.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The social laws of the Marga do not only make no distinction between one person and another, but ensure that both sexes have to share equal responsibility in life. All social superstitions, such as discrimination against widows, etc., are discarded. Not only are these superstitions discarded, but the fundamental principles of some of the existing laws of society, such as allegiance to the laws of society and state, take only second place, that is, after allegiance to <i>Brahma</i>. Capital punishment,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> such as outcasting, or restricting widows or women in general from taking part in certain social functions, do not find any place in our society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Ananda Marga forms a society in which laws have been framed always keeping in view the common ideal, and thereby developing the idea of the oneness of all humanity. This society is radically different from any existing society, for it provides a society with a common bond where there is no distinction, whether of class or sex, where no one can be outcast or punished so that one may not be incapable of reforming oneself, and where no laws are framed keeping in view the interest of a few individuals only. In such a society, no one would be weak or downtrodden, and no one would allow oneself to be exploited by others. Such a society had been dreamt of and spoken of earlier by moralists and idealists, but never before has a practical approach to achieve it &ndash; as has been discovered by Ananda Marga by producing people who combine all the qualities of the different economic classes of the world in one individual &ndash; been conceived of by any of the numerous thinkers or lawgivers of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..26"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Trend of Thinking<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->If Ananda Marga is a revolution in the economic and social spheres, it is a greater revolution in the mental and spiritual spheres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->All [Indian] philosophers and thinkers so far have declared the visible world to be unreal when compared to themselves. Ananda Marga takes a radically different view. According to the philosophy of the Marga, the world is as real as one&#146;s knowledge of one&#146;s own existence. At first it is difficult to imagine how far-reaching the effects of this radical change in the trend of thought can be. This approach not only gives the world the importance of human beings, but also makes the existence of the world essential. The world, or any worldly activity, is just as good a manifestation of the Supreme Being as human beings themselves. Hence Ananda Marga does not preach running away from the world, but makes it an essential requirement for every individual to be in the world. The idea of giving the world equal importance is a revolutionary idea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Ananda Marga makes no distinction between a family person and a <i>sannya&#x301;sii</i>. It needed the courage of a revolutionary to say so.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..30"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Spiritual Practices<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->All the religions of the world, whether present or past, have placed restrictions on the persons who are entitled to spiritual practices. In the Hindu religion also such restrictions are numerous. In almost all other religions there are restrictions as well. Ananda Marga has no such restrictions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->There is no need for a person to be a <i>sannya&#x301;sii</i> to learn spiritual practices which so far had never been taught to family people. Ananda Marga places no restrictions on the members of a particular class, caste or sex for learning spiritual practices. The removal of such restrictions is a revolution. Never before had it been conceived that a family person, living with his or her family and earning a living, could achieve the ultimate goal, but the revolution of Ananda Marga has made it possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Everything we see is a manifestation of the Supreme Being, and so every work connected with It should be done with as much efficiency as the worship in other religions. <i>Brahma</i> is omnipresent, and one need not go to the Himalayas to find Him. The idea that whatever we do, see, hear or feel is <i>Brahma</i>, is a unique idea. Such a philosophy is a revolution, and is radically different from the philosophies evolved by the great thinkers of the world so far.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Ananda Marga is radically different from all concepts of philosophy, economics or social thinking. It is not a change which has evolved as a result of the evolution of the human mind and its economic and social environments; it is a revolutionary concept of life altogether different from any of the present or past ideas. It is a change which is independent of the cyclic changes resulting from the passage of time. It does not preach or practise anything which is not new in both approach and practice. It is a revolution which makes life a reality and teaches adjustment in life, rather than giving up the world and leading a useless, secluded life. It prepares human beings who are fit for every walk of life, who do not make any distinction among their fellow beings, and who are joined together as a complete, big one. In Ananda Marga all humanity, nay, all living beings, <i>jiiva ma&#x301;tra</i>, combine together in every walk of life as they sing:<!-- /block --></p>
