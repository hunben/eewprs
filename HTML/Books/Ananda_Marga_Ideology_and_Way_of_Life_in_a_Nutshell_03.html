<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The one who has known the Supreme Brahma has really known Him as the refuge of this universe. The One Who is the ultimate refuge of each and everything, animate and inanimate, movable and immovable, from the Supreme creation&#8230; Brahma &ndash; to the lowliest blade of grass, is the supreme goal, the final beatitude. The universe has been created within Him and is indeed radiant with His radiance. That the universe is created within Him is not all that can be said. It is the transformation of His own Self. It is evolved by Him. He is the substance as well as the cause of this universe. It is the cooperative creation of the sixteenfold distortions (ten sensory and motor organs, the mind and the five Tanma&#x301;tras or inferences) and the eight binding factors of Prakrti that are there as the cause and effect of His qualitative manifestations. The seeds and potentials of this universe are also inherent in them. It is for this vastness that He has been called Brahma, which means Great (Brahatva&#x301;d Brahma). Then again the One who makes another great, the One with whose thought and bearing the small unit establishes itself in the vastness, is also called Brahma (Brm&#x301;han&#x301;atva&#x301;d Brahma). When this world is within Him, then He must necessarily be greater than the world. Suppose there is a box in a room; then the room must be greater than the box. That is why there is space for the box, otherwise it could not have been accommodated. That in which this universe is implanted is naturally greater than the universe. The entire universe is pivoting around its knower, its Nucleus, in a cyclic order in the vast body of Purus&#x301;a. Revolving thus in this cycle the one who progresses towards the knowing Entity by virtue of one&#146;s spiritual force attains unity with Him, becomes one with Him. They become Brahma themselves, and that is why He has the quality of making one great.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Brahma is effulgent in white radiance. The Shruti says that Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti are indivisible and inseparable. Where Prakrti (the operative principle) is active over Purus&#x301;a, Purus&#x301;a is of white radiance. In the Ga&#x301;yattri mantra the word, &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo;, is used in the sense of white radiance, and that is why this &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo; and Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (The subjectivated Transcendentality) are inseparable. The inseparability of Brahma and His Radiance is fully substantiated by the real meaning and analysis of the word &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo;. It is trilateral, the combination of three letters, viz., &ldquo;Bha&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ra&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ga&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Generally speaking, the word, &ldquo;Bharga&rdquo; is used verily in the sense of Brahmic effulgence. Now the question arises, whether Brahma and His radiance are two different entities. If we say Ra&#x301;ma has such and such qualities or Shya&#x301;ma has such and such qualities &ndash; aren&#146;t the individuals and their qualities two absolutely separate entities? Such distinctiveness is not applicable to limitless, integral, Brahma, who is without a second. Brahma and His radiance are not two separate entities, for He is autophanous &ndash; self-luminous. Citing the instance of Ra&#x301;hu&#146;s<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> (Dragon&#146;s) head we have to say that He is characteristically radiant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This creation is triple-attributional. The game of the three attributes goes on in everything and everywhere in the universe, and they have not spared the human body. The region below the navel is dominated by Tamogun&#x301;a (Static principle), the region from navel to throat, by Rajogun&#x301;a (Mutative influence) and the region from throat to Trikuti (the junction of the two eyebrows, where the seat of the mind is located,) by Sattvagun&#x301;a (Sentient influence). Normally, a particular region in the body becomes more active in accordance with the Vrtti or epithymetic influence or the inter- and intra-ectoplasmic occupation of an individual. When a Sa&#x301;dhaka is established in his/her mental seat by virtue of his/her hearing, thinking and profound meditation, he or she being then established in Sattvagun&#x301;a (Sentient quality), realizes the Supreme Being in His Super-white glory, as is the wont of Sentient quality. When one goes beyond the mental sphere, one merges in the objectlessness of the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma in the Brahmarondhra (An aperture in the crown of the head) and thus reaches beyond the scope of colors. Bharga or white color also disappears from him. A desireless person, who worships this Supreme Purus&#x301;a absolves himself from the momenta of rebirths due to mind being objectless or desire-free. Such an individual goes beyond the cycle of ordinary birth and death. In other words, one&#146;s mental force goes beyond the stars (&#146;Shukra&#x301; means Venus, a planet) due to one&#146;s being established in the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;ma&#x301; yah ka&#x301;mayate manyama&#x301;nah<br>Sa ka&#x301;ma&#x301;bhirjja&#x301;yate tatra tatra<br>Parya&#x301;ptaka&#x301;masya krta&#x301;tmanastu<br>ihaeva sarve praviliiyanti ka&#x301;ma&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->According to human longings and desires or according to human propensive pursuit, their minds take form i.e., they will gradually acquire the like Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or reactive momenta. They first see within themselves what they aspire for and then let their minds flow towards it. Thereafter the external organs i.e., hands and feet, etc., set about achieving it. And so it is generally seen that the desires that they had been giving indulgence to throughout their lives, come hurtling over to them in a condensed form at the last hour, i.e., their mind-stuff takes the like mental form for the last time in order to shape itself into a fitting medium of the like Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Even during the life-time as well it is seen that the mind-stuff of a drunkard, which imbibes within it an indomitable desire or Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra for wine, turns into a vantage ground for undergoing the next Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or momenta of pleasure and pain. That is to say, such a person gets scent of the wine shop by the sheer propulsion of his acquired mental propensity, if he happens to go to a new and unfamiliar place. A man who has cultivated dog-like or swine-like desires all his life, dies with the same dog-like or swine-like frame of mind. Thereafter with the help of Prakrti&#146;s Mutative force he acquires the form of a dog or swine in order to undergo the dog-like or swine-like Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. The great ascetic, King Bharata, died thinking of a fawn, and that was why it is written in the Pura&#x301;n&#x301;as (Indian mythologies) that he had to take the body of a deer at his next birth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->But he who is fully satiated, i.e., he whose longings and desires have consumed themselves, obliviates even the possibility of any such thought-wave later because of the absence of any Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra. Such all-satiated persons are indeed self-purified. How can final satiety possibly come unless and until that Whole &ndash; that Supreme Spirit &ndash; is achieved? Hence he who has attained full satiety has indeed reduced all his Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras to nothingness right here in this world and so he has gone beyond the cycle of life and death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->From the inanimate to the animate goes the process of evolution. Take a piece of stone for instance. It has neither the power of action nor the sensation of mind. What is the reason? It is because hitherto there has been no manifestation of mind in the stone at all. Thought-wave or sensation can take place or an action can take a form only if there is a mind. Take, for instance, trees and plants which are more animate than stones. There are activities in them. They grow, draw the vital juice from the earth, maintain their species by creating seeds in their own bodies and enjoy and suffer pleasure and pain, when taken care of or smitten. We see in them the manifestation of consciousness or animation, for the mind has awakened in them. Thus progressing on the path of psychogenesis or mental development we see in humans the greatest manifestation. Just as during the Cosmic thought-process the evolution takes place from the subtle to the crude, similarly the unit retroverts step by step from the crude to the subtle, towards the same Absolute Consciousness from where it had come. It is just like the waves of the sea rippling back from the shore to the ocean from where they had originally come. Now, just how much should a person strive on his return journey? He has got to be alert, so that he may easily end the journey in his characteristic Self. Then alone shall we call him self-purified. Then alone shall he become saturated with Brahma, within and without.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->To become self-purified one has got to make some effort &ndash; this effort is what is known as Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The greatest Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is that which comprises three aspects viz., devotion, action and cognition. Medium Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is that which comprises two aspects i.e., devotion and action, and the inferior Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is that which consists of only tall talk (cognition or knowledge cannot exist singly without action and devotion &ndash; whatever may exist will be merely the debris of knowledge). The ability of a Sa&#x301;dhaka cannot be based on his common or worldly knowledge alone. It can only stand on the firm base of his knowledge, devotion and action (Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, Bhakti and Karma). By firmness I mean unflinching intensity of zeal and earnestness. By just saying that Rasagolla&#x301; is sweet, one cannot get the taste of a Rasagolla&#x301; (a spongy and juicy sweetmeat). One has got to make some efforts to obtain it and eat it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->By tall talks alone one cannot achieve Brahma. An almanac forecasts that there will be so much rain this year. But mere knowledge of such a forecast will not save the crops of a farmer. No amount of squeezing the almanac will produce even a drop of water. One has got to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to habituate one&#146;s mind to Brhamaward projection in order to attain Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->If a person, without Anubhu&#x301;ti or intuitional susceptibility, studies scriptures a million times or lectures on Brahma, his Brahma will ever remain a bookish Brahma, not the Brahma of one&#146;s conception or realization. Just as one seeing in water the reflection of fruit dangling overhead from the branch of a tree cannot taste the fruit, similarly an erudite scholar, versed in the six philosophies, will remain far away from Brahma if one refrains from Brahma-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. No matter how vastly learned you may become in worldly knowledge, without Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; you can know nothing about Brahma, for along with your knowledge of these lores, a vanity of knowledge will also grow in you. With this result, you will go on enhancing the volume of your burden unnecessarily by habitually giving importance to your small ego. This burden becomes the cause of your sufferings and enjoyments, not of your salvation. A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Sham&#x301;kar said:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->You will come across many such people who do not practice spiritual meditation themselves but will run after great spiritual men in order to hear their sermons. These people are totally wrong. Only running after great men will be of no avail. A person has got to establish himself in the path of realization of Brahma by doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; himself. God does not bestow His mercy upon anybody after seeing how great a speaker he is or how many books he has read. Only one who has devotion can exact His mercy. The great devotee, Mahars&#x301;i Na&#x301;rada said.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->That is, Brahma can be realized by achieving even a tiny bit of God&#146;s grace or that of a great person. Take a very intelligent boy for instance. If his teacher does not teach him how to read and write, he will not be able to become a great scholar in spite of having the potential for becoming one. Similarly, all persons have the ability or potentiality of achieving spiritual development or of establishing themselves in the Brahmic stance, but for want of a worthy guide it cannot take practical shape. That is why a spiritual Preceptor or Sadguru is necessary &ndash; his grace is indispensable. His grace is but God&#146;s grace, for God is the ocean of grace.<!-- /block --></p>

Indifference to mundane duties or flying above the world with a resolute detachment is but a mental disease. Those who want to give themselves up to divine contemplation in the cave of the Himalayas, leaving their homes, are misguided. The word, Sannya&#x301;sa, means to dedicate oneself for the attainment of God. When Brahma is everything, whatever you are, you must behave properly with everything around you. Hence to be callous about family and society is completely contrary to Brahma Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (Divine Contemplation). One cannot know Brahma through showy, superficial knowledge. You can only attain Brahma, when your knowledge has become strong and powerful through austere devotion to Truth. Only the soul of the one whose knowledge is identified with austerity, enters the abode of Brahma. Ultimately the united qualities of sedateness, mental and spiritual force, firmness, devotion to Truth, knowledge, the proper use of mundane things etc. will certainly enable a Sa&#x301;dhaka to attain unity with Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The word &ldquo;Rs&#x301;i&rdquo;, means a Sa&#x301;dhaka who has cultivated Brahma within himself. So long as a Sa&#x301;dhaka does not attain Brahma, there exists in him a feeling of incompleteness. Suppose you want a thousand rupees. If you are given a thousand rupees, will you be contented? No, you will then ask for more. Such is the characteristic of human mind. Man has a limitless thirst. He keeps on harping ceaselessly, &ldquo;I am hungry.&rdquo; The hunger for a thousand will change into hunger for a lakh, and hunger for a lakh will make room for hunger for a crore. Thus the amount of hunger goes on increasing until a limitless amount of money is attained. This limitlessness is inherent in Brahma, and so your hunger can be satiated in Brahma alone. Hence when a &ldquo;Rs&#x301;i&rdquo; attains complete self-control (krta&#x301;tman), he goes beyond the sphere of attachment and detachment, and attains full realization of his characteristic Self. He becomes imperturbably tranquil, i.e. he reaches the stage which lies beyond the momentum of rebirth or regeneration. Attachment and repulsion exist so long as the proclivities of fascination and contempt exist. For instance, a puritanical sa&#x301;dhaka will consider wine as an object of disdain and will regard touching it as an act of impiety. A wine addict, however, regarding it as an object of greed, will run after it with total disregard for all social conventions and norms. But he who has become really desireless as the result of self-realization, will keep himself above these two. He will take wine as medicine under medical advice, otherwise he will carefully keep it away from the sight of people. He will have neither attachment nor aversion for the wine.<!-- /block --></p>

Brahma is the combined name of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti.

But when Prakrti is inactive, i.e., when Purus&#x301;a is predominant, in that case the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra&#x301; sound also stops. By a slight transposition of A. U. Ma the three constituent letters of the ideogram ([DEVANAGARI CHARACTER] or On&#x32D;m&#x301;), i.e., placing, &ldquo;A&rdquo; at the end, we get the word UMA&#x301;. That is why Umapati (Pati means husband) means Purus&#x301;a. Brahma, in conjucation with Prakrti, is the cause of creation. In a particular content He may also be called Iisvara, means Controller Brahma is the controller of the organs and their gods directly and indirectly. His cognitive eyes are not two but three, i.e., He is the seer of all the three &ndash; past, present and future.

His throat is not limited and demarcated like that of a unit. The entire creation is within Him. His depth is unfathomable and hence He is calm and tranquil. Reaching the original cause of all elements by virtue of their meditation and ideation the sages eventually attained the very Brahma Himself. His place is above all extroversive forces.

It is because of His possessing the inexhaustible power of destruction that He is known as Ka&#x301;la&#x301;gni or the fire of destruction. He is called the moon, for He is shining in the Hrdaya&#x301;ka&#x301;sha or the firmament of the heart as the great and noble Intellect. Briefly speaking, all that you can think of concerning the worlds are within Him. He is the seed of all the Tanma&#x301;tras, i.e., the generic essences of physical elements like sound, touch, form, taste and smell. The germ or sprout is verily His expression.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn1">1</a></b>) Ra&#x301;hu being the head itself. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn2">2</a></b>)  Of the countless number of veins or tubular organs of the human body, thirty-three are most important. The controlling entities of these thirty-three veins or tubes are called thirty-three gods, vid, eleven Rudras, eight Vasus, twelve Adityas, Indra and Praja&#x301;pati. The Chief manifestation of the Cosmic Force is called Indra, which controls the human body entirely.<br> <br> (a) The eleven rudras: Ten organs (sensory and motor) and the mind. &ldquo;Rudra&rdquo; means that which makes one cry. At the time of death when all the organs merge into their corresponding counter-gods, the mind becomes inactive and the human body becomes still and immobile. Due to this near and dear ones of the dead person cry piteously. These eleven gods make the human cry, and hence they are called Rudras. <br> (b) The eight vasus: Vasu means the habitat of the units; that is to say, those that are receptacles, shelters, or objects of the organs are called Vasu. The sun, the moon, the stars, the sky, the ether, the air, the fire and the earth are the eight Vasus. <br> (c) The twelve A&#x301;dityas: A&#x301;ditya means Collector. Here it means that all those which takes or take away the consequences of deeds and life. Every moment the duration of life is being reduced, and the unit is being compelled to undergo the process of metamorphosis in order to enjoy or endure the consequences of his deeds. All these are taking place through the passage of time. Hence time is A&#x301;ditya, for it takes away the life and the consequential moments of deeds. The twelve months are the twelve A&#x301;dityas. <br> (d) Indra: Indra means lightning, thunder or actional force. <br> (e) Praja&#x301;pati: Praja&#x301;pati means Yajin&#x32D;a (sacrifice) or action.<br> <br> Some are of the opinion that the veins of the human body are uncountable. Others say that they are a few crores, as if they had counted them all. Many people say that the number of veins totals thirty three crores and so the gods are also of the same number. Truly speaking it is due to ignorance and blind faith that the controlling nerves and veins of the human body have been converted into thirty-three crores of gods, having so many different names and forms. Sham&#x301;kara said in reference to gods &ndash;<br> <br> &ldquo;Sarvadyotana&#x301;tmaka akhan&#x301;dacidaekarasah.&rdquo;<br> <br> Ya&#x301;jin&#x32D;avalkya said &ndash;<br> <br> Dyotate kriidate yasma&#x301;dudyate dyotate divi<br> Tasma&#x301;ddeva iti proktah stu&#x301;yate sarvadevataeh.<br> <br> The gods are of two kinds &ndash; (1) Daehik Devata&#x301; (the physical gods). The manifestation of soul is accomplished through the organs, and so the organs are called Daehik Devata&#x301; and (2) Brahmik Devata&#x301; (Cosmic gods through whom the whole universe is manifested and controlled). Both are thirty-three in number. Each of the Cosmic gods is the counter-god of the respective physical gods. These physical gods get merged into the counter-gods, which again merge in Brahma, and that is why the liberated Sa&#x301;dhaka becomes Brahma Himself.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn3">3</a></b>)  Author&#146;s footnote on the other two meanings of kula omitted here. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn4">4</a></b>)  It is the Supreme Brahma Who is the creator of the universe and to create is also an act. Where there is action, there is sound. The pran&#x301;ava or On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is indeed the sound of the creative thought-process of the Supreme Spirit and he who has merged himself in Brahma due to the absence of Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra or reactive momentum, has attained a position even above Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Maheshvara. <br> Of the three letters (A, U, Ma) of the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra &ldquo;A&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x0985;</span>) is the seed of creations, &ldquo;U&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x0989;</span>) is the seed of stability or preservation and &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; (<span class=Bengali>&#x09AE;</span>) is the seed of destruction. &ldquo;A&rdquo; being the creative alphabet, Brahma is called Brahma&#x301; (Brahma + a) in reference to creation. Suppose a man&#146;s name is Ra&#x301;mbabu. His son will call him &ldquo;father&rdquo; and his pupil will call him &ldquo;sir&rdquo;; these are but the titles of Ra&#x301;mbabu applied to his specific occupational conditions, Actually Ra&#x301;mbabu is one, Sagun&#x301;a&#x301; Brahma imbibes three chief acts, viz., creation, preservation and destruction. These acts of creation, preservation and destruction are taking place in the psychic sphere of Brahma. With the termination of its thought process all the manifestations of these three kinds of acts will also cease. For instance, when we think of Bhagalpur, a clear picture of Bhagalpur gets projected on our mental plate and when we give up the thought of Bhagalpur, the picture of Bhagalpur gets lost in that very mental plate. If afterwards we cease to think at all, the mind also loses its existence. So Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Mahesh are the nomenclatures of the different psychic acts of Brahma Himself. When a Sa&#x301;dhaka, having gone beyond the mental stratum, gets ensconced in the immutable, pure Brahmic region, he certainly enjoys greater importance or superiority over these three gods. That state is the characteristic state of the unit &ndash; the supreme state of Shiva or Cosmic Transcendentality. Asked to reveal his identity, Lord Sam&#x301;kara&#x301;car&#x301;ya said &ndash;<br> <br> Manobuddhyaham&#x301;ka&#x301;ro cittani na&#x301;ham<br> Na ca shrotrajihave na ca ghra&#x301;n&#x301;a netre<br> Na&#x301;vyoma bhu&#x301;mirna tejo na va&#x301;yuh<br> Cida&#x301;nandaru&#x301;po&#146;shivo&#146;ham&#x301; shivo ham.<br> <br> That is,<br> <br> Not mind nor I-feeling nor ego am I<br> Nor ear nor tongue nor nose nor eye<br> Nor air nor earth nor sun nor sky<br> The Soul Eternal am I, am I.</p>

<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Matter or object is indispensable for the existence of the mind, for mind thrives on matter. Mind exists only as long as it is concerned with matter. As soon as it becomes objectless it dies. The unit mind accepts the unit objects around it as its objective or livelihood with the help of the organs. The unit entity cannot conceive any integral, infinite object in its mind. Brahma alone is integral, and other objects are but fractions of Him and can be brought within the jurisdiction of the mind. Take the Himalayas Mountain range for instance. The mind finds it difficult indeed to comprehend it straightway; although vast, but it is not limited, also only a part, and so it can be brought within the mental compass easily through the medium of a map. But we cannot draw a map or picture of the integral entity, Brahma. We cannot bind Him to an image from the ten directions. That is why the scriptures say, &ldquo;Na tasya pratima&#x301; asti&rdquo; i.e., He has no image. Mind cannot apprehend this integral Brahma, for every object that is encompassed by the mind is demarcable from the ten sides. To demarcate Brahma would be totally antagonistic to the concept of limitlessness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If holding or apprehending Brahma is beyond the capacity of the mind, how then can man attain Him? When, through spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the mind is gradually transformed from crude to subtle and goes on advancing on the path of withdrawal, it (the unit mind) gradually goes on surrendering itself unawares to it Hiran&#x301;yagarbha or subtle Cosmic mind. And when this self-surrender reaches its apex, the unit mind, i.e., the sense of Ra&#x301;ma, Shya&#x301;ma jadu, Madhu etc. meets its waterloo. What remains then is only the Supreme Mind of that Supreme Purus&#x301;a. This state is called Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi or determinate concentration of the mind. So we see that the first and last word of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice is total surrender of the unit mind to the Supreme Mind. Similarly when the unit mind has been dedicated to the Supreme Consciousness, and as the result of this there remains only an objectless unity, the Lord of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, this state is called Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi i.e., supersensual or total suspension of the mind. The first and last word of this Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; also is total surrender. To the unit mind Brahma is unthinkable,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->He is unimaginable, for He is beyond the sphere of imagination. Not only is he unimaginable He is also unmanifest because He is inapprehensible to the sense organs through sound, touch, form, taste, smell etc. Any object, having the above five qualities like sound, touch etc., no matter how huge it is apprehensible by the sense-organs. He is formless, as we cannot give a form to infinity. But then, is not this perceptible world His form? Yes, it is, but these countless forms of this observable world are but His psychic manifestations. Only unit entities are evolved in the sphere of His mind as the objects of the unit minds, whereas countless and endless, big and small unit entities are being created and recreated in the imagination of Brahma the possessor of the infinite mind.  Apparently they are His &ldquo;form&rdquo; in this observable world. But none of these forms of His psychic flow &ndash; none of these bubbles that are originating, rising and bursting are the ultimate entities. They are all progressing through spatial, temporal and personal changes with a view to merging in that Supreme Bearing, the Nucleus of the Thought-Cycle. That is why none of these mundane manifestations of Brahma can be taken to be permanent and held on to as such. No matter how charming or captivating a form of His may be, one day it must take its leave from us must go away to some unseeable region in response to the beckoning call of time, leaving us behind to rue and wail in profuse tears. So none of His unit forms can give us any perennial peace or real, abiding happiness. That is why a Sa&#x301;dhaka is taken aback at the sight of the infinite, manifest form of form of the infinite of the Infinite Brahma. Shrii Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; said &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->He is the selfsame Shiva. The word, Shiva, means Purus&#x301;a. It is also used in the sense of benevolence. Here &ldquo;Shiva&rdquo; is used in the latter sense, for his psychic manifestations. The evolved objects, are all employed for the good alone and so. He is Shiva, He is benevolent, He is the image of benevolence. Does He punish us to afflict us with pain and suffering? No, there too, His benevolent wishes abide. It is for the rectification of our character, that the benevolent penal dispensation is there. He is perfectly free from the stigma or darkness of Avidya&#x301;, etc. Hence He is perfectly in peace &ndash; in absolute tranquillity. The Avidya&#x301;-like gale creates stormy waves in the sea of the mind, destroying its equipoise and tranquillity. In the sea of Brahma shocks and clashes of Avidya&#x301; (forces of microcosmic distraction) or (distracting forces which act upon the microcosm) do not exist and so there is no wave at all. The more the Avidya&#x301; evolved ego, the greater the agitation of the waves &ndash; the greater the shallowness of its knowledge. One can observe that a Kanya&#x301;kuma&#x301;rii, on one side there are the surging waves of the Shallow Bay of Bengal and the calm serenity of the very deep Arabian Sea on the other, He is deathless and free from distortion mutation. Distortion cannot take place in an object, unless there is the influence of a second object or of an outside agency upon it. If you want to transform milk into curd you will have to mix some thing sour into it.  As nothing exists outside of Him, He precludes the possibility of being distorted by any outer influence or agency.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->He is the original Cause of everything, for He has been creating the world in His mind by virtue of His imagination. He has neither beginning, nor middle, nor end, for He is indeterminate and infinite. If He had a beginning, it would not be possible to call Him endless and infinite. For one that has neither a starting-point nor a last point there cannot be a middle point. If he possessed those three aspects, there would have been a possibility of something else existing &ndash; a second entity beside Him, and such entities could have either existed before or after His point of origin. In such an event it would have been possible to apprehend Him through the mind and the organs, for in that case He would have been a mere entity made up of the five elements. If we consider an image to be God, then behind the pedestal, under His feet and habare the crown on his head, must some other entities exist. To call such an image beginningless and limitless is rank madness, for we can see both its first and last points and can also apprehend it by our minds, as well as by our organs. This is because it made of the quinquelemental ingredients like earth, stone, metal etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->As everything is within His psychic body so He is the real Supreme Controller of everything. He is Consciousness &ndash; Bliss Absolute. All mental feelings are either pleasant or painful. When the mind remains associated with any object for a long time we call that state &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; and when it is repulsed by any absent (while is characteristically inimical) for long, we call such a state sorrow. When the mind is neither concerned with the feeling of happiness nor with that of sorrow, it ceases to exist. In such a state here remains only an objectless soul, when the soul revels in the happiness of the soul.  That is why He is the self-same Consciousness &ndash; the Bliss Absolute &ndash; the ever-blissful Spirit.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The word, aran&#x301;i, means mantra-sanctified wood used for sacrificial fires, by the friction of which people of olden days used to produce fire. The main wood was known as Aran&#x301;i and the striking wood by which the friction was to be accomplished was called Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i. A&#x301;ran&#x301;i used to grow in the forest, the place of meditation for the Rs&#x301;is of those days. Metaphorically, one is advised to use one&#146;s soul as the Aran&#x301;i or [[main wood]]. But to light up the Brahmic fire it is necessary to have Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i or the striking flint for friction. Here the Uttara&#x301;ran&#x301;i is the Pran&#x301;ava or On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. The roots pra plus nu plus al make the word, Pran&#x301;ava. The root, &ldquo;Nu&rdquo; means to worship.

<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->If Brahma is one and without a second (Ekameva advitiiyam), then why is there the distortion in Him? This question is quite natural and its answer is also very easy. Distortion comes on account of the Prakrti, the Operative Principle, and this distortion takes place within the Body of Brahma, not outside It. Hence on final scrutiny His oneness remains unassailed. The unit beings that have been in possession of the Cosmic Mind in part and that have been progressing within It, are also conscious of their smallness and this very sense of smallness is their individuality &ndash; unit-hood. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice means an effort to break through the barrier of this smallness, and Siddhi or beatitude is the state, wherein the barrier has been broken through. Under the influence of Prakrti there exist three conditions or states between the small conscious unit and the unfathomably great Brahma. These three conditions are wakefulness, dream and sleep. None of these three are permanent, for they are evolved by the influence of Prakrti&#146;s three gun&#x301;as or attributes, viz., Sattva (Sentient, Rajah (Mutative) and Tamah (Static). In all these three conditions macrocosm and microcosm remain apparently separate. But the influence of Prakrti being absent in the fourth condition, which is known as Turiiya (the state of non-duality) or Kaevalya (absolute identity with the divine essence), there remains no distinction between Brahma and the unit. Both are one consummate Whole, Wakefulness, dream and sleep &ndash; these three conditions feature in the game of evolution. It is to these three attributes, viz., Sattva (Sentient), Rajah (Mutative) and Tamah (Static) that Prakrti owes her creation. When the influence of Sattvogun&#x301;a (sentient attribute) is greater on Purus&#x301;a, He is called Ks&#x301;iira&#x301;vdhi or Ks&#x301;iirasamudra&#x301; or the Sea of Milk. The comparative condition in the unit is called the wakeful state. People generally think that Knowingness only exists in the awakened state. It is not correct. Knowingness does also exist during dream and sleep. I shall clarify this point for you later.<!-- /block --></p>

This Aks&#x301;ara remains intermingled with Ks&#x301;ara. The part of Brahma, which is neither Ks&#x301;ara nor Aks&#x301;ara and which bodily exists as the nucleus or the central point or sovereign point of the Cosmic System, is the Controller of both the knowable (Ks&#x301;ara) and the knower, (Aks&#x301;ara).

<a name="2..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Why are the unit entities more vulnerable to Avidya&#x301; (Force of Microcosmic Distraction) during the wakeful state? Because within their minds there are eight fetters and six passions, which are ever susceptible to the captivating charms and deceitful superficialities of the external world. Every mental action of his is vulnerable to both internal and external influences. Under the influence of the passions and fetters of their minds he races towards objects related to the body like, women, food, drinks etc., thinking them to be the objects of self-gratification. The Sa&#x301;dhakas (spiritual aspirants) have to scrupulously guard themselves against the glamour of these external baits. They have to be self-controlled. But will self-control be possible unless it becomes firmly established within their minds? It is certainly not possible by becoming a hypocritical Sa&#x301;dhu, tramping about with a smear of ashes on the body and a Kaman&#x301;da&#x301;lu (bowl) in hand. Without going in for the external paraphernalia and formalities one has to prepare oneself internally, maintaining the balance between the internal and the external? One has to remain alert so that the external environment will not be detrimental to one&#146;s purity of mind. A high-thinking man may meet his downfall within a short time, if he continually associates himself with bad company. Hence it is necessary to maintain a balance between internal and external expressions. Although bodily pleasures are perceived by the mind in the wakeful state, the objects of such pleasures always come from without, with the result that the privations of the external world will always stand in the way of real happiness, as the external world cannot always supply objects in accordance with the desires and wishes of the mind. Due to this the mind has to run up and down in search of them. It becomes very agitated in the process and peace becomes and impossibility. The influence of the external world is absent during the dreamful state, accordingly the amount of pleasure is due to want of efferent desires in the mind or increased organs (for that matter here the desire is not afferent either). In the state of sleep, as the internal activities of the mind are substantially less, the amount of happiness (Static happiness) is proportionately increased.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->I have already said that the unit can perceive more pleasure or pain during his dreamful state, for in that state there is no possibility of a clash between efferent desires and the external world. Normally, even during the dreamful state the unit keeps themselves aloof from Brahma, for there remain dual sentiments of the perceiver and the perceivable. The difference in the dreamful state as distinguished from the wakeful state is that during this state none of the perceivable objects are taken from the external quinquelemental world. Whatever perceived are all self-conceived. Ordinarily we are acquainted with three aspects of the mind, conscious mind, subconscious mind and unconscious mind, that are generally called Cetana mana, Avacetana mana and Acetana mana, the respective proper terms of which should be Ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a, Manomaya kos&#x301;a and Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a mana. All the three conditions being in the right order during the wakeful state, the imagined objects do not appear to be true during imagination (as is the went of the subtle or sub-conscious mind), for the unit can very well understand that the actions of the sub-conscious mind are all simply imaginary. For influenced it&#146;s by the conscious mind, the perceiver of the perceivable quinquelemental objects with the help of the organs. But during the dreamful state the crude or conscious mind lies quiescent and the relation of the unit being with the external world is disrupted. At that time the imaginary, perceivable objects appear to be real. That is why it is said that during the dreamful state the unit being becomes the perceiver of imaginary pleasure and pain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Can a dream ever be true?&rdquo; Such question arises in the minds of many. What the unit entities imagines or do during the wakeful state are recorded in their subconscious minds. In any condition, when concerned with similar sentiments acts or things, the unit being determines the character or shape of the subsequent things, acts or sentiments in the light of the recurrence of his previous acts. In the absence of any comparison with already perceived objects, the unit is unable to recognize subsequent objects. Where there is negligible difficulty in comparing things, then people think within themselves: &ldquo;Yes, this thing appears to be similar to that thing to some extent &ndash; perhaps this may be the changed form of that&rdquo; &ndash; thus they come to recognize an entity. In the language of psychology this is called consciousness of identity. For example, suppose we had once seen a boy of 12 or 13. He had was merely a lad at the time. Now we come to see him after twelve years, as a fully developed youth. A great change has come about in his form and features. Still in most cases we can recognize him with a little difficulty. We come to the conclusion within ourselves that that very boy of 12 may now look like this. We call it pratyabhijin&#x32D;a&#x301; or consciousness of identity. But if the difference between the two forms be very great, Pratyabhijin&#x32D;a&#x301; does not occur. So we can see that the accumulated experiences of the subconscious mind help us a great deal in our daily lives. The non-recurrence of these enlightening vibrations would have created great difficulties in this common world as well as in the world of imagination, had they not expressed themselves according to necessity. In sleep if the flatulent gas moves upwards on account of stomach trouble or if there is some nervous disturbance, the brain and the sub-conscious mind will become agitated. Our previously imagined or felt objects reappear in our subconscious mind in a disjointed form. This we call a dream. Obviously such a dream is of no consequence. Not only that, the story formed therein will not be well-knit as it consists of merely the re-appearance of the objects, stored in the different parts of the brain.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->There is yet another type of dream. The Atima&#x301;nas kos&#x301;a (supramental mind) is the store-house of all knowledge. At times a premonition of a coming be great happiness or sorrow, which only the omniscient causal frame can visualize, is created during deep slumber in the subconscious mind of an individual, who is deeply concerned with that particular happiness or sorrow. Such dreams do not take place very often. Nevertheless such a dream does carry the prognosis of a true event.<!-- /block --></p>

The inordinate unconscious mind in spite of its being the receptacle of all knowledge cannot be the knower of any object due to its being surrounded by darkness. Whatever be the reasons behind it, in spite of being objectivated, it is unable to maintain its objectivity (objectivity) and so it remains in a particular stance of satiation &ndash; in a particular state of happiness. In spite of a person&#146;s heart being rent asunder by hundreds of shocks, sorrows and insults he or she forgets everything during sleep and lapse into a condition of ease and comfort.  Such comfort or happiness is static born our of ignorance. Sleep is devoid of all feelings.

The crescent-like mark between the point signifying Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma and the letter &ldquo;on&#x32D;m&rdquo; signifying Sagun&#x301;a Brahma represents the manifest culmination of the expressed form of the unmanifest Prakrti (the Operative Principle).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->The witnessing counterpart of the wakeful state of unit entities, is Vishva (a philosophic word meaning causal unit mind) or Subjectivated Purus&#x301;a. The proper enjoyment of objects through the sense organs is possible only in a wakeful state. So the Purus&#x301;a of this state is called Subjectivated Purus&#x301;a. Similarly in reference to the microcosm, the Purus&#x301;a, of the dream state is called Taejasa or subtle unit mind; and that of the state of sleep is called Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a or spiritually dormant cognition. The Purus&#x301;a subjective of Ksiira&#x301;vdhi, Garbhodaka and Ka&#x301;rn&#x301;arnava is respectively called Vira&#x301;t&#x301;a (causal Cosmic Mind). Hiran&#x301;yagarbha (subtle Cosmic mind) and Iishvara (Crude Cosmic Mind). Hence we find that &ldquo;A&rdquo; is the seed or primary cause of Vishya or Vir&#x301;a&#x301;ta; &ldquo;U,&rdquo; Taejasa and Hiran&#x301;yagarbha; and &ldquo;M,&rdquo; of Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a and Iishvara. In the state of non-duality (Tu&#x301;riiya) there is no distinction between the unit entity and the supreme entity, for the I-feeling is absolutely nil; and so there is no seed or acoustic expression of this state. The seed or acoustic expression is the cause of origination; and so where there is no question of origination or non-origination, creation, preservation or destruction, the question of seed also does not arise. The knower, known and knowledge, the contemplator, contemplated and contemplation &ndash; all become one in the state of Turiiya. Hence that supreme state of final beatitude which is denoted by the Sonic Dot, is called Iishvaragra&#x301;sa &ndash; that state in which even Ishvara or the Lord of the universe is devoured. Here the three purus&#x301;a also merge in the Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma or the supreme Non-attributional Entity. Hence it is absolutely correct to call it Iishvaragra&#x301;sa.<!-- /block --></p>

When a spiritual aspirant destroys the three Purus&#x301;a by constant spiritual practices and deep analyses, and churns the cream of knowledge, there remains no distinction whatsoever between Brahma and the unit beings; this is the state of Turiiya or non-duality.

<a name="2..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->This world is indeed a Macrocosmic conation. The vital energy or vital air begotten, or the union and disunion of the five fundamental factors active in the microcosmic body, are but the products of His own imagination. At the embryonic stage, human beings derive vital energy from the bodies of their parents and from their mother&#146;s food and drink delivered from the five fundamental factors. Then after birth, they receive vital energy directly from their own food, drink, air, light etc. Hence the source of the life of unit beings lies in Brahma. He is the Life of the life of the microcosms. (The word Pra&#x301;na&#x301; or life, when used in singular number, means functional energy, and when used in plural, means vital energy). The quinquelemental manifestation is the crudest expression of His psychic action and so the microcosms have to draw vital energy from the quinquelemental world. Vital energy is generated in the unit body through the media of five internal and five external Vayus (airs). Of the five internal Vayus, viz., Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, Apa&#x301;na, Sama&#x301;na, Ud&#x301;ana and Vya&#x301;na, the Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, situated between the navel and the throat controls the functions of lungs, heart etc.; the Apa&#x301;na, situated below the navel (i.e., between the navel and the anus) controls the excretion of stool, urine etc.; the Sama&#x301;na&#x301;, situated within the navel, maintains the equilibrium between Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a and Apa&#x301;na; the Uda&#x301;na, situated in the throat, controls the vocal cord (power of speech) and the Vya&#x301;na, permeating the entire body, controls the circulation of the blood, vital secretions etc., and, with the help of the nerve fibres brings the sensory and motor organs into contact with the knowable i.e. the objects to mentally dealt with. The vibration necessary for the faculty of contemplation is also supplied by Vya&#x301;na Va&#x301;yu. The five external airs, viz., Na&#x301;ga, Ku&#x301;rma, Krkara, Devadatta and Dhanain&#x32D;jaya, control expansion and contraction, yawning and hiccup, hunger and thirst, sleep and drowsiness. Hence it is clear that it is with the help of the Va&#x301;yus by created Parama Purus&#x301;a, living beings derive their mind-stuff from the Cosmic Mind. The Indriyas find their expression when the Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a comes into contact with the mind. Ether, air, fire, water and earth are all created and sustained in the Cosmic Mind. That is these five factors, the psychic creation of Brahma, are preserving the existence of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The significant part of this above mantra is that words of neuter gender have been used for Brahma instead of words of masculine or feminine gender. In fact, the Entity or that which has neither beginning nor end and is devoid of any form, can hardly be called masculine or feminine. He is the Life of all lives, the Soul of all souls, and that is why He is Param&#x301;a&#x301;tma&#x301; or the Supreme cognition. The finite objects require a shelter, a base. Only the Infinite does not requite a base. All the finite objects of the universe are but the unit-manifestations of this Brahma. They are all sheltered in Him. All of them are the objects of His imagination. Inconceivably vast as His fundamental intellect is His existence-cum-cognitive Entity. It radiates as the Knowing Entity through His mind-begotten, subtler than the subtle, smaller than the small unit objects also. The One that abides in the unit entities as the Knower, also abides thus in the vast cosmos. Actually the faculty of His Knowership does not undergo any change. The change appears only in the receptacles because we see Him differently, because we imagine Him to be a separate Entity, abiding in separate receptacles. A Sa&#x301;dhaka, however, knows that by knowing One&#146;s own self, one can know the Supreme self, for they are essentially one. Shrii Ra&#x301;makrs&#x301;n&#x301;a Paramhamsa once said that if Sa&#x301;dhakas can know themselves, they can also know the Supreme Consciousness. The great seer of Truth, Rabindranath, expressed this idea in one of his beautiful poems. &ndash;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Every unit object is subject to the law of causation, every action is the object of the mind. The cause of the mind, functioning within a unit entity is embedded in the Cosmic Mind. It is not only a creation of the Cosmic Mind, it is its object as well. The Cosmic Mind has no cause, for no other active entity ever existed before the Cosmic Mind came into being. To look for an answer to the question as to why and how the Cosmic Mind came into being, will involve the fallacy of infinite regress, for no one can claim to have witnessed the origin of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. At that time nothing existed which we would call &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and so there was also no existence of the relative factors like Time, Space and Person. To investigate the time of His origin involves the necessity of the existence of a being endowed with a mind at that time. It is because His origin, existence and extinction are beyond the scope of mind, as well as of time, space and person, that He is called eternal. The intuitional science is beyond the realm of causality. Nothing exists outside Brahma and so nothing can be the cause or primal form of Brahma, for the transmuted form of the cause is called action. Milk is the cause of curd, for it is the primal or former state of curd. As nothing is outside Brahma, so nothing can be the cause of any subsequent action. The change in an object takes place out of contraction and expansion and for this contraction and expansion the influence of a second entity upon that particular object is necessary. Thus Brahma is unchangeable &ndash; the only Truth. As long as the mind exists, the law of causation will also exist, thus people say:<!-- /block --></p>

All these immutable objects are created, preserved and destroyed within Him. That is why the Rs&#x301;i (sage) has said, &ldquo;He is you and you are He.&rdquo; The objects, which undergo metamorphosis are all made of the five fundamental factors &ndash; ether, air, fire, water and earth, which must be present in some form or another; and they remain in one or another of the three conditions &ndash; wakefulness, dream and sleep.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->Objects which are made out of the combination of the five factors are called Prapain&#x32D;ca. The differences in the forms of objects occur due to the momenta of the Cosmic thought process, and proceed from the subtle to the crude (Sain&#x32D;cara or the process of Extroversion) and then retrace their path, from the crude back to the subtle (Pratisain&#x32D;cara or the process of Introversion). That is why they are perishable, for any of their forms is dependent on the three factors of time, space and person. Their manifestative, active and inert states are all respectively ensconced in the states of wakefulness, dream and sleep of microcosms. But what is the source of their different kinds of expressions? What are their main ingredients? They all originate from the Supreme self, the Supreme Subjectivity, that limitless centre of energy of the ego. So in spiritual terms all these states of wakefulness, dream and sleep, as well as this quinquelemental world, are all I. Those who have understood the real meaning of this &ldquo;I&rdquo;-ness, do not consider anything to be a bondage, nor are they afraid of anything.<!-- /block --></p>

Each of them is unique in its own individual glory. Each of them, manifesting my grandeur differently, is rushing in various speeds towards formlessness from the world of forms.

This stage we call Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi. In this the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s microcosmic ego merges in the Cosmic Ego completely and totally. The difference between this state and the state of Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi, is that in Nirvikalpa no I-feeling, whether small or great, exists at all; everything is lost in the integral Consciousness. Since external awareness is absent during Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi, the sense of duality does not exist in the sa&#x301;dhaka. For those who are established in introspective trance the objects which are visualized internally appear to be indistinguishable from their own ego. Onlookers cannot comprehend such a state as this. Some ridicule such sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s, some call them crazy or mad.

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->During the last Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (Spiritual Congregation) I told you something about the cosmological system. There I also explained the Cosmological system, vis-a-vis solar, earth and atomic systems. The sun is the nucleus of the solar system. The different planets, such as earth born out of the sun, are revolving around the sun as their nucleus. They are neither approaching the sun by coming close to it, nor are they moving away from it, for their centrifugal and centripetal forces are on the whole in an equipoised state. If this equipoise is lost, the planet or planets will either merge in the sun due to the intensity of their centripetal force or gradually recede from it due to their centrifugal force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Similarly the nucleus of the earth-system is the earth. The moon is revolving round the earth as its nucleus. Here, too, the centrifugal and centripetal forces are functioning with equal intensity. In the same way the electrons are moving around he nucleus of the atomic system. There, too, the same play is going on the same system is working.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->By cosmological system we mean this vast universe, whose nucleus is the Aks&#x301;ara or the immutable Purus&#x301;a as the witness, around whom are revolving His psychic objects like the sun, the stars, etc., in His imaginative flow. Here too the centrifugal and centripetal forces are maintaining equilibrium. This balanced state of the forces is what we call Prakrti. To the cosmic system the centrifugal force which is dominated by the static principle (Tamagun&#x301;a) is known as Avidya&#x301; and the centripetal force dominated by the sentient principle (Sattvagun&#x301;a) is called Vidya&#x301;. When these objects, revolving around the nucleus, were initially created out of the nucleus, there must have been the predominance of the centrifugal force, and in the evolutionary process the static principle must have been dominant. Then again, when its created objects rush in intense yearning towards it with lightning speed, defying all hostile forces, surely at that time the equipoise of forces is lacking. Just as the meteor races down to the surface of the earth, similarly the unit object also races towards, and merges in, that Macrocosmic nucleus, leaving its own orbit in the Cosmic System. Certainly this movement towards the Cosmic Consciousness is dominated by the centripetal force: Hence the path of liberation is the path of the Sentient Principle (Sattvagun&#x301;a). Why do we call it the path of liberation? It is because after the merger with its nucleus, an entity&#146;s individuality ceases to exist. After the earth merges in the sun, the earth no longer remains.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The unit entities have been moving around the cosmic nucleus throughout eternity and this movement will continue as long as an entity maintains the feeling of distinctions; that is the rotation will not cease until their sense of separateness from the nucleus is dissolved. When the intensity of their attachment for the nucleus will reach its climax &ndash; when they will seek to forget everything but Him &ndash; no force whatsoever can then dissociate them form Him. This intense attachment is what we call devotion. This momentum towards the Supreme One becomes easy and smooth, when unit entities realize that He always wants to get them back on His lap. His desire to bring them to Himself is simply His grace. In fact He is showering this grace on all. But when peoples eyes are blinded with materialistic enjoyment, they cannot realize this. The great Sage Na&#x301;rada said, &ldquo;Mahat krpa&#x301;yaeva bhagavat krpa&#x301;lesha&#x301;dva&#x301;&rdquo;, for this His grace is essential. I already said that He had been showering His grace on all. One has only to realize that grace with one&#146;s intensely concentrated mind. His imagination is incessantly flowing. As long as you are incapable of realizing His grace, as long as you do not try to move towards Him you will have to go round and round like the bullocks in the oil-mill in the endless cycle of creation, life and death.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The nucleus of the cosmic system is called Purus&#x301;ottama. He is the Supreme Lord of this imagination-born world of the mutable (ks&#x301;ara) and immutable (aks&#x301;ara) aspects of the Cosmic Mind. In Him is knowership as well as the doership. He Himself is never metamorphosed into any action. We cannot call Him Nirgun&#x301;a or non-qualified, in Him lies the witness-ship of the entire universe. Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is the name for the combination of the Purus&#x301;ottama and His psychic object, the universe. Judging from attributional point of view, the difference between objectified form of Brahma and the witness-ship of Purus&#x301;ottama is that in His objectified form He is under the bondage of the gun&#x301;as (gun&#x301;a&#x301;dhiisa). Yet in both Brahma and Purus&#x301;ottama He is related in some way with the gun&#x301;as. Thus I have said that He is the transcendent controller of the gun&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->He cannot be called Nirgun&#x301;a or non-attributional due to His relation with objects. In the Vedas, Savitr-Rk composed in the Ga&#x301;yatrii mantra is used to describe Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. The first three syllables of the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra (a-u-m) have also been used to describe Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. In ancient times, however, only Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa mantras were used for Purus&#x301;ottama, the Nucleus of the Sagun&#x301;a Brahma. It should be mentioned here that of the seven metres, Ga&#x301;yattrii, Usn&#x301;k, Annus&#x301;t&#x301;upa, Vrhati, Pam&#x301;kti, Tris&#x301;tupa and Jagati, Ga&#x301;yattrii and Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa commanded the greatest importance. Ga&#x301;yattrii-mantra is composed in three lines of eight letters each, totalling twenty-four letters, and Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa of eight letters, dedicated to Purus&#x301;ottama, stands for each of the syllables of On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Ugram: In the above mantra the traits and the signs of Nrsim&#x301;ha (a mythological form of Brahma, half-human and half-lion) have been described. He has been called Ugra: &ldquo;Ur&rdquo; means &ldquo;anu&rdquo; i.e., &ldquo;anu&rdquo; plus &ldquo;graha&rdquo;, that is to say, &ldquo;He who is merciful is Ugra.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ugra&rdquo; is He who sustains the world through creation, preservation and destruction, by whose endless flow of grace the creation has been continuing in its cycles of births and deaths from time immemorial. To this little earth the sun is Ugra or merciful, for the sun is the cause of its creation, preservation and destruction. Similarly, Purus&#x301;ottama is the cause of the Cosmic Cycle. Hence none else can be ugra except Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Viiram: Purus&#x301;ottama is called Viira or brave. Why?

All that has been, is or will be, are but the unit manifestation of His mind, and so He is the Supreme witness of all. Are you not the witness of your internal thoughts? Just as your mental eye views the objects of your imagination, similarly to see his creation in all directions, Purus&#x301;ottama has to be all-facing.<!-- /block --></p>

Incidentally, it must be remembered Nrsim&#x301;ha cannot mean a strange half-man and half-lion creature, which is merely a fanciful contrivance of the authors of the Pura&#x301;n&#x301;as (mythologies). Only that Purus&#x301;ottama, who is the Supreme Entity deserves to be called Nrsim&#x301;ha, it is He who has been protecting from all anti-spiritual forces those spiritual aspirants who seek to attain Him. At times He has to take drastic measures according to necessity, to save devotees like Prahlad from the unholy forces like the demon Hiranyakashipu. To ridicule the Supreme Purus&#x301;ottama by imagining Him as half-human half-lion is not at all proper.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Bhiis&#x301;an&#x301;am: The one who is the Supreme Judge of all deeds, often has to take apparently cruel steps in order to maintain the dignity of His divine justice. Otherwise He will be guilty of partiality, and His stainless name will become tarnished. It is those that kept themselves within the bounds of petty selfishness that are called the unit entities (jiivas), for their thoughts filled with petty selfishness have kept them limited and fragmented by subjecting their minds to the bondage of time, place and person. This feeling of finitude and unit-hood has bred in them a sense of fear for the limitlessness of the Cosmic Consciousness. Such is the nature of the unit beings they fear and hold in awe what is beyond their own limitations, what is greater than them. You will certainly be afraid of one who is your better in education, intelligence, wealth and power, if you do not have a feeling of oneness with him. Those who have realized that Purus&#x301;ottama is the life of their lives, the Soul of their souls, those in whom the sense of oneness with Him has awakened, will not at all be afraid of Him but will love Him &ndash; whereas those who are always conscious of their unit-hood, will be ever afraid of Him and to them He will be frightening (Bhiis&#x301;an&#x301;am).<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Out of fear of Him, the wind blows, the sun shines and the fire burns. Out of fear of Him, the god Indra does his duty and death also appears before the unit entities. Whom shall I call terrifying except Him of whom even the horrible Death is afraid. According to a story in the Vedas, once a vast, radiant Entity appeared before the gods. In order to know His identity the gods sent Fire, Air and Indra. Approaching Him, the Fire said by way of self-introduction, &ldquo;I am Fire &ndash; I am Ja&#x301;taveda. To consume everything is my dharma (characteristic).&rdquo; The Supreme Being then said, offering him a blade of straw, &ldquo;Here, burn this.&rdquo; The Fire, whose inherent characteristic was to burn, could not burn it, howsoever it tried. Then the air approached and said [[by way of self-introduction]], &ldquo;I am Air, I am Ma&#x301;tarishva&#x301;, to blow everything always is my strength.&rdquo; Even the vainglorious Air could not blow away that piece of straw. Finally Indra was able to know the identity of that Purus&#x301;a. Thereafter the gods could very well realize that the power they wielded was not actually theirs. They were powerful only with His power. Their unit identities were but His orderlies. So even all the gods remain at the fringe of fear.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Bhadram: He is the embodiment of welfare. His auspicious flow of imagination is guiding the unit entities and the world to the path of good, to the path of prosperity. There never was, is, or will be, anyone as benevolent as He. Hence He is Bhadra, compassionate and benign.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Mrturmrtyum: This has a double meaning. The first meaning is that even death is afraid of Him, death fears Him as much as a unit entity fears death, and so he is the Death of death. The second meaning is that to this observable world although all other objects die, only death does not, for the unit entities do not die once but die repeatedly &ndash; they take birth after death and then die and take birth again, and then again die. Thus countless deaths come to them, countless number of times.  But those who have attained the Purus&#x301;ottama, attain a supreme death; their worldly death is the last one for them. In other words, with their worldly death, death also dies and further death becomes impossible. It is only through His grace that a unit attains the Supreme, and so He is the Death of death. I bow to this Purus&#x301;ottama.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Now the question may arise: &ldquo;Is this Purus&#x301;ottama identical with the state of Turiiya?&rdquo; If Purus&#x301;ottama and Turiiya are identical, then how can such adjectives as Ugra, Viira, etc., be applicable to Him? Truly speaking those words are only used for particular conditions or states of the Aks&#x301;ara Brahma which are concerned with objects. In other words such a condition may be called Ku&#x301;t&#x301;astha (lying covert). Such epithets in reference to His Turiiya condition or the state of non-duality are quite inappropriate. The Purus&#x301;ottamahood  is on the whole discernible only in the first three stages of Turiiya, wherein His witness-ship is explicit or implied due to the manifest or half-manifest influence of Prakrti. The fourth state of Turiiya , that is, the unchangeable state, wherein the material or objective involvement is nil, is the perfect state of Nirgun&#x301;a (objectlessness) or Turiiya (non-duality) or Niraks&#x301;ara (changelessness). This state is also known as Iishvaragra&#x301;sa or the Final Doom, because it is the finality of all divine endowments and powers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In the Cosmic System, Nr&#x301;sim&#x301;ha or Purus&#x301;ottama is the original nucleus, and the Air, Sun, Fire, Indra, etc. Are the subnuclei. That is why the worship of Nrsim&#x301;ha is called Pain&#x32D;cavyuha&#x301;tmaka or &ldquo;five-nuclear&rdquo; worship. The Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa mantras are composed for this five-nuclear Nrsim&#x301;ha.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Quite a number of times I have told you about Pran&#x301;ava or On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. Now a question may arise in the minds of people regarding which is the greater of the two, Pran&#x301;ava or Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa, or if the two enjoy equal status, then what is the necessity for their separate existence? In reply it may be said that Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa stands for the Cosmic Nucleus (Purus&#x301;ottama) only, while On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra stands for the entire Cosmic System, all the manifestations of the five fundamental factors, and so I am obliged to say that On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is greater than Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa. Anus&#x301;t&#x301;upa too, falls within the scope of On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is composed of four syllables: a, u, ma and the sonic dot, of which the first three are indicative of Sagun&#x301;a and the sonic dot stands for Nirgun&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

So the creation, whether of the past, present or future, could not have been, and cannot be, distinct or separate from the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. Wherever there is manifestation of creation, wherever there is the imaginative flow of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, time, place and person must also be there. The existence of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma is impossible without this On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra produced by His imaginative flow. That is why I have said that the existence of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma and even the existences of all the objects, are dependent on the measurement of the motivity of their action. The mind&#146;s measurement of the motivity of an action is Time; the measurer of this motivity with the help of the mind is person; and that which establishes the relation between time and person is space. The existence of these three is dependent on the mental activity, i.e., on the thought-process or On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. Sunrise to sunset, the beginning of the year to the end, all belong to the vast periphery of Time; hence they are but the manifestations of the On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. From any one extreme point to another extreme point, no matter how short or long the distance, all belong to the sphere of space, and hence they too are the manifestations of On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. So, as I have said, all that we can or cannot think of within the compass of Time, all belong to On&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra.

<a name="3..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->In all these three conditions one thinks oneself separate from Brahma. This distinction between unit entity and Brahma is dependent on their attributional differences. The difference in the states of wakefulness, dream, sleep are due to the greater or lesser dominance of Sentient, Mutative and Static Principles. The unit entities are concerned only with their crude physical existence; while the Cosmic manifestation, however is concerned with the entire, vast universe. I have already said that the Cosmic manifestation is also affected by the three binding principles. The existence of these three states in the unit entities is only possible when these three attributes of the Cosmic manifestation are explicitly evident. This is because the crude, subtle and causal existences of the unit entity are wholly dependent on the cosmic thought-process. The crude unit-body is made of the quinquelemental, earthly ingredients, begotten of the Cosmic thought-process; that is to say, it is created in His Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a or Conscious Mind. It is out of this crude Cosmic Mind that innumerable unit bodies have come into being, for in order to preserve their individualities, the distinctiveness of the receptacles (bodies) has to be maintained, or else the units lose their individual freedom. In order to maintain the continuity of the Cosmic thought-projection, the distinction among objects in the sub-conscious world are unavoidable necessity; this also accounts for the creation of innumerable bodies, or else the thought process becomes Stha&#x301;nu or static for lack of material distinctions. Since Sagun&#x301;a Brahma has to take recourse to imagination for the exhaustion of His unserved Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, it naturally becomes incumbent on Him to evolve a heterogeneous world. The experiencing of actions and reactions by the unit entities are done, to be sure, through the medium of the bodies or receptacles; and when these unit entities abjure their sense of separateness or separate existence from the Cosmic Entity, they no longer have to undergo the consequences of their actions. Being emancipated from the worldly bondage, their separate physical entities cease to exist.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->This very wakeful state is the crudest state of the self for in this state it subsists on apprehending tanma&#x301;tras (sensible and supersensible inferences) from the crude world, desiring things relating to them and materializing those desires by making them explicit or extrovertive. Its thought-wave and its resultant action also is crudely materialistic, and so in the wakeful state it thrives on the crude; i.e. crude world is its pabulum, its food. In the wakeful state it also thrives on the subtle, for the source of its materialistic acts actually abides in its subtle mind. Actually, its real bhaga (the experience of pleasure and pain) takes place in the mental sphere. If the mind is disturbed, one cannot properly enjoy a beautiful sight, a tasty food or a delectable drink. In this wakeful state the A&#x301;tma&#x301; or soul is called catus&#x301;pada or four-phasic; that is, in this state all its four phases are present either explicitly or implicitly. In other words the wakeful state is explicit and within that are latent the dream state, sleep state and the state of Turiiya. This wakeful condition is concerned with the cognizance of the crude; that is, its function is to acquire knowledge of the crude. This relatively crude wakeful state is sevenfold or septilateral; the quinquelemental citta (mental plate), the Mahatattva (fundamental intellect) and the ego. It is nineteen-faced, for its manifestation are in nineteen directions &ndash; ten sensory and motor organs, five va&#x301;yus, mind, the fundamental intellect, ego and Mu&#x301;la Prakrti (the primordial Prakrti in equilibrium). In the wakeful state all objects are the food for the mind, thus, it is called Vishva or Vaeshva&#x301;nara. It is the first pa&#x301;da or phase of the soul. Microcosmically the witnessing Purus&#x301;a of the wakeful state is called Vishva and Macrocosmically He is called Vaeshva&#x301;nara or Vira&#x301;ta.<!-- /block --></p>

In this dream state the organs and limbs like hands, feet etc., remain in proper order and so do the nineteen endowments, but at such a time the soul does not accept any pabulum or food from the crude world. The soul at that time is hungry for the subtle; it accepts only those things apprehended in the realm of the mind. The appearance of such mental objects does not depend on the inferences or tamma&#x301;tras received from the senses at that time but on the reactive momenta or seeds of previously acquired tanma&#x301;tras upheaving waves of the Omniscient seed. In this state, too, all other three states &ndash; wakefulness, sleep and Turiiya remain dormant in the dream state. The unit soul witnessing its dream state is called Taejasa, and similarly subjective witnessing entity of the supreme Consciousness is called Hiran&#x301;yagarbha or Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, or the Subtle Cosmic Mind.

In the wakeful state both the conscious and the sub-conscious mind are functioning: Thought-waves originate in the sub-conscious mind and are translated into action through the medium of the conscious mind. In the wakeful state the role of the conscious mind is solely predominant, but due to physical inertness in the dream condition, the sub-conscious mind cannot properly control the conscious mind and so here the sub-conscious mind alone is predominant. But during sleep the imaginative power, the sub-conscious mind &ndash; also becomes as inactive as the physical body: There remains only the unconscious or causal mind, the Atima&#x301;nas Kos&#x301;a, Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;namaya kos&#x301;a and Hiranyamaya Kos&#x301;a. Then how does dream occur during sleep &ndash; how does the stage of dream come between sleep and wakefulness?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->What is dream? When certain impressions perceived by the sense organs, agitate the conscious mind and sensory or material thoughts are thereby vehemently awakened in the conscious mind, the nervous system, the crude receptacle of the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a and the mind itself becomes unsteady and restless. This leaves an impression on the cells that is short-lived or long-lasting depending on the degree of its intensity. Sometimes even a significant impression being compelled to give way to a newer one under the impact of some other sense-agitation or restlessness, loses its previously acquired permanence. In the sleep state, if a person&#146;s nerve-tissues are agitated due to some physical cause, often either as the result of this or on account of cerebral heat caused by some vehement thinking, the nerve cells also become tired and disturbed. Such agitations give rise in the mental sphere to desires similar to those impressions, accumulated in the nerve-cells. Thus the agitated citta (the sub-conscious mind) accepts as real the stream of thoughts arising from one or more such impressions. The crude organs having stopped functioning, the identical desire arising from the previously acquired desire, do not then seem to be imaginary but appear to be quite real.  Such dreams often do not come true, for these are actually pure imaginations or a mere stringing together of different disjointed thoughts, a confused or inconsistent dream. Only those whose nerve tissues have become weak due to some ailments of the brain or head or to some protracted illness, or those whose digestive system are malfunctioning, generally experience such confused dreams, which we may call Sensual Dreams. These dreams, as I have already said, are the true reproduction of previously imagined objects or the disjointed expressions of previous thoughts. Excessive eating also gives rise to such dreams in a person. Those who have purity of thoughts and also restraint over their diet, are generally less susceptible to such dreams. Such dreams never occur during sleep.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->There is still another type of dream. Even when people are in a deep slumber, there may arise in their sub-conscious minds through their dreams, the prognosis of some good news or bad news, or even a huge calamity. The all-knowing causal or unconscious mind usually cannot express its all-knowingness due to the unsteadiness of the conscious and sub-conscious minds as well as due to its own expressional inability, but sometimes it can awaken in the calm conscious and sub-conscious minds of people in deep slumber visions of past, present or future and those visions overwhelm the sleepers&#146; minds. A surging vibrational flow emanating from the fountain head of the unconscious mind and vibrating the sub-conscious mind, is also a sort of dream; and that dream is not insignificant for its cause is the all-knowing causal mind. This type of dream we may call a supramental vision. Sometimes even in the wakeful state the cognitive flow of the unconscious mind penetrates into the subtle mind, as the result of which people even in the wakeful state, with a little concentration, can know events concerning their distant near and dear ones, this is called telepathic vision. Through the concentrated state of this telepathic vision, when conscious mind is more calm and sedate, people can visualize events concerning their distant beloved ones, enacted before their eyes in the external world or feel as if they are seeing them; this is called telepathic clairvoyance. Mistaking such acts as those of spirits many people come to believe in spiritism or spiritology. Truly speaking such incidents have no connection at all with spirits or ghosts. Telepathic vision and telepathic clairvoyance are intrinsically the same as supramental vision. They are born of the inspiration of the unconscious mind, the knower of the universe. To believe in ghosts and spirits is merely to perpetuate the cowardly mentality of the pre-historic people. But compared to supramental vision, the incidence of telepathic vision is very much less frequent, and still less is the occurrence of telepathic clairvoyance due to the activeness of the Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a or the conscious mind. Nevertheless the supramental vision itself does not occur more than 8 to 10 times in the life of a person. The greater or lesser frequencies of such experiences wholly depends on ones sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (intuitional practices) or sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (reactive requitals). (One, however, must bear I mind that self-acquired telepathy or self-acquired clairvoyance is something different.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->Even in supramental vision people often do not rasp things properly for such cognitive waves are generally expressed through the media of their personal sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Suppose, for instance, in some country cows are necessary for various indispensable jobs like cultivation, the milling of oil-seeds, or bearing conveyances; normally people of suck countries will have very great regard for cows. Having lived on cows milk since their childhood, they will revere as mothers, and regard healthy, strong cows as symbols of good fortune and prosperity. These sentiments about cows are the resultant sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras born out of their day-to-day necessities. Once someone in such a country had a dream about a cow growing leaner and thinner by subsisting only on the dried straws of the paddy field. Then another cow appeared who met the same fate. Then appeared still another cow, and that too fared no better. From such a dream he may infer that his next three years will be inauspicious. As the cows and paddy were symbols of good fortune and prosperity, lean cows and dried paddy plants in the dream were a premonition of misfortune. So for the prescience of the truth through the medium of dreams it is necessary for people to control their conscious and sub-conscious minds. Those who have brought both these minds under control through spiritual practices can, with a little effort, visualize pictures of the past, present and future even in their wakeful state. This accounts for the meditational clairvoyance or intuitional foresight of the stages regarding distant objects or events. Some power of visualizing past, present or future or distant events may also be found in an average person through crystal-gazing, mirror-gazing, etc. These are nothing but the expansion of the cognitive field as the conscious and sub-conscious minds are partially absorbed in the unconscious mind, as the result of earnest concentration on a particular bright object. In the hypnotic state or during planchette-concentration (ouija board) also, the activities of the conscious and sub-conscious minds become stilled, and the range of a particular individual&#146;s knowledge is expanded at least for a short duration. But here one must bear in mind that in the hypnotized state or in mirror-gazing one sees only the reflections of one&#146;s own sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or previous bias. This occurs in almost cent percent of the cases; for instance when a hypnotized person utters, words according to his own sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras while people gaze at him in awe and with folded hands, taking his utterances as absolute truth. Those who feign theophanic or demonical trances are total frauds &ndash; all that they do or say are tricks and hoaxes. But even those who invoke the spirits of gods with devotion or sit around the planchette &ndash; even their statements are almost entirely the expressions of their respective sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras and previous bias. One or two percent of their predictions may even come true due to their mental concentration; but such chance truths may not always be the expressions of the unconscious mind, for there is nothing unusual about one or two predictions out of many, coming true &ndash; it may happen to any ordinary person. There is a Bengali proverb, &ldquo;The crow dies of storm, the Fakir strikes his form.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->The state in which conscious and sub-conscious minds do not function, when the unit entity is not motivated by any longing or any desire nor is seeing any dream &ndash; this in the language of the scriptures is known as the state of sleep. That is to say if there is any desire or dream, we cannot then call it sleep. In the absence of any particular conceptual or external expression, such a state is one of absolute cognition for the individual. Due to this absolute cognition people enjoy a special kind of bliss. In the absence of any crude or subtle function of the mind, they do not experience any happiness or sorrow, any pleasure or pain. That is, why in that state they feel special type of joy in the crude as well as in the subtle spheres of mind, and so in such states material distinctions do exist. But in the state of sleep, the crude and subtle functions of the mind are absent, and thus the awareness of material diversities is also non-existent. All worldly objects become one. This state of absence of distinction creates a special kind of bliss which the individual goes on enjoying in the sleeping state. But this unicity of sleep is not actually the state of self-expansion or absolute identity with the Divine Essence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->The knowledge of material distinction can be dispensed within two ways. In a very brilliant radiance the perception of differentialities is lost, for at that time all objects appear radiant. Then again, in absolute darkness material differences as well vanish for them there is only a cimmerian darkness in which all objects lose their respective outlines.  The unicity of sleep is the same as that of the stupefying cimmerian darkness; that is to say, the power of vision is intact and so are the objects, but there is no visualization. Hence the joy of sleep is static or passive, and gradually this state gives way to dream or wakefulness. The seven-sided and decennoval (nineteen) outlets of the wakeful and dreamful states are not lost but remain as seeds in the state of sleep. And so there can never be happiness in this state either. Such a state is called Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a or the quiescent state of cognition, and that of the Supreme Spirit is called Ishvara or the Crude Cosmic Mind. Since the entire world is linked together in Him just as the pearls are strung on a thread or su&#x301;tra, so He is called Su&#x301;treshvara. It is this thread that has encircled the individuality of the unit. The reason for calling the Purus&#x301;a in the sleep state as Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a is that in this state the seed of all knowledge is embedded. Yet due to darkness, discrimination is nil &ndash; such is the state of sleep. The seeds of the wakeful and dreamful states abide in this state too, and so its happiness is not absolute but merely, a fragmental or partial one.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->Turiiya is neither Omniscient nor the Lord of all, for to know anything the presence of different entities like knowledge, knower and knowable is unavoidable. Likewise, the Iishvaratva or the right of control over anything is not possible without the existence of a controller, control and the controlled, so the state of omniscience or all-knowingness exists only when one&#146;s cognitive self remains separate from all the rest, from the knowable entities.  Similarly, in the state in which one experiences &ldquo;I am&rdquo; the Iishvara or the Lord of all, here too the separateness of ones characteristic self from all others is necessary. But in the Turiiya state the sense of existence of all other entities does not exist at all; there remains only one entity and that is why, an individual in this state cannot be the knower of any object nor the Iishvara of anything. An individual endowed with omniscience or Lordship, we shall call Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a not Turiiya. The Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; is the root of all, the giver of inspiration, the cause of the existential ratification of the world. That is why His body is known as the Causal Body. He Himself is the Quiescent Soul or the Causal Soul. Turiiya is the Witnessing Consciousness, and the Causal Body or Causal Brahma is the qualified manifestation is expressing itself through the media of endless unit manifestations in the hope of finally attaining the great union in the Supreme Perfection &ndash; in the Absolute Supreme Bliss. The qualified thought projection of the Cosmic expression, that is the initial stage of the centrifugal action (Sain&#x32D;cara) is called the Causal Body, and the Purus&#x301;a, which is the subject of this Causal Body, is the Causal Soul, for the word &ldquo;cause&rdquo; here actually means seed. His Body is the seed of the universe and thus He is the Causal Soul. The manifestativeness of the entire universe lies covert in this stage and that is why He is the Controller of all manifestations. He is the Omniscient Being and the Lord of all.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->The last phase of Introversion (Prati-Sain&#x32D;cara) is somewhat like Extroversion (Sain&#x32D;cara); but the main difference between them is that during the time of extroversion the Causal Soul has the germinating potentials of the seed but in the last stage of introversion it is just the reverse. In other words, due to the lack of germinating possibility the Causal Soul returns to the Original Entity. Thus, it will be more correct to call returning Causal Body the ordinary body instead<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->Turiiya Brahma (Nrsim&#x301;ha or Purus&#x301;ottama) is concerned with the Causal Body in four kinds of associations or dissociations: <ol> <li>Ota Yoga or the state of pervasive or intimate association. <li>Anujin&#x32D;ata&#x301; Yoga or the state of cosmotheistic bearing. <li>Anujin&#x32D;a&#x301; Yoga or the Cognitive meditational approach to infinity. <li>Avikalpa Yoga or Absolute identity with the infinite. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Ota Yoga is that pervasive state of Turiiya, in which He is omnipresent as the knower of the Causal Body. He is just like the sun associated with its own manifestation, the world, by means of its own rays. Here the sun-ray is but a particular state of the sun itself and through the medium of that state the sun itself is united with this its manifestation, intimately and physically linked with this world as well as with other planets; it is inherent their very molecules and atoms. Similarly Purus&#x301;ottama is also intimately and physically associated with the manifest and unmanifest unit entities as their witness. This associational bearing of the Turiiya is called Ota Yoga. In other words the yoga or link that constitutes the witness-ship of the unit entities is called Ota Yoga and that which constitutes the pervasive witness-ship of the collective whole is called Prota Yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->Nrism&#x301;ha is connected with the Causal Body in Ota Yoga just as the sun is connected with the causal body of the world through the medium of its rays. Where the knowership is Purus&#x301;ottama, the known is the Causal Body. Where the knowership is Aks&#x301;ara, the known is Ks&#x301;ara, that which has deviated from its characteristics. Where the knowership is Acyuta (undegraded), the known is Cyuta, that which has degraded from its original characteristics. Where the knowership is the Supreme Brahma, known is the microcosm or reflected Brahma. This knowership is the Infinite Entity, the known is finite.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->Is not that Causal Body, which Turiiya Brahma is associated through Ota Yoga, also Brahma? Of course that too is Brahma. When the unit entities ascribe pantheistic bearing to the Causal Body and run after it, they virtually impose Turiiyabha&#x301;va or oneness on the Causal Body itself. The Causal Soul itself is Brahma. This bearing being the state preceding the Turiiyasthiti or establishment in non-duality this Pre-Turiiya Cosmotheistic state, is called Anujin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta&#x301; Yoga.  It is similar to knowing the sun, keeping in view the fact of its inalienable relation to the creation, preservation and destruction of the world. Truly speaking the Yoga by which the sense, that the world is intrinsically inalienable from the sun, is awakened, is called Anujin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta&#x301; Yoga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->In this Anujin&#x32D;ata&#x301; Yoga the relation of knowership and known though not fully manifest, does exist, it is semi-manifest, and so, like Ota Yoga, I cannot call the either the Supreme state of Turiiya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->When the finite, qualified unit entity, makes efforts to reach, through the Dhya&#x301;na Yoga or meditation, the state of infinity of non-qualifiedness or non-distinctiveness, such a state is called Anujin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta&#x301; Yoga. In other words it is as though attempting through cognitive sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to regard the world itself as the finite form of the sun, while understanding the sun&#146;s essential and characteristic unicity with it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->In Avikalpa Yoga there is no room for any second sentiment or thought. Here the entity is essentially one, the soul is purely cognition devoid of attributional aspects of the three states like knowledge, known and knower. This Avikalpa state is the seedless state of absolute identity with the Divine Essence, the eternal tranquillity of Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi or indeterminate, super-sensual trance of absorption.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->We cannot call this Turiiya Sthulapara&#x301;jin&#x32D;a, for He is not apprehensible by any crude objective intellect or knowledge. Nor can we call Him Suksmapra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a either, for He is beyond the knowability or apprehensibility of the subtlest of the subtle intelligence of the subjective or objective intellect. Then again we cannot say that He is Ubhayapra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a,  that He is knowable, but through some middle condition between the two. It will be also incorrect to say that He is attainable through synthetic knowledge or intellect for in that state, which is in reality a state of absolute cognition, the seed of all-knowingness as well as Omnilordship does exist and so that state &ndash; not to speak of the Avikalpa or seedless state &ndash; is not even a Turiiya state. We shall call the state  absolute cognition the Causal Soul, which is known as Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a and Su&#x301;treshvara according to individual and collective distinction respectively. Truly speaking, the Entity which is neither a crude cognition &ndash; nor a subtle cognition neither a bilateral cognition nor an absolute cognition &ndash; can have no relation with the mind or its activities at all. That Entity is beyond the scope of mind, common knowledge or intelligence, be it crude or subtle, condensed or uncondensed, or any of the other imaginative processes of the mind &ndash; none of these is Turiiya Brahma for He is beyond the orbit of the mind. He is free of all adjectives or attributes, like commonness, uncommonness, density, non-density etc. To attribute all these to Him is to brand Him with positive or negative traits. Being beyond the purview of the mind, He cannot be seen nor can He be used for any transaction of give and take. The differences of objects are determinated by the differences rather than attributes. As the mind cannot determine His attributes, it cannot determine His distinctiveness from any other object either. He is not a material thing. He is non-material. This Turiiya Entity, being beyond the scope of mind, is also not apprehensible through meditating. His characteristic form cannot be described, for how can any material language describe the immaterial? This Turiiya Brahma exists behind the existential sense of every object in His characteristic, intransmutable stance only, which remains as the characteristic essence, the ultimate result of all metaphysical and philosophical analyses. He indeed is Shiva-the Bhuma&#x301;nanda (Macrocosmic Bliss). Being free from all duality He is Absolute Tranquillity. He is without distortions, for distortions occur due to the application of force by one object upon another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->His singular stance is His only characteristic. Thus the first three of the four states are not the absolute Truth. The fourth state, the Turiiya, is the only Truth. The states of wakefulness, dream and sleep are not spiritual entities for they contain in them the semblance of attributes, their existential entities are dependent on the crude, subtle and causal knowables. So the first three states of the soul are relative truths because they are dependent on other factors whereas the fourth state, the Turiiya, being independent of all others, is the spiritual Truth, the whole Truth, the Absolute Truth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->Earn your deathlessness by establishing yourself in Him. He is the real Soul. If any condition is worth attaining at all then it is this condition &ndash; the Turiiya condition. In such a condition there cannot be any distinctions of microcosm or macrocosm. In this condition there is no form for action, inaction or counter-action &ndash; no scope for extroversive or introversive vagaries. This bearing is the natural characteristic of the soul, its characteristic Self. In wakefulness the collectivity is called Vira&#x301;ta (the subjective counterpart of the Causal Cosmic Mind) and the individuality is Vishva (the subjective counterpart of the causal unit-mind). In the dream state the collectivity is known as Hiran&#x301;yagarbha (the subjective counterpart of the subtle Cosmic Mind) and the individuality is Taejasa (the subjective counterpart of the subtle unit-mind). In the sleeping state the collectivity is Su&#x301;treshvara (the subjective counterpart of the crude Cosmic Mind), the individuality is Prajin&#x32D;a (the subjective counterpart of the crude unit-mind), the dormant cognition, being completely free from all attributes or the semblance thereof, the states of collectivity and individuality cannot exist due to the absence of all kinds of differentiations. In this condition He is called the One unique Iishvaragra&#x301;sa or the Cosmic Finality regardless of any collectivity or individuality. Only in the soul is He experienced. He is the summum bonum of all sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional practice. He is not attainable through arguments or science. When one is ensconced in Him, wakefulness, dream and sleep are but mere imaginations and illusions &ndash; merely the mistaken recognition of untruth for Truth. Even the entire quinquelemental or Pain&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tatmaka world is lost during this Turiiyabha&#x301;va, in such a supreme state all elemental bearings recede into nothingness. In every human being there are the states of wakefulness, dream, sleep, the unit soul and the Supreme Soul. It is that Soul we must know.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->He is the ultimate Finality, the Iishvaragra&#x301;sa. The range of the dream state is greater than that of the wakeful one, and the range of the sleep state much greater than that of the dream state. And the state encompasses the entire vast extent of the sleep state, and that is why Turiiya state is the vastest of all, the all-devouring. Even the Supreme Purus&#x301;a (Iishvara), the subjective witnessing entity meets His end in Him and that is why His name is Iishvaragra&#x301;sa or the Cosmic Finality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->This Turiiya or non-dual state is beyond all gun&#x301;as or attributes. No language can describe Him. The scriptures have only tried to elucidate and explain Him, but the language for the proper explanation is not within the bounds of the scriptures. In the state of Turiiya not only does subjectivity not exist, but in the fourth aspect of the turiiya, the Avikalpa, there is not even a semblance of witness-ship. No matter how assiduously the wavering and indecisive mind exerts itself to reach that Turiiya, it can never hold Him within its grasp. To attain Him one has to do the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of self-surrender, one has to surrender oneself wholly &ndash; giving the full sixteen annas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.3.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#3.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> Withholding of even a single anna will not do.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->On the 9th of January last year I told you something about the theory of Prakrti. Today I will tell specifically about Avidya&#x301; or the Extroversive Force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Brahma is the composite of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. Prakrti is the Operative Principle and Purus&#x301;a is the Consciousness or the Cognitive Principle. Brahma is two in one. Jiiva or the unit manifestation of Brahma is also composed of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti, that is cognitive and operative principles. The sense of ego or &ldquo;Doer I&rdquo; that exists behind all that a person does, says, thinks, understands, or hears is the product of Prakrti. And behind this ego, the &ldquo;I know I am&rdquo; that exists as the Supreme Knower is a human being&#146;s cognitive force &ndash; the undistorted Purus&#x301;a. Not only humans, every entity, whether animate or inanimate, movable or immovable, consists of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti. Sentience or insentience are only relative conditions. Truly speaking, there is nothing which is insentient or inanimate. Rather we do them injustice by calling and believing them to be so. Take, for instance, a piece of stone. Is it insentient? No, nothing is insentient from the spiritual point of view. Only those things appear insentient or inert, in which the influence of Prakrti or force over Purus&#x301;a or Consciousness is more in evidence. In other words, I would call only that inert, in which due to the greater influence of Prakrti, Purus&#x301;a is not manifest, or is lying dormant. In the Sun Prakrti is manifest but Purus&#x301;a is subdued. That is why the Sun, in spite of being the nucleus of the solar system &ndash; whose inhabitants, human beings, possess such a highly developed intellect &ndash; whose countless organisms are conscious of their respective egos &ndash; does not know itself as the Sun. But its progeny, human beings, very well know it as the sun. Not only that, they have tried to know and understand its functioning more and more deeply and have persevered and will persevere to possess and unravel all its mysteries through philosophical researches and analytical experiments. This conquest of human beings over the sun &ndash; the credit for this feat, does not belong to human beings but to the developed Purus&#x301;a or Consciousness. I cannot, from the spiritual standpoint, call anything inert or crude which looks apparently so under the greater crudifying influence of Prakrti, because the entity, which appears to be passive or crude, is actually the crude manifestation of Prakrti-influenced Consciousness. That is to say, in such a state the Consciousness is incapable of expressing its knowership, for its expression has been curtailed at the very outset by Prakrti. Thus a piece of stone which seems to be inanimate or inert, is not actually so. It only exists in a particular state of Consciousness and it too has the potentiality of transforming itself into a glorious human being like you one of these days. The dormant Purus&#x301;a in such seemingly inert objects will certainly one day awaken.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->It is by the influence of Prakrti that Purus&#x301;a comes to be imbued with inertness, for to make the integral body of Brahma divided and diversified, everything has to be demarcated, and that demarcation is not possible unless the thing is crude. So to bring about such plurality in Purus&#x301;a, inertness has to be imposed on Him and this imposition is accomplished by Prakrti. Prakaroti iti Prakrti, that is, that, which [[has the]] multi-creative power or plasticity is called Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This Prakrti has three constituent attributes or forces (gun&#x301;as) &ndash; sentient (sattva), mutative (rajah) and static (tamah). Had there been no such multi-creative, triple-attributive Prakrti, the diverse manifestations of different animals and plants would not have come into being. In other words the entire universe would have remained purposeless and unvaried, unexpressed or unmanifested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Prakrti and Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; are almost synonymous, but in common usage there is a shade of difference in the meaning. In cases where the three gun&#x301;as or attributes, sattva (sentient), rajah (mutative) and tamah (static), are in equilibrium, the word Prakrti, is generally used. Such equilibrated Mula&#x301; Prakrti (Primordial Force or Operative Principle) is unmanifest but where the three components are not in equilibrium, such a state is called Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; (the Creative Principle). Where there is no equipoise or equality, where there is disparity &ndash; either sattva or tamah is predominant. The state of disparity in which sattva (the Sentient Force) is greater, is called Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or Introversive Force and the state in which Tamah (the Static Force) is greater, is called Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or Extroversive Force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->So you see, it is only due to the disparity in the trivalent factors of Prakrti that the world is conceived in the Cosmic Mind. Similarly when the unit mind races towards Brahma, it is also due to the same attributional disparity of Prakrti. If Prakrti had been in equipoise, no movement would have been possible in the primordial state where Prakrti is inexplicit and dormant in Purus&#x301;a &ndash; this state is a stationary state. Manifested Prakrti is of course dynamic, be that momentum introversive or extroversive. By the introversive momentum of Prakrti under the influence of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the unit beings (jiivas) proceed towards sublimity. But the stage when it reaches in that Sublime Uniformity, not only does the Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or extroversive force [[not]] exist, but even Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;&#146;s potential influence over the individuality of the unit also disappears due to her own super-exaltation. For the purpose of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (spiritual practices) sa&#x301;dhakas (spiritual aspirants) have to take the help of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or introversive force though finally they have to forgo her also.<!-- /block --></p>

Similarly, with Brahma as the goal, this proceeding forward, rending the darkness of Avidya&#x301; (the Extroversive Force), is one of the fights against Avidya&#x301;.

The word here implies the Jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; or the sentient soul which is asleep or quiescent spiritually. Such persons are concerned with heterogeneous entities, yet, in spite of their highly discerning refined discernment, they are unable to understand their true perspective &ndash; due to the spell of darkness of Avidya&#x301;. Nevertheless they abide in this very darkness with all their knowledge of the differences. The very fight against these disintegrating tendencies is their Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In other words, Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a or the spiritually dormant persons will have to fight to rescue their Prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; or discriminating intellectual self from the hands of the Static principle. In this fight, when the Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a comes out victorious, they will identify themselves with the Supreme Consciousness, for they are then no more under the bondage of Prakrti. I have said it before and I say it again, that Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; means fight against Avidya&#x301;. This fight is internal, not external. External or ostentatious fight will achieve nothing. In such a fight one&#146;s entire capability culminates in the acrobatics of dressing and decorating of one&#146;s exterior with ma&#x301;la&#x301; (a rosary or string of beads for saying prayers), tilaka (a conspicuous mark between the eyebrows with sandalwood-paste or vermilion, jhola&#x301; (a little sack for the rosary) and candan-cha&#x301;pa (or the mark of sandalwood paste on the forehead, arms and chest).

<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Actually the jiivabha&#x301;va or the individuality of the unit imbibes quite a lot of knowledge in the basic condition. It also has the potentiality for infinite knowledge, but that knowledge is unobjective. Suppose you are sitting alone in darkness and around you there is the variegated discriminative world and within yourself you also have the power to observe this discriminative world. Yet you cannot see anything due to the darkness. All the entities have mingled and identified themselves with the darkness. The sight of the seer is intact, but the vision has become one with the all-devouring darkness. So in such a condition the knowledge of the seer is unobjective. Similar is the condition of the individuality of the unit entities. It cannot understand the real form of any entity due to Avidya&#x301;, so it goes on groping and forming its own arbitrary conclusions about things. That is why, I told you that it is incorrect to say that the Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a or the spiritually dormant human being has no capacity of knowing; in fact he or she does have a limitless capacity to know. The seed of knowledge is certainly present with its limitless potentiality. Only the knowingness is lacking substantiation due to the darkness. Hence the spiritually dormant person will have to do Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to drive away the darkness. With the disappearance of obscurity, all the things perceived during the spell of darkness and their cause will merge in the Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a itself, that is to say, their whole existence will vanish. So with the merger of the Pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a-Sa&#x301;dhaka in Brahma this discriminative world also merges in the homogeneous Cause.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In the human mind Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; (Extroversive Force) manifests herself in two ways: Viks&#x301;epa&#x301;tmaka (extroversive or centrifugal) and A&#x301;varana&#x301;tmaka (obstructive). Philosophically we call them Viks&#x301;epa Force and A&#x301;varan&#x301;ii (covering) Force, respectively. Due to the remoteness of the original object to be known, a lack of valid knowledge results, that is, due to the remoteness of Brahmabha&#x301;va, a lack of spiritual knowledge results, and with the increase of remoteness even the semblance of knowledge gradually vanishes. These are all the actions of this Viks&#x301;epa or Centrifugal Force. And in spite of the opposite condition, proximity, the lack of valid knowledge that occurs due to the darkness of ignorance is the act of the A&#x301;varan&#x301;ii or the Obstructive Force. The reason why I call this an A&#x301;varan&#x301;ii Force is that it works as a cover or lid over the original object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In this heterogeneous world the sense of existence and acquaintance are the combined action of Viks&#x301;epa and A&#x301;varan&#x301;ii forces of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Just as the real picture of a thing is not discernible in the darkness &ndash; appearing as a strange shadowy entity in this heterogeneous creation, too is similarly observed on the Cosmic Body due to the influence of Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. In other words, during the process of Sain&#x32D;cara (Extroversion) the Viks&#x301;epa and A&#x301;varan&#x301;ii forces dominate due to the predominance of Avidya&#x301; in the macrocosmic thought-projection, and during Pratisain&#x32D;cara (Introversion), they gradually dwindle into nothingness. In order to realize their own characteristic seity or self-hood, Sa&#x301;dhakas must try to establish themselves in the introversive state (Pratisain&#x32D;cara) by banishing darkness of Avidya&#x301; which created this heterogeneous world &ndash; this is their Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. When the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is introversive, it has to be assumed that the preponderance of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or introversive principle is there. The two anti-Avidya&#x301; forces that exist in the Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; are Samvit or the Introspective Force and Hla&#x301;dinii or the Sublimative Force. The force that awakens the consciousness of one&#146;s present condition in a Sa&#x301;dhaka &ndash; the awareness that I am the highest evolved creature, a human being, and I have to cast away the darkness of the obstructive force of A&#x301;varan&#x301;ii, I have to worship the nearest Entity by conquering the distance or chasm created by the centrifugal force of Viks&#x301;epa &ndash; such an introversive sense of realization that wakes up in the human mind is called Samvit. The meaning of Samvit, you all know, is sudden realization of the state of things. I call it the Samvit Force, for it awakens the sa&#x301;dhaka to reality.<!-- /block --></p>

I call it hla&#x301;dinii Force, for it escorts the Sa&#x301;dhakas through the path of ahla&#x301;d or a&#x301;nanda or divine ecstasy and establishes them in Absolute Bliss. This is the much-coveted Hla&#x301;dinii of the unit being &ndash; the Shrii Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; (the staunch devotee of Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, the personified Love Sublime) of the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas.<!-- /block --></p>

In such a balanced state the microcosm undergoes neither regeneration nor degeneration. Such a condition is indeed rare. Yet in common terms I can say that such a condition does exist in most of the jiivas or units. The equilibrium of forces that causes this non-progressive and non-regressive condition is called tatastha shakti or the coastal Force. A man who is not depraved and abides by normal laws, and yet does not do Brahma-Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, is virtually within the realm of this coastal force. Right from the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a sa&#x301;dhaka begins his journey from the borderline of a coast towards the victorious, all-pervasive, Macrocosm with the aid of the Sublimative Force (Hla&#x301;dinii). I call it Tatastha, because Tata means the shore where the water of a river or lake touches the bank. What is the state of the people who are Tatastha, right on the borderline of the Tata or shore? If they descend just a step down they fall into the river, and if they ascend a step up they stand on dry solid ground; so the first step of Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is situated on the borderline of the shore. Now in such a condition you may either cut adrift from your Brahmic sentiment, aided by the extroversive force of Viks&#x301;epa, and be swept away by the current of the river, or you may establish yourself squarely on the solid ground Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>

Purus&#x301;a is an aseity, a birthless entity and His objects are the rhythmic heterogeneity of the birthless Prakrti, the plastic performer of the inconceivable. That is why they are not eternal but transitory. This rhythmic extravaganza is leading human beings forward every moment through the heteromorphic phenomena, none of which has any lasting permanence. The person who is a boy, becomes a youth after a few years, and the same person becomes old again after some time. After the death of the illusive forms of boyhood and youth, comes old age, and after the death of the illusive form of old age there occurs the worldly death.

Within these twenty years at every fraction of a moment, or at some sort of a still shorter time, say, a micro-second, for example &ndash; one form of this child died and another form was created and each of those dead forms merged in the Purus&#x301;a and identified itself with the Supreme Knower.

On reaching Arrah you start thinking about Mogal-Sarai. Again your citta takes the form of Mogal-Sarai. Now at this stage, where did the form of Arrah go, which had been previously created by your mind? That form has merged in you. Similarly this illusory world is also created by the Brahmic thought-projection, wherein the disappearance of one form is followed by the creation of another. This thought-process is evolved by the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and it is through the help of this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; that we realize the self-manifested form of Purus&#x301;a. Sagun&#x301;a Purus&#x301;a (the subjectivated and objectivated Purus&#x301;a) and Prakrti are like fire and ghee (clarified butter). To see the dazzling form of fire we have to pour ghee in it, similarly, to see Purus&#x301;a manifested in form, the presence of the active force of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is unavoidable. This Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;-influenced Purus&#x301;a is the Sagun&#x301;a Purus&#x301;a, or else like the ghee-less fire He is &ldquo;extinguished&rdquo; for without the association of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; Sagun&#x301;a Purus&#x301;a perishes &ndash; there remains only the Nirgun&#x301;a or unattributed, unmanifested, Transcendental Entity. But there is one important thing to note here. By the influence of ghee the existence of fire is indeed realized but what is the result? To keep the fire burning, the ghee consumes itself. Likewise, in order to maintain the evolution of this created world, of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, she gradually gets merged in Purus&#x301;a. In other words, Sagun&#x301;a attains salvation by degrees. You must have thoroughly understood now how Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (past momenta) are being destroyed through Karmabhoga (suffering and enjoyment).<!-- /block --></p>

An entity that takes the colours and forms of all things or has the capacity to do so, cannot be just dismissed as worthless. Prakrti is like a motion-picture, which can neither be held in hand as something tangible and existent, nor can it be dismissed as something non-existent. Prakrti is a passing show, a moving phenomenon, a changing reality. Although she is moving, there is enough firmness in her linear forms, and that is why people are so attracted to her, just as parents are attracted to the transient form of their child of five, in spite of their being aware of the changing nature of her forms and features. And then again, when that very form reaches its twentieth year through physiognomical changes, they are equally fond of that twenty-year-old form. Hence every momentary bit of the fragmentary forms of the quick-changing Prakrti is an object or cause of the unit&#146;s great fascination. The cimmerian Prakrti with her darkening magic wand keeps humanity in darkness. This sombre Prakrti has to be removed at any cost from before our eyes. She will not go voluntarily. You will have to get rid of her influence through the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Purus&#x301;a or the Cosmic Consciousness. She will put countless obstacles and hindrances before you and yet you will have to fight against them and triumph over them. Wallowing in materialism one cannot reach the stage of supernaturalism. Living in the midst of Bhoga (sufferings and enjoyments) and indulging in and zealously practicing, Bhoga Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for enyoyment&#146;s sake, one cannot give up bhoga or materialistic bent. For the sake of one&#146;s profession or for any other reason, one who has to tell lies continually, will eventually turn a naturalized liar, if one does not take a vow of truthfulness. Many teachers of the old school, when they do not have canes in their hands, vent their habit of caning by brandishing their pencils. Grimacing in a paroxysm of rage or clenching their fists as if they were holding on tightly to the branches out of fear &ndash; these two apish characteristics &ndash; [[we human beings]] have not yet been able to relinquish. So if you exist [[in]] Bhoga (material enjoyments or sufferings), no harm; if [[you]] do the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Bhoga, no harm there either; but there should certainly not [[be]] bhoga for bhoga&#146;s sake.

When the Cosmic Consciousness is the witness of Prakrti&#146;s dominant Sentient Principle (Sattva), He is known as the Supreme Spirit, Brahma&#x301;. When He is the witness of her dominant Mutative Principle (Rajah), we call Him Hiran&#x301;yagarbha or Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u, and when He is the witness of her Static Principle (Tamah), He is known as Iishvara or Shiva. It must be borne in mind that Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Shiva are not three different entities. They are the three circumstantial manifestations of the One Cosmic Entity. In all the three circumstances there is but one witness. It is according to the differences in objects or aspects that we have given different epithets to the objectivated Purus&#x301;a. Does the sense of ego in Jitendra Narayana change when his son calls him by the name of &ldquo;father&rdquo;, or [[when his father calls him by the name of &ldquo;Jitu&rdquo;, or]] when his student calls him by the name of &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;? No, certainly not. Whatever difference is there, is due to the angle of vision and the way of application. One&#146;s unchanged sense of ego remains as a witness in every case. When in Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the Sa&#x301;dhakas are established in Cosmic Consciousness, they feel themselves to be Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Maheshvara (Shiva) simultaneously. All the three states are immanent in the one and the same Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, are vibrated in the one and the same on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->Prakrti is spiritually refulgent in the Brahmic Consciousness and Brahma&#x301;, Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u and Maheshvara only represent particular aspects of that Consciousness. But is not the individuality of the unit sentient also, since it is the reflection of Cosmic Consciousness Itself? When the individuality is the reflection of Consciousness and if the mirror reflects everything whether crude, subtle or causal, then the individuality has to be spiritually refulgent as well. (In order to help make people to understand this philosophical principle easily, sometimes the Buddhitattva or the unit-intellect, and sometimes Purus&#x301;a, have been compared to mirrors, but this does not mean that Buddhitattva or Purus&#x301;a has any material relation with any earthly mirror).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->The individuality also is not asleep or quiescent. Now the question arises, if the individuality is the reflection of the Cosmic Consciousness and if the former is also as much conscious, then who is lacking? Why can&#146;t we realize it in its Cosmic maturity, as the full-fledged Brahma Himself? Why isn&#146;t the reflection of omneity, evident in it in the fullest measure?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..75"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph --><i>Sarvam&#x301;sarvamayam&#x301; sarve jiiva&#x301;h sarvamaya&#x301;h Sarva&#x301;vastha&#x301;su tatha&#x301;pyalpa&#x301;h sa va&#x301; esa&#x301; bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;niindriya&#x301;ni vira&#x301;jam&#x301; devata&#x301;h kos&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301;shca srs&#x301;t&#x301;va&#x301; pravishya&#x301;mu&#x301;dho mu&#x301;d&#x301;ha iva vyavaharanna&#x301;ste ma&#x301;yayaeva.</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->Truly speaking, the individuality of the unit is as omni-present, omnifarious and all-pervading as the Cosmic Consciousness, because if the reflection is clear, we can know the original very well, because the reflection retains the full impress of the original. The Buddhitattva-like (Intellect-like) mirror also is capable of reflecting all the three states, crude, subtle and causal. But then I do not find any inconsistency in the fact of the individuality of the unit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->Practically the individuality is always its own characteristic self and it is certainly characteristically free Ciara&#x301;a Saha&#x301;be Mukal (that is, characteristically the microcosm is an emancipated entity). But we cannot catch the full reflection of Brahma on the unit-Mahattattva (I-feeling). For this Cosmic Consciousness is not at fault, the fault lies with the plate of our unit-Mahattattva. If the reflection of just a foot of an elephant is caught in a small mirror instead of its full figure, it will look like a pillar in that mirror. Now which of the two is to blame for this wrong impression of the elephant in the mirror &ndash; the elephant or the smallness of the mirror? So Sa&#x301;dhakas have to increase the dimension of the plates of their Mahattattva, and also they will also have to make it scrupulously clean, so that they may reflect the entire universe in themselves. Partial reflection makes the world appear to be disjointed and heterogeneous. But when you will be able to see this heterogeneous world fully on your mental plate the world will not any more appear to you as the world, but only as the product of your imagination. Then, possessed with such a vast mind, you will further realize that you are not &ldquo;you&rdquo; any more - your &ldquo;you&rdquo;-hood is being absorbed in the speckless, super-white effulgence of that Empyrean Splendour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->The receptacles of the individuality of the unit are the Pain&#x32D;cabhaotika or quinquelemental body and the organs. The Pain&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tas or the five fundamental factors are wholly the products of the thought-process of the Supreme Spirit &ndash; the Cosmic Ego. The unit-body is made of these five ingredients and it is related with the Universe through its ten organs. Sagun&#x301;a Brahma or the Subjectivated Transcendentality has evolved thirty-three kinds of primary manifestations (Devata&#x301;) in this universe with the help of Prakrti, and the individuality of the unit has evolved five Kos&#x301;as (sheaths or receptacles of the mind) after imposing upon its sense of ego the crudifications of the five elements and the ten sensory and motor organs. But due to its smallness this five-sheathed and ten-organed body is unable to realize the Cosmic Consciousness. Its materialistic mental plate is totally unfit to grasp that Infinite Consciousness. So listen, O Sa&#x301;dhakas! You shall have to magnify the area of your subtle mind or Manomaya Kos&#x301;a so that you may appropriate the Cosmic Consciousness in the fullest measure. The smaller the object of your mind, the smaller shall become your mental body in proportion. The greater the object of your mind, the greater and still greater your mental plate will become until finally you will be able to install yourself in the Supreme Cosmic Entity. That is why, no one of wisdom will ever take any limited crude object as the pabulum of their minds and thus lead themselves to animality. Those who do that are fools, they want to remain in the smug ignorance of their characteristic selves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->The difference between Aseity and Seity &ndash; Cosmism and individuality &ndash; is in name only. One is the subject of one&#146;s Great Mind and the other of one&#146;s small mind. It is due to such cognominal difference that Dasharatha Sim&#x301;ha and Dasharatha Tha&#x301;kur are two different entities. But if we remove their surnames, the two are Dasharatha. This is as true of a metaphysical name as it is of a secular one. In the titleless condition both the transcendent unit and Brahma entities are identical. If Brahma is not the Witnessing Entity of His Cosmic Mind and if the unit also is not the subjective counterpart of his small mind, the two become one due to their objectlessness. Such a state is called Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi or the state of total absorption of the unit-mind in the Supreme Spirit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->So it is clear that due to its being a reflection of Consciousness, the individuality of the unit, too is omnipresent, omni-inherent and omniscient; but this individuality with its limitless cognitive potentials is unable to comprehend the state of Superperfection or Omneity due to its being the limited intellectual manifestation of the Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;ic mirror. With the disappearance of the influence of this Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;ic mirror, its reflected existence also disappears and it is then that it merges itself in the Original Entity &ndash; it regains its own characteristic self, its own homogeneous status.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->In Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi or the stance of indeterminate contemplative contemplation, the causal mind is suspended due to the transcendency of Avidya&#x301; or Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and that is why that state is supersensible, beyond the comprehension of the senses. Following that state, after the break of that Sama&#x301;dhi or total mental suspension, when the faculty of senses and understanding returns, then alone one realizes that some unknown current of exhilaration from some unknown region has flooded one&#146;s whole entity &ndash; is drifting it away to some ultra-sensual, pulsating realm of celestial bliss. Hence it is said that in a state of Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi the Sa&#x301;dhakas cannot understand whether they are in Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi nor can they say afterwards that they felt any such thing, for that state was a super-sensual ego-less one.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->After the break of that self-lost, ego-less abstraction, when the Sa&#x301;dhakas feel the return of their hazy egos drifting away in the current of exuberant joy, they then realize that their preceding state must have been a state of the loftiest ecstasy which is called Nirvikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi. The post-Sama&#x301;dhi condition is reminiscent of the state following a deep slumber. In a state of slumber people do not feel that they are sleeping. After waking up, when their Ka&#x301;mamaya Kos&#x301;a or crude mind becomes active, they realize, as they think of their preceding state of void or insensibility, &ldquo;I was so long asleep&rdquo;. As much as the Sa&#x301;dhakas are able to establish their heroism after escaping from the Serpent-noose of Avidya&#x301;, the Extroversive Force, so much A&#x301;nandasvaru&#x301;pa or Supreme Exultation they experience; they then become A&#x301;nandasvaru&#x301;pa Himself, the A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti or the very image of A&#x301;nanda or Bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..85"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->O how long doth my ego await Thy grace<br>To merge in Thy likeness without a trace?<br>When will Thy name so glorious divine<br>Bid warmest tear in these eyes of mine<br>And my body and soul with vibration reel<br>In joyous rhythm of blissful thrill?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->Savikalpa Sama&#x301;dhi or the determinate suspension comprises the fullness of Vidya&#x301; Prakrti (Introversive Force); that is, the full establishment of the introversive momentum in the Sa&#x301;dhakas&#146; austere spiritual life &ndash; the absence of any Extroversive Force (Avidya&#x301;), and total cessation of their extroversive momentum. So in such a state the ego not only exists, it exists in its total fullness and completeness. This very ego in its Brahma&#x301;-ic mood evolves the universe, in its Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u-ic mood it preserves the universe and in its Shiva-ic mood it destroys the universe. In the three manifestations of this very ego lies the anchor of this universe &ndash; in this short-long-slow rhythm of creation-preservation-destruction lies the tether of space, time, and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->Who is the causal factor of creation, preservation and destruction &ndash; Purus&#x301;a or Prakrti? Actually in the varied expressions of creation, preservation and destruction the all-knowing Consciousness remains unaffected and undistorted. All these expressions are but the dance of Prakrti herself in her own receptacle, the Cosmic Body &ndash; the scintillating sports of Energy on the bosom of Shiva or Purus&#x301;a. The immutability (aparin&#x301;a&#x301;mitva) of the Purus&#x301;a entity never was, never is and never will be affected[[, for the word]] &ldquo;immutable&rdquo; (aparin&#x301;a&#x301;mii) means to be beyond the purview of space, time and person. The waves created on the bosom of Shiva by the dance of Prakrti, have not changed and cannot change His true characteristic Self. The flower with its red colour is coming close to the mirror and going far from it. Such a sight makes one think that the mirror itself has become red and is moving forwards and backwards. But what is the reality? The mirror remains as motionless as it always was, does it not? Satya, Sat and immutability are indeed synonymous. He alone is the sympathetic reciprocator of all entities. In this reciprocation alone the relative existence of the entities is recognized. That is why He is the witnessing Consciousness of all the entities. Happiness or sorrow abides in the unit entities, the reciprocator only creates the suitable reflections. Hence He is beyond the compass of happiness and sorrow &ndash; He is the Bliss Absolute. So I say that the sweet, colourful, multi-expressive dance of Prakrti, on the bosom of Shiva, cannot influence Him at all. Shiva or Cosmic Consciousness is immutable: He is the witnessing entity. He is beyond the pale of pleasure and pain. Shiva is Sat (unchangeable), Cit (Consciousness), and A&#x301;nanda (Divine Bliss) &ndash; He is Saccida&#x301;nanda.<!-- /block --></p>
