<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam (&ldquo;Blissful Discourses&rdquo;) series assembles all the known General Darshan discourses given by Ma&#x301;rga Guru Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti. General Darshan (GD) speeches, or discourses, were those given to Ananda Marga members, often as a part of the daily routine, in whatever locality Ma&#x301;rga Guru happened to be staying in at the time. Normally briefer and lighter in tone (though no less profound in their fundamental meanings) than the discourses given on the formal occasions of Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (DMC), these talks were sometimes delivered in a very intimate way to relatively small groups of Margis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam series was begun in 1978 with the GD discourses given by the author at that time; it then kept pace with the GD discourses that the author gave over the subsequent six years. Starting with Part 23, the series has included GD speeches given before 1978.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Some of the discourses in the A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam series were recovered in the form of typed discourse notes; or if recovered from an established magazine of the mission, then recovered in the form of an article that appeared to be a summary or approximation of the original discourse, but perhaps not an exact rendering. It has been thought advisable to locate such discourses separately within each part of A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam, in an appendix called &ldquo;From the Notebooks of Devotees&rdquo;. In the present volume, the discourse &ldquo;You Must Live Glorious Lives&rdquo; will be found in that appendix in the last pages of the book. Writers who wish to quote from this discourse should attribute the material to the &ldquo;A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 33 appendix&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate here &ndash; in addition to the original language of each speech, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if other than in this book, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the cases of some of the discourses published here, no written record was found of the language in which the discourse was given; but if the language could be clearly inferred from the location and other circumstances of the discourse, we have cited that language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the editors have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Eds.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Many readers are concerned that the author&#146;s speeches, as published, should adhere as closely as possible to the precise wording the author used in speaking. For this reason, in the case of discourses given originally in English, the editors have not altered pronouns and other terms which the author in his lifetime considered &ldquo;common-gender&rdquo; words. As the author once said, &ldquo;You know, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is not only masculine gender, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is common gender also. &lsquo;Man is mortal&rsquo; &ndash; here &lsquo;man&rsquo; means both male and female.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The author was a natural advocate of women&#146;s rights and on at least one occasion indicated that &ldquo;lopsided justice&rdquo; in language should be eliminated at some future date. In keeping with this guideline and with present-day trends, it is our policy in the case of translated discourses (where the published wording will necessarily be that of the translators) to use gender-neutral language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Twenty-nine of the discourses presented here, that is, all except three of the discourses in this book, were given in Hindi in or around the &ldquo;Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; Year&rdquo;, 1969. These twenty-nine as well as other discourses from that period were recorded in the form of handwritten notes taken by A&#x301;c. Vijaya&#x301;nanda Avt. The others from that period have already been published in Bengali in Tattva Kaomudii Parts 2 and 3, and in both Bengali and English in Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Parts 4 and 5.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The [[twenty-nine discourses]] were originally published in English in various issues of &ldquo;Notes on Spiritual Philosophy&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;Seminar Notes&rdquo;) in 1969 or within a year or two thereafter. Minor English re-editing has been done by A&#x301;c. Acyuta&#x301;nanda Avt. The titles of two of the discourses as they appeared in &ldquo;Notes on Spiritual Philosophy&rdquo; have been changed here to avoid confusion with other discourses given at other times and places. &ldquo;Sva&#x301;bha&#x301;vika Dharma and Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma&rdquo; originally appeared as &ldquo;Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Atima&#x301;nasa Yoga Sama&#x301;dhi&rdquo; originally appeared as &ldquo;Sama&#x301;dhi&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Everywhere in this observable universe we find that there is a system. The mighty Himalayas follow a particular system. The wee bit of material expression also follows a particular system. Everywhere there is a system, there is an order. Nothing can be done in a disordered way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The smallest article that can be seen by the human intellect, if not by human eyes, is the atom. And in the atom also there is a particular system, the atomic system, and the centre, that is, the nucleus, has electrons moving round that nucleus. This is the atomic system. These systems are called cakras in Sanskrit. So for this atomic system the Sanskrit name should be pa&#x301;rama&#x301;n&#x301;avik cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The same system is followed by the earth also. Here in this ethereal system we see that in the middle is the earth, and the moon is moving around that nucleus. It is the same system. This one may be called pa&#x301;rthiva cakra. That one pa&#x301;rama&#x301;n&#x301;avik cakra, this one pa&#x301;rthiva cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now the next bigger cakra or bigger system is the solar system, and that is: the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving round that sun. The same system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->And the biggest cakra, the biggest system, is Brahma Cakra, the Cosmological system. In that Cosmological system, the nucleus is Purus&#x301;ottama. The hub of that Cosmic [[wheel]] is Purus&#x301;ottama, and so many jiivas [unit beings] are moving around that Purus&#x301;ottama. The same system. So this Cosmological system, or this Cosmological order, is called Brahma Cakra in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now in this cakra or in these cakras two forces are working: one is the eccentric force and the other is the concentric force. For this eccentric force, or centrifugal force, the Sanskrit term is Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or avidya&#x301; shakti; and the concentric force, or centripetal force, is called Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or vidya&#x301; shakti in Sanskrit. Both are Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Both concentric and eccentric, vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301;, are expressions of the same Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the same Creative Principle. And that Nucleus is the lord of that Creative Principle, is the sva&#x301;mii of that Creative Principle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now this avidya&#x301; shakti, or Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, centrifugal force, has got a two-fold expression, two different expressions. One is called viks&#x301;epa shakti and the other is called a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; has got two expressions. And jiivas are moving around this Nucleus Purus&#x301;ottama with the help of these two forces (&ldquo;two forces&rdquo; means Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;), and when a balance is there, a balance between Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; and Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, the radius of that jiiva&#146;s circle, the circle of that particular jiiva, will neither increase nor decrease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, the first portion of avidya&#x301; shakti is called viks&#x301;epa shakti in Sanskrit. Viks&#x301;epa means a repulsive force, the force repelling the jiiva from its Nucleus. That is, a jiiva is darted away, is drifted away, from its Nucleus by<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> propensities, by depraving ideas, by depraving propensities. So these depraving ideas or depraving propensities are what is called viks&#x301;epa shakti. Clear? The jiiva is darted away from Purus&#x301;ottama by mundane propensities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->And the second expression of avidya&#x301; shakti is a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. In Sanskrit a&#x301;varan&#x301;a means &ldquo;to cover&rdquo;. This shakti [force] is just like a black curtain in between Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; and jiiva. And because of that a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti, that dark curtain of a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti, that sombre curtain of a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti, jiivas cannot see the Lord. Jiivas think that &ldquo;Whatever we are doing, nobody sees, nobody can see&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;I am doing everything secretly, nobody will see me.&rdquo; The condition of a jiiva committing pa&#x301;pa [sin] secretly is just like that of a rabbit when followed by a hunter. It is said that when a rabbit, a hare, is followed by a hunter, it shuts its eyes with the help of its ears. And it thinks that &ldquo;As I am not seeing the hunter, the hunter is also not seeing me.&rdquo; And such is the condition of the jiiva under the influence of this a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. Due to viks&#x301;epa shakti it moves away from its Lord, and due to a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti it cannot see its Lord.<!-- /block --></p>

But the vision of his Lord remains unassailed by the cimmerian wonts of that a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. His vision can pierce through that black curtain. The jiiva committing misdeeds, committing sins, secretly, thinks that its action will remain covered forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->These are the two expressions of avidya&#x301; shakti: viks&#x301;epa shakti and a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>

The radius will go on decreasing in length. But this vidya&#x301; shakti has also got two influences on the minds of individuals, on microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Of these two expressions, the first one is called samvit shakti. Samvit means spiritual consciousness, spiritual awakening. A man engaged in bad things all of a sudden feels that &ldquo;No, I shouldn&#146;t do all these things. No, I should be a good man henceforward.&rdquo; Such an idea all of a sudden comes in his mind. And this thing, this change of mental tendency, is brought about by samvit shakti of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Do you follow? This is what is called samvit shakti. &ldquo;No, henceforward I must be a good man. No, henceforward I must be a spiritualist. I must not encourage any depraving idea.&rdquo; Samvit shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->And the second expression of Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is hla&#x301;dinii shakti. After a man decides that &ldquo;Henceforward I will be a good man, henceforward I will be a sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual practitioner],&rdquo; he gets the krpa&#x301; of that Almighty Lord. (Regarding krpa&#x301; I will say something afterwards.) And after getting His krpa&#x301; through some medium he gets initiation. After being initiated he is to move along that spiritual path. That movement along the spiritual path is brought about by hla&#x301;dinii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->This hla&#x301;dinii shakti is also known as Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti in Sanskrit. &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo; means spiritual aspirant, &ldquo;one who is engaged in a&#x301;ra&#x301;dhana&#x301;&rdquo;. One who is engaged in a&#x301;ra&#x301;dhana&#x301; is called &ldquo;Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;&rdquo; in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava [Vaishnavite] philosophy.

Each and every creature is moving like this. Their radii are neither increasing nor diminishing. If a man encourages Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; the radius will be diminished; if a man encourages Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; it will be enlarged, it will be increased.<!-- /block --></p>

Why do they hover round that Purus&#x301;ottama? Because in their minds there is a sense of separateness, sense of separation, from their Cosmic Lord. They think that they are separate entities from Purus&#x301;ottama. They do not feel their unison with Purus&#x301;ottama, that&#146;s why they hover round that Nucleus.

Here the rs&#x301;i [sage who composed the shloka] says that &ldquo;being benefited by Him, he becomes one with his Nucleus&rdquo; &ndash; the merger takes place, and he attains immortality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Mortality and immortality. This movement round that Nucleus takes place within the three fundamental factors of relativity. And those three fundamental factors are the spatial factor, the temporal factor and the personal factor. There are three fundamental factors in the sway of relativity, in the realm of relativity. And these three fundamental factors are time, space and person. Temporal bondage, spatial bondage and personal bondage. Jiivas move through the realm of these three factors. And this movement naturally brings about certain changes in their body and mind; and this change, this transmutation, this metamorphosis, is called death, is called ma&#x301;ran&#x301;a. What is ma&#x301;ran&#x301;a, what is death? Death means change. Death is nothing but change. From childhood, boyhood came &ndash; childhood died; from boyhood, adolescence came &ndash; boyhood died&#8230; So death means change. Death is nothing but change. When an old man dies and a babe is born, it is also a change. But where the link between the preceding stage and the succeeding stage is missing, we say it is physical death. Because in that case, that is, when an old man dies and a new babe takes a place and sits in a mother&#146;s womb, we cannot find the link. And that&#146;s why we say, &ldquo;That old man has died.&rdquo; This is also an ordinary change. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->But where there is no movement, we say those items moving round that Nucleus are passing through the realm of time, space and person; but the Nucleus doesn&#146;t pass through time, space and person. It is above the realm of time, space and person. It controls time, space and person. And that&#146;s why it undergoes no metamorphosis, it undergoes no transmutation. That&#146;s why it is beyond the pale of life and death. It is beyond the periphery of life and death. It is beyond the compass of woes and agonies. And that&#146;s why when one is ensconced in that supreme centre, one establishes oneself beyond life and death. One is established in amrtatva, one is established in immortality.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->God cannot have any partiality in Him. He has got equal love for each and every creature of this universe, for all animate and inanimate objects.

Equally on pa&#x301;piis [sinners] and pun&#x301;yava&#x301;nas [the virtuous]. But common people do not feel it, they do not feel that they are getting His krpa&#x301;. Why do they not feel it? That krpa&#x301;, that water of compassion, is being showered on each and every creature equally, but ordinary people do not feel that they are being drenched by those sacred waters. Why? Because they are holding the umbrella of vanity over their heads, that&#146;s why they are not being drenched. And what is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? You will have to remove that umbrella from above your head and get yourself drenched by the sacred water. You will have to remove that umbrella of vanity, you will have to remove that umbrella of hatred, you will have to remove that umbrella of shyness and get yourself drenched by that water; and then you will feel that you are being graced by Him. This is what is called krpa&#x301;. Krpa&#x301; is there, but you will have to come to feel it by your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And when you will remove that umbrella, you will get proper direction, and then you will be guided by hla&#x301;dinii shakti, by Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti. Here you will come in contact with His nu&#x301;pura dhvani [sound of ankle bells], you will come in contact with the enchanting flute of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

And in the second stage it is called nu&#x301;pura dhvani &ndash; a jhum jhum jhum jhum jhum jhum jhum jhum sound &ndash; like this. It is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asya nu&#x301;pura dhvani. In the third stage it is just like the sound of a flute, and it is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;asya ba&#x301;nsharii dhvani, muralii dhvani. You will hear these sounds both internally and externally.

So there must not be any inferiority complex in the mind of a sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual practitioner], there must not be any fear complex in the mind of a sa&#x301;dhaka, because sa&#x301;dhakas are progeny of the Supreme Progenitor, and the only goal for them, the only goal for a sa&#x301;dhaka, is that Supreme Father. A sa&#x301;dhaka will have to become one, rather, he will have to be unified, with the Supreme Father &ndash; not united, but unified.<!-- /block --></p>

That supreme unification is the goal of your life, and your march towards Him should be done through three vital factors.

Sometimes people ask questions only for the sake of knowledge, only for the sake of tarka [debate], but it is not pariprashna. Pariprashna means to know what to do and how to do. That is, the person is prepared to do something. He is prepared to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and for that purpose he wants to know how to do, what to do. This special type of question is called pariprashna. Sa&#x301;dhakas have got nothing to do with ordinary prashna [questions]. A sa&#x301;dhaka is to ask pariprashna &ndash; what I am to do, how am I to do. &ldquo;I am ready to do. I have got nothing to do with logicians&#146; philosophy.

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->According to our philosophy, dharma is of two broad categories: (1) sva&#x301;bha&#x301;vika dharma and (2) Bha&#x301;gavata dharma. Sva&#x301;bha&#x301;vika dharma means that dharma by the performance of which physical integrity is maintained &ndash; that is, a&#x301;ha&#x301;ra, nidra&#x301;, bhaya and maethuna [eating, sleeping, survival and procreation]. Bha&#x301;gavata dharma is that which differentiates human from non-human.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The object of both, sva&#x301;bha&#x301;vika dharma and Bha&#x301;gavata dharma, is the same: to get sukham [pleasure]. But in sva&#x301;bha&#x301;vika dharma the intensity of sukham is limited, while in Bha&#x301;gavata dharma it is beyond any measure, it is ananta. As a man thinks, Na&#x301;lpe sukhamasti Bhu&#x301;maeva sukham [&ldquo;One does not get infinite happiness from limited objects; one gets it only from something infinite&rdquo;]. One can be satisfied with Bha&#x301;gavata dharma alone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Bha&#x301;gavata dharma is quadruped: (1) Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, (2) vista&#x301;ra, (3) rasa and (4) seva&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->(2) The second leg is vista&#x301;ra, which means perpetual expansion beyond the scope of all relative horizons. This jagat [world] is the expanded form of vista&#x301;ra, that is, ka&#x301;rya bha&#x301;vana. Vista&#x301;rah sarvabhu&#x301;tasya Vis&#x301;n&#x301;orvishvamidam&#x301; jagat &ndash; &ldquo;The microcosm is to see Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u everywhere in this universe.&rdquo; This is what is known as A&#x301;tmavat sarvabhutes&#x301;u [&ldquo;One should see the A&#x301;tman, or Self, in all expressed objects&rdquo;]. The scope of expansion is infinite till one reaches Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u [Supreme Entity in the sense of that which pervades everything]. This is vista&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->(3) Rasa means &ldquo;flow&rdquo;. Human existence is a flow, or rasa; of the two ends of human existence, at one end there is Parama&#x301;tman, or Paramarasa, or the Macrocosmic flow; at the other there is vis&#x301;ayarasa, or the flow of the crude world. Now, human existence is svarasa. In Tantra there is a type of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, that is, rasa sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The object of rasa sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to merge the svarasa (entitative rhythm) into parama rasa (Macrocosmic rhythm). The conception of ra&#x301;saliila&#x301; has been derived from the idea of Purus&#x301;ottama [Nucleus Consciousness] encircled by innumerable devotees (svarasas); each and every svarasa tries to become one with Paramarasa (Parama Purus&#x301;a [or Purus&#x301;ottama]). This is what is known as ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;. Here the sa&#x301;dhakas will accept the divine wish as their own wish.

There is a gradual differentiation and integration of the three gun&#x301;as, and as a result of their combination in different proportions, the various objects of the world originate.

<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Origin of Life: Mechanism and Vitalism<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->What is life? Mechanism makes no distinction between organic and inorganic. In explaining life, from the simplest amoeba to the most complex human beings, it assumes no other materials and no other forces than those present in inorganic nature, as for instance in the formation of rock or of chemical compounds. The physical and chemical laws that operate in the inorganic world are regarded as sufficient to explain all forms of life. Ultimately, according to mechanism, living things can be adequately described in terms of just matter and motion. Ultimately living things are all groupings of the same primitive atoms whirling through space.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Mechanism describes the origin of life in this way: Atoms of creation &ndash; hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, etc. &ndash; moving by the forces pertaining to them, strike against one another and adhere together in clusters and arrange themselves at last into the protoplasmic cell with which life begins. Next, the movements of atoms within the cell draw into it (the cell) more atoms from outside and at last split it up into two cells; and these ultimately split into many thousands. Then follow interactions of the different cells, leading to their differentiation into the tissues and organs having different functions. Finally, the motions of the atoms and interactions of the organs spontaneously adjust themselves in such a way as to reach a state of moving, self-sustaining equilibrium which constitutes the living organism as a whole. So it will be found that life is nothing other than this mechanical resultant of interaction of the molecules constituting the body. If we understand life in this way, as the equilibrium of colliding atoms, we have to admit that living creatures originate from that which is lifeless &ndash; the theory of abiogenesis. This is the theory of mechanism in its essence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->It is difficult to explain life by means of matter and motion only. The animal sense acts for its own preservation. When I step on a floating log and find it to be a crocodile, the change in my knowledge is due to the kind of motion in the crocodile which logs do not and cannot present: a flexible action which appears to come from within and to aim at self-preservation. There is something else that is real in a living body besides the material elements and the physical and chemical processes, to account for its characteristic behaviour. Thus we are led to the opposite theory of vitalism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->The vitalist argument may be briefly stated thus: Every living object is an organized whole. Its parts exist and function for the organism&#146;s total well-being. In it the whole exercises control over the parts. And there, in that power, lies the instinctive character of life. Nowhere in the inorganic world can this characteristic be found. The characteristic power of life can be detailed as follows: <ol> <li>The power which the organism possesses for exposing its own molecules to oxidation for the production of heat and energy. <li>The power to apply part of its energy to change its own form and position in such a way as to resist external forces and adapt itself better to outward circumstances for the preservation of its whole being: for example, the movement of an insect towards food or away from an injurious object. <li>The power of applying part of its energy to seizing for itself materials from outside and assimilating them to its own body, thereby making up the internal waste. <li>The power of coordinating the work of different organs so as to make them cooperate for the good of the whole system, and, if necessary, compensating the loss of the function of any injured organ through the strengthening of some other organ. <li>The power of giving off cells in the form of buds or germs which grow into new organisms, and thereby of preserving the species for unknown ages. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->None of these powers oriented to the single goal of the whole organism&#146;s well-being fall within the scope of the mechanist explanation. This is why we have to postulate the pressure of something new in the living organism to explain these peculiar functions. And this is entelechy, or the vital principle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The main objection to the vitalists&#146; theory of life is that there is an element of mystery about the concept of the vital principle.<!-- /block --></p>

In Sanskrit the word pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h &ldquo;is always used in the plural number, because it is a collection of ten va&#x301;yus, or ten important forces working within&#8230; the physical structure.&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The external pressure of the static principle on the&#8230; five factors is known as bala. As a result of this bala, two opposing forces develop.&#8230; The centre-seeking or interial force tries to maintain the structural solidarity of the object, while the centrifugal one has a fissiparous tendency, that is, it tries to split up the object into thousands. The collective name of these exterial and interial forces is pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, or &ldquo;energy&rdquo;. Every solid factor therefore possesses pra&#x301;n&#x301;a. Pra&#x301;n&#x301;a is the eternal game between the Cosmic cause and its crudest effect. In pra&#x301;n&#x301;a there exists an internal clash in which either of the aforesaid active forces may win. If the interial forces win, that is, if the resultant force created happens to be interial in character, a nucleus is formed within the solid factor. Under such circumstances a solid structure is created and maintenance of its physical solidarity depends upon the bala or external pressure.&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>

These physical structures are composed of five fundamental factors &ndash; ethereal, aerial, luminous, liquid, and solid &ndash; and so, for their own existence as unit structures, they must have the controlling nuclei of the respective factors within their composite body. All these factors should remain in requisite proportion, and on the mutual cohesion amongst these factors depends the resultant interial, or the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h. The controlling nucleus of all these fundamental physical nuclei is the controlling point of the collective pra&#x301;n&#x301;a.

<a name="6..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Development of the organism is a phenomenon  of the progressive manifestation of dormant consciousness. The first and primary streak of awakened consciousness finds its way through the crudest portion of the mind-entity. With simple cellular structures, the mind is confined to a few expressed elements of the body, its pleasure and protection. Whatever propensity exists is only for protecting  the entity against environmental pressures and for increasing the number of similar creatures. That is why uni-cellular organisms are equipped with intense sexual power. Both male and female capacities are combined in the one body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The plant world that precedes the cellular animal organisms also has the privilege of the manifestation of mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->In the cellular animal organisms, however, the expressions of propensities are very distinct. Though the initial tendencies remain confined to the preservation of material existence, with a gradual instinctive clash in progress, new propensities find their way, making the manifestation of the dormant consciousness still more distinct as the older structures are evolved into the forms of new species.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The organs themselves are shaped and their relative strength is determined according to the needs of the mind for preserving the body against environmental conditions. Thus the physical structure goes on developing and getting complex with the development of the mind. The dimension of the psychic plate increases with the increase in the number of propensities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->The power of self-expression remains confined to the instinctive desires of self-preservation and procreation in the most underdeveloped organisms. But with the widening of the psychic horizon, this power goes on increasing and finally finds the highest expression in the form of human beings. Lower organisms are slaves to matter &ndash; they can make adjustments in the environment but cannot mould it. According to the degree of freedom, their existential consciousness has formed the body-feeling; their power of doership increases; and accordingly they become competent to turn the environment to their advantage. An ape can throw a rock or a branch of a tree in self-preservation, but a serpent has to rely on its poisonous gland. Nature has provided the lower organisms with sufficient weapons of protection in their own bodies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->With the increase in psychic power, fierce physical potentialities go on waning, and at the stage of human beings the power of protection lies more with the mind than with the body. Though the acquired tendencies of the animal play no mean role in the life of human beings, the developed ego-consciousness or intellectual faculty finds adequate expression in their behaviour. It is they alone who have the power to introspect within the real nature of their existence and find its final abode, or generative place. Animal consciousness identifies body-consciousness with the existential consciousness, but human consciousness tries to investigate on the synthetic plane.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Though the potentiality of the highest consciousness is always latent even in the lowest organisms, its coruscation becomes clearer with the increased circumference of the mind. This presupposes the adequate and consummate unfolding or awakening of the working and  intuitive intellects. It is on the pure existential intellect that the reflection of the Cognitive Entity or Knower-Progenitor finds clearest expression. As the lower rungs of psychic consciousness are merged in the intuitive intellect through the sublimation of propensities, the feeling of body and environment merges in the surging flows of Cognitive Force and the unit loses its individuality for the time. If the cerebral nerves stop functioning and all the psychic momenta of the past are exhausted, the unit existential intellect loses its entity permanently in the ocean of blissful Consciousness. This is the end of the journey of the microcosm.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Gun&#x301;a here [in spiritual philosophy] means &ldquo;binding principle,&rdquo; not &ldquo;quality&rdquo; as it commonly implies. Purus&#x301;a is pure consciousness; it cannot be activated without a second principle.

<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Even after the formation of the Cosmic Mind, the process of sain&#x32D;cara<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> continues under the gradually-increasing domination of static Prakrti, and, as per degrees of crudification, the ethereal, aerial, luminous, liquid and solid factors come into being. The stronger the bondage upon anything, the cruder the thing becomes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->On account of the firmness of bondage, the inter-atomic and inter-molecular distances go on decreasing, as the result of which the internal frictions in the material body go on increasing. The external pressure of attributional bondage and the internal frictions compel greater and greater attributional expressions in the bodies of objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Here one should bear in mind that &ldquo;attributional expression&rdquo; does not mean the [amount] of attributional capabilities, but the [variety] of the attributional manifestations as well as the attributional diversities. The a&#x301;ka&#x301;shatattva [ethereal factor] has the sound-carrying attribute. If, suppose, we fix its measure at one hundred, in that case, when the a&#x301;ka&#x301;shatattva gets metamorphosed into the va&#x301;yutattva [aerial factor], on account of greater static bondage, the attribute of touch is also expressed therein along with the sound-carrying attribute. [I.e., as a result of further crudification of ether into air, it has both the attribute of carrying sound and that of carrying touch. A new attribute is expressed.] But the [total] attributional capacity remains what it is &ndash; unenhanced. The sound-carrying attribute wanes in the va&#x301;yutattva as compared to the a&#x301;ka&#x301;shatattva, but, all the same, the combined measure of the sonic and the tactual attributes still remains at one hundred.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In exactly the same way, when the aerial factor becomes metamorphosed into the luminous factor as a result of greater static bondage, there emerges a third attribute of form in addition to the former two attributes of sound and touch. Degrees of the aforesaid two attributes wane in correlation with a&#x301;ka&#x301;shatattva [ethereal factor] and va&#x301;yutattva [aerial factor]. Likewise, due to more and more crudification, along with the emergence of apatattva [liquid factor] and ks&#x301;ititattva [solid factor], the two more attributes of taste and smell occur, and to that extent, the degrees of the former attributes of sound, touch and form decrease as compared to the other factors. And the total capacity still remains unenhanced.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Thus we find that the stronger the bondage, the cruder the thing becomes with the origination of more attributes.

<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Jad&#x301;asphot&#x301;a means &ldquo;material explosion&rdquo; of any physical body. In the process of centrifugal movement in sain&#x32D;cara, the material body composed of five fundamental factors comes into being. But even after that stage, the static Prakrti exerts her crudifying force. This external pressure from static Prakrti is known as bala.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->As a result of this bala, two opposing forces develop, one centrifugal and the other centripetal in character. The centre-seeking or interial [centripetal] force tries to maintain the structural solidarity of the object; while the centrifugal one has a fissiparous tendency, that is, it tries to split up the object into thousands.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->When the structural solidarity of anything is maintained, it means that in that particular unit structure, all the component five factors are in requisite proportion,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..12"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->But if the exterial forces win, the resultant exterial cannot form any nucleus within that physical structure. The resultant interial force, therefore, is the only factor that can create a nucleus within a solid body and thereby maintain its structural solidarity. Even if the structural solidarity of the unit be maintained, there can be spaces or portions within the unit structure where the exterial forces dominate over the reacting materials.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In such a portion dissociation occurs and the portions under the influences of a resultant exterial force get detached from the parent body.

<a name="7..14"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The wear and tear within a physical structure results in the deficiency of some factor or other and may also tell upon the resultant activity controlling the subjective nucleus and maintaining structural solidarity. Now if the deficiency caused thereby is not adequately compensated, and if the requisite proportion of any factor or factors is not met, the resultant interial will begin varying in intensity; and the unit structure may lose its solidarity.&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..15"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Even if the resultant interial be the winning factor in pra&#x301;n&#x301;a, the physical structure will split up into innumerable subtler particles if the atmospherical condition be not congenial to the expression of the vital energy. In the absence of a proper environment life does not get an expression; but static Prakrti continues exerting external pressure or bala on the unit structure. Consequently a stage will come when there will be little interatomic space within the solid body. Now if static Prakrti exerts more pressure, [the equipoise of the component elements gets lost and] there will be a tremendous reaction within the physical body (affecting both the interial and exterial forces) resulting in structural dissociation. This is called jad&#x301;asphot&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Jad&#x301;asphot&#x301;a occurs only in dead or dying celestial bodies. In a living celestial body, the existing congenial environment will be the cause of transformation of pra&#x301;n&#x301;a into pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h. This eliminates the chance of jad&#x301;asphot&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>

The ego does not appear in the primary stage of mental creation. Under such circumstances the blind pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;h [vital energy] cannot activate the physical structure. In this initial stage, the functions of the mind are for maintenance of the entitative structure and for procreation. It is nothing but the ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a [crude mind].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This undeveloped mind gradually proceeds on the path of pratisain&#x32D;cara. As it comes close to the Nucleus its scope is diluted. This dilution is not abrupt. There are many intermediate stages of evolution. At first, only the citta portion exists. Citta is the crudest counterpart of the mind. This mind is attracted to the Nucleus, and at the same time there are physical and psychic clashes. As a result of this, there is tremendous internal friction, which subtilizes the crude mind. The aham&#x301;tattva is subtler than the citta. In the later stage of evolution of mind a portion of the citta is converted into aham&#x301;tattva. That means that in that mind there are citta and aham&#x301;tattva both. But the area of the citta is bigger than that of the aham&#x301;tattva. In certain creepers and plants we find these two parts of the mind. The mind where there exists only citta can take the form of the matter around it, but as there is no aham, or ego, it cannot use the matter. And due to the absence of mahattattva, it has no feeling of existence either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->But the mind where there exists citta and aham&#x301;tattva both can take the ideation of matter with the help of the citta and keep contact with matter through the aham&#x301;tattva. But due to the lack of mahattattva, it does not feel that it exists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->These creepers and plants where both citta and aham&#x301;tattva exist are underdeveloped organisms. If the body of one of these organisms is bisected, the two separate parts will be two organisms again. No part will die, because in that mind there was no unit feeling of separate existence. The branches of certain flower plants are [cut off] for a separate plant. In those plants there is absence of mahattattva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In developed organisms there are citta, aham&#x301;tattva and mahattattva. As a result of continuous clashes and attraction, certain parts of aham&#x301;tattva are converted into the subtler part of the mind &ndash; mahattattva. But even in that case, the area of mahat will be smaller than that of aham&#x301;tattva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Gradually the internal friction increases and the mind becomes more and more subtle. The dimension of aham becomes greater than that of citta. Therefore the citta remains inside the aham&#x301;tattva.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Greater attraction from the Nucleus increases the scope of mahattattva and it envelops aham&#x301;tattva. That mind is superior to all lower minds. And the organism possessing that mind becomes conscious of its existence and is called a human being. The fundamental difference between the mind of a developed organism having citta, aham&#x301;tattva and mahattattva, and the mind of a human having mahattattva, aham and citta, is that the former is guided by instinct because the scope of the citta is bigger than that of the other two parts, while the latter is guided by intellect and intuition, because in it the scope of the mahat and the aham is bigger than that of the citta.<!-- /block --></p>

While dreaming, the crude or conscious mind remains dormant, the subconscious and the unconscious minds remain active. During sleep [and during senselessness], only the unconscious mind remains active. The opinion that the state of sleep is the state of the sense of vacuity is unacceptable to a subtle philosophical judgement, because at that time the works of both the conscious and the subconscious minds are done by the unconscious mind. The real state of vacuity is verily the state of utter destruction of the mind, and so even savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi is not a state of vacuity. Only the state of nirvikalpa is the state of vacuity. In this state of absolute vacuity, the spiritual waves of exhilaration that fill the unit entity still continue to flow and trail on for some time even after that state of vacuity, that is, after the mind returns due to unserved sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [the consequential reactive momenta of one&#146;s past deeds]. These very trailing waves of exhilaration and joyous exuberance keep reminding the &ldquo;mindful&rdquo; sa&#x301;dhaka [intuitional practitioner] that his or her &ldquo;mindless&rdquo; state had been one of absolute bliss.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The Transcendental Entity, or Purus&#x301;a, is one infinite entity and its immanent principles are the sentient, the mutative and the static. In the Supreme Purus&#x301;a, a countless number of linear waves are emanating in the different flows of the sentient, mutative and static principles. These triple-attributional flows are running from [all] sides in infinite directions. When they run parallel, no figure is formed. But when they lose parallelism, they form multi-conical or polygonal diagrams. All these forces are belligerent in nature. Prakrti here is called anucchu&#x301;nya&#x301; (unmanifested) and Brahma here is objectless (nis&#x301;kala), because there is no question of subjectivation or objectivation. Brahma is nirgun&#x301;a here because the balanced Prakrti has not been able to influence Brahma. Later on, these polygonal diagrams gradually get transformed into triangles of forces due to homomorphic evolution, or svaru&#x301;pa parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma. This triangle of forces is endless and is flowing eternally.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the initial stage, there is balance in the triangular figure. The reason for formation of triangular figures is this, that when more than two forces act at a place, the figure of forces tends to become triangular in shape. The multi-conical figures have been transformed into a triangle of forces, but no resultant is formed, because of proper adjustment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This triangle of forces, or Gun&#x301;ayantraka, is called Srs&#x301;t&#x301;ima&#x301;trka&#x301;, or the Causal Matrix. Because, though the actual creation does not start from this stage, metamorphosis is imminent. Very soon the forces lose their equipoise and the unbalanced forces burst out through one of the vertices and start the creational evolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->So long as these forces maintain a perfect equipoise, Prakrti is called Mu&#x301;la&#x301; Prakrti. But these forces cannot remain equipoised forever. When the three forces act on the three sides of the triangle with their respective natures and degrees of influence, it is just possible that one force will enter into the sphere of another force, which will result in change in the pattern of attributional flows. Moreover, when forces act on the same line, the forces will change their respective peculiarities. In this process of mutual conversion, the sentient is penetrating into the mutative, the mutative into the static[, the static into the mutative and the mutative into the sentient.] There is a constant exchange of identities amongst the three fundamental principles. This mutual exchange or transformation is called svaru&#x301;pa parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma, or homomorphic evolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The triangle of forces is flowing endlessly. The conical points of these triangles are called biija bindu. The forces of triangles are mutually transformed due to homomorphic evolution. The three gun&#x301;as have three types of vibration, and according to the nature of these vibrations, the respective properties of these gun&#x301;as are determined. Due to the homomorphic evolution, one gun&#x301;a is constantly transformed into another at the conical points. As a result, the three forces, due to non-uniformity of flow, cannot remain in a triangular figure, and the resultant force is compelled to burst out of one of the vertices. This bursting out of the forces through one of the vertical points signifies the state of disequilibrium in the triangle of forces, and the point through which the unbalanced forces burst out is called ka&#x301;mabiija. This imbalance or lack of balance is [called] gun&#x301;aks&#x301;obha in Tantra. From this point of bursting out, the creation starts, and Prakrti starts exerting influence on Purus&#x301;a. That is why this point is called the noumenal cause of the phenomenal.<!-- /block --></p>

That is, the sentient changes into sentient, the mutative into mutative and the static into static. Such transformation of gun&#x301;as is called svaru&#x301;pa parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="11..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In our philosophical treatise, A&#x301;nanda Su&#x301;tram, it has been enunciated, Bha&#x301;va bha&#x301;va&#x301;tiitayoh setuh Ta&#x301;rakabrahma &ndash; &ldquo;The common point bridging together the empirical state of Sagun&#x301;a and the metempirical state of Nirgun&#x301;a is called Ta&#x301;raka Brahma.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

The speed of the sentient force is greater than that of the mutative, and the mutative has more speed than the static. Thus in the beginning of sain&#x32D;cara the speed is greater. Similarly, after elevation, under the influence of the sentient force or reaching sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya deha (a stage beyond the hiran&#x301;maya kos&#x301;a [subtle causal mind] where the unit mind experiences only the sentient force), the speed is greater. The speed of the unit mind far exceeds the normal flow in the Cosmos, and it gets accelerated if the unit mind as a result of spiritual practice tends itself towards the Nucleus Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="11..3"></a><p class="Para_Quote"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Since the beginning of creation humans have been aspiring for this merger with the Nucleus Consciousness. The non-uniformity of speed changes the movement of the unit mind to an elliptical force, and the motion changes to oval from circular.&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>

At this point of tangential touch is the abode of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma (who resides within the scope of both Nirgun&#x301;a and Sagun&#x301;a Brahma). Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is a concept of Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>

When Ta&#x301;raka Brahma by His own will takes the help of the five fundamental factors (the pain&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;tas), His physical entity comes within the scope of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, otherwise He is Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. When Ta&#x301;raka Brahma takes the assistance of the five fundamental factors, according to Tantra it is called His Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti.&#8230;<!-- /block --></p>

Nirgun&#x301;a is the Objectless Entity with no action or derivation, but Ta&#x301;raka Brahma is the middle point and can fulfil the function of both. He guides, loves and favours His affectionate sons and daughters. His children say that He cannot live without loving them [and with deepest reverence and complete surrender proceed to Him].

When dharma declines and adharma, or sin, gets the upper hand; when the virtuous and the pious are tortured and the dishonest and evil-doers tyrannize over the good; in a word, when the human intellect is guided along degraded and destructive channels; Ta&#x301;raka Brahma forms a desire to come on earth with a specific mission of restoring dharma by launching a ceaseless fight against all injustice and sin.<!-- /block --></p>

Because that point is the veritable link between the relative world and the Absolute; the point exists where the relative world ends and the Absolute begins. This point is representative of the Cosmic Entity. Once this point is controlled, the attainment of the highest state of spirituality becomes easy.

The only thing essential is one&#146;s unshaken faith in one&#146;s goal, and persistent efforts. That will please Parama Purus&#x301;a so much that He will most graciously lift the veil of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; from the jiiva [unit being] and make him or her free.

Sometimes due to their momentary weaknesses they commit some mistakes or crimes; but after all, they are manifestations of God. Everyone is a divine creature and everyone is destined to be perfect some day or other. Whatever we are now is the result of our thoughts and actions in the past, and whatever we shall be in the future will be the result of what we think and do now. Our past actions determine our present state, and our thoughts and actions now will determine our future.

In Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava [Vaishnavite] philosophy, these various states of spiritual ecstasy are described as dasha&#x301;, bha&#x301;va&#x301; and maha&#x301;bha&#x301;va.<!-- /block --></p>

The one thing that always counts is one&#146;s latent devotion and great desire to become pure and holy in life. The rest is managed by God. Since diehard criminals of this type were changed into holy men in only a short time, there is no reason why others also might not be equally blessed by the Lord. The Lord&#146;s blessings and mercy are always with men and women. Just as God has His duty towards human beings, human beings have a duty towards God. The duty of humans is to perform only those deeds which will give pleasure to God. God never makes any distinction between a holy man and a so-called sinful man. If God wills, that so-called sinful man may become a great devotee of God in no time.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="14..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In philosophical parlance, sama&#x301;dhi means unification of the unit mind with the Cosmic Mind, or merger of the unit mind into the Cosmic Mind. Ordinarily, the conscious mind performs physical actions through sense organs and nerve-cells and nerve-fibres, while the subconscious performs thinking, recollection, etc., and the unconscious is all-knowing. In sama&#x301;dhi, the three chambers of the mind are fused into one. During sama&#x301;dhi, the mind remains full of knowledge (prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;). This is a positive state; though the mind remains inactive, still it is full of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Mrtyu, death, on the other hand, is a negative state. Because of lack of psycho-physical parallelism, the sense organs, the nerve-cells, nerve-fibres, etc., will stop functioning, as a result of which the entire body will be as inert as a block of wood, that is, hardly distinguishable from matter. All the expressions of mental faculties become suspended. It is a state of complete lifelessness devoid of any prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sama&#x301;dhi is not possible merely through one&#146;s own efforts. It is absolutely dependent on the grace of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. Death is a providential arrangement. Man must make efforts to attain sama&#x301;dhi. So far as death is concerned, it will come as a matter of course. Through this arrangement of death, Parama Purus&#x301;a is continuing the flow of creation; otherwise this creation would have stopped. It is natural that when people lose their dear and near ones, they feel the pangs of bereavement. When operated upon, patients certainly feel pain, but all these things are unavoidable. One who is born must die. Anything, once created, must undergo change and, ultimately, meet destruction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Suppose somebody does something which may cause some physical harm, should we call it the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of death or of prajin&#x32D;a&#x301;? Those who subject themselves to all sorts of tortures, who stand in deep water on chilly nights for hours together, are certainly not making spiritual progress. Even those who are taking holy baths on Ma&#x301;ghii Purn&#x301;ima&#x301; [the full moon of mid-February to mid-March] are not enhancing their spiritual progress. If merely a dip in the Ganges made one holy, then the fish that are always in the river would be the most virtuous and holy. Pilgrims do not gain morally or spiritually from their holy baths, but, on the contrary, have to suffer bitter experiences &ndash; physical troubles, loss of money, mental anxiety, and humiliation at the hands of robbers and thieves. Spiritual elevation is possible by introverting all the mental propensities and directing them towards the Supreme Desideratum (one&#146;s dhyeya [object of ideation]) and thus becoming one with Him.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Psycho-physical parallelism is very easy, while psycho-spiritual parallelism requires repeated mental efforts. That is why wise sa&#x301;dhakas superimpose Brahmabha&#x301;va on physical objects and mental thoughts. At once they cease to be physical or mental, they become spiritual. After all, each and every object &ndash; physical or psychic &ndash; is nothing but an expression of Brahma. As a result, one will not have to reap the consequences of one&#146;s actions. This is the only way by which one can prevent one&#146;s mind from being crudified due to constant psycho-physical parallelism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ordinarily, people who are not on sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; ma&#x301;rga [the spiritual path] look upon physical things as mere things. While they eat food, drink water, read books, talk to friends or perform any action, they get into bondages due to work. Their minds become assailed by karma bandhana. They won&#146;t attain salvation till their sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are finally exhausted. Hence to get rid of this karma bandhana [bondage of action and reaction], one must take Brahmabha&#x301;va [ideation on the Supreme].<!-- /block --></p>

The latter is only preferred till one experiences the former; once parama rasa is tasted, the other becomes tasteless. On this point Bhusuku humorously remarked: A&#x301;j ba&#x301;un&#x32D;a&#x301;lii haili [&ldquo;I became a ba&#x301;un&#x32D;a&#x301;lii today&rdquo; (Ba&#x301;un&#x32D;a&#x301;lii can mean Bengalee)].

<a name="17..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the course of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual practitioner] has to pass through four stages: yatama&#x301;na, vyatireka, ekendriya and vashiika&#x301;ra. There is a shloka [couplet]:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Yacchedva&#x301;un&#x32D;manasi prajin&#x32D;astadyacchejjin&#x32D;a&#x301;na a&#x301;tmani;<br>Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nama&#x301;tmani mahati niyacchettadyaccheccha&#x301;nta a&#x301;tmani.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[Wise persons first merge their indriyas, sense organs, into their citta, then their citta into aham, then aham into mahat, then mahat into jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;, and finally their jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; into Supreme Consciousness.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In yatama&#x301;na, the first stage, the mental propensities are directed towards the citta [objective mind, mind-stuff]. It is a very difficult stage: difficulties arise from within as well as without. The internal difficulties are created by the untrained mental propensities, which misbehave like wild animals. After a moment of control, off they go again, dashing about like unbroken horses. The external troubles arise from concerned friends and relatives who resent the spiritual beginner&#146;s efforts. They fear that he will become an ascetic and renounce worldly ties. These internal distractions and external pressures try the patience and steadfastness of the spiritual novice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the second stage, vyatireka, the propensities are directed from the citta to the aham&#x301;tattva [doer &ldquo;I&rdquo;]. This stage is less trying than yatama&#x301;na. In fact, occasionally it is slightly pleasing. The kicking wild horses have been broken to some extent, and for brief intervals these partially-tamed mental propensities do follow the direction from the citta to the aham&#x301;tattva. During these intervals the sa&#x301;dhaka enjoys bits, shreds, and glimpses of bliss. Tears of such bliss may roll down his cheeks. In this period the external pressures are also lessened, because friends and relatives have become somewhat reconciled to the other-worldly pursuits of the sa&#x301;dhaka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the third stage, ekendriya, the upward direction is followed from the aham&#x301;tattva to the mahattattva. As the very name ekendriya implies,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> the sa&#x301;dhaka gains control over some single propensity or organ, which brings to him a corresponding occult power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Occult power (called vibhu&#x301;ti or aeshvarya in Sanskrit) is the supernatural power gained from the practice of the psychic mystic cult. The eight vibhu&#x301;tis are an&#x301;ima&#x301;, laghima&#x301;, mahima&#x301;, pra&#x301;pti, iishitva, vashitva, pra&#x301;ka&#x301;mya, and antarya&#x301;mitva. This stage marks a great step forward. However, this is a dangerous stage also. The danger comes more from inside than from outside. The sa&#x301;dhaka may get intoxicated with the feeling of the occult power and be tempted to abuse it. Moreover, there is the external threat that somebody may provoke him into such abuse. Any misuse of these powers causes a setback or even a downfall in the spiritual journey. Abuse of power is bad in any sphere. Even in the temporal sphere misuse of power leads to downfall. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely &ndash; unless there is the strength to control the power.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The fourth and last stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is that of vashiika&#x301;ra, when the propensities are all completely directed from the mahattattva towards the one original and ultimate Self: that is, the sa&#x301;dhaka is established in his svabha&#x301;va [nature] and svaru&#x301;pa [own form]. As the very word vashiika&#x301;ra implies [vash means &ldquo;control&rdquo;], all the propensities are completely under control. Worldly friends and relatives have already deserted the sa&#x301;dhaka as they desert a dead body after cremation or burial, and he becomes merged in the permanent and lasting Self, Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The sa&#x301;dhaka should ask for and pray for the Lord Himself and nothing else. He should not even pray for worldly power without at the same time praying for the ability through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to restrain that power. Better still, if the Lord is so omnipotent as to be able to grant the worldly power and the spiritual strength to restrain that power, then why not pray for the Lord Himself? Boons (barada&#x301;nas) may be pleasing to some, but in reality they are simply an adjustment in time, shape, or [degree of concentration or dispersion] of what the sa&#x301;dhaka is entitled to by virtue of his karma. If one attempts to acquire power that is beyond his due, he may find that his inability to handle it makes a menace out of a seeming boon.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->There is the story of the grant of a dried hand of a monkey to an aspirant. The dried hand was powerful enough to fulfil three wishes. The grantee first of all demanded a fortune of fifty thousand rupees from the dried hand. In a few moments there came a knock at his door and a man appeared with fifty thousand rupees; but this money represented the insurance payment of his son, who had suddenly died in an accident. The grantee, who regarded himself as a clever person, demanded as the second request that the son should be brought to him alive. In a few moments there came the clattering sound of somebody approaching the house. When the father looked out, to his horror, what was coming was the skeleton of his deceased son. It was walking by itself and therefore might be said to be alive, but it was nevertheless a skeleton. The father was so terrified that he asked the dried hand of the monkey to drive the skeleton away. The dried hand did this, but it was the last of the three wishes and the dried hand was exhausted of its power. So the father got his fifty thousand rupees, but lost his son.<!-- /block --></p>

(Padma because of the lotus-like shape.) The Tibetan prayer On&#x32D;m&#x301; man&#x301;ipadme hummm refers to the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra, the starting-point of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, with hummm referring to the struggle that we call sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

This feeling that the jiiva is not alone, but that the Lord is with the person, is a sign that the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra has been crossed. The colour visible here is the golden yellow of the earth and the sound is like the tick-tick of the cricket. The shape is square.<!-- /block --></p>

The sound resembles that of the pa&#x301;yala, bells affixed to a dancer&#146;s legs. The colour is a watery white and the shape the half-moon.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The crossing of the man&#x301;ipura cakra produces the feeling of close touch, sa&#x301;yujya. The sound is like a sweet flute, the colour is red, and the shape is triangular.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The crossing of the vishuddha cakra produces the feeling of sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi, the feeling of &ldquo;I am He.&rdquo; There is no particular shape and there is a mixture of various colours. The earlier sounds of bell, flute and sea develop into the beginning of the sound on&#x32D;m, and this becomes clearer and clearer until the full-fledged on&#x32D;m sound comes at last.<!-- /block --></p>

The remaining feeling is now simply of oneness. This feeling is called kaevalya, and there is no sound and there is no colour, because there is no expression. The state of kaevalya has some internal stages, and the last stage is called nirbiija nirvikalpa.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Those who proclaim any philosophy other than the ultimate and everlasting preach falsity. Those who profess a faith claiming to be the last word from the last prophet follow an incorrect line. Prout [Progressive Utilization Theory] philosophy is ahead of such philosophies and faiths. As is stated in its fifth principle, it is a philosophy which not only sets its goal as the ultimate subjectivity (Brahma, who is unchangeable and eternal), but also adopts the objective course of adjustment according to time, space and person.<!-- /block --></p>

In this way sama&#x301;dhi can be induced from any cakra. But a success easily gained may not be fully appreciated and valued. Therefore, normally the sa&#x301;dhaka should be allowed to work out his success through the hard way of diligent sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

But the unconscious helps only slightly and indirectly in the subconscious mind; therefore, once the subconscious fully gives way to the unconscious, the control is lost and the body falls. That is why sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; has to be performed sitting in a firm a&#x301;sana (posture) and on a blanket or other protection, so that, should the body fall, there may be the least possible injury to the head.<!-- /block --></p>

The sa&#x301;dhaka should help other persons spiritually. Those engaged in worldly life should serve mankind in worldly matters, while those leading spiritual lives should serve humanity in the development of their spiritual potential. Prout wants maximum utilization of the spiritual potential of the unit as well as of the universe. Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; said that the avadhu&#x301;ta who had been one of the media of the demonstration had been a great saint in his previous life, his only sin having been his self-centred abstention from any spiritual help to mankind.]<!-- /block --></p>

Often the subconscious ceases also, leaving only the unconscious to continue the work of the brain. However, sometimes the nerve-cells begin functioning during the latter part of the night, due to sudden heat in the back portion of the cranium or to an upward movement of gastric wind. The subconscious mind accordingly starts thinking or remembering, producing dreams. In the absence of the functioning of the conscious mind, these products of the subconscious are accepted as true and practical. Sometimes the dreamer actually believes that he is flying, for the non-functioning of the conscious mind prevents him from perceiving this idea to be pure imagination. Some people become extremely frightened by their dreams and produce inarticulate mutterings of fear; at times dreamers even die of heart failure. To assist a person out of a disturbing dream it helps to bring the person&#146;s hands or feet into contact with the ground, for this aids the conscious mind in beginning to function again.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Even a golden vessel needs polishing occasionally. Unmaintained it gathers dust and dirt and loses its lustre. Similarly, even a good person or a sa&#x301;dhaka needs proper maintenance, for in a world of constant change, care must be taken that the change be always towards the better or the higher. Keeping good company is essential for this positive development. While bad company strengthens the bondage of the soul, good company is conducive to liberation and salvation. The keeping of good company is conducive to liberation and is known as satsaun&#x32D;ga in Sanskrit. When satsaun&#x32D;ga is followed, either physically or mentally or both, the subconscious mind, and thus the conscious mind, are charged with better and higher influences. This change will move the follower forward towards higher and better goals. The alternative is asatsaun&#x32D;ga, the keeping of bad company, which leads one into greater and greater bondage. It has been said:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Satsaungena bhavenmuktirasatsaunges&#x301;u bandhanam;<br>Asatsaun&#x32D;ga mudran&#x301;am yat tanmudra&#x301; parikiirtita&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This means that through satsaun&#x32D;ga one achieves liberation; whereas asatsaun&#x32D;ga leads to greater bondage. [And the meaning of the second line is: &ldquo;The mudran&#x301;am &ndash; shunning &ndash; of bad company is called mudra&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There are two types of satsaun&#x32D;ga &ndash; external and internal. Just as the best medicine is Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself, the best satsaun&#x32D;ga is also Parama Purus&#x301;a. Internal satsaun&#x32D;ga is the satsaun&#x32D;ga of Parama Purus&#x301;a, that is, the thought of Parama Purus&#x301;a during all the [waking] hours of the day, even when the bodily organs are engaged in worldly activities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Internal satsaun&#x32D;ga is absolutely essential. Those practising internal satsaun&#x32D;ga may, as far as practical, attend external satsaun&#x32D;ga also, but if they cannot do so at any time, there will be no harm. But mere external satsaun&#x32D;ga, that is, the mere sitting among good persons while the mind forgets Parama Purus&#x301;a or remains engrossed in undesirable thoughts, is not good.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The importance of satsaun&#x32D;ga lies in the subconscious mind. In the realm of the conscious layer of the mind, processes are natural and mostly alike between human and animal, and no pa&#x301;pa [sin] is incurred. The unconscious layer is beyond the sphere of the active mind. The subconscious layer of the mind is of basic importance because it affects the conscious as well as the unconscious minds. It is like a two-way flow from the subconscious mind. The flow is swifter downwards, that is, towards the conscious mind. It is slower upwards, that is, towards the unconscious mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The subconscious mind is subject to three processes, namely, smaran&#x301;a, manana and nididhya&#x301;sana.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Strictly speaking nididhya&#x301;sana takes place mostly beyond the subconscious mind, but the subconscious leads to it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Smaran&#x301;a means the recollecting and rethinking of what was heard earlier.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Manana means the recollecting and the rethinking of what was imbibed earlier through the other sense organs. This rumination which is involved in smaran&#x301;a and manana influences the conscious mind and activates it into causing actions, good or bad, depending upon the nature of the impressions recollected and rethought during smaran&#x301;a and manana. Moreover, the unconscious mind is also concerned. Thus satsaun&#x32D;ga, where one hears, sees, smells, etc., desirable things, leads to desirable smaran&#x301;a and manana and to good actions, while the reverse is the result of bad company. When the subconscious has desirable smaran&#x301;a and manana, and if they are collected and directed one-pointedly through the [subconscious] mind to Parama Purus&#x301;a, that is known as holy smaran&#x301;a and holy manana. And if the subconscious smaran&#x301;a and manana are focused through the unconscious onto Parama Purus&#x301;a, there is nididhya&#x301;sana. Here again lies the importance of satsaun&#x32D;ga.<!-- /block --></p>

He was first asked by Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; to examine the audience carefully with open eyes and to estimate roughly the number of individuals. He estimated there were about two hundred fifty individuals. He further stated that as he beheld all those various individuals, his mind registered different feelings and became disturbed. Then Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; made him close his eyes and touched him.<!-- /block --></p>

As the cakras under concentration rose higher and higher, the sa&#x301;dhaka said that he was feeling oneness more. Moreover, his mind was becoming more and more tranquil, in contrast to the disturbance he had felt earlier when viewing the audience. Finally, when his concentration reached and surpassed the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra at the trikut&#x301;i (between the eyebrows), the sa&#x301;dhaka got more and more deeply immersed in sama&#x301;dhi till at last he lost control of his body.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; explained that the Cosmos was, externally, a phenomenon of analysis (vishles&#x301;an&#x301;a), diversity, clash, disturbance of mind and materialism (jad&#x301;ata&#x301;); and internally, a matter of synthesis (sam&#x301;shles&#x301;an&#x301;a), oneness, peace, tranquillity and spirituality (a&#x301;dhya&#x301;tma). Apara&#x301; knowledge, that is, the knowledge of the external objectivity, is necessary for worldly activities, but para&#x301; knowledge, that is, the knowledge of matters internal, is supreme and superior. Apara&#x301; knowledge should be controlled by para&#x301; knowledge. Educational institutions where only apara&#x301; knowledge is imparted are not sufficient. Side by side the controlling para&#x301; knowledge must be taught. In fact the para&#x301; knowledge should have precedence over the apara&#x301; knowledge, because uncontrolled by para&#x301; knowledge, apara&#x301; knowledge will tend to produce literate brutes who might misuse their knowledge of worldly things.

Even a criminal whom we may have to punish is, ultimately, a chip off the same block, Brahma. Thus orientated internally, our physical actions will always remain moral, ethical and spiritual.

With the reflection of their light, they can see other creatures and objects around them. There are also, in less deep seas, some animals that generate electric lights to catch hold of their prey.<!-- /block --></p>

He explained that in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; human vital energy is converted into spiritual energy. In our daily life we exhaust our vital energy and compensate the same by taking food, drink, light, air, etc. While working, vital energy is transformed into mechanical energy. The same vital energy can be transformed into electric energy also, but in that case, the body will be electrocuted and the person will die. Human vital energy can be converted into magnetic energy as well.<!-- /block --></p>

The vast solar universe retains its balance because of the mutual attraction of the planets. Human beings are drawn easily to the fertile alluvial plains where there is easy scope for plenty of production of food materials. Sweet and scented flowers attract honey-bees. Human beings madly run after money and materials as they provide them with security and comforts. But no non-integral object can ever be the strong and permanent fundament of human life.

The answer as given by an avadhu&#x301;ta and amplified by Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; himself was that the two could not be equated. First, the extra-cerebral memory remembers only the past lives, whereas the unconscious mind knows all about the present and the future as well as the past. Secondly, while nerve-fibres and nerve[-cells] come into play when the subconscious mind receives flashes of the knowledge from the unconscious, there is no dependence upon these cells and fibres when the extra-cerebral memory is concerned.]<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There are two kinds of knowledge, namely, para&#x301; and apara&#x301;. Apara&#x301; knowledge seeks to subjectivize the external objectivity, while para&#x301; aims at the subjectivization of the internal objectivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Apara&#x301; is temporary and imperfect in the very nature of things. If a graduate in any subject were to reappear for examination in the same subject with the same question paper after a considerable lapse of time, that person might not be able to pass the examination because in the meantime they would have forgotten much of the apara&#x301; knowledge they possessed at the time of the examination. Moreover, if the medium is defective in some way or other, the very initial impartation of the knowledge may be defective. There may be a printing mistake, or there may be an error on the part of the author himself, or the external objectivity which forms the subject may itself have changed and what was taught about it some time ago may no longer be correct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Para&#x301; knowledge, on the other hand, is always exact and correct and permanent and lasting, because its subject is Parama Purus&#x301;a Himself.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Comparatively speaking and in ultimate terms, it is para&#x301; knowledge which is worthwhile rather than apara&#x301; knowledge. But because Ananda Marga is a path on which the external objectivity is not ignored, although the ultimate goal remains the ultimate subjectivity, that is, Parama Purus&#x301;a, the correct course is to gain the maximum para&#x301; knowledge and along with it to acquire such and so much of apara&#x301; knowledge as may be found helpful and necessary while dealing with the external objectivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Shastra knowledge and sha&#x301;stra knowledge are both necessary. If the one is lacking the other gets jeopardized. Shastra [literally, &ldquo;weapon&rdquo;] denotes what protects the physical, the metaphysical and the spiritual existence. Sha&#x301;stra, which has its root in the word sha&#x301;sana [administration], means the discipline that leads to spiritual perfection. If there be no protection for the physical and the metaphysical existence, then the spiritual journey cannot begin at all. If a sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual practitioner] cannot have the security of life and limb to perform his sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the very question of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; will not arise. Without sha&#x301;stra, on the other hand, shastra will be useless and aimless, because the ultimate objective of Parama Purus&#x301;a can be gained only through sha&#x301;stra.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="31..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Change occurs in a collection of waves of different wavelengths. Change in waves results in the change in their wavelengths, and that causes change in things. When you get vibrated by particular visual waves under particular circumstances, you see one thing. What you saw may be correct or may not be correct. That depends completely on the circumstances in which you saw the thing. The unit mind and the Cosmic Mind both emanate light-waves and also accept them. As when you think of an elephant, you know that the elephant created in your imagination is not true. Similarly, the elephant that is created in the imagination of the Lord is not true for Him but is true for humans. What the Lord creates in His imaginative flow is liila&#x301; for humans, as humans do not know the cause of that creation. And what jiivas create through their own imaginative power is kriida&#x301; for them. Whatever you create is a mere reflection of His liila&#x301; and not the original. You cannot create anything original. Things created by your kriida&#x301; must have resemblance to one or other thing created in His liila&#x301; or a mixture of those things.<!-- /block --></p>

Humans perceive external things according to their reactive momenta or sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. But while you are experiencing a dream, what you think in the dream [is as true for you as what you see externally while awake]. When through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; your mind gets unified with that of the Lord, this external world becomes imaginary for you.<!-- /block --></p>

That can occur only if so desired by Him. Anything and everything can happen if He pleases. A man can be converted into a stone, a stone can be changed into a man.

<a name="34..4"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;While living a life charged with action, one should pray to live for one hundred years, only to continue performing noble deeds.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There is a common notion that people in ancient times lived longer than the people of today; but this is incorrect. Rather due to scientific progress and advances in medical science, as well as spiritual progress in Tantra Yoga, modern humans are living longer lives than the ancients. People in the olden days hardly lived longer than forty-five years; but today people live much longer. To live a life of one hundred years was a rare accomplishment in those days. And thus the sage said, &ldquo;Human beings may pray to God for  a long life of one hundred years &ndash; in order to perform noble deeds&rdquo; (otherwise why should they drag on their existences unnecessarily?). In the present-day world, there are a few people who have passed the age of one hundred, but not very many. There is a Bengali poem:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Nara&#x301; gaja&#x301; bishe sha-y ta&#x301;r ardhek ba&#x301;nce hay;<br>Ba&#x301;ish balda tera cha&#x301;gla&#x301; bale gela bara&#x301; pa&#x301;gla&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..7"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[Humans and elephants live for one hundred twenty years. A horse lives for half that time; a bullock for twenty-two years, and a goat for thirteen years. That was the calculation of the astrologer Baraha.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..8"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Human beings and elephants live as long as one hundred twenty years; bullocks live over twenty-two years, and goats thirteen years. This was observed by the great astrologer Baraha. But although the human beings of today may live even longer than that, mere survival is not enough; what is important is to live a dignified life. The excellence of human life lies in action; it is through action that human beings survive. They should aspire to live long while performing noble deeds; it is futile to live just like an earthworm. Indeed, each and every human being should vow, &ldquo;I do not know how long I will survive; but as long as I exist I will live a glorious life, not an ignominious existence like that of an earthworm.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Human beings have to earn their livelihood and perform their assigned duties. The degree of physical labour they have to perform depends on the economic condition of their land. The citizens of those countries which are socio-economically developed have to perform less physical labour; instead their intellectual labour has increased. This is the natural law. The human beings who lived one hundred years ago used to perform much more manual labour than do those of today. Those who washed clothes used to stand in knee-deep water. This type of life for years on end markedly reduced their longevity, and thus washermen and women did not live longer than forty to forty-five years; their excessive physical labour would shatter their health. Due to their lack of knowledge of hygiene and absence of spiritual practice, their life-spans were shortened.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Spiritual practice makes the mind calm and quiet, and maintains the nerves in a state of equipoise; and thus spiritual practice increases longevity. Those Vaishnavites who are vegetarians, who regularly sing spiritual songs, do meditation, perform virtuous deeds and think pure thoughts, live longer than ninety years.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now, one may say that some people like Vivekananda did not live long; but the cause of their early death was excessive labour. Extreme physical labour definitely reduces one&#146;s longevity. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu lived [less than fifty] years; he could perhaps have lived longer, but due to excessive labour, he could not survive. He undertook long tours throughout India on foot. Shankaracharya did not live long, either, because he also toured India on foot; he walked from Cape Comorin to the Himalayas. This extreme physical labour told upon his health; otherwise he could perhaps have lived longer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->I want you all to live long &ndash; but you must live glorious lives, not like those of earthworms. Your lives should be bustling with activity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Human beings always yearn for the destruction of the evil forces, for the removal of darkness and the flooding of effulgent light. Let your dynamic forward movement make your lives ever joyful &ndash; see that you never lag behind, or slump down dejected. No human being wants this. Rather let your slogan always be, Caraeveti, caraeveti [&ldquo;Move on, move on&rdquo;]. Let the chant of your forward movement be ever on your lips.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In India, particularly in Bengal in early autumn, when, in the midst of constant movement, people get a slight respite from their worldly responsibilities, they get the scope to think deeply about life. In the month of Bha&#x301;dra [mid-August to mid-September] the early autumn paddy has already been harvested, and the late autumn paddy will be harvested some time later. During this period people cannot remain inactive: they will have to move ever forward. During this time, they long in their heart of hearts for the victory of the righteous forces over the evil forces.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->You might have noticed in the pillars of King Ashoka, a lion is standing upon a wheel. Here the lion is the symbol of the evil forces: it may be the king of beasts, but however powerful it might be, it is after all only an animal. Tatha&#x301;pi sim&#x301;gha pashureva nanyah &ndash; &ldquo;Yet a lion is an animal, nothing more.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Here [in relation to Bengal] the lion means Mansingha [the general of Akbar]. Once Mansingha sent a letter to Pratapaditya, the king of Jessore, and along with the letter he sent a chain and a sword, asking him to choose between the two. King Pratapaditya quickly called a meeting and told his courtiers that he was going to choose the sword, and leave the chain for the animals. To him a lion, however powerful it might be, was after all only an animal. For his part in this Mansingha was universally condemned: his action was despicable because he was trying to seize someone else&#146;s freedom. People always long for the victory of the righteous forces over evil, and in this autumn season people pondered deeply over this. In the process, they developed this festival of victory, celebrating the triumph of humanity over the negative forces.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->At the time when Krittivas, the famous Bengali poet, wrote the Bengali Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, long after the time of Valmiki&#146;s original Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, all languages except Sanskrit were considered to be people&#146;s languages [dialects]. Krittivas wrote the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a in Bengali during the Pathan rule, in the reign of Nawab Hussain Shah. In his book Krittivas linked this autumn festival to Ramchandra&#146;s victory celebration as depicted in the original Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->You should remember that this type of victory celebration was also popular during the Buddhist period, when people used to organize autumn festivals with much music, dance and revelry. In the original Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a, Ramchandra attained victory in the Lanka war, and hence there was a victory celebration. But Krittivas added a religious dimension to the victory celebration of Bengal. Actually the former victory celebration was nothing but an autumn festival.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->During this season, all of nature remains pure and sentient: the sky is free from clouds, and there is an atmosphere of joy all around. A sweet breeze blows, and the beautiful kush and ka&#x301;sh grasses abound everywhere. In fact, the entire environment makes people intoxicated with joy. Against this background, people long for the victory of righteousness over the evil forces, the victory of knowledge and wisdom over the darkness of ignorance. This is how the autumn festival originated in Bengal. At an early stage, this autumn festival had nothing to do with the worship of Durga&#x301; [attributed by Krittivas to] by King Ramchandra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Moreover, when the goddess Durga&#x301; was worshipped in earliest days, she was an eight-armed deity. In all the Puranas [mythological scriptures] over 1200 years old, such as the Ma&#x301;rkan&#x301;d&#x301;eya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Brhat Nandikeshvara Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, the Devii Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a and the Ka&#x301;lika&#x301; Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a, the deity was invariably eight-armed. In those days in Maharashtra also, the custom of worshipping the eight-armed goddess was also popular. The worship of the ten-armed goddess Durga&#x301; was first introduced by Kansa Narayana, king of Taherpur of Rajsahi District of Bangladesh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="34..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->This victory celebration was clearly symbolic of the victory of humanity over the evil forces, over the forces of destruction. Thus human beings should take a vow that their lives will be utilized in waging a ceaseless struggle against the demonic forces. The very prospect of this struggle brings joy, and the joy becomes still greater when the evil forces are totally vanquished and righteousness is established. And in this great task of establishing righteousness, we also should make a maximum contribution.<!-- /block --></p>
