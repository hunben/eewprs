<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Everything in this universe, manifest or unmanifest, abstract or matter, is the playful creation of Prakrti. All entities are the different expressions of the endless dance of Shakti (Supreme Creative Principle) on the vast body of Shiva. Is Purus&#x301;a a mute witness in this playful creation of Prakrti? Is it only Prakrti who functions? Is this dance the sole responsibility of Prakrti alone? Purus&#x301;a is certainly not a mute witness. When creation is in a dormant stage, Prakrti&#146;s dance remains merged in Purus&#x301;a. It is only when Purus&#x301;a exercises His hypnotic power that Prakrti receives the inspiration to dance. Prakrti betrays Her total surrender to Purus&#x301;a with every cadence of dance and resonance of rhythm. She makes it clear that She is fully subservient to Purus&#x301;a. It may appear as if the dancing Prakrti is independent, but actually this is not the case. Even when creation is manifested Prakrti is not entirely independent in the strict philosophical sense. It is only due to Purus&#x301;a&#146;s slackness that Prakrti appears to be independent. It seems as if Prakrti does everything through Her own independent volition, but actually She only does that which She is permitted to do, nothing more. It is with Purus&#x301;a&#146;s consent that She acquires the power to bind Him. In this way Prakrti continues Her playful creation with Purus&#x301;a as the fundamental stuff.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In individual life, too, a microcosm seems to be under the influence of Prakrti, but in reality this is not true. If Purus&#x301;a checks the movement of Prakrti, She loses the capacity to function independently. At this stage jiiva (microcosm) becomes one with Shiva (Macrocosm or Purus&#x301;a). The conscious endeavour to elevate microcosmic consciousness beyond the influence of microcosmic operative principle (Prakrti) is called sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or intuitional spiritual practice. Purus&#x301;a is the seed of both the manifest and unmanifest universes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->When the universe is unmanifest Purus&#x301;a is predominant. Even when the universe is manifest Purus&#x301;a is predominant; but it appears as if Prakrti is dominant (in certain schools of philosophy the term Pradha&#x301;na is used for Prakrti).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Both the expressed and unexpressed universes are the play of Prakrti. In the former Her play is conspicuous; in the latter it is dormant. But even in the dormant stage, when the triangle of forces remains balanced, Prakrti cannot be said to be completely inactive. She still continues Her dance, but being under Purus&#x301;a&#146;s hypnotic influence cannot modify Purus&#x301;a in any way. Purus&#x301;a remains absorbed in the bliss of His witness-ship while Prakrti dances within His vast body. This hypnotized Prakrti cannot create any rudimental factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the expressed universe Purus&#x301;a gives Prakrti plently of latitude to move within the periphery of His vast body. Prakrti works according to the freedom granted to Her, exhibiting Her dexterous art of dance, rhythm and posture. Purus&#x301;a remains in a state of absolute bliss as the witness of Her masterly dance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the first half of Prakrti&#146;s playful creation of the manifest universe Purus&#x301;a is a little slack. Consequently the noose of Prakrti&#146;s bondage becomes tighter and tighter, causing creation to move from subtle to crude. This half of the Cosmic Cycle in which Purus&#x301;a gives more latitude to Prakrti is called Sain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Thereafter, when Purus&#x301;a begins to reassert Himself, the binding influence of Prakrti starts waning and creation moves from crude to subtle. When Purus&#x301;a fully asserts Himself, He brings Prakrti under His complete control, thus curtailing Her freedom to dance according to Her own sweet will. Hypnotized under Purus&#x301;a&#146;s spell, She takes creation back to the previous dormant stage. This movement from crudity to subtlety which terminates in the original unmanifested state is the second half of the Cosmic Cycle or Pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In both Sain&#x32D;cara and Pratisain&#x32D;cara Purus&#x301;a seems to be bound by Prakrti, but actually it is Purus&#x301;a who grants Her latitude so that She can continue Her playful dance. Although Purus&#x301;a is metamorphosed into multiplicities in Sain&#x32D;cara, those multiplicities remain embedded in the Supreme Singularity. When Purus&#x301;a curtails the freedom He granted to Prakrti and returns to His original stance, then Prakrti is compelled to return to Her own original dormant stage. Hence it is better to say Prakrti and Purus&#x301;a are one. They are both manifested and unmanifested, or, more logically, they are neither manifested nor unmanifested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->So the analytical phase is the phase of manifestation in which the Singular Purus&#x301;a appears to be transformed into many by Prakrti. The greater the influence of Prakrti, the greater the number of pluralities, and the greater the degree of crudification. But when creation reaches the nadir point of crudification, Purus&#x301;a starts decreasing the latitude He granted to Prakrti and withdraws everything unto Himself, thereby bringing an end to the process of creation. This is the phase of Pratisain&#x32D;cara. In this phase Prakrti is no longer free to continue Her creative flow independently. Creation now proceeds from plurality towards Supreme Singularity, towards the Supreme Cognitive Faculty. This is the path of synthesis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->When pluralities move towards the Supreme Singularity they undergo severe internal and external clashes. In this phase the more the latitude granted by Purus&#x301;a begins to decrease, the greater the external pressure on each finite object, and the greater the internal clash within each object. The result of these clashes is the gradual disintegration of the atoms and molecules which constitute a physical structure, and thus the gradual decrease in the degree of static influence on the physical structure. Suppose five hundred people have been closely bound together with ropes. If they start jostling and fighting amongst themselves then naturally their tight bondages will gradually loosen. If their movements become even more violent their bondages will snap open. In much the same way the atoms and molecules within a structure are powdered down and transformed into crude mind-stuff as a result of internal clash. Philosophically, this crude mind-stuff is called citta. As Purus&#x301;a further withdraws His latitude there is greater internal clash within the citta leading to the formation of the subtler aham&#x301; (doer-I) and mahat (existential-I) portions of the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The major difference between animate beings and inanimate beings is that animate beings have an existential feeling whereas inanimate beings do not. An inanimate piece of iron and a grain of sand are not aware of their existence, but an undeveloped living creature like an earthworm has self-awareness. The mighty Himalayas do not know that they exist, but for a tiny fly existence is quite real. This tiny fly has the potentiality to become a great personality one day in the course of evolution. The fly that you see today is a very insignificant creature, but after hundreds of thousands of years it may become a towering personality of great eminence &ndash; a mighty genius. Hence a wise person never despises anyone. There is nothing in the world to be despised, nothing to be slighted or belittled.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Instead of saying that the inanimate world has no existential feeling, it is better to say that existential awareness is dormant in matter. When citta emerges from matter as a result of internal clash existential awareness begins to develop gradually. With the emergence of aham&#x301; and mahat existential awareness becomes increasingly crystallized and ultimately I-feeling assumes a preponderant role.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->What is the mind? The mind is a subtle expression of matter. Matter is the condensed form of Cosmic Mind. The three chambers of the Cosmic Mind evolve in the Sain&#x32D;cara phase of the Cosmic Cycle. First the mahattattva, the subtlest part, which arouses existential feeling, then the aham&#x301;tattva, a little less subtle, which establishes the correlation between existential feeling and matter, and finally the citta, the crudest part, which takes the form of objects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the phase of Pratisain&#x32D;cara it is the citta which initially emerges as a result of clash within the material structure. Citta is unable to fully express its potentiality in the absence of aham and mahat. There are some entities in the world which lie between the animate and the inanimate. They have citta which can take the form of physical objects, but in the absence of aham&#x301; and mahat they are unable to apply any power to utilize matter. Some entities have citta and aham&#x301; but in the absence of mahat do not have proper existential I-feeling. Their citta can take the form of material objects and their aham&#x301; can connect themselves to their objects, yet they have no clear existential I-feeling. Creepers and climbers and undeveloped living beings are in this stage of development. In some of them only citta has awakened; in others both citta and aham&#x301;. Only in developed creatures do the three parts of the mind exist. If creatures devoid of mahattattva are bifurcated, each part survives as an independent creature. Likewise, branches and leaves cut off the parent plant can maintain a separate existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Aham&#x301; develops as a result of clash within the citta. If that clash becomes more intense, mahattattva develops. When the clash within the citta becomes extreme, the periphery of mahat exceeds that of aham&#x301;. As long as aham&#x301; remains smaller than citta, the psychic faculty is called ma&#x301;nas&#x301;a (crude mind-stuff). But when aham&#x301; surpasses citta in size as a result of increased clash the enlarged portion of the mind is called maniis&#x301;a&#x301; (intellect). And when mahat becomes larger than aham&#x301; due to extreme clash, that enlarged portion is called bodhi (intuition).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Intellect is the controller of citta (crude mind) because it is larger and subtler. Undeveloped creatures and animals are guided by the crude mind. Human beings, however, are guided by intellect as in their case aham&#x301; is larger in area than citta; and herein lies their greatness. For undeveloped entities whose citta is larger than aham&#x301; enjoyment of crude matter is the goal of life, because their mental power moves within the arena of the crude mind. But in human beings intellect controls the crude mind, checking its unbridled fascination for material enjoyment. As soon as a goat sees a green plant it rushes towards it; but human beings do not run greedily and indiscriminately towards whatever object of enjoyment they see. They procure things either with their hard-earned money, or by applying their intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The development of intuition is possible only in living beings who undergo greater psychic clash. Intuition and the awakened kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii (sleeping divinity) are indistinguishable. To arouse the kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii through psychic clash and intuitional practice means to develop intuition. A person whose kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii has awakened does not belong to the crude world of material enjoyment, but is a true citizen of the world of intuition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->People of undeveloped intellect are mostly guided by Prakrti. But those of developed intellect through proper object of ideation, the Supreme One, through intellectual analysis, and then start moving towards Him. When intellect advances with the ideation of the Supreme, the sensory and motor organs act as obedient servants to the mind. No longer is the mind the slave of the organs. Hence proper ideation leads to intellectual subtlety.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The physical hunger of living beings is basically centred around their bodily needs. As their sole intention is the crude enjoyment of matter, all their crude and psychic functions move towards matter, making subtle ideation impossible. Undeveloped animals, being totally preoccupied with meeting their crude necessities only have one propensity &ndash; the gratification of physical needs. Thus it is very easy to understand their psychology. Intellectually developed human beings only use some part of their minds for material pursuit &ndash; the rest is used for subtle pursuits. If such people undergo greater psychic clash, psychic movement toward subtlety will increase. The mind&#146;s capacity of subtle ideation will also increase spontaneously. Generally, part of the mind is attracted by the material world, and part by the spiritual world. This results in tremendous mental clash, causing divergences in the mental flow. These divergences are nothing but the various propensities of mind. Thus the more the intellect awakens, the greater the number of propensities; and the greater the number of propensities, the greater the diversity in psychic expression. The greater the diversity in a human mind, the more difficult it is to comprehend that mind. Thus it is very difficult to understand the psychology of developed human beings, but quite easy to understand the psychology of people who run after crude physical enjoyment like mad dogs, because they are no better than animals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->When intellect evolves into intuition, human beings realize that the cause of the varied expressions of this quinquelemental world is the Supreme Entity. They consolidate their innate propensities (vrttis) and channelize them towards that Singular Entity. Hence the gradual unfoldment of intuition leads to a corresponding decrease in the number of vrttis. Ultimately there remains only one propensity &ndash; the propensity of bliss (a&#x301;nanda vrtti). Intuition is sometimes called hrdaya or guha&#x301; in Sam&#x301;skrta. Dharmasya tattvam&#x301; nihitam&#x301; guha&#x301;yam. &ldquo;The essence of dharma lies in intuition.&rdquo; Here guha&#x301; does not mean a mountain cave, but intuition. Just as there is only one propensity in the crudest stage of mind, similarly in the last stage of Pratisain&#x32D;cara, after the development of intuition, there remains only one propensity, the propensity of bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The crude mind (citta) remains engrossed in the thought of crude matter. When intellect is associated with the crude thought of matter it helps the crude mind in controlling the material world, thus enhancing its scope of enjoying the physical world. The part of intellect which helps the crude mind is the creator of material science. Material science is virtually unknown to undeveloped creatures and animals. It has advanced proportionately to the development of human intellect. Inborn instinct plays a more important role in animals than acquired knowledge, even if they do have some practical knowledge of material science. But in the case of human beings acquired knowledge plays a more important role. If human beings pursue the path of material science without basing their lives on a spiritual ideology, the constant psycho-physical parallelism will result in a hundred percent possibility of their intellect being degenerated into crude mind. Thus I am constrained to say that if material science denies spirituality, it may be instrumental in causing a major calamity to befall the world at any time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->When intellect associates itself with the material sphere material science develops, but when it functions within the psychic sphere it formulates philosophy. Philosophy emerges at the point where the crude mind ends and intellect begins. Excessive philosophical study makes a person a logician and creates vanity and confusion in the mind. Moreover, philosophy is a creation of the intellect; its confabulations and ruminations are confined to the realm of intellectuality. It is hardly able to step beyond the intellectual realm and is thus unable to attain Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->When the mind transcends the barriers of intellect the realization dawns in human beings that they cannot reach the abode of the Supreme Entity through material science or philosophy, but through intuition alone. Supreme blessedness lies in the unfoldment of intuition. Those who are graced with intuition, even though they may be totally illiterate, can reach the Supreme rank, thereby establishing themselves in a state of perennial blessedness. The greatest pandits, however, become lost in the labyrinth of logic, and even though they try to find a way out, they finally attain nothing.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In intuitional practice this process is reversed: devotees elevate themselves from Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti to Bhaeravii Shakti, from Bhaeravii Shakti to Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti, and finally attain oneness with the Supreme Entity. Those who pursue this path of divine adoration are called devotees. Whom do devotees ideate on? Certainly on Purus&#x301;ottama. Those who accept matter as their object of ideation can never attain Purus&#x301;ottama, but will invariably degenerate towards the staticity of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti. Their entire being will ultimately be converted into inert matter. To ideate on Purus&#x301;ottama means to transform Bhava&#x301;nii into Bhaeravii and Bhaeravii into Kaos&#x301;ikii, thereby establishing oneness between the devotee and the Lord. In the process of transforming crude waves into subtle waves, devotees become one with their final goal. If one&#146;s movement is towards the crude, one&#146;s psycho-physical waves will become cruder and cruder. But if one&#146;s movement is towards the Supreme, if Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti is transformed into Bhaeravii Shakti, then one&#146;s waves will gradually straighten. The subtle waves of effulgence will also become straight. Thus a devotee&#146;s movement towards the Supreme One is an endeavour to transform crude energy into subtle energy. To transform Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti into Bhaeravii Shakti both shraddha&#x301; [implicit veneration for one&#146;s goal] and viirya [stamina] are important. Without regular spiritual practice this transformation is impossible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->For a devotee, action is indispensable. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; itself is a type of action. If one sits idle like a piece of inert matter, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is impossible; the conversion of crude into subtle will never occur. The relationship between devotees and their Lord is strengthened through action. At this point a question may arise: on the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; who is greater &ndash; a bhakta [devotee] or a karmii [person of action]? The answer is simple and straightforward. For bhaktas all actions are a part of their psycho-spiritual practice, whereas for karmiis actions are merely seen as actions. Those people whose actions are indistinguishable from devotion are true devotees. Thus in the process of conversion of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti into Bhaeravii Shakti, devotion plays a greater role than so-called action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->What is the source of inspiration of the individual&#146;s efforts to convert crude energy into subtle energy? In this case the Cognitive Faculty is the source of inspiration. Bhaeravii Shakti is prevented from being converted into Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti with the help of the Cognitive Faculty, and with the help of the Cognitive Faculty Bhaeravii Shakti is merged in the cognitive flow.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In the struggle to transform Bhaeravii Shakti into Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti, Citishakti [Cognitive Force] plays a dominant role, because Bhaeravii Shakti is the second stage of Citishakti in the flow of creation. The Cognitive Force manifests itself as Bhaeravii Shakti to expedite the evolution of mind. The will to evolve is primarily dependent on the active role of Bhaeravii Shakti. In fact Bhaeravii Shakti is one&#146;s real &ldquo;I&rdquo;. It is with Her help that one must carry on one&#146;s sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; to attain Citishakti. It is just like worshipping the Ganges with the water of the Ganges.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Suppose a certain student studies abroad with his father&#146;s financial assistance. If he saves a little money every month and buys his father one of his favourite objects, his father will certainly feel happy. The pursuit of dharma is a similar process. One attains Parama Purus&#x301;a with the proper application of devotion, knowledge and action, which are the faculties He has chosen to bestow on spiritual aspirants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Exactly the reverse occurs in the case of materialists who are puffed up with vanity: their Bhaeravii Shakti is gradually converted into Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti. Only devotees can expand Bhaeravii Shakti because only they cherish the desire for supreme union with the Cognitive Faculty. They do not ask the Supreme Being for wealth, opulence, fame or children, but pray, &ldquo;O Lord, please manifest Yourself fully in me. Make me Yours, O Lord.&rdquo; They continue to pray like this until they merge in the Supreme.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->They continue their efforts to attain the Supreme with the physical and psychic strength already bestowed upon them by the Supreme Entity. To ask for extra power without first utilizing the power already given them would be to show disrespect to Parama Purus&#x301;a. Only after all their power has been totally exhausted may they ask Parama Purus&#x301;a for anything. If He so desires, Parama Purus&#x301;a may grant that request through some third entity. While utilizing one&#146;s energy one should pray to Parama Purus&#x301;a, &ldquo;O Lord, I am working with the strength given by You. Let me not make the mistake of taking it to be my own power. Let me not forget You, O Lord.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Devotees will have to straighten the waves of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti. The more the waves are straightened, the more Bhava&#x301;nii will be transformed into Bhaeravii Shakti. This straightening of the waves is the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. As long as sa&#x301;dhakas remain within the scope of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti they observe that all finite entities of the universe are separate from one another. But when they enter the bounds of Bhaeravii Shakti after straightening the waves of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, they discover that all those previous differentiations have vanished into nothingness. The more the influence of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, the greater the feeling of differentiation; and the more the influence of Bhaeravii Shakti, the greater the feeling of unity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Many people think that social service alone is the best process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but they are mistaken. Through intuitional practice a sa&#x301;dhaka succeeds in elevating Bhaeravii and Bhava&#x301;nii Shaktis in individual life. A person who develops the cognitive faculty in this way will spontaneously do social service. Service is the way and the life of such a spiritual aspirant. A balance between one&#146;s individual dharma and social dharma will thus be established.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->When one&#146;s cognitive faculty becomes so subtle that one sees Brahma in all manifested entities, one can play a proper role in the practical world. Only at this stage does one realize that no one in this universe is inferior, for all are the children of the same Supreme Father and Supreme Mother. Brothers and sisters belonging to the same family cannot belong to separate castes. So those who support casteism are atheists. Those who want to perpetuate economic disparities are also atheists. No parents could sincerely desire one of their children to become fabulously rich and roll in opulence, while another slowly starves to death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Human beings should develop themselves as individuals by expanding their dormant cognitive faculties through intuitional practice, and should develop their socio-economic life by eradicating the vested interests in the socio-economic sphere. Those who have rendered service to society and have either become government ministers or been otherwise rewarded with power and prestige, but have failed to practise sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; in their personal lives, generally degenerate later.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->What happens before Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti is metamorphosed into Bhaeravii Shakti? Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti emanates from Purus&#x301;a in so many waves. It is the variation in these waves which causes the differences among the many objects of the universe. Bhava&#x301;nii, Bhaeravii and Kaos&#x301;ikii Shaktis are created according to the way the three principles act on the Cognitive Faculty. When major changes occur in Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, ether, air, fire, water and other crude objects can be perceived. These entities acquire different forms due to the differences in the waves created by the three principles. Thus we observe the same Purus&#x301;a manifested in different ways.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->It is due to a particular vibration of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti that we perceive Purus&#x301;a as a piece of iron, and due to another vibration that we perceive Purus&#x301;a as a piece of gold. Had there been no differences among the wavelengths of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, there would have been no differences among the manifested objects. When spiritual aspirants remain within the periphery of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti and observe the differences among objects, they realize the Supreme Singularity behind the diversity of expression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->All objects are the varying forms of Purus&#x301;a. When one realizes that all these diverse objects finally merge into His supreme singularity, social service becomes more important than anything else, because service to individuals or the collectivity means service to Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->So in the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, as a result of the constant superimposition of Cosmic ideation, Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti is changed into Bhaeravii Shakti. Then all the objects of the world are seen as expressions of Brahma. This realization is not brought about by the study of books. Book knowledge is only perceptional knowledge; it cannot take one beyond the boundary of perception. If people study constantly without practising sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, psycho-physical parallelism will make them vain and egotistical.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Remember that until one becomes one with the Cognitive Faculty, one will have to continue to act. Through karma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [the yoga of action] one advances to the second stage of progress, realizing that everything is Brahma.

<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->In the third stage the question of differentiation does not even arise: the difference between the seer and the &ldquo;seeable&rdquo; is completely obliterated.

<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The Cosmic force that is active in the psychic sphere of microcosms is Bhaeravii Shakti. As Bhaeravii is the force which starts moving from a vertex of the unbalanced supreme triangle, one will have to concentrate one&#146;s mind on a particular point in the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Thus in a&#x301;sana shuddhi, Bhaeravii Shakti is concentrated at a nuclear point, and subsequently transformed into Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti. When that transformation occurs, the unit mind gradually dissolves into the Cosmic Mind. The three principles of Prakrti remain perfectly balanced in Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti, and thus lie unexpressed.<!-- /block --></p>

If their minds are directed towards Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti their Bhaeravii Shakti will become crudified. Hence sa&#x301;dhakas must carry on a relentless fight against all crudifying forces. For this reason they must also be viira&#x301;ca&#x301;riis.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> They must ideate constantly on Parama Purus&#x301;a, and gradually transform Bhaeravii Shakti into Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti. But one should remember that Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti is not one&#146;s final goal. Even after merging one&#146;s identity into Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti it can still be the cause of bondage and subsequent rebirth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Of all the bondages, the bondage of [Bhava&#x301;nii] is most strongly felt, but [Bhava&#x301;nii] Herself is not the original entity. While utilizing mundane objects, one should always ideate on the Cognitive Faculty working behind this myriad world of forms and colours. The regressive movement that the mind makes when ideating on matter is prevented by this Cosmic ideation or Brahmacarya sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->One who ideates on the Supreme Entity while engaged in individual and collective sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; establishes a happy correlation between Bhaeravii Shakti and one&#146;s cognitive faculty. Such a person will never degenerate, even though his or her cherished supreme goal may not be fully realized. The main factor is the clear awareness of one&#146;s goal. Your own excellence depends on the excellence of your goal. To build a bridge over the Ganges is not the goal in itself; the actual goal is to connect north Bihar to south Bihar. Of course, that goal is achieved by building the bridge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->The attainment of Brahma signifies the victory of one&#146;s ideology; first the victory of Bhaeravii Shakti and then the victory of Kaos&#x301;ikii Shakti. Or put in another way, first the defeat of Bhava&#x301;nii Shakti, then the defeat of Bhaeravii and Kaos&#x301;ikii Shaktis at the hands of Purus&#x301;a. When one becomes the master of Bhava&#x301;nii, Bhaeravii and Kaos&#x301;ikii Shaktis, one attains enormous power to subdue the wicked forces and protect the forces of righteousness in the external world.<!-- /block --></p>

This battle should end in one of two ways: in victory or in death. One should never undergo the ignominy of defeat. If one dies while seeking the Supreme, one will surely attain the Supreme after death. One who is totally absorbed in ideation on the Supreme becomes one with the Supreme at the time of death. This is certainly true in the case of devotees. The duality between the one who serves and the entity served ceases to exist. Ultimately the one who serves, the entity who is served, and the action of serving become fused into one. If one&#146;s goal is right, one is sure to attain the supreme stance. And one who attains the supreme stance will never make the mistake of differentiating between high and low, literate and illiterate, touchable and untouchable.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->To remain satisfied with a little is contrary to human nature. That is why, since the dawn of creation, human beings have been worshipping the Supreme Entity. People longed for supreme knowledge, for indirect and direct spiritual realization. This fundamental human yearning for supreme expansion led people to discover the practical cult of spirituality. Moreover, it created in the human mind the sense of inquisitiveness, the spirit of dedication, and the thirst for knowledge. It is because of these noble qualities that human beings have become what they are today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The divine revelations experienced by the sages of the ancient Vedic age through their meditative vision have been compiled in the Vedas. Thus the Vedas have to some extent quenched the human thirst for intellectual knowledge. But they have not quenched the thirst for supreme knowledge, the fundamental thirst of human life. That thirst can only be quenched through the illuminating realizations of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practice].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There is no reliable evidence to suggest that in the Vedic period spiritual knowledge was handed down from preceptor to disciple. As far as we know from the history of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, Lord Shiva was the first to propound it, and He gave this spiritual cult the name Tantra. Tantra is the secret behind spiritual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The scriptural definition of tantra is Tam&#x301; ja&#x301;d&#x301;ya&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sah tantrah parikiirttitah [&ldquo;Tantra is that which liberates a person from the bondages of staticity&rdquo;]. Tam&#x301; is the acoustic root of staticity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Tantra has another meaning as well. The Sanskrit root verb tan means &ldquo;to expand&rdquo;. So the practical process that leads to one&#146;s expansion and consequent emancipation is called tantra. Thus sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and Tantra are inseparable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Strictly speaking, theoretical knowledge cannot be called Tantra. Tantra is a practical science. Hence in Tantra the importance of book knowledge is secondary. The practical process of Tantra begins with the physical and progresses to the physico-psychic, then to the psycho-spiritual, then ultimately results in [the supreme spiritual stance,] ensconcement in the a&#x301;tma&#x301; [self]. [This scientific process sets it apart from many other schools.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->As the practical aspect is the most important factor in Tantra, the greatest emphasis is placed on the preceptor-disciple relationship. The disciple must do intense spiritual practice to be worthy of the preceptor&#146;s instructions at every stage of development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->And it was for this reason that Sada&#x301;shiva never wanted the Tantric teachings to be written down. However, in course of time, due to a lack of competent preceptors and disciples, Tantra was about to be lost to society. It therefore became an imperative necessity to put the teachings in book form to save them from total extinction. There are presently sixty-four Tantric texts.<!-- /block --></p>

[Literally, &ldquo;The edge of a razor is very sharp and difficult to walk on.&rdquo;] This path, to walk upon, is like a path strewn with sharp razors. The disciple has to tread the path with extreme caution. The disciple needs the help of the guru [preceptor] at every step. Without this supervision, any defect in the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; as imparted by the guru, or the least negligence on the part of the disciple in following the instructions, inevitably leads to the disciple&#146;s downfall. For success on the path of Tantra, the proper preceptor and the proper disciple are both essential. So the first step in Tantra is the selection of a competent preceptor and a worthy disciple.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The situation can be explained through the following analogy with agriculture: The disciple&#146;s heart is a field; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is the ploughing and irrigation of the field; and the preceptor&#146;s initiation is the sowing of seeds. If the seeds are defective they will not sprout; if the field is infertile the harvest will be poor; and even if the seed and the field are ideal, yet the field is not properly ploughed or irrigated, the harvest will be poor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->According to Tantra, disciples are of three categories. The first category are likened to pitchers placed inversely in a tub of water. Such pitchers contain water as long as they are kept in the tub, but as soon as they are taken out, all the water pours out. These disciples acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from the preceptor they forget all his teachings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The second category of disciples are like people who carefully climb a plum tree and pick plums from its thorny branches. Unfortunately they become so absorbed in climbing down the tree that they completely forget about their carefully-collected plums, which fall out of their bags and break open on the ground. Such disciples learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The best category of disciples are like pitchers positioned right side up. When such pitchers are put in a tub of water, there is water both inside them and all around them; and even when they are removed from the tub, they remain full to the brim with water. These disciples carefully preserve in the jewel caskets of their hearts whatever they learn from their preceptor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->According to Tantra there are also three types of preceptor: the inferior, the mediocre, and the superior. Inferior preceptors are those who deliver high-sounding speeches but do not bother about whether the disciples follow their teachings or not. Mediocre preceptors impart knowledge to their disciples, no doubt, and also check on whether the disciples are following their teachings, but they are not too demanding. Superior preceptors, however, take meticulous care to ensure that their disciples follow their teachings. If they discover that their disciples are negligent in any way, they compel them to practise more painstakingly by applying circumstantial pressure.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The practice of Tantra can be divided into several stages. Everyone has his or her own individual sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, and there is no denying that at the initial stage human beings are normally animals (and have hence been called &ldquo;rational animals&rdquo;). A human being who lacks viveka [discrimination] is actually worse than an animal. Animals are undeveloped creatures, and thus certain behaviour on their part may be condoned. But humans are developed, so improper conduct by them cannot be condoned. The initial stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is meant for people of animal nature and is thus called pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra or pashubha&#x301;va [pashu = &ldquo;animal&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->When sa&#x301;dhakas advance in the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, guided by the instructions of the preceptor, they develop an ideation proper for human beings. At this stage they are called viira [heroic]. Just as animals are controlled through external pressure, in the stage of pashva&#x301;ca&#x301;ra sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; disciples must be controlled by the external application of pressure of circumstances. This will help establish them in viirabha&#x301;va. But those who are more elevated than animals do not depend on external pressure for spiritual progress.

Hence there is no contradiction between Tantra and science. People are found at all different stages, according to their ideation &ndash; animal-like, heroic, or god-like &ndash; as they ascend on the scale of evolution.

Sada&#x301;shiva was the propounder of both branches of Tantra, hence there cannot be any contradiction between them. Under ordinary circumstances the human mind is dominated by animal propensities. Of course, these baser propensities are not equally strong for all people. Those who have intense animal desires rush toward objects of physical enjoyment. Such people cannot just suddenly give up their objects of enjoyment in favour of spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Those whose desire for physical enjoyment is less intense can easily abstain from physical objects, but what are the first-mentioned people to do?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->If such people try forcibly to turn their minds away from their objects of enjoyment, they will face disastrous consequences. Psychologists are well aware of the dangers of attempting to suppress or repress one&#146;s desires. One may be able to maintain saintliness for a certain time, but the raging storm cannot be contained forever. It is not unusual for those who remain virtuous early in life to fall prey to immoral desires later in life. The dark shadow of immorality fell across the lives of many sannya&#x301;siis and sannya&#x301;siniis or bhiks&#x301;us and bhiks&#x301;uniis [monks and nuns] in the past for this very reason, that they had tried to suppress their desires by force. Some people pretend to be virtuous but indulge in immoral deeds secretly; if their numbers increase in society it is an unhealthy sign. The practice of the Five M&#146;s was formulated for those people who harboured secret desires for crude physical enjoyment. But for those guided by subtle propensities, the subtle Pain&#x32D;camaka&#x301;ra, or yoga ma&#x301;rga, was prescribed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->The main idea behind the practice of the crude Pain&#x32D;camaka&#x301;ra is to carry out sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; while in the midst of crude enjoyments. While carrying out this practice, they will limit the degree of their indulgence.  By limiting the use of objects of enjoyment they will gradually increase their psychic power, and will ultimately rise above the allurement of enjoyment. For example, a wine addict will drink a controlled measure of wine as a part of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.

Only one whose mind is reverently concentrated on Brahma will win liberation; there is no doubt about this. Those who think that Parama Purus&#x301;a is confined within idols made of clay, stone, metal, or wood, are simply torturing their bodies with penances &ndash; they will surely not attain salvation without self-knowledge. If an idol produced out of the human imagination can bring about salvation, then can a person, by creating a kingdom in his dreams, become a king in the real sense? Liberation is not attainable by penance, sacrificial rituals, or hundreds of fasts. Living beings attain liberation when they realize, &lsquo;I am Brahma.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ndash;Eds.</p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In subtle philosophical analysis it can be said that all perception and assimilation is done with the help of shakti (force). Hence the Witnessing Entity of this entire creation is nothing but Citi Shakti (Cognitive Force or Cognitive Faculty). Purus&#x301;a is called Citi Shakti for two reasons: He is pure Consciousness and He is omni-telepathic. Citi Shakti has five qualities: shuddha&#x301; (absolutely pure), ananta&#x301; (infinite), aparin&#x301;a&#x301;mii (unchangeable), apratisam&#x301;krama&#x301; (non-extroversive), and darshita vis&#x301;aya&#x301; (witness of the reflected object).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The first quality of Citi Shakti is absolute purity. An object is pure when it is not tainted by any impure object. If pure gold is mixed with another metal it loses its purity and becomes gold alloy. The impurities can be removed from the gold alloy through a chemical process. The Cognitive Faculty is always free from impurities. However, when It comes under the influence of the three principles of Prakrti It can no longer be called Citi Shakti because It becomes metamorphosis into one of the forces instrumental in causing this creation. Actually, every entity of this relative world is nothing but the Cognitive Faculty which has apparently been tainted by the three forces of Prakrti. The Cognitive Faculty is at Its purest when it is not under the influence of any of the three principles. Hence it can be said that the Cognitive Faculty by Itself is ever-pure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->To transform this universe, which is only a metamorphosed form of Citi Shakti, into pure Cognition, a special scientific process is required. This scientific process is called dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The process of dharma sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; leads to the transformation of plurality into singularity. It takes one to the exalted position of the Cognitive Faculty, far above the domain of the relative principles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The second quality of Citi Shakti is Its infinitude (ananta). Here ananta does not mean an object which has no finitude or end ; it means an entity which has no witness. The Supreme Entity can never come within the periphery of the mind for He has no witness. An entity which has no end, however, can come within the periphery of mind. The word ananta is only a mundane term, unable to convey any real conceptual understanding of Citi Shakti. If ever the mind does attempt to fathom the magnitude of Citi Shakti it totally loses itself. The mind can only think of that which is finite or that which is not finite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Cognitive Faculty cannot be called infinite in the normal sense of the term because It can never come within the scope of the mind. But we can call the expressed Macrocosm (universe) infinite because, though very vast, it comes within the scope of psychic subjectivisation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Ananta is infinite in the sense of being opposite to anta (finite). The infinitude of Citi Shakti is not the same as the infinitude generally understood by the term ananta. The infinitude of Citi Shakti is beyond the scope of psychic comprehension. Citi Shakti is not witnessed by any finite object, but is the witness of all. None of those objects which Citi Shakti witnesses can be called the final object. The creative flow does not have any terminating point. Hence Citi Shakti&#146;s witness-ship is endless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Objects are composed of inferences (tanma&#x301;tras) and bound by demarcations, and thus have particular names and forms. But the Cognitive Force is neither composed of inferences nor bound by demarcations and is thus Nirvishes&#x301;a (having neither name nor form). An object is recognized and distinguished from other objects by the inferences radiated from it. No two objects radiate the same inferences. Hence the speciality of an object is easily perceived by human beings. Mundane objects are called tanma&#x301;tra&#x301;dha&#x301;ra because they invariably radiate tanma&#x301;tras. From the form tanma&#x301;tras we can determine the identity of objects, but we cannot determine their smallness or vastness. The factor which permits us to determine the size of objects is called vyavadhi. In Sam&#x301;skrta, vyavadhi means form or dimension. Inferences are perceived through the indriyas, whereas the idea about the existential smallness or existential vastness of an object is formed by pra&#x301;n&#x301;ah (vital energy). Citi Shakti is devoid of tanma&#x301;tra&#x301;dha&#x301;ra and vyavadhi and is thus called Nirvishes&#x301;a. That which is nirvishes&#x301;a is infinite. Thus the Cognitive Faculty is not only absolutely pure, but also absolutely infinite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The third quality of Citi Shakti is aparin&#x301;a&#x301;mitva or immutability. Aparin&#x301;a&#x301;mii means that which undergoes no metamorphosis. Nothing is static in this universe; every created object constantly undergoes some kind of change. These changes are caused by the vibrations emanating from gun&#x301;a&#x301;ks&#x301;obha ( mutual conversion of principles), svaru&#x301;pa parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma (homomorphic evolution), and sadrsha parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma (heteromorphic evolution). The change of place of an object is called gait or motivity; and the mental measurement of this motivity is called ka&#x301;la or time. Motivity is the cause of spatial and temporal change within the periphery of object entities. This change becomes the cause of subsequent change. The sequential order of cause and effect which operates within the cycle of creation does not occur within the original stance of the Cognitive Faculty. It only occurs when the Cognitive Faculty comes under the influence of Prakrti. Due to Prakrti&#146;s influence various mutable entities originate from the body of the Cognitive Faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The human body undergoes a continuous metamorphosis from infancy to adolescence, from adolescence to middle age, and from middle age to old age. At a certain stage in this process of metamorphosis death occurs. But even death is not final. After death the five fundamental factors of which the physical body is composed, undergo further metamorphosis. The only entity that undergoes no metamorphosis is the Cognitive Faculty. He is the Immutable One.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->When an object returns to its original cause in the process of metamorphosis, it is called na&#x301;sha (annihilation). Na&#x301;sha is not total destruction; rather it is the opposite &ndash; it is the stage in which an entity returns to its original source of life. In the flow of Pratisa&#x301;in&#x32D;cara entities attain human frames and then, by virtue of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, return to the Supreme Macrocosmic Stance. When a microcosm is not required to return within the scope of the law of causation after becoming established in its original stance, it is called prana&#x301;sha. This prana&#x301;sha, or total merger in the Supreme Cause, is called moks&#x301;a or salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There are no spatial, temporal or personal differentiations within the Cognitive Faculty. Hence He cannot be metamorphosed in any way due to time, space or individuality. He is the immutable one, the impersonal one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The fourth quality of the Cognitive Faculty is apratism&#x301;krama. The word sam&#x301;krama literally means extroversive movement. As there is no spatial difference in the Cognitive Faculty there is no differentiation between internal and external. Thus there is no question of Him moving extroversially or being polluted by any external infection. He is Apratisam&#x301;krama&#x301;, the One who moves internally.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The fifth quality of the Cognitive Faculty is darshitavis&#x301;ayitva. The Cognitive Faculty does not depend upon sense perception for the acquisition of knowledge. He possesses absolute knowledge about all entities. Being infinite, He does not require indriyas; and being omniscient He does not need to perceive inferences. The inner essence of each object is embedded in the Cognitive Faculty, no matter what inferences it radiates. With the help of mahattattva (or buddhitattva), aham&#x301;tattva and citta, the Cognitive Faculty automatically possesses knowledge about all objects and events as the subjective counterpart of Mind. This buddhitattva, sometimes in the form of aham&#x301;tattva, citta or the five fundamental factors, remains an object of knowledge of the Cognitive Faculty. The unit cognitive plate sees whatever the mind of Sagun&#x301;a Brahma reflects on it. Hence the Cognitive Faculty is called Darshitavis&#x301;aya (witness of reflected object).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The Cognitive Faculty can in no way be compared to an object as it is understood in the ordinary sense. Ego arises in the human mind when buddhitattva is misconceived as Cognitive Faculty. Actually, the Cognitive Faculty is not an object of buddhitattva; rather buddhitattva is a form of the Cognitive Faculty, qualified due to the influence of Prakrti. Through psycho-spiritual practice human beings realize that the Supreme Cognitive Faculty, the unit cognitive faculty, and the unit existential-I are not the same. (Unit cognitive force or unit consciousness or a&#x301;tman is the reflecting plate of the existential-I). When people develop this awarneness through psycho-spiritual practice it is called mukhya&#x301; aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vrtti (mukhya&#x301; means predominant or primary; aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vrtti means the propensity that is non-painful). When people realize this by studying scriptures, or by hearing about if from intuitionally developed people, it is called gaon&#x301;a&#x301; aklis&#x301;ta&#x301;vrtti (gaon&#x301;a&#x301; means secondary).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The knowledge of the differentiation between a&#x301;tman (unit Cognitive Faculty) and buddhitattva (existential-I which results from mukhya&#x301; aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;vrtti is called vivekakhya&#x301;ti (viveka means discrimination; khya&#x301;ti means ensconsement) or vis&#x301;ayaka sama&#x301;patti (vis&#x301;ayaka means microcosmic object; sama&#x301;patti means ultimate dissolution). When viveka khya&#x301;ti or vis&#x301;ayaka sam&#x301;apatti become permanent it is called dharmamegha sama&#x301;dhi. To attain permanent viveka khya&#x301;ti, vaera&#x301;gya (spirit of total surrender) and abhya&#x301;sa (continuous practice) are indispensable. The meaning of vaera&#x301;gya is not to colour the mind with the colour of finite objects but to develop an intense longing for the supreme spirituality. The meaning of abhya&#x301;sa is to regularly continue the same spirituo-psychic practice. The minds of non-sa&#x301;dhakas are extremely restless. There are changes in their thought waves at every moment; there are numerous curvatures in the waves of their cittas. Through abhya&#x301;sa, through prolonged and meticulous practice, one strives to make the citta flow with a particular wavelength permanently. When one succeeds in this endeavour all the flows of the universe merge in one&#146;s psychic flow, and one attains samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi. Following that, when one&#146;s flow is suspended in the vast Cognitive Flow, one attains asamprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta or nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->This sort of spiritual practice is mostly performed by citta, Citta is born out of the three fundamental principles. The influence of the sentient principle on the Cognitive Faculty produces buddhitattva or mahattattva (existential-I), the influence of the mutative principle on buddhitattva produces aham&#x301;tattva or &ldquo;I do&rdquo; feeling, and the influence of the static principle on aham&#x301;tattva produces citta, the &ldquo;done-l&rdquo; feeling. So in citta all three principles (gun&#x301;as) have their respective influences. Through abhya&#x301;sa or repeated practice the static citta is converted into the mutative citta, the mutative citta into the sentient citta, and the sentient citta into Cognitive Faculty.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->According to the degree of its psychic concentration, the human mind experiences five states: ks&#x301;ipta (mad), mu&#x301;r&#x301;ha (blindly attached), viks&#x301;ipta (scattered), eka&#x301;gra (concentrated), and nirodha (suspended). Each of these states can lead to a particular type of sama&#x301;dhi (absorption of mind). In the first state, due to the preponderance of vrttis such as anger, the mind is withdrawn from all objects and temporarily concentrated oil one object. Have you ever experienced a quarrel with anyone in your life? In spite of your repeated attempts to calm yourself, your mind persists in thinking about the person you were quarrelling with.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In the second state (mu&#x301;r&#x301;ha) a similar thing happens. The mind becomes so attached to something that it repeatedly thinks about it. A person who is greedy for money becomes totally preoccupied with the thought of making money; a person who hankers after name and fame continuously harbours thoughts about becoming famous.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In the first and second states, the mind becomes so infatuated with its crude objects that ultimately it becomes converted into matter. It follows the path of negative Pratisain&#x32D;cara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Most of the time the human mind is totally scattered. Sometimes it calms down, sometimes it becomes absorbed in something, but mostly in jumps uncontrollably from thought to thought. The restless mind which begins the process of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; can be calmed down through regular practice. Ultimately a state is reached when the mind flows undisturbed in one direction. This state is called eka&#x301;gra bhu&#x301;mi (state of concentration). As one progresses one eventually attains the state of nirodha or suspension of mind. One must reach the state of mental concentration (eka&#x301;gra) before attaining sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Sama&#x301;dhi which is attained in any of the first three states of mind is not real sama&#x301;dhi, but jar&#x301;a sama&#x301;dhi, the sama&#x301;dhi which occurs when the mind is converted into its crude object. In jar&#x301;a sama&#x301;dhi the sentient citta is gradually transformed into mutative citta, and the mutative citta into the static citta. Eventually the whole mind is converted into matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Most people are well acquainted with the fourth state of mind ( eka&#x301;gra). In this state the human mind sometimes becomes exalted with divine sweetness; and sometimes becomes as debased as an infernal creature. Sometimes it keeps company with good people and takes a resolve never to tell lies, accept bribes, get intoxicated, or become characterless; and sometimes it thinks that honesty and virtue are sheer folly, for happiness lies in falsehood, taking bribes, stealing, promiscuity, and the like. The mind is continuously tossed between good and bad. But when the practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; inspires one to accept shreya (path of benevolence) as one&#146;s ideology, one attains the true state of eka&#x301;gra bhu&#x301;mi. In this state waves upon waves of citta emerge.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Every newcomer to the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; suffers from a lack of concentration of mind. After repeating the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra a couple of times hundreds of undesirable thoughts flood the mind. The newcomer thinks, &ldquo;I am unable to attain the One on whom I meditate, and instead am pestered by those objects I do not want.&rdquo; The hand counts the beads, the lips mutter the name of the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a, but the mind roams in the filth of hell. When all the undesirable waves are removed from the mind, one blissful wave begins to flow, and the sa&#x301;dhaka attains the state of eka&#x301;gra bhu&#x301;mi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Citta can be concentrated on anything &ndash; on crude matter or on a subtle idea. It may flow towards the Supreme One (kaevalya) or it may move towards the mundane world. Hence it is said that the mind is like a river which can flow in both directions (citta na&#x301;d&#x301;ii ubhayatah prava&#x301;hinii). When the mind flows towards the Supreme One it is called kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a vaha&#x301; (flowing towards benevolence), and when it runs towards matter it is called pa&#x301;pa-vaha&#x301; (flowing towards malevolence). When the kalya&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;-vaha&#x301; stance of citta becomes permanent it is called savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi (state of determinate absorption). This savikalpa or samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi (philosophically, samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta is the correct term) is also characterized by certain criteria:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->1) Realization of the Absolute: When spiritual aspirants acquire self knowledge they realize the oneness of the Supreme Entity behind the apparent multiplicities of the world. This is the Supreme truth. To realize this truth one does not need to study books or listen to discourses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->2) Requital of reactive momenta: After the attainment of sama&#x301;dhi all afflictions caused by defective cognition gradually disappear.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->3) Loosening of the bondages of reactions: Every living entity is under the bondage of its reactions. Even after attaining savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi one continues to perform actions, but does not acquire the reactions of those actions. At this stage the underlying spirit is as follows:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->It has already been said that one&#146;s afflictions (klesha) begin to lessen following the attainment of savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi. There are five types of klesha, which are dependent on various psychic propensities (vrttis), especially the propensity of defective cognition. The propensities themselves are of two types: klis&#x301;t&#x301;a (painful) and aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a (non-painful). Those vrttis which are helpful for spiritual progress are called aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a; the remainder are klis&#x301;t&#x301;a. The five brood categories of klis&#x301;t&#x301;a: are prama&#x301;na (proof), viparyaya (defective cognition), vikalpa (variability) nidra&#x301; (sleep), and smrti (memory). Following the attainment of samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi these psychic propensities cease to exert their painful influence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..34"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Prama&#x301;n&#x301;a Vrtti<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The derivative meaning of prama&#x301;n&#x301;a is &ldquo;hidden import&rdquo;. The cause of prama&#x301; is called prama&#x301;n&#x301;a. Prama&#x301;n&#x301;a vrtti can cause an animate entity to be transformed into matter through analysis. The prama&#x301;n&#x301;a which leads to this degeneration is certainly a painful modification of klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; vrtti. On the other hand, by employing logic and lucid arguments, one can establish the existence of a&#x301;tman or Parama&#x301;tman. In this case prama&#x301;n&#x301;a can be called a non-painful modification of klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; vrtti. When prama&#x301;n&#x301;a is applied analytically it is klis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; vrtti, and when it is applied synthetically it is aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301; vrtti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Prama&#x301;n&#x301;a is of three types: pratyaks&#x301;a (perception or direct knowledge), anuma&#x301;na (inference) and a&#x301;gama (authority or testimony). When the indriyas assimilate inferences of objects which colour the static portion of citta with a static ideation one acquires preliminary knowledge about an object. This is called sensation (a&#x301;locana&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na). When this superficial knowledge or sensation becomes an object of the mutative citta, and receives the support of the sentient citta, it is called perception or coordinated sensation. When one recreates an image of an object in the citta which does not correspond exactly with the previous perception of the object, the conclusion made by the mind is called inference. (When one recreates an image in the mind which is the exact replica of a object previously perceived, it is called conception).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->To accept the perception or inference of a person in whom one has confidence is called a&#x301;gama or authority. But if the perception or inference is defective then the authority will also be defective. Those who have blind faith in a particular person or book refuse to acknowledge their defects. These defects then devolve on the blind followers themselves.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Viparyaya or defective cognition occurs when one acquires false knowledge about something which does not really exist. Suppose the moon is reflecting in a pond. There are two images of the moon, but the image in the pond is not the real moon. To consider the reflected moon as the real moon is viparyaya or false knowledge. Viparyaya is false knowledge about an unreal object. If prama&#x301;n&#x301;a is the positive knowledge about an object which really exists, viparyaya is defective cognition about a non-existent object. Due to this defective cognition the Singular Supreme Entity appears to be manifested as many in the relative world. He appears to be reflected on innumerable mental plates as innumerable consciousnesses. To see a mirage in a desert is also a kind of defective cognition.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Defective cognition causes five kinds of afflictions, which are also known as the five Avidya&#x301;s: avidya&#x301; (negative force), asmita&#x301; (egotism), ra&#x301;ga (blind attachment), dves&#x301;a (repulsion) and abhinivesha (self-obsession). These avidya&#x301;s are also called tamah, moha, maha&#x301;moha, ta&#x301;misra, and hata&#x301;misra respectively.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Viparyaya vrtti can also express itself in both ways &ndash; klis&#x301;t&#x301;a and aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a, painfully and non-painfully. When the unit mind strives to attain the Supreme Entity by practising sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, viparyaya vrtti is certainly a non-painful propensity. But when viparyaya vrtli causes the unit mind to crudity itself by running blindly towards the mundane world it is a painful propensity. When the unit mind becomes totally degenerated due to its attraction for the crude, defective cognition becomes extremely painful.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->We try to form an idea about the real nature of an object through the sense-organs. And we try to express a feeling about it through words. Often we use words or expressions in a different sense from that which properly belongs to them. Such words and expressions can be called vikalpa because the ideas they convey cannot actually be perceived. Regarding Parama Purus&#x301;a we say that He is devoid of imperfections. In this case we use the word &ldquo;devoid&rdquo; not in the true sense of its meaning, but merely to convey a certain idea about an object. While travelling by train we may say, &ldquo;Good, Burdwan Junction has come?&rdquo; But does Burdwan Junction ever &ldquo;come&rdquo;? We also say, &ldquo;Bullets are flying,&rdquo; but can bullets fly of their own accord. Thus in vikalpa vrtti words are used not in their literal sense, but to convey a certain idea. If one takes the word or expression literally, the whole thing becomes meaningless. Thus meaningless words are used to convey precise ideas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Vikalpa is of three types: kriya&#x301;, vastu and abha&#x301;va.

<a name="4..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->The propensity which creates a psychic vacuum is called nidra&#x301; (sleep). Sleep is the intervening stage between two periods of active psychic functioning. It is a stage of vacuity in which the mind does not function. On waking up one makes the safe assumption that one&#146;s mind did not function for a certain period &ndash; that one slept. Klis&#x301;t&#x301;a nidra&#x301; (&ldquo;painful&rdquo; sleep) is an impediment to sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But dreamy sleep and deep sleep in which one is aware of one&#146;s sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is certainly not detrimental to spiritual progress. This sleep can be called aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a nidra&#x301; or non-painful sleep. Sometimes during sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one falls into a relaxed &ldquo;half-sleep&rdquo;. This is called yoga nidra&#x301;. Most sa&#x301;dhakas experience yoga nidra&#x301; in the early stages of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. It is also aklis&#x301;t&#x301;a because one does not become totally oblivious of oneself.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Memory concerning a spiritual object is dependent on two factors : assimilation and object of assimilation. The difference between intellect and memory is this: memory is re-creation of something already known and intellect is subjcctivisation of an objectivity.

<a name="4..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Following the attainment of samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi the painful propensities gradually become weaker and weaker and consequentity static citta is converted into mutative citta, and mutative citta into sentient citta. As soon as the nonpainful propensities become more powerful the painful propensities begin to disappear. This resembles the disappearance of darkness with the arrival of the light of the crimson dawn. As the light increases in brightness, darkness fades and ultimately totally disappears.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->The innate characteristic of the sentient principle is prajin&#x32D;a&#x301; or intuition; that of the mutative principle is pravrtti or assimilation of mundane objects, while that Of the static principle is inertness. With the cultivation of the non-painful propensities the mutative force is gradually transformed into the sentient force. Ultimately, the mutative and static citta dissolve into the powerful sentient citta. At that stage there remains only the powerful wave of sentient citta, a state known as samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Mental functions are sam&#x301;kalpa (action in seed form) oriented and vikalpa (actional expression) oriented. The sense organs (indriyas) are activated by the sam&#x301;kalpa&#x301;tmaka portion of the mind, and then actions are performed in the practical world. If someone considers that as actions are performed by the sam&#x301;kalpa&#x301;tmaka portion of mind, they are true, and that as actions are not performed by the vikalpa&#x301;tmaka or negative portion of mind, they are untrue, such a statement of theirs is not philosophically justifiable. How far does this sort of positive or negative mental movement of mind influence the life of a spiritual aspirant? How far is it related to sama&#x301;d&#x301;hi? If sa&#x301;dhakas actively render social service and accept it as the supreme goal of life, will they become established in sama&#x301;dhi?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In fact sama&#x301;dhi is neither a positive nor a negative state of mind. Sama&#x301;dhi is a sate of equilibrium. When the surface of water remains smooth and unruffled by the wind, we may call it a state of equilibrium. If the outer surface of turbulent, water is sam&#x301;kalpa&#x301;tmaka or positive aspect of mind, then the currents below the surface should be called the negative aspect. When a state of equilibrium is attained the upper surface and the lower currents of the mind attain parallelism. In the course of their agitated movement, the sam&#x301;kalpa&#x301;tmaka and vikalpa&#x301;tmaka portions of the mind meet at certain common points. Thus in every thought wave, in every entity, at all times, and in all countries there is some kind of temporary equilibrium.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->While one is engaged in extroversial actions (pravrttimu&#x301;laka karma) it appears that both nivrtti (introversial actions) and a state of equilibrium are possible to attain. Similarly, to a person who is engaged in nivrttimu&#x301;laka karma, both pravrtti and a state of equilibrium seem to be impossible to attain. Generally, people accept those objects or actions as natural with which they easily adjust themselves, and those objects or actions as unnatural with which they are unfamiliar. Aquatic creatures think that the only place to live in is water and cannot comprehend how any living object could live on land. Conversely, those creatures who live on land think that land is the only and natural habitat. They gasp for breath after remaining only a little while in water. This is nature&#146;s arrangement &ndash; no question of free choice arises here.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->People who try to bring their minds to a state of equilibrium, find that a tranquil mental flow is something quite natural. For them pravrtti and nivrtti, that is, extroversial and introversial states of mind, are something unnatural. The paths of pravrtti and nivrtti depend upon the mundane propensities neither of them leads to psychic balance, thus neither can ensure absolute bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->For success in the extroversial (pravrtti) sphere of life one must develop an attachment for an external object or extroversial idea, and then make efforts to attain it, For success in the introversial sphere (nivrtti) one must develop dves&#x301;a or the feeling of repulsion for an external object or extroversial idea, and then make the requisite effort to succeed in that endeavour. The greater one&#146;s attachment for an object, the greater the possibility of attaining success in the pursuit of pravrtti. But if there is only attraction for an object, with no endeavour made to attain it, one cannot be successful. If someone wants to become rich, but does not try to acquire wealth, he or she will never become rich. Similarly, the greater one&#146;s psychic repulsion for an object, the more easily one will be able to withdraw from that object. But if one does not try to increase one&#146;s repulsion one will not be successful in nivrtti sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Those who are the advocates of the nivrtti cult strive to convince people that wealth, opulence, and near and dear relations create snares of bondages and are thus impediments to spiritual progress. And their exhortations do not end here. They incite people to abandon their homes and embrace the life of renunciation. In other words they advise people to practise the cult of repulsion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->A spiritual aspirant who wants to attain sama&#x301;dhi needs to develop vaera&#x301;gya (spirit of renunciation) and abhya&#x301;sa (continued practice). Remember, sama&#x301;dhi is neither pavrtti mu&#x301;laka nor nivrtti mu&#x301;laka. Vaera&#x301;gya is the absence of attachment, not repulsion. In order to deal with objects properly one should never become subservient to them, but should ascribe Brahmahood to them by cultivating the repeated practice of cosmic ideation or Brahma Bha&#x301;vana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What is abhya&#x301;sa? Tatra sthitao yatno&#146;bhya&#x301;sah. Abhya&#x301;sa is the creation of a particular continuous psychic vibration. It is the most essential factor in the spiritual sphere. The continuous endeavour to maintain the state of equilibrium of citta leads to the attainment of sama&#x301;dhi. When one is attracted by an object one runs after it, and when one feels repulsion for an object, one runs away from it. A person who is fond of wine often thinks of wine, whereas a person who detests wine prevents his or her mind from thinking about wine. Unless attraction and repulsion are both transcended, the mind can never attain a state of equilibrium or sama&#x301;dhi. Mental equilibrium only becomes possible when one makes a constant endeavour to attain psychic balance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Sama&#x301;dhi becomes a natural phenomenon as a result of continuous spiritual practice. Procrastination is something undesirable on the spiritual path. If ever spiritual practice is discontinued endless desirable and undesirable waves of thoughts occupy the mind. Spiritual practice should be continued uninterruptedly and with proper sincerity and veneration, otherwise sama&#x301;dhi will forever remain a theoretical subject of philosophy, never entering the periphery of practical realization. One must not adopt the psychology, &ldquo;I&#146;m practising spirituality because my a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya (spiritual teacher) told me to.&rdquo; Rather one should think, &ldquo;I want to attain spiritual realization. My a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya is merely guiding me along the path.&rdquo; Only when one takes full responsibility for one&#146;s own spiritual life can one attain the peak of spiritual progress and become fully established on the solid ground of spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->When one accepts something as absolute after due logical deliberation one develops shraddha&#x301; (veneration) in the mind. One who has no respect for the goal can never attain success. Shrat satyam tasmin dhiiyate iti shraddha&#x301;. &ldquo;Shraddha&#x301; is the pursuit of Supreme Truth.&rdquo; The expansion of citta is also called shraddha&#x301;. One should have immense, respect for that object which causes the citta to expand. Sama&#x301;dhi is the state of maximum expansion of citta, and thus shraddha&#x301; is the first stage in the attainment of sama&#x301;dhi. Pravriti and nivrtti are both psychic tendencies. The more one practises either of these the more one&#146;s mind becomes adjusted with them. Sama&#x301;dhi is beyond the scope of pravrtti and nivrtti. Even shraddha&#x301;, is not necessary in the pursuit of pravrtti and nivrtti, but it is indispensable for attaining sama&#x301;dhi. Sometimes an undesirable thought blocks the smooth uni-directional flow of the mind along the spiritual path. When this occurs viirya or spiritual vigour, a special type of psychic power, is required to dispel the negative thought. Spiritual vigour arises as a result of shraddha&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Anubhu&#x301;tavisaya&#x301;sampramosah smritih. &ldquo;The re-creation of an object already perceived is termed smriti (memory).&rdquo; Memory is strengthened by spiritual vigour. When one successfully eliminates all impediments to spiritual progress by developing spiritual vigour born out of shraddha&#x301; and moves towards the spiritual goal without interruption it is called dhruva&#x301;smrti or fixed memory. The waves of extroversial propensities create obstacles in the way of dhruva&#x301;smrti and the waves of introversial propensities keep the mind oblivious of everything. But when dhruva&#x301;smrti is perfect, that is when one&#146;s only object of ideation is the Supreme Entity, and none other, one attains sama&#x301;dlii. At this stage the mind becomes fully identified with its goal. In subtle analysis this is also a type of a positive stage of mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The mind takes the form of the physical object or psychic idea it encounters. This assuming of a form in the mind is called psychic pabulum or a&#x301;bhoga. Unless the mind is liberated from its pabulum permanent peace is not possible. How can one attain liberation from one&#146;s pabulum? Liberation cannot be attained through repulsion. Repulsion for an object is a negative tendency &ndash; this too is a kind of pabulum. Although the mind detaches itself from its object it is nevertheless attached to the non-existent form of that object. When the mind withdraws from its object citta becomes suspended in unmanifested Prakrti due to the attainment of vashiika&#x301;ra siddhi. This is not a supreme attainment. This state of sama&#x301;dhi is neither static sama&#x301;dhi nor nirviija (seedless) sama&#x301;dhi, nor samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi. Within citta there remains the possibility of future rebirth, even after a million years, and thus the attainment of permanent sama&#x301;dhi (kaevalya sama&#x301;dhi) is not possible. The sama&#x301;dhi attained in this state can be called nirbiija prakrtiliina sama&#x301;dhi. Unless this nirviija sama&#x301;dhi is permanent we may at best call it asamprajin&#x32D;ata or nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi, and not salvation of a permanent nature,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In the states of prakrtiliina and videhaliina (two of the seven devayonis) the samska&#x301;ras lie latent in the seed form waiting for a congenial environment to acquire a proper physical base. Videha means bodiless state, liina means merged or dissolved. Videha liina are caused by ones bhavapratyaya (bundle of samska&#x301;ras). The bhavapratyaya contains the reactive momenta which cause one&#146;s rebirth. The states of prakrtiliina and videhaliina are niviija and not asampraliina&#x301;ta because although the seeds of the reactive momenta are burnt, one does not attain full omniscience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->A spiritual aspirant attains the state of videhaliina as a result of shunya dhya&#x301;na or ideation on nothingness. Through such ideation a sa&#x301;dhaka develops a psychic pabulum of nothingness. Yet even in this state there remains the possibility of rebirth. Those who embrace nothingness as their absolute goal develop a void in their citta in the absence of Cognitive Faculty. As a result they are unable to establish themselves in the Supreme Cognitive Stance and attain salvation. The spiritual cult which encourages this practice is certainly defective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Both the prakrtiliina and videhaliina states are established in negation, thus there is certainly a possibility of rebirth. The true path of sa&#x301;dhakas is not the path of bhavapratyaya, but the path of upa&#x301;yapratyaya. (path of positive ideation and exhanstion of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras). Sa&#x301;dhakas will have to devise methods to established themselves in sama&#x301;dhi beyond the periphery of the mind. They should neither become attached to nor detached from the objects created by Prakrti, for this is not the path of enjoyment or sacrifice, but the path of psychic equilibrium. Prakrti is not the entity to be worshipped or denied; the goal is Parama Purus&#x301;a. He is the only object of ideation and adoration. By ideating on Him one&#146;s whole being gradually becomes identiilied with the Cognitive Faculty. Hence one should worship Purus&#x301;a, not Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The perpetual state of nirbiija sama&#x301;dhi acquired in the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Purus&#x301;a is called moks&#x301;a or salvation. Samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi, in which only the I-feeling persists is experienced when the citta is in a state of total concentration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->One who has attained this sama&#x301;dhi gradually acquires the state of omniscience. After citta attains samadhi due to its unwavering ideation on one particular pabulum, it can easily attain sama&#x301;dhi on other pabula too. Once the mind gains control over one object it can simultaneously gain control over other objects as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->What is omniscience? The knowledge regarding the past, present and future is called omniscience. The seed of omniscience lies in every human being, but the degree of its expression varies from person to person. In some the seed is ripe, in others it is unripe. Samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi causes the seed to ripen. In permanent savikalpa the seed assumes vast proportions. In that state one&#146;s object no longer remains within the limited periphery of the unit mind, but becomes as vast as the Macrocosm. One&#146;s potentiality becomes immeasurable. By virtue of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the ungerminated seed ripens and assumes unlimited proportions. Thus elevated sa&#x301;dhakas do not need to acquire knowledge from external sources. The bliss of knowledge spontaneously manifests itself in them due to Macrocosmic grace. Tatra nira&#x301;tishayam&#x301; sarvajin&#x32D;a&#x301;tva biijam&#x301;. &ldquo;The seed of omniscience is manifested in them.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->This expansion of citta is only possible in savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi. A restless citta can never attain samprajna&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi. Jara sama&#x301;dhi (sama&#x301;dhi on crude material objects) should never be called samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi. What is jar&#x301;a sama&#x301;dhi? Jar&#x301;a sama&#x301;dhi occurs when the mind becomes so infatuated with a crude material object of ideation, be it money, opulence, landed property, etc., that it takes the form of that object, to the exclusion of all other objects of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The goal of samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi may be positive or negative, crude or subtle psychic pabulum. The goal of asamprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi, like prakrtiliina, nirbiija, or videhaliina, etc., is neither nirbiija asamprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta (without seed), nor sabiija asamprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta (with seed), but is an intermediary stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Samprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi has four stages. The first stage is called savitarka. One attains this sama&#x301;dhi when the mind is concentrated on worldly objects such as one&#146;s children, relations or wealth. In fact savitarka sama&#x301;dhi is synonymous with jar&#x301;a sama&#x301;dhi. Negative savitarka sama&#x301;dhi occurs when one keeps one&#146;s mind aloof from the thought of family or material wealth. The desire or nondesire for crude pabulum amounts to the same thing as far as the citta is concerned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The second stage is called savica&#x301;ra sama&#x301;dhi. This sama&#x301;dhi occurs not when the citta is engaged in crude psychic pabulum, but when it becomes fully concentrated in the mad pursuit of more subtle pabula such as name and fame, etc. If the citta wants to free itself from these things, one attains negative savica&#x301;ra sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The third stage is called sa&#x301;nanda sama&#x301;dhi. In this sama&#x301;dhi citta only has one psychic pabulum &ndash; the feeling of bliss. This sama&#x301;dhi also has a negative counterpart which occurs when the only psychic pabulum is &ldquo;I am not enjoying bliss.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->The fourth stage of samprajin&#x301;ata sama&#x301;dhi is called sa&#x301;smita sama&#x301;dhi. In this sama&#x301;dhi the unit cognitive faculty has only one object &ndash; the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feeling or asmita&#x301;. When this I feeling disappears leaving a subtler, singular flow of consciousness, it is called asamprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi. In asamprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi there only remains the Cognitive Faculty (Purus&#x301;a). When all other objects or factors disappear and only Cognitive Faculty exists, it is called purus&#x301;akhya&#x301;ti. The way to attain purus&#x301;akhyati is to maintain the ideation that purus&#x301;a is my subject and I am His object, and thus to return to one&#146;s original source with complete self-surrender. Purus&#x301;akhya&#x301;ti is only attainable through the practice of iishvarapran&#x301;idha&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na is devotion attained through japakriya&#x301; or repetition of one&#146;s is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra. Thus Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na is the incantation of the name of the Supreme Being with cosmic ideation. Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na does not mean to escape from the world, nor to avoid one&#146;s responsibilities like a coward. On the contrary, iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na is a dynamic spiritual practice performed with the courage of a lion. The more one masters the technique, the more the mental wave becomes straightened, and the easier it becomes. Through iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na one can reach the state of asamprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi, yet for this attainment dhya&#x301;na is actually more effective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na is a more effective practice for the attainment of savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi, because during iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na the mind is temporarily concentrated in the state of ekagrabhumi (the fourth stage of mental development &ndash; the state of one-pointedness of mind). Whatever little amount of I feeling still persists can be finally discarded through the practice of dhya&#x301;na. Asamprajin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta sama&#x301;dhi is attained following the complete elimination of the I-feeling.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->To ideate on Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma (Non-attributional Brahma) is impossible. Unit beings can only ideate on Sagun&#x301;a Brahma (the Purus&#x301;a liberated from bondage) and Ta&#x301;raka Brahma (the Tangential Point between Sagun&#x301;a and Nirgun&#x301;a). Ideation can only occur when both the subject and object continue to exist. ideation for one who has remained free from klesha (afflictions ), karma (actions), vipaka (requital of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras) and a&#x301;shaya (bundle of unserved sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras) since eternity is meaningless. Microcosms undergo unserved afflictions due to their original actions. Afflictions cause the requital of accumulated sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras and that leads to the formation of a bundle of unserved sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The one who meditates on that Entity who has no mind or feelings will never be showered with grace. How can the ever-free Nirgun&#x301;a Purus&#x301;a shower his grace on human beings? Only Sagun&#x301;a Brahma and Ta&#x301;raka Brahma can shower grace. Those unit beings who have liberated themselves from bondage will remain liberated. They become one with Sagun&#x301;a Brahma and are thus called Great Personalities or Maha&#x301;purus&#x301;a. Only they have the right to shower grace upon microcosms. Infused with divine grace microcosms make rapid progress along the path of iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na. They attain Supreme bliss by surrendering their individualities to the Supreme Entity. In so doing they liberate themselves permanently from the bondages of Prakrti. This sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of salvation which ultimately results in sama&#x301;dhi is not a mental distortion. The mental state it creates can neither be called positive nor negative. The practice of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for the attainment of sama&#x301;dhi is the way to progress along the path of spiritual vigour. There is no room for escapism on this spiritual march.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is action? Action is the relative change of position or place of an object. When an object is transferred from one place to another, or when an object acquires a new position temporarily or permanently leaving its former position, we call it an action. When an overweight person loses weight after strenuous physical exercise, it can also be called an action because he or she now occupies less space than before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->No action can be performed in the absence of the will. Will the initial stage of each action, and is thus called the primary action. One may think that actions such as the beating of the heart, sleeping and awakening occur independently of the will, but this is not so. In these actions, too, the will plays a dominant role.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the mundane sphere some actions depend on the unit will and some on the Cosmic Will. Human beings move according to their individual wills but the wind blows according to the Cosmic Will. Actually, most of the actions which human beings supposedly perform by their own will are directly guided by the Cosmic Will. Some actions are performed by the indirect human will, such as the beating of the heart. When the indirect will ceases to function it should be understood that one&#146;s individual sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras (reactions in potentiality) have been fully exhausted. Under such circumstances a person is sure to die. This death is called the final glorious death (maha&#x301;mrtyu).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Most people who commit suicide do not have the direct will to survive. However, their indirect will remains partially active, sustained by the desire to be free of the untold sorrows, miseries, and humiliations of this life. Deep within they cherish an indirect desire to acquire a new, dignified life in another world after death. This desire is the work of the indirect will. Their indirect will seeks a way to escape the ignominy of humiliation and build a new and better life in the future. Their will did something in the past for which they must undergo their present humiliation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Macrocosmic Will is eternally active behind the creation of this universe. This Supreme Will of Parama Purus&#x301;a is termed Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga in philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->An action which is done independently is called pratyayam&#x301;ulaka karma (original action). Suppose one has a desire to go to Calcutta and then actually goes there. This is an original action because to go or not to go to Calcutta depends entirely on one&#146;s will. But an action which one is obliged to perform mechanically under pressure of circumstances is called sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ram&#x301;ulaka karma (reaction to the original action). In these actions it is the indirect will and not the direct will which functions. The original deed which was performed by the direct will is later expressed as a reaction by the indirect will. Your indirect will forces you to become a tool to restore the equilibrium in the universe which was lost due to your original action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In sa&#x301;mska&#x301;ram&#x301;ulaka karma individuals have no free will, but are slaves to the dictates of the indirect will. Suppose a person commits a theft by his free will. As long as the reaction of the original action of theft is unexpressed, his indirect will remains in seed form as reactive momenta.  But the moment the indirect will finds a congenial environment it expresses itself, resulting in the thief either being arrested by the police, or having to undergo some punishment or humiliation. This is how the thief reaps the consequences of his previous action of theft.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Good reactions to good actions are experienced in a similar way. One will have to reap the consequences of one&#146;s past actions until one&#146;s sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are exhausted. If one&#146;s previous deeds were virtuous, life will be blessed, but if they were wicked, one will be branded as a sinner. Only when all good and bad reactions have been expressed do the bondages of vice and virtue snap open.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->All actions, whether introversial or extroversial, crude or subtle certainly lie latent in individuals in seed form as potential reactions. One day, with the help of the indirect will, they will be expressed in the external world. Suppose one harms someone. The reaction of one&#146;s action will lie in potential form until the proper time and place arrives for its expression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Even if one does not harm anyone physically, but simply thinks of harming someone, sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras will still be created. Whatever feelings one may have for a person, good or bad, will certainly cause a reaction. That reaction will remain in potential form in the subtle mental sphere until the opportune time arrives for its expression. This is why wise people look upon this universe with an attitude of equanimity and pray for the welfare of all. Sarvesa&#x301;m maun&#x32D;galam ka&#x301;unks&#x301;e.  People who fail to do this will have to suffer endlessly for their mean-mindedness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Action is of various types. When the mind, under the domination of avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, is tossed by the waves of worldly desires, that is, when it associates itself with crude psychic pabulum, it is called abhila&#x301;sa (desire). When abhila&#x301;sa becomes firmly rooted it is called sam&#x301;kalpa (resolve) for attaining psychic pabulum. When the mind functions in collaboration with pra&#x301;nendriya and karmendriya (motor organs), it is called krti (physical action); and when it associates itself with pra&#x301;nendriya and the jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nendriya (sensory organs), the mental expansion is called avadha&#x301;na  (advertence). Abhila&#x301;sa, krti and avadha&#x301;na are all actions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Avadha&#x301;na is of three types. When the sensory organs connect themselves to certain objects, but the mind does not accept them, that mental state is called  anavadha&#x301;nata&#x301; (inadvertence). For example, a student&#146;s eyes may be reading the pages of a book while his or her mind is diverted elsewhere.  Many students cannot learn their lessons due to this sort of inadvertence in study. When the mind perceives an object through the medium of the sensory organs, but does not have any deep knowledge about that object, then that special state of anavadha&#x301;na is known as a&#x301;locana jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na (sensation). Here the word a&#x301;locana does not mean serious reflection.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The firmly established sensation which occurs when knowledge is acquired from various sources of an object is called perception (caettik pratyaks&#x301;a). Perception may also be called coordinated sensation. Suppose three blind people feel an elephant to find out what it is like. The one who feels the legs might think that the elephant resembles the trunks of banana trees, the one who feels the trunk may think that the elephant is like a pipe, and the one who feels the ears may think that the elephant is like bamboo trays. Each one experiences a different kind of sensation.  Only when the totality of the legs, trunks and ears is produced as an image in the mind can one acquire a true image of an elephant. The temporary idea acquired about an elephant is called perception.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->When perception becomes meaningful, that is, when a particular name is given which corresponds to the nature of things already perceived, it is called conception. The perception of an elephant is only possible when all the parts of its body &ndash; legs, trunk, ears, etc. &ndash; produce an image of an elephant. When one sees the elephant a second time one thinks, &ldquo;It looks just like the animal I saw previously. Yes, it must be an elephant.&rdquo; When this confirmation occurs one can say that one has a concept about something.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->When a past perception is recreated in the mind with the help of memory, it is called tattva-jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Tattvajin&#x32D;a&#x301;na can be of various types. In the process of meditation, the crude mind merges into the subtle mind, and the subtle mind loses its identity in the causal mind. When the newly awakened subtle and crude minds return to their active states, they perceive things in a completely different way. This new set of perceptions is also called tattva jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na or siddha jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na.  In fact tattva jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is also a type of action, though it is not included in avadha&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->It was explained earlier that krti occurs when the mind is associated with the motor organs and the pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya, and avadha&#x301;na occurs when the mind is associated with the sensory organs and the pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya. But prior to reaching the stages of krti and avadha&#x301;na the will must be converted into sam&#x301;kalpa (determination) or abhila&#x301;sa (desire). Sam&#x301;kalpa is more likely to be successful than abhila&#x301;sa. What is sam&#x301;kalpa? When the mind is firmly associated with its objects in a relationship of iron-determination it is called sam&#x301;kalpa. This vast universe has originated from the sam&#x301;kalpa of the Cosmic Mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Action depends on desire. The nature of an action is determined by the nature of the desire. Feelings of pain and pleasure occur in the mental sphere only because the vibrations of mental feelings are stored there. Reactive momenta are created out of these feelings of pain and pleasure. Desire originates from the sum total of one&#146;s pain or pleasure. Put in another way, it can be said that desire (va&#x301;sana&#x301;) is one&#146;s total reactive momenta in potential form of all feelings of pleasure and pain. People determine their own course of action according to their inherent desire. It is desire which puts a bridle on people and drives them according to its whims. People rarely attain the results they seek. What they actually attain is determined by the nature of their original actions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Human beings strive to acquire objects which satisfy their desires and avoid those objects which displease them. They only pursue those things which give them pleasure. Because of this psychology, human beings do not want to listen to bad news, see horrifying images. When they cannot avoid a painful situation they immediately close their eyes.  This behaviour is a good example of how action depends on desire. To separate action from desire is impossible. If desire is compared to an earthen pot, then the water inside the pot is comparable to pratyayamu&#x301;laka karma.  The water inside the pot assumes the form of the pot, that is, the action representing the water takes the same form as the desire representing the pot. The process of withdrawing the water-like karma from the pot-like desire is termed sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; (the process of attaining liberation). The action which assumes the shape of the pot-like desires is called karma&#x301;shaya (bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras). The course of human life is determined by the nature of one&#146;s bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The bundle of sam&#x301;skaras gets lighter due to non-original actions. After death this bundle loses its connection with the sensory organs, motor organs, pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya and mind. It becomes compact after imbibing a new set of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of pain and pleasure. During a prolonged period of unconsciousness or at the time of death, the bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras becomes even more compact. It can be created in one life or in many lives. Disease, grief and other deep sorrows are merely the reactions of self-created sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. After reaping such tremendous reactions as a result of the temporary disconnection of the sensory organs, motor organs, pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya and mind, a new bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras is created which brings tremendous change to the fortunes of human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->According to one&#146;s desires, original or non-original actions produce pleasurable or painful experiences, or both, or neither. Pleasure occurs when one&#146;s actional vibrations create a congenial sensation which relaxes the nerve fibres, and pain occurs when one&#146;s actional vibrations create tension in the nerve fibres.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->By nature human beings long for pleasure and not pain. The action which creates a pleasurable sensation in the mind is called shukla karma (white action), and the vibration which creates a painful sensation is called kr&#x301;s&#x301;n&#x301;a karma (black action). The action which creates both pleasurable and painful experiences is called shuklakr&#x301;s&#x301;na karma (black and white action), and the action which creates neither pleasurable nor painful experiences is called ashuklakr&#x301;s&#x301;na karma (neither black nor white). Worldly actions are either shukla, kr&#x301;s&#x301;na, or shuklakrs&#x301;n&#x301;a.  Only an action or reaction related to sama&#x301;dhi, that is, spiritual sa&#x301;dhana, can be called ashuklakr&#x301;s&#x301;na, for spiritual actions take one beyond the state of pleasure and pain. When the actional vibrations become embedded in the domain of desire, that is called sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra (reaction in potentiality). The sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra is destroyed by those actional vibrations which are equally powerful and opposite to the original actional vibrations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Every living being which has a physical body has a mind. The a&#x301;tman or soul is the reflecting plate of the mind. As long as the existential feeling of human beings is reflected on the a&#x301;tman, human beings are considered alive. A videhii mana (bodiless mind) cannot function at all because existential feeling does not exist in its mind. The videhii mind only has a bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras which rests on its spiritual base. This is why the videhii a&#x301;tman does not act as the witness to the functions or existential feeling of the bodiless mind. It remains only as the witness of its bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Thus it is proper to call the a&#x301;tman, pratyak cetana (cognitive counterpart).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Pratiipam vipariitam ain&#x32D;cati vija&#x301;na&#x301;ti iti Pratyak.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->As a rule, the bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras that is continually formed until the moment of one&#146;s death in this life, is exhausted through sam&#x301;skaramulaka karma (non-original actions) in one&#146;s next life. Generally, the bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras does not fully ripen during a person&#146;s life unless there is a disconnection of the sensory organs, motor organs, pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya and mind. Thus the actions performed in one life are not experienced as reactions in the same life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Generally, reactions start expressing themselves at the end of an actional flow.  The moment a football loses its power to rise up in the air, it starts falling down to earth. Similarly the actional flow loses its momentum when it comes, in contact with the va&#x301;sana&#x301;bha&#x301;nd&#x301;a (the pot of desires), and from that moment takes the form of reactions. Because of this, one is unable to discern the actions of a previous life which cause the reactions in the present life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Ordinarily, one&#146;s accumulated reactive momenta ripen at the time of death as a result of the disassociation of the sensory organs, motor organs, pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya and mind. These reactive momenta then take the form of reactions in the next life. Human beings fail to realize that it is quite natural for the reactions of past actions to be expressed in this life. Since they cannot see the original actions, they blame God for their fate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Some people who spend their whole lives engaged in virtuous deeds suffer tremendously as a result of previous original actions. For the same reason, some people who performed wicked actions in a past life enjoy abundant pleasure in this life. When people experience reactions without understanding the nature o their original actions in previous lives it is called adrastavedaniiyakarma, or in short, adrsta (fate).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The mind may become temporarily detached from the sensory organs, motor organs and pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya when one suffers from a serious disease, a bereavement, or a fainting fit, etc., or when one&#146;s kulaku&#x301;n&#x301;dalinii is awakened due to one&#146;s association with a great person. When this detachment occurs, the bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras ripens and the reactions of one&#146;s present life start to express themselves. This kind of karma is known as drs&#x301;t&#x301;a vedaniiya karma &ndash; good or bad reactions are experienced in the same life as their original actions were performed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->If a liar, a fraud, a bribe-taker, or a corrupt politician happen to reap the consequences of their bad actions in this life, whether they admit it or not, they will realize in their minds that they are being punished for their falsehood, fraudulence and political hypocrisy. These reactions are drs&#x301;t&#x301;a vedaniiya karma.  Likewise, people can also enjoy the fruits of their actions in this life. Generally we reap the fruits of actions we performed in the past life. To reap the consequences of actions of the present life is not quite natural, though it is also not unnatural.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Generally one does not reap the consequences of the actions performed in this life itself. If the accumulated sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of this life are almost similar to the bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of past life, that is, if the actional vibrations of both lives are the same, then the reactions of both lives occur concurrently. But if the vibrations of the accumulated sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of this life are totally different from those of the past life, the two lives&#146; reactions will not occur concurrently. In the latter case, one will reap the consequences of the actions of the previous life. The actions performed in this life will form a new bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. When this bundle is mixed with the bundle created in the previous life, an altogether new bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras is formed. Hence the bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras varies from person to person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of a saint is not the same as the bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of a sinner. If a saintly person does something bad, there will be a clash between the vibration created by the evil deed and the vibration of the original bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. This will cause a severe disturbance in the nerve fibres. The hand of a person accepting a bribe for the first time trembles.  A man who commits armed-robbery for the first time becomes so mentally agitated that he cannot resist returning to the scene of the crime, and is thus caught by the police. However, when a confirmed criminal commits such an offense, the vibration of the evil deed is in perfect harmony with the vibration of the bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, causing no disturbance at all in his mind or body. For this reason, wicked people continue committing crimes without being caught by the police. If a good person persists in following a bad path, in that case, in the absence of internal conflict, the possibility of a violent tension in his or her nerves gradually decreases.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->There is yet another circumstance in which people may reap the consequences of their actions in the same life. If people continue to perform actions without interruption their karma becomes drsta vedaniiya. With the help of Vidya&#x301; a link is formed between the self and the mind. When the mind is influenced by the sentient principle, the self (soul or atman) reflects on the mind; when the mind is influenced by the static principle it gets embroiled in the mundane world; and when it is influenced by the mutative principle it reaps the consequences of its actions. When people are goaded by the propensity of mundane enjoyment they become desperate for uninterrupted pleasure, and end up drifting in the flow of the static force. As this unrestrained flow is not resisted by any opposing force, it directly hits the va&#x301;sana&#x301; bha&#x301;nda&#x301; (pot of desires) causing a mutative reaction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Human beings undergo reactions according to the nature of their original actions. If someone harms a sick person, a saint, a person who has taken shelter with someone, or a honest person, he or she will immediately undergo a reaction of the same intensity. This is because sick, infirm and saintly people never obstruct the original actions of wrongdoers. Whatever the original actions of a person may be, good or bad, reactive momenta are bound to be created Until all these potential reactions are expressed, liberation or salvation is impossible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..34"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Ya&#x301;vanna ksiiyata karma shubhain&#x32D;ca&#x301;shubhameva ca,<br>Ta&#x301;vanna ja&#x301;yate moks&#x301;onra&#x301;m kalpashataerapi.<br>Yatha&#x301; laohamayaeh pa&#x301;shaeh pa&#x301;shaeh svarn&#x301;amayaerapi<br>Tatha&#x301;baddho bhavejjiivo karma&#x301;bhishca&#x301; shubhae shubhaeh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Until all the reactions of actions, good or bad, are exhausted a person cannot attain salvation in hundreds of lives. Just as people bound by golden or iron chains feel the pains of bondage, similarly people undergoing good or bad reactions will have to accept them.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->As long as one has a physical body, one cannot be free from action. Thus spiritual aspirants must be ever-vigilant to ensure that new reactive momenta do not enter their va&#x301;sana&#x301;bha&#x301;n&#x301;da. Through proper Cosmic ideation (Brahmacarya), sa&#x301;dhakas can keep their va&#x301;sana&#x301;bha&#x301;nd&#x301;a filled with the ideation of Consciousness. They may have to undergo their past sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, but because they constantly ideate on the Supreme, no new bundle of sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras will be created. Moreover their old sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras will be exhausted more quickly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->We often notice that after initiation a sincere sa&#x301;dhaka suddenly experiences tremendous pain or pleasure. The initial stage of a spiritual aspirant&#146;s life is quite troublesome. Those who suddenly feel tremendous happiness become so absorbed in this blissful state that they completely forget their ideology, and those who suffer immense torture sometimes leave the path of sa&#x301;dhaka&#x301; due to their inability to face such difficulties. A true sadhaka must remain unaffected by both pain and pleasure. It should be understood that only through pain and pleasure can one&#146;s sa&#x301;mska&#x301;ras be destroyed and a new karma&#x301;shaya dominated by Consciousness be created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->The way to fill the va&#x301;sana&#x301;bha&#x301;nd&#x301;a with Consciousness is to practice asta&#x301;un&#x32D;ga yoga (the eight-limbed yoga).  This has been divided into three stages. First, one should free one&#146;s mind from the influence of the pra&#x301;n&#x301;endriya and motor organs and lead it towards Consciousness. As a result of this, the karma&#x301;shaya becomes flooded with more and more Consciousness. And through the practice of a&#x301;sanas and pra&#x301;n&#x301;aya&#x301;ma, one should increase the degree of control of the mind over pra&#x301;n&#x301;a. During the first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the human mind and body become increasingly pure. This is known as anubhava.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->After becoming pure in mind and less conscious of the body an awareness dawns in the mind that &ldquo;I am not this body.&rdquo; This awareness is called pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a. Sentient pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a is known as prasam&#x301;khya&#x301;na.  The effort to make pra&#x301;jin&#x32D;a sentient is the second stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. In this stage, when the karma&#x301;shaya is filled with Consciousness, the possibility of a spiritual aspirant&#146;s rebirth is destroyed for good. Burnt seeds never sprout. However, even though it is burnt, the seed still exists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Even though karma&#x301;shaya is filled with Consciousness, the va&#x301;sana&#x301;bha&#x301;nd&#x301;a has to be offered at the feet of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Complete surrender is indispensable. The only way to merge the va&#x301;sana&#x301;bha&#x301;nd&#x301;a into Consciousness is to ideate on Parama Purus&#x301;a and forget everything else. To think of plurality is to stumble towards crudity, whereas to ideate on the Supreme One is to march towards Consciousness. This ideation on the Supreme Entity is called purus&#x301;akhya&#x301;ti (ensconcement in the Supreme Cognitive Faculty). This results in one&#146;s individual identity, one&#146;s va&#x301;sana&#x301;bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a, merging in Parama Purus&#x301;a.  One will become Him. All one&#146;s actions and reactions will merge in Parama Purus&#x301;a. Parama Purus&#x301;a is the Supreme Shelter. Ta&#x301;ma&#x301;hu Parama&#x301; gatih.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject of today&#146;s discourse is vaedhii bhakti (formal devotion) and shuddha&#x301; bhakti (pure devotion). The word bhakti is derived from the root verb bhaj + suffix ktin. While pursuing knowledge some people cultivate devotion for Parama Purus&#x301;a. The devotion which is aroused when one feels one should cultivate devotion is called vaedhii bhakti. Regarding knowledge, action and devotion I once gave a simple formula for determining devotion: action minus knowledge equals devotion. Thus, if action is 100 and knowledge is 20, then devotion is 80. Suppose a person has no knowledge and only performs good deeds. In that case the devotion will be 100 &ndash; 0 = 100. Now, if a person is highly learned, in that case in order to attain devotion he or she will have to perform action to the degree of 100 + 20 = 120. People who are puffed up with the vanity of knowledge will have to perform more actions if they wish to cultivate devotion. It is not easy for them to express devotion to Parama Purus&#x301;a. But those who do not have the vanity of knowledge attain devotion easily. To acquire devotion one requires the good sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of many lives. What is vaedhii bhakti? I have already said that Parama Purus&#x301;a is the nucleus of this universe. Each and every object of this universe is attracted to this nucleus and orbits around it. Attraction, not repulsion, is the natural law. Each microcosm, characterized by its acquired sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras constantly moves around this nucleus. When an object moves around a nucleus two forces operate: the centrifugal force (which takes the object away from the nucleus) and the centripetal force (which pulls the object towards the nucleus). If the centrifugal force is greater than the centripetal, the object drifts away from its nucleus. Conversely, if the centripetal force is stronger, the object finally merges in its nucleus. In the scriptures this centripetal force is called vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; leads the microcosms towards Purus&#x301;ottama, the nucleus of the universe. The force which takes the microcosms away from Parama Purus&#x301;a is called avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. In vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; lies the hope of liberation, the seed of immortality. In avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; lies the seed of sorrow and death. The accumulative effect of both forces has caused the universe to come into being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->What sort of influence does the force of avidya&#x301; have on human life? Avidya&#x301; shakti exerts its influence in two ways: through viks&#x301;epii shakti and a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Viks&#x301;epii Shakti<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Viks&#x301;epii shakti is the force that strongly repels an object from its nucleus. When human beings become excessively attached to crude physicality they move away from Parama Purus&#x301;a. They become so infatuated with matter that they totally forget the Supreme. Similarly, a person who is involved in a court case thinks constantly about his or her opponent. A person who quarrels thinks constantly about his adversary for many days even at the time of meditation. &ldquo;I should have spoken my mind,&rdquo; he thinks to himself, &ldquo;why didn&#146;t I rebuke him more?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The funny thing is that one always thinks about the faults of one&#146;s opponent and never one&#146;s own faults. One never cares to analyse whether or not one has any faults. In this process one&#146;s opponent becomes one&#146;s object of meditation. One becomes so preoccupied with one&#146;s opponent&#146;s defects that one begins to acquire his or her defects oneself. Suppose a person is quarrelling with an opium addict. If he thinks about the addict&#146;s defect constantly over a long period of time he will develop a desire to try opium. That is, he acquires the defect of his adversary. In the same way if one ideates on Parama Purus&#x301;a one will acquire His qualities. People ultimately become as they think: Ya&#x301;drshii bha&#x301;vana&#x301; yasya siddhirbhavati ta&#x301;drshii. Viks&#x301;epii shakti causes a person to move away from A&#x301;tman, the self, and become attracted to matter. The innate characteristic of human beings is to acquire infinite happiness. In this pursuit lies the seed of human excellence. To remain engrossed in the thought of crude matter is contrary to human existence if this ever occurs it should be understood that the concerned person has degenerated. In the Bhagavad Giita&#x301; Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a warns people, Svadharme nidhanam&#x301; shreya, paradharmah bhaya&#x301;vahah: &ldquo;It is better to die while following one&#146;s own dharma than to pursue the dharma of others.&rdquo; Under no circumstances should one forsake one&#146;s own dharma. Here svadharma, or &ldquo;own dharma&rdquo;, does not refer to any particular religion, but to one&#146;s own innate characteristic.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Suppose a person commits a wrong by accepting a bribe. While receiving the bribe he or she thinks that no one is watching, but that is impossible. A third entity is watching everything. No one can do anything secretly in this universe. But the bribe-taker thinks the opposite because avidya&#x301; shakti has placed a veil between him or her and the Supreme Being. This is a very dangerous situation. It is just like a hare being chased by a hunter: the hare sits down and covers its eyes with its ears and, thinks, &ldquo;I cannot see anything, so the hunter cannot see anything either. Hence he won&#146;t be able to kill me.&rdquo; This is a deadly mistake! Wherever one commits a wrong, be it in the depths of the ocean or in a high mountain cave, one cannot escape the consequences: one will certainly be detected one day or another.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the psychic world Parama Purus&#x301;a has infinite power. All longings and thoughts are reflected on His mental mirror. Any action one performs, any thought one is trying to materialize, is immediately reflected on the vast mental mirror. One cannot keep anything secret from Him. If a small piece of stone is thrown into the vast ocean it creates tiny ripples on its smooth surface. This event, although trivial, does not remain unknown to the ocean. Even the least vibration created within the unit mind is immediately known to the Macrocosmic Mind, for the unit mind is within the vast Macrocosmic Mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; also exerts her influence on the human mind in two ways: through samvit shakti and hla&#x301;dinii shakti.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Suppose a certain person who has been doing wrong deeds for a long time suddenly changes for the better. After hearing some wise words, by reading a good book, or by receiving a shock or, injury, a thought dawns in his or her mind: &ldquo;I have unnecessarily wasted so many years in futile pursuits. Now I have only a limited time at my disposal.&rdquo; From the very moment of birth human beings move slowly and steadily towards the grave. With each passing second the distance between the person and the burial ground gradually decreases. Hence human beings should utilize every moment of their valuable time in worthwhile pursuits. A person may realize one day, &ldquo;How unfortunate it is that I have not fully utilized the capacity that God has provided. I have committed a grave error in not doing what I should have done.&rdquo; What is the force that awakens this psychic outlook? It is the samvit shakti of vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. In colloquial Bengali, samvit shakti is called hun&#x32D;sh (sudden awareness). When people suddenly return to their senses or repent, this is the first type of influence of vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; on the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..12"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Hla&#x301;dinii Shakti<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Hla&#x301;dinii shakti is the second type of influence of vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; on the human mind. When people realize that they have wasted their precious time, they express the sincere desire to utilize their time more benevolently. They think, &ldquo;From today I will utilize all my energy and capacity in worthwhile pursuits.&rdquo; This sincere desire gradually takes them towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. And this movement towards the Supreme occurs due to the influence of hla&#x301;dinii shakti. Hla&#x301;dinii shakti is the force which helps the microcosms to meditate on Parama Purus&#x301;a. In the Caetanya Charita&#x301;mrta it has been said,<!-- /block --></p>

That sweet discovery is only possible for those who worship Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a out of deep devotion to Him.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->With the help of vaedhii bhakti (formal mechanical devotion) a person can approach Parama Purus&#x301;a but cannot become one with Him. Vaedhii bhakti does not have that power. To attain oneness with Parama Purus&#x301;a a sa&#x301;dhaka requires ra&#x301;ga&#x301;nuga&#x301; bhakti or ra&#x301;ga&#x301;tmika&#x301; bhakti. Unless a sa&#x301;dhaka develops ardent devotion for Parama Purus&#x301;a, it is not possible to become one with Him. To think, &ldquo;Parama Purus&#x301;a is so vast, so beautiful! How can I possibly attain Him?&rdquo; is to create an impediment on the path of one&#146;s spiritual progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->There are three types of devotion which are well known to all: ta&#x301;masikii bhakti or devotion of static nature, ra&#x301;jasikii bhakti or devotion of mutative nature, and sa&#x301;ttvikii bhakti or devotion of sentient nature.<!-- /block --></p>

Eliminate him/her for my sake.&rdquo; Obviously, such a person has no devotion for the Lord but simply wants to gratify his/her selfish desire.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->When a devotee moves towards Parama Purus&#x301;a with intense yearning for Him, it is called ra&#x301;dha&#x301;bha&#x301;va. When a devotee finally reaches Parama Purus&#x301;a by virtue of this intense ra&#x301;dha&#x301;bha&#x301;va it is called the union between Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301; in the Vaeshn&#x301;ava scriptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Who is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a? Here Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is none other than Parama Purus&#x301;a. You might have seen some pictures depicting Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. These all are false. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Ra&#x301;dha are subtle spiritual concepts. A devotee will have to move towards Purus&#x301;ottama, the Supreme Nucleus, with the help of ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti or hla&#x301;dinii shakti. There is no path of Supreme Welfare other than ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->I have already said that action minus knowledge equals devotion. Thus when a sa&#x301;dhaka performs action, devotion awakens. This is the beginning of vaedhii bhakti. For example, some people pray, &ldquo;Oh Parama Purus&#x301;a, my neighbour&#146;s child has passed the school examination, but my child has failed. The teacher has made my child fail intentionally. Let that teacher be destroyed.&rdquo; This is ta&#x301;masikii bhakti. Parama Purus&#x301;a may or may not grant your prayers &ndash; it depends on His will. But as you expressed ta&#x301;masikii bhakti to Parama Purus&#x301;a you will attain neither liberation nor salvation because you did not want either one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..23"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;jasikii Bhakti<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->In this category of devotion one does not think of harming anyone, but asks for a mundane favour for oneself. For example, one may pray to the Lord, &ldquo;Oh Lord, please bless me so that I can score high marks in my exams and thereby procure a good job.&rdquo; To ask for worldly favours as a result of one&#146;s crude devotion to the Lord is not at all desirable. The Lord may or may not fulfill your desires, but one thing is certain: you will never attain liberation or salvation because you did not desire it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->A devotee of this category may think: &ldquo;Now I am an old man. I have committed so many wrongs in my life. It would be wise for me to take initiation from a preceptor and count beads. Otherwise what will people say about me? They will say I&#146;m spending my old age eating and sleeping and doing nothing worthwhile. At least I should do some religious deeds to show everyone that I love God.&rdquo; This is the inner motivation behind sentient devotion. Such devotees do not think of harming others, but they do not want Parama Purus&#x301;a either. Even if such devotees attain liberation or salvation, they certainly do not get Parama Purus&#x301;a because they did not want Him. Hence such devotion has no real value.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->All of this comes within the scope of vaedhii bhakti. There is a lack of genuine love for Parama Purus&#x301;a in all these types of vaedhii bhakti.<!-- /block --></p>

When spiritual aspirants attain a certain degree of spiritual progress, they are able to hear that divine sound. This divine sound is called on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. All the sound waves of this universe have their source in Him. They emanate from the point of beginninglessness to the point of endlessness, and will continue to emanate eternally.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->The kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii shakti (serpentine power) rises upwards in accordance with the divine sound. As it rises through successively higher stages one hears the sound of crickets, ankle bells and the melodious sound of the flute. This is called the sweet sound of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#146;s flute. It is neither a dream nor a fantasy. All of you will hear it one day. A mystic poet said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->This is pure devotion (shuddha&#x301; bhakti) and not vaedhii bhakti. If one does not move towards Him with one&#146;s entire being, one cannot develop exclusive devotion for Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Api cet sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ro. Who is a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii? A person in whose contact one degenerates is called a dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii. Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said that whoever will meditate on Him with undivided attention will attain liberation from all accumulated sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Devotees who run towards Parama Purus&#x301;a with all the strength of their soul need not be afraid of anything.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->What is pa&#x301;pa? Paropaka&#x301;rah pun&#x301;ya&#x301;ya pa&#x301;pa&#x301;ya parapiir&#x301;an&#x301;am. Any action that leads to one&#146;s physical, psychic and spiritual well-being is called punya or a virtuous deed; and any action which leads to one&#146;s physical, psychic and spiritual degeneration is called pa&#x301;pa or sin. There are two types of pa&#x301;pa or sin: pa&#x301;pa, which occurs when one does something one should not do, and pratya&#x301;vaya, which occurs when one does not do something which should be done. For example, one should nurse a sick person. If one does not do that one is committing pratya&#x301;va&#x301;ya. Pratya&#x301;va&#x301;ya is more harmful than pa&#x301;pa. Pa&#x301;pa and pratya&#x301;va&#x301;ya are both of three types: pa&#x301;taka, atipa&#x301;taka and maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka. If one compensates for the loss caused by the performance of an improper action or by the non-performance of a proper action it is called pa&#x301;taka. Suppose someone has stolen five rupees from a person. If the thief repays the amount in full it is said that she or he has atoned. This is a case of pa&#x301;taka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Atipa&#x301;taka refers to a sinful action for which there can be no atonement. Suppose someone chops off a hand of an innocent person. This is atipa&#x301;taka. But if in a fight someone chops off the hand of their enemy, a wrongdoer, it cannot be called a sin. In the Bhagavad Giita&#x301; Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301; advises people that their dharma is to fight against adharma. A chopped-off hand cannot be put back on the wrist easily.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->What is maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka? Maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka is a sinful action for which there can be no atonement and which has a recurring effect. Once I told you a story from the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a. Ra&#x301;ma and Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a were engaged in a bitter combat. When Ra&#x301;ma began to get the upper hand Ra&#x301;vana entreated Shiva to save his life. On hearing Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a&#146;s desperate pleas, Parvatii&#146;s heart melted, and she requested Shiva to save Ra&#x301;vana&#146;s life. Shiva said unambiguously, &ldquo;I cannot save him. He is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka, a sinner of the worst type&rdquo;. Shiva explained that if Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a had abducted Siita&#x301; in his original form he would not be a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka; but he chose to abduct Siita in the guise of a sa&#x301;dhu (saint). As a result, in the future people will never fully trust sa&#x301;dhus again. Whenever they will see a sadhu they will immediately question his intention. So Shiva refused to help Ra&#x301;van&#x301;a because he was a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said that whoever meditates on Him with exclusive, unwavering devotion will be liberated from all sins. When microcosms ideate on the Supreme Entity they feel joy, and the Supreme Entity also feels joy. Everyone wants joy; the devotees also want joy. Devotees worship Parama Purus&#x301;a with the sole intention of giving Him joy. A mother derives more pleasure from seeing her own child eat than by eating her own food. Similarly, those who are the greatest devotees rush towards Him to give Him joy. They feel much more joy than their Lord feels. Maha&#x301;prabhu Caetanya said,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today&#146;s subject of discourse is &ldquo;Bha&#x301;gavata Dharma&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;bha&#x301;gavata&rdquo; means &ldquo;pertaining to divinity&rdquo; and dharma means &ldquo;inherent characteristic&rdquo;, so Bha&#x301;gavata dharma means &ldquo;the way of life which leads to ensconcement in the supreme stance&rdquo;. Dharma is a natural propensity, an inherent characteristic. It refers to a particular spiritual way of life. Each and every object in this universe has its own innate characteristic, or svabha&#x301;va (Sva means &ldquo;own&rdquo; and bha&#x301;va means &ldquo;propensity&rdquo;). The innate characteristic of fire is to burn whatever it meets. The innate characteristic of human beings is to practise spirituality. To make a clear distinction between spiritual practice and the other natural tendencies of mind in the mundane sense, such as eating and sleeping, the term &ldquo;Bha&#x301;gavata dharma&rdquo; is used to describe the higher tendencies. Bha&#x301;gavata dharma refers to the innate tendency which leads human beings towards the Supreme Entity, which arouses in them a spontaneous love and attraction for the Supreme Entity. In fact, in each and every human being there is love and attraction for the Supreme Entity. The human being who does not feel this attraction hardly deserves to be called a human being. Such a being is no better than a sub-human, although in human form. It is bha&#x301;gavata dharma that clearly distinguishes human beings from animals. Even a thief who feels love for the Supreme Entity in the core of his heart, merits being called a human being. But a so-called virtuous person or a man of knowledge who feels no love for the Supreme Entity should not be considered a human being, because in such a person human dharma is wanting. Human beings are characterized by their bha&#x301;gavata dharma. They have a spontaneous attraction for the Supreme, which non-humans do not possess. Hence, human beings have a glorious existence; animals do not.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->This shloka clearly illustrates that human beings devoid of bha&#x301;gavata dharma are just like animals. I have already said that if human beings lack bha&#x301;gavata dharma they are actually worse than animals. Animals do not have a developed intellect or consciousness; human beings do. If human beings fail to utilize their developed intellect and consciousness, choosing to avoid the pursuit of bha&#x301;gavata dharma, they are the enemies of humanity and a slur on the human race. Their actions, having no relation to bha&#x301;gavata dharma, should be considered contrary to humanity and their innate characteristic. Their future is bound to be doomed, like that of a huge tree struck by lightning. The downtrodden masses who long to better themselves should embrace the path of bha&#x301;gavata dharma. The easiest and most natural way for human civilization and humanity to grow is through bha&#x301;gavata dharma. There is no other way. Hence, those who sincerely seek the welfare of humanity must uphold bha&#x301;gavata dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Bha&#x301;gavata dharma is dependent on three factors: vistara (expansion), rasa (flow) and seva&#x301; (service). The literal meaning of the word vista&#x301;ra is expansion, that is, to direct the mind toward the vast Cosmic Entity. This psychic movement towards the vast Cosmic Entity is not dependent on external factors. To move towards that Supreme Entity one must first overcome and transcend all sorts of meanness and pettiness. Hence, a follower of Bha&#x301;gavata dharma must wage a relentless fight against these limiting tendencies within his or her own mind, as well as in the society at large.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->When the mind is confined within the narrow limits of pettiness a polluted atmosphere of sin spreads all around.

<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Only human beings can expand their minds because only they have the opportunity to follow bha&#x301;gavata dharma. Now the question is, how can human beings follow bha&#x301;gavata dharma, and when should they begin?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Human beings should practise bha&#x301;gavata dharma from their childhood, from the age of five. Human life is more valuable than the lives of other creatures. Hence every creature unconsciously yearns to attain a human frame because only with a human frame is it possible to practise spirituality and perform noble deeds. The scriptures state that the practice of bha&#x301;gavata dharma should commence at childhood. Those who embrace bhagavata dharma look upon this entire creation as a manifestation of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u (Parama Purus&#x301;a). A small effigy of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u is not the real image of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u for them. They love the manifest form of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u because they are in an inextricable relationship of love with Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Anayamamata&#x301; vis&#x301;n&#x301;oramata&#x301; premasam&#x301;gata&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The exclusive love for Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u can be called prema or divine love because one is in love with the Supreme Entity in whose mind resides the entire universe. By creating the quinquelemental world He bas made Himself accessible to His created objects. Even a small blade of grass is His creation. Hence the followers of bha&#x301;gavata dharma who expand the mind, will certainly see every object of this universe as an expression of their dear Lord. They will therefore show equal respect for each and every entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->A religion or cult which does not encourage spiritual elevation but keeps the human mind confined to narrow limits, and depicts God in various imaginary forms, is far removed from bha&#x301;gavata dharma. In bha&#x301;gavata dharma there is no scope for differentiations and distinctions. The religion or philosophy which causes the human mind to become so analytical that it distances itself from the one integral Entity is contrary to bha&#x301;gavata dharma. Those following bha&#x301;gavata dharma strive to create unity and synthesis in the midst of disunity and analysis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The second factor is rasa, or flow. Whatever is happening in this universe, whether natural or supernatural, is due to Cosmic Will. Everything depends on His grace. Whatever human beings think, say or do is only possible due to Cosmic grace. This entire universe is a Macro-psychic conation &ndash; everything originates from the thought waves of the Macrocosm. Thus He witnesses everything at the same time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The major difference between the unit mind and the Cosmic mind is that whatever the unit mind imagines is only transformed into action on certain occasions. The external projection of the unit mind is only possible when it is fully concentrated. But for the Cosmic mind nothing is external &ndash; this entire universe is within His mind. The Cosmic thought-waves appear to be something external for us. The Macropsychic thought waves are his Svarasa (flow). Likewise, for externalization various waves emanate from the unit mind. In the first case the psychic waves are the svarasa of Parama Purus&#x301;a. But mental waves, created by various thoughts, are the svarasa of microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Microcosms differ from one another due to the differences in their individual flows. All microcosms want to move according to their own individual flows. They endeavour to direct their internal thoughts and actions according to their individual flows. That is why the thoughts, actions and lifestyles of microcosms are so diverse. When you walk along a road a cobbler looks at your feet, a washerman looks at your clothes, and a barber looks at your head. The difference in their outlooks is due to the difference in their individual flows.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->All microcosms create their own individual flows, in adjustment with the Macrocosmic flow. Hence the individual flow of every microcosm is directly controlled by Parama Purus&#x301;a. I have often said that Parama Purus&#x301;a is not guided by your intellect or desires, but moves according to His own wishes. You will never have any opportunity to question Him. You will have to move around Him, whether you like it or not. If your individual flow does not maintain an adjustment with the Macrocosmic flow your longings will never be fulfilled. Everyone longs to attain so much but only attains a fraction of what is desired. If one&#146;s longings are not in perfect adjustment with the Cosmic waves one can never attain success.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..17"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Kii habe iccha&#x301;y iccha&#x301;te kii hai<br>Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a iccha&#x301; vina&#x301; phal phalena&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..18"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[Does individual desire have any value? Without the approval of the Supreme Entity nothing can succeed.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->You wish to attain something, but if your desire is not approved by the Supreme Entity, then you will not attain success in your mission. This is the second factor &ndash; rasa tattva of bha&#x301;gavata dharma. What is rasa tattva? When human beings are in deep love with Parama Purus&#x301;a they begin to know His nature and follow His will accordingly. Such individuals become invincible and victorious in the world. Most people are overwhelmed by His greatness, but sa&#x301;dhakas know the secret of becoming great. Thus the basic spirit of rasa sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is to direct one&#146;s individual desires and longings towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. Only in this way can a sa&#x301;dhaka achieve fulfilment (rddhi) and success (siddhi). In the scriptures this has been called ra&#x301;saliila&#x301;. Created beings, will have to move according to the Cosmic will; there is no other way. Learning, intellect and personal status become meaninngless unless they are directed towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. After realizing the Supreme truth intelligent people start moving according to Parama Purus&#x301;a&#146;s desire, saying, &ldquo;Oh Parama Purus&#x301;a. I have nothing to ask of you. Let thy will be fulfilled. I want nothing else.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The third characteristic of bha&#x301;gavata dharma is selfless service (seva&#x301;). When you offer something to a person and expect to receive something in return, it is a sort of commercial transaction. But when you have no desire to receive anything in return for services rendered it is called true service, and here lies the basic difference between true service and commercial transactions. You might have seen newspaper advertisements in which a certain company says it has been rendering service to the people over a long period of time. But the question is, can any commercial institution truly &ldquo;serve&rdquo; the people? Are they not merely involved in a commercial transaction of one form or other?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Service can be of two types: internal and external. This entire universe is the expression of the greatness of Parama Purus&#x301;a, and therefore, whatever a person does for a particular living being is as good as rendering service to Parama Purus&#x301;a. Wherever you are, and whatever you may be, whether you are leading a family life or the life of a recluse, you need to serve all created beings for they are the veritable expression of the Supreme Entity. While serving living beings one should never allow a feeling of vanity to develop. One should always remember that one is serving Parama Purus&#x301;a and none other. Had Parama Purus&#x301;a not come in your contact in the from of living beings, you would not have an opportunity to serve Him. He comes to you as a sick person or as a beggar to solicit your assistance. Naturally you are more grateful than the person you serve because Parama Purus&#x301;a has given you the opportunity to serve Him. Thus everyone should render external service.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Japakriya&#x301; and dhya&#x301;na should also be practised with the ideation that one is serving Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is internal service. If this is done one will achieve intense psychic concentration. Of course one must serve without expecting any reward in return. If this spirit of service is fully awakened during japakriya&#x301; one will attain eveything. A service-minded sa&#x301;dhaka can attain liberation merely by repeating naina mantra, but a Yoga who performs higher spiritual practices will attain nothing in the spiritual sphere if he or she shuns service.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->If internal service is not rendered properly, true external service becomes impossible. Hence it has been said,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..24"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Atmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Individual salvation is also a service to humanity. Internal service (a&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham) leads to fulfilment or immortality; external service (jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca) leads to universal welfare. Thus both internal and external service have equal importance. External service purifies the mind, and with a pure mind one is more capable of rendering service to one&#146;s is&#x301;t&#x301;a. Every sa&#x301;dhaka should render both types of service.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The mind thinks; it creates micropsychic waves. The merger of micropsychic waves into Macropsychic waves is a natural process. This merger is possible for every human being in the rendering of external and internal service. Thus bha&#x301;gavata dharma is a social dharma, a human dharma that easily can be followed by all. Whether people are aware of it or not, all are moving towards the nucleus of bha&#x301;gavata dharma. Everyone&#146;s individual journey ultimately terminates in Parama Purus&#x301;a. Just as the earth is moving around the sun, and the moon around the earth, similarly every individual human being is moving around Parama Purus&#x301;a. Your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is nothing but an attempt to reduce the distance between yourself and Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->One&#146;s nerve cells, glands, and sub-glands are created according to one&#146;s individual flow. In fact, various structures are created based on this individual flow. The various thoughtwaves of the mind are all identified with the individual flows. All microcosms, knowingly or unknowingly, are rotating around the nucleus of the Cosmic Cycle. No one is separated from the Supreme Entity. Living beings attain different physical bodies according to their respective psychic waves. And with their individual minds and bodies they move around the Cosmic Cycle. This movement continues as long as they feel that they are separated from Parama Purus&#x301;a. But as soon as the tiny drop finds the vast ocean it automatically merges in that ocean. The distance between the two is removed and there remains no separate existence for either. The two become one. But until that final union is achieved unit beings will have to move like bullocks trudging around the oil mill.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->When sa&#x301;dhakas establish themselves in bha&#x301;gavata dharma, by virtue of vista&#x301;ra, rasa and seva&#x301;, their journey comes to an end. They become one with the Nucleus, one with Parama Purus&#x301;a. At that stage they realize the secret of the divine sport of Parama Purus&#x301;a. This is the true dharma of human beings &ndash; bha&#x301;gavata dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->In the Giita&#x301; Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said that to pursue one&#146;s own dharma is the best and safest path, whereas the pursuit of other&#146;s dharma is extremely dangerous. The endeavour to satisfy physical needs is common to both humans and animals, but this endeavour alone does not lead to supreme welfare. Rather, if people become totally engrossed in gratifying their crude desires, they will most probably become extremely crude. Hence, although bha&#x301;gavata dharma is human dharma, and is a somewhat difficult path, people should follow this path, and not the path of animal dharma. If they do follow animal dharma their rapid degeneration is inevitable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->One should remember that here dharma does not refer to any particular religion. These religions have nothing to do with one&#146;s svadharma, with the pursuit of one&#146;s innate characteristics. Unfortunately, this is how the Giita&#x301; bas been misinterpreted by a section of the people. The dharma of all human beings is one and indivisible, and that dharma is bha&#x301;gavata dharma. Establish yourself in that dharma and your victory is assured.<!-- /block --></p>
