<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Gondwanaland is the name given by geologists to a super-continent as they consider it to have existed hundreds of millions, even billions, of years ago. And the very oldest part of that continent that has remained above water came to be called, after human beings appeared who could give names to things, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. (Or more precisely, western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.) When Gondwanaland broke up and gradually metamorphosed into a number of our modern land masses, that ancient land of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was to be found within the Indian sub-continent, occupying an area that is now mostly coextensive with the western part of West Bengal. (Geologists do not necessarily speak of Gondwanaland in the past tense, but sometimes speak of all the dispersed parts of Gondwanaland, as Gondwanaland even today.) Then came the geological birth of eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the appearance of human beings in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, and the geological birth of the remaining portions of Bengal still farther east than eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. With Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h as the main nucleus, civilization developed throughout Bengal, and Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h spread its influence to other lands also. In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h: The Cradle of Civilization, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar tells this story.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The original book was published in Bengali in 1981. In view of the wealth of information that the author has given in the book on geological and geographical, historical, archaeological, sociological, linguistic, artistic and even spiritual subjects, there has been a long-standing demand for an English version (a demand to which some noted archaeologists have recently added their voices). We are now happy to be able to fulfil that demand, however belatedly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Unsigned footnotes, indicated with asterisks, are those of the author. Since many readers may not be entirely familiar with Bengal or even India, the translators have also provided notes wherever necessary. Footnotes by the translators have all been indicated with numbers and signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo; Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations or other insertions by the translator, while round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or word given by the author, and normally his own use of such punctuation. Some of the translators&#146; footnotes provide further background to a topic with excerpts from other works by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->This book contains a multitude of place names and names of historical figures. Since Europeans first came to India, such proper names have been rendered in roman script according to a variety of romanization systems, and also sometimes in haphazard ways that could not be called systems at all. The surname that in Ananda Marga&#146;s romanization system would be rendered as &ldquo;Ra&#x301;ycaodhurii&rdquo;, has over the years been romanized in about sixty ways &ndash; &ldquo;Roychoudhury&rdquo;, &ldquo;Roy Choudhury&rdquo;, &ldquo;Raychowdhuri&rdquo;, etc. Nevertheless, such spellings have stuck, and citizens of India are now familiar with them. In this book we have normally tried in the case of each proper name to use the romanization preferred by that particular person or that particular place themselves, and with which Indians might be most familiar; but obviously we may often have been wrong as to what was preferred or most familiar. If the name was an obscure one for which there might be no preferred or familiar romanization, we have followed the Ananda Marga system. For all common nouns, name of gods and goddesses, name of religions, philosophical systems, literary movements, etc., we have followed the Ananda Marga system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the original Bengali book, the number 9 as a chapter number was inadvertently skipped, so the chapters were numbered 1-8 and 10-32. In this book they have been numbered 1-31.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Shrii Viiresh Bose set the English translation of this book on a strong foundation, preparing the entire first draft. Since Shrii Viiresh was unable to be present during later review and modification, any defects there may be in the book are the responsibility of the co-translator alone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->We wish to thank A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Satyashiva&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta and A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmaka&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta, who contributed greatly to the translation of the early chapters of this book, A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Priyashiva&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta, who contributed greatly throughout, and Shrii Hita&#x301;m&#x301;shu Banerjee, who assisted much with the later chapters. We are also grateful to some of the archaeologists mentioned above, who spared their valuable time to assist us.<!-- /block --></p>

Human beings appeared on the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h after the ice age had retreated from its heart. The enormous animals were gradually becoming smaller. The mammoths (aera&#x301;vatas in Sanskrit) had been frozen in ice and fossilized, leaving behind elephants as their descendants. The age of gigantic dinosaurs, guntosaurs and kakt&#x301;esiya&#x301;s was over, and other kinds of large animals took their place. The forest-dwellers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, clad in leaves, bark and animal skins, lived by hunting. The human beings of today may disregard them, but those people were the epitome of simplicity, they were the representatives of the undulating soil and the thunderous reverberation of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the underdeveloped humans of that time who were the revered ancestors of the people of today, and the dust of whose feet we touch to our heads as we march ahead.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Afterwards, those people learned how to tend animals, and slowly learned a little agriculture.

A fire for self-expression stirred their hearts as well. This was many thousands of years ago. Surely, they did practise tapasya&#x301; [suffering or austerity for the attainment of a certain goal]. But what was it for? How did they do it? Who taught them? No one but the Lord of their inner world, the Supreme Master of their life, taught them &ndash; &ldquo;Search, search, someone is there &ndash; someone is coming &ndash; someone will give you what you need to journey forward, and help you properly direct your efforts to reach the target.&rdquo; This was their nameless, silent tapasya&#x301;.

People of many lands started converging on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h to hear the pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cajanya, the clarion call, of humanity, and to join in singing the paean of humanity. China called Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h by the name of &ldquo;La&#x301;ti&rdquo;, Greece called it &ldquo;Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; Rid&#x301;i&rdquo; and the Aryans called it &ldquo;Ra&#x301;t&#x301;t&#x301;ha&rdquo;.

The ancestral land of the majority of the Brahmans of modern Ba&#x301;m&#x301;la&#x301; was Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Hence they call themselves Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Brahmans even today.

Pandu Basudev, the nephew of the sonless Vijaysingha, ascended the throne of Singhal in c. 534 BCE and conquered the south-western coast of India. The transplanted people of Bengal laid the foundation of the Nair society of Kerala. The Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Brahmans of Bengal set sail for the coast of Konkan where they set up the Gaor&#x301;iiya Sa&#x301;rasvata Brahman society. Sahasrabahu, another prince of Singhapur, founded the Thailand dynasty and named the country Shya&#x301;mdesh. None of the above went as a conqueror; wherever they went they became sons of the soil and merged with the local inhabitants. This is a matter of great joy. The superiority of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h did not lie, as a hidden agenda, in the conquest of those lands; it lay in devoting themselves to the service of those new places. This was Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h the starting-point of civilization.<!-- /block --></p>

A person comes to be a philosopher when that person studies his or her environment and thereby learns to see his or her inner self. This very Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h presented human society the first philosopher, who was none other than Maharshi Kapil. He wanted to get to the bottom of the mystery of creation and bring the causal factors of the universe within a framework of a theory of numbers. We in today&#146;s world cannot imagine how much self-confidence and inner daring it took for a person to do this. Maharshi Kapil was born in a certain place near Jhalda in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. He came to the highest philosophical realization at Gangasagar, on the Bay of Bengal, at the furthest extremity of Samatat in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Later another philosopher, Maharshi Patanjali (who was born in Patun village in Burdwan), endeavoured to establish a heartful union between the earth and human beings, and between human beings and their inner divinity.<!-- /block --></p>

Valmiki&#146;s Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a is of course an epic, but perhaps more than an epic, because it abounds in educative features. Some call it a pura&#x301;n&#x301;a [educative fiction], but so much aesthetic sense is hard to find in a pura&#x301;n&#x301;a. But that Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a epic [of Valmiki] is not for the common people. It was Krittivas Ojha who offered the Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a to common people in a new way, telling the story in a context of the joys and sorrows, the smiles and tears, of the general populace.

Krittivas was also a man of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. And it was Maladhar Basu of Kulingram of Burdwan District, also a Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Kayastha, who brought the Bha&#x301;gavata Sha&#x301;stra, that unending flow of devotion, through the ears of deep-thinking Bengalees into their very hearts.<!-- /block --></p>

Those who drenched Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h in a flow of sweetness in those days and caused people to lose themselves in joy were the original Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava poets, people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; Dvaja Chandidas (from Nanoor of Birbhum), Dina Chandidas (from Burdwan) and Baru Chandidas (from Chatna of Bankura). The mission to enliven the human mind with a flow of sweetness was first taken up precisely by people from Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, and they inspired the rest of the world to activate themselves in this same mission. What flooded, and is still flooding, the minds of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is the joy of inspiring others to do noble deeds.<!-- /block --></p>

All these gods and goddesses have the power to bestow wrath and love and curses and boons and all such things. If they curse, the merchant ship Saptad&#x301;iun&#x32D;ga sinks, and if they are propitiated, the ship which has sunk may float up with everything in it untouched by water. Logical argument about this fact [the reality of these things] would be out of place here, because the deities had no social standing though they had gained currency in society [i.e., in the worship of the common people]. The poets of the Maun&#x32D;galka&#x301;vya helped the deities gain social standing. The poetic stories of the Vaishnavites were almost contemporary with the Maun&#x32D;galka&#x301;vya era. The Maun&#x32D;galka&#x301;vya poets were almost all from Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Those who vibrated people&#146;s minds through characterization and a flow of sweetness were Ghanaram Chakravorty (of Burdwan, who wrote the &ldquo;Dharmamaun&#x32D;gal&rdquo;), Kavikankan Mukundaram Chakravorty (of Damunya [village] of Burdwan, who wrote the &ldquo;Chandimaun&#x32D;gal&rdquo;), Raygunakar Bharatchandra Ray (of Penr&#x301;o Vasantapur of Bhursoot, who wrote the &ldquo;Annadamaun&#x32D;gal&rdquo;), etc. They were all from Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>

Though not born in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, Rabindranath [Tagore] and Michael Madhusudan Dutta were Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii by lineage. Rabindranath also became a man of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h by choosing Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h in which to work. The contribution of Kazi Nazrul Islam to Bengali literature demands praise. He also emerged from the undulating red soil of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The wizard of rhythm, poet Satyen Dutta, who trained his flow of rhythm to surge and dance with vitality like a fountain, was a man of Burdwan District &ndash; a Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hi Kayastha. Rajshekhar Basu (Parashuram), who left a novel imprint on Bengali literature, was by lineage a Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Kayastha and by place of birth also a Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hi (of Brahmanpara of Burdwan District).

This resulted in a new system of calculation based on the solar year. In those days Ma&#x301;rgashiirs&#x301;a, that is, Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;, was considered to be the first month of the Bengali year.

Then they generate pulsations ceaselessly in each manifestation of the mental set-up. When the world of ideas takes shape in the external world [in the form of art], those ideas undergo that transformation not only through language but also through [the display of] emotions, through different techniques, rhythms, mudra&#x301;s [symbolic gestures] and beautiful visual forms. Painting is a subtle expression of this type. Not only did the traditional screen painting artists of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h earn fame for themselves; many of them also exalted their art from the sphere of the objective world sphere of the noumenal world. Thanks to their lofty ideas and dexterous hands, the classical art of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h developed.

But argument for the sake of argument will not go far towards victory in a debate. Victory rests on a strong basis of logic. The description of a sea coast that Kalidas has given is the exact description of the sea coast of Contai. Had he been an inhabitant of a mountainous coast region, his description would have been different. Again, had he lived at a barren, grey, desert-like sea coast, his description would have been different yet. So it will be by no means a travesty of truth to guess that Kalidas dwelt in the Contai region of southern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The sea at the Contai coast is to the south. So in order to enjoy the wind blowing from the sea, people build south-facing houses. This is also a strong point of logic in this matter.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The varn&#x301;a&#x301;shrama social system [four-caste system] did not originate in India. This weed crept into India from the north-west and, sucking all the vital juice out of the verdurous expanse of people&#146;s minds, it threatened not only to destroy their minds, but to annihilate them totally. The effects linger on. We still feel the ill effects in our innermost being, in every vein and capillary. This varna&#x301;shrama system is an ineradicable black spot on us. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, situated at the furthest end of northern India, was also touched by this all-obliterating wave. Just as in northern India, the social discipline in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was about to be devastated by this caste system. [Throughout northern India,] all attempts to stop the onrush of the scourge of this wave, this wave of discrimination, superiority complex and inferiority complex, with weak embankments of sand, proved futile. No one could stop it, but in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h some efforts were made. There an attempt, at least, was made to give some support to society so as to save the social edifice from the jaws of disaster. It was Sma&#x301;rta<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Raghunandan who made this attempt through his two-caste system. This system, like the four-caste system, was defective, but the defects were not as serious as in the four-caste system. And the main thing was that, defects or not, an experiment at least was certainly made. Bankimchandra and Haraprasad Shastri appeared at a time when the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Bengal had, in confusion, forgotten their real selves; when they failed to find a  link in their lives between the past and the present; and when self-recrimination was the order of the day. They came with a lamp of enlightenment in that dark age. In their literary work they both sallied forth not only with strokes of the pen and marks of ink, but also in a vital literary achievement that resonated with the loud clang of swords. Bankim and Haraprasad were Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii by lineage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Like the shruti sha&#x301;stra [the Vedas] the smrti sha&#x301;stra [social scripture] is neither unchangeable nor divine. The social scripture undergoes changes in every age according to the needs of society. At a time when India clung to the interpretation of Mita&#x301;ks&#x301;ara&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  given in the smrti sha&#x301;stra of Manu, without considering its merits and demerits, and wanted to fling the people of India into a dark well of oblivion and isolate India from the rest of the world, Jimutbahan Bhattacharya, an inhabitant of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, introduced the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  system, based on a much more scientific and humanistic outlook and on sensitivity for the rights of daughters, and thus set Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Bengal free from family squabbles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->At that time myriad evils and aberrations, and various unholy and corrupt practices, paralysed social life. Some influential persons, enjoying the privilege of higher social standing, began to make people outcastes with or without reason. Those who were thus excommunicated found it hard to live in society with self-respect and with their heads held high. Due to the mental pressure on them, and due to the irresistible lure of acquiring social status, many among them began to think it proper to convert to other religions. And in fact, many such conversions did take place. It was at that time that Devibar Ghatak (of Birbhum) introduced the melbandhan (pat&#x301;ibandhan as it was called in the Barendra caste) system<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  among those outcastes. As a result, the tendency to convert to other religions came to a halt. The scholars of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had on earlier occasions also been fighting against the existing customs. The invention of the melbandhan system was a great revolutionary step on the part of the social reformers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. This clearly showed their originality of thought and their spirit of independence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Krishnananda Agambagish, another revered son of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, brought about innovations in religious life by thoroughly reforming the ritualistic system of worship and festivals of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. He introduced some sort of logic into the illogical system of offering worship.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Krishnachandra, the king of Krishnanagar (a Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Brahman), did much for the society of that time. His fame spread far and wide, crossing the borders of Bengal. On the one hand, he brought many sweets experts from the neighbouring district of Burdwan and built up the sweets industry by getting them to prepare new varieties of sweet. And on the other hand, he won fame by bringing many shellac artists from Ilambazar, Birbhum, and helping them to settle in Ghurni, Nadia. And if Nadia has a worldwide reputation in clay-modelling, it was due to King Krishnachandra. At that time, most townships grew in an awkward way. But this very King Krishnachandra got the town of Krishnanagar built in a planned way by Allal Dastur Pir, a city architect of the then Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>

But the environment is not made up only of the five rudimental factors [ethereal, aerial, luminous, liquid and solid]. The environment is not made up only of earth, water, air, rivers and vegetation. The environment must include also citta [the objective mind], aham&#x301;tattva [the ego], mahattattva [the &ldquo;I exist&rdquo; feeling] and a&#x301;tma&#x301; [the soul].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The mental trend of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h developed in a special environment, and that environment in turn had been formed in such a way that it became easy and natural for the mind to vibrate the a&#x301;tma&#x301; [spirit] in a special manner. Initially, there was no dharma [spirituality, spiritual path] in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Though the Rgveda was composed in the distant past &ndash; about fifteen thousand years ago &ndash; the Vedas were not dharma. The collection of the Vedas composed by different rs&#x301;is [sages] is nothing but the A&#x301;rs&#x301;a Matava&#x301;da [Doctrine of the Rs&#x301;is]. Many rs&#x301;is gained deep inspiration from their internal culture], and shaped that inspiration into words in the Vedic verses (shruti). The a&#x301;rs&#x301;a doctrine that thus developed gave rise to the A&#x301;rs&#x301;a Dharma [Religion of the Rs&#x301;is]. Lord Sada&#x301;shiva&#146;s advent occurred about 7500 years ago. The people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h turned the liberal Shaeva Dharma [Shaivism] which that great entity had propounded for the welfare of humanity, into their vital treasure in all respects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The Aryans began to proceed towards Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h from the north-western part [of India] at that time. But the liberal Shaeva Dharma was being practised in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h long before the influx of the Aryans [into Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h]. The influence of the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma [Puranic cult or religion] propounded by Shankaracharya was felt only 1300 years ago. This Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma of Shankaracharya&#146;s should not be called Hindu Dharma [Hindu religion, Hinduism]. Shankaracharya&#146;s religion mainly aimed at driving out the Baoddha Dharma [Buddhism] widely practised at that time. What was the essence of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma? It was mainly just obedience to cows, Brahmans, Vedas and kings. And obedience to a king did not mean just any kind of obedience. It meant regarding the king as an incarnation of Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u. Thus the narrow Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma prevailed in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, displacing the liberal Shaeva Dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Prior to Shankaracharya, there were caste divisions in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, but caste discrimination [i.e., the practical sense that one caste was superior to another] was unknown there. The caste divisions came through the Aryans from the north-west. And the caste discrimination system came only 1300 years ago, after Shankaracharya preached his Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma. Intimidated by the followers of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma, the Buddhists of that age were unable to worship Buddha directly, and took to the worship of Dharmat&#x301;ha&#x301;kur [the converted form of Buddha in the name of Shiva]. The Buddhists set up Dharmat&#x301;ha&#x301;kur in remodelled temples in the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Age, and such can be found spread all over Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h even today. The priestly functions in these temples of Birbhum and Gopabhum were performed by members of the Sadgope community who use Devangshi as their surname.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Having come under the influence of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma, the priests of these temples sometimes used sacred threads made of copper. The priests in these temples of Dharmara&#x301;ja<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  in the Bankura area belonged to the Jalik Kaivarta community or the Dom community.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  The mantras they used, and still use, to worship the gods and goddesses, were in the Bengali language. All these priests used Pandit as their surname. The Doms still use Pandit as their surname. Ramai Pandit, for example, composed the Shunya&#x301;pura&#x301;n&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The Kurmi Mahatos of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h also performed priestly functions in many such temples. They were deprived first of their religious rights, then of their social rights, and now of their human rights. Yet they are one of the six indigenous communities which constitute the Bengalee race. They are original people of the Bengalee races and as such certainly deserve respect. They are not outsiders, they are the children of the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Thus those who were once venerated are now no longer so. This disrespect for them should be considered as disrespect for Bengalees as a whole. This state of affairs calls for immediate rectification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Thus we see that before becoming tightly fettered with the caste system, the indigenous communities of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had the full right to priesthood. The monopoly of the Brahmans on priestly rights became established only during the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Age, not before that.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the Shaeva [Shaivite] marriage custom is still popular among the people of the so-called low castes. The bride and the bridegroom exchange garlands, the bridegroom offers some unhusked rice (paddy) to the bride. The rice-offering indicates, &ldquo;I take responsibility of maintaining this girl throughout life.&rdquo; He then applies some vermilion on her forehead and says, A&#x301;jiivanam&#x301; bha&#x301;tka&#x301;pad&#x301;am&#x301; sva&#x301;ha&#x301; [&ldquo;As long as you live I will provide you clothes and food&rdquo;]. Thus in a simple, unostentatious way the marriage is solemnized within a few minutes. There is no need to call in a Brahman priest. This is an example of the liberal Shaevism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->There is no proof as to whether Shiva upheld idol worship. But it was after His passing away that a special kind of worship known as phallus worship came into being. In this phallus worship there was a nice combination of spirituality and earthly need. At that time the different groups remained locked in continual fighting with one another. All the groups wanted to increase their own populations. So they first introduced phallus worship to symbolize the increase of their numerical strength. Later this phallus worship became subtilized by infusing it with spiritual ideations. As the thoughts and ideas of the people of that age were very simple and at the same time somewhat crude, they started to practise the phallus worship with the idea of the relationship between Purus&#x301;a [Consciousness] and Prakrti [Operative Principle] (Shivashaktya&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->). This very phallus worship [the earlier kind] was the most ancient system of worship in the world. Sociologists identify it as humanity&#146;s first step on the path of dharma [religious belief, spirituality]. This type of phallus worship was prevalent in the Mayan civilization of Mexico in Central America. Numerous Shiva lingas of this kind are scattered in many places in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Many of the Shiva temples that are found virtually everywhere in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; in almost each and every village &ndash; date back to 2500 to 7000 years ago.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Even innumerable rural folk-rhymes prevalent in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are paeans to Shiva. A liberal Shaeva [Shaivite] ideology permeated every existential vibration, every cell of the bone and marrow of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. For this reason the women of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h always enjoyed more liberty than those of other countries. They had absolute freedom to move anywhere &ndash; in the markets and fairs, in the villages and towns. They still enjoy the same amount of liberty today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the past, men and women shared equally in the hard work of the fields and farms. They continue to do so today. Even on the battlefield women stood beside their men and actively fought in wars. There were no artificial social restrictions. Even Bagri [Samatat] and Barendrabhumi<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  did not allow women as much freedom as Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, what to speak of Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k. Moreover, there were numerous restrictions based on caste.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Shankaracharya came to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h only [not the rest of Bengal]. Hence many Buddhists and Jains of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h embraced Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma. D&#x301;aba&#x301;k being marshy land, neither Shankaracharya nor any of his disciples with leadership qualities visited there much. So the inhabitants of that land remained Buddhists and later embraced Islam on a large scale. It can be said that Muslims are scarce in modern-day Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, except for some in eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Hindus and Muslims are almost equally numerous in Bagri. But in D&#x301;aba&#x301;k Muslims are in great number. The reason is this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The history of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is not the history of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h alone, it is the history of Bagri, D&#x301;aba&#x301;k, Barendra and Orissa also. Wherever the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h have settled down, they have mingled and become one with the local people. So it can be observed that there exists a close link between the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and the people of Orissa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->It has been said before that severe caste discrimination arose in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h due to the influence of the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma propounded by Shankaracharya &ndash; an evil which created fatal rents in the otherwise well-knit social fabric of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. A man who showed outstanding wisdom while rescuing Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h from the sway of that horribly destructive system was Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (Vishwambhar Mishra). He formed a new group, the Vaishnavite group, with those people who were not socially recognized by the high-caste Hindus. The people of this Vaishnavite group are still spread in many places throughout Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Mahaprabhu&#146;s historic contribution still permeates every atom of the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. So no one can lose caste so easily today.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->While dharma in the true sense of the term is based on logic and the realizations of great sa&#x301;dhakas [spiritual aspirants], religion, or dharmamata, is based entirely on irrational blind faith. So religions are always sheltered within dogma. While the propagation of dharma goes on spontaneously, for the propagation and establishment of dogma-based religions, the financial power of the vaeshyas [capitalists] and the intellectual prowess of the vipras [intellectuals] is inevitably needed. What we observe from the history of humankind is that the religions which have come so far have, without exception, taken shelter under the wings of capitalism. While money has been spent lavishly for the construction of beautiful places of worship, money has never been arranged for food, clothing, housing, education and medical care for the welfare of the poor. While for four full years all the state revenues of Orissa were spent for the construction of the Konark temple, during that period not a penny was spent for human welfare. Needless to say, the history of all countries is replete with such examples.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the background of the Jainism that was introduced into the heart of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h 2500 years ago there was the same strong influence of the vaeshyas. The exponent and propounder of this religion, Vardhaman Mahavir, was himself born in a rich vaeshya family of Vaishali. His father&#146;s name was Siddhartha and his mother&#146;s Trishala. Almost at the same time, in the Terai region of Nepal (or, according to some, the Terai region of Uttar Pradesh), Siddhartha (who later became famous as the propounder of Buddhism) was born in the Ks&#x301;atriya [warrior] Malla sub-tribe of the Shakya tribe. His father&#146;s name was Shuddhadhan and his mother&#146;s name Maya Devi. It is to be noted here that Mahavir Jain, the propounder of Jainism, belonged to a vaeshya family, whereas Buddhadeva, the propounder of Buddhism, was a ks&#x301;atriya by birth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Just as the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had at one time settled in Samatat-Barenda-Vaun&#x32D;gabhumi in the east, so they later migrated on a large scale to Magadh-Mithila and such regions in the west. At one time, just as in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the people of Magadh were followers of Shaeva Dharma. The people of both lands were accustomed to living a simple, unsophisticated life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Both Vardhaman Mahavir and Buddha first started preaching their religions in Magadh. Buddha preached compassion, penance and karma sannya&#x301;sa [setting Supreme Consciousness, and not the world, as one&#146;s goal of life]. The people of Magadh listened to him with reverence, and a few accepted his ideology. Then he set out for Varanasi to preach his religion there. Later he passed away in Kushinagar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[But for the most part] the people of Magadh did not accept the religion preached by Mahavir Jain. Out of many reasons that the people of Magadh did not wholeheartedly accept the Jain religion, the three main ones were: 1) Jainism&#146;s aversion to struggle. The interpretation of ahim&#x301;sa&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  given by Mahavir in his religion was so unnatural and unrealistic that it was completely impossible for the common people of Magadh to accept it. For example, according to Jainism, it is forbidden to kill any living being. Since tilling the land may bring about the death of the insects in the soil, agriculture became impossible for the followers of Jainism. So that during respiration microbes should not enter the body through the nostrils and die, the nose must be covered with a piece of cloth. 2) Nirgranthava&#x301;da [no use of clothing on the body]. In the final stage of religious practice, nirgranthava&#x301;da (digambara) should be followed (one should remain naked). For people living in society, this nirgranthava&#x301;da cult failed to evoke any response. 3) Between Shaeva Dharma and Jainism there was a yawning gap. For the followers of Shaeva Dharma in Magadh, this atheistic Jainism appeared like a very far-off object.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Having found it futile to preach his religion in Magadh, Mahavir went to Astiknagar, the most ancient town in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. It goes without saying that there also the common people could not easily accept his ideology of inaction. A handful of the rich merchant community, however, did pay recognition to Vardhaman Mahavir, not so much for any uniqueness of his religion, but rather to him as a representative of the vaeshyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In spite of the vaeshya community of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h having accepted Jainism, the common people there remained Shaevas in their minds and hearts. Of course, externally they called themselves Jains. Even though they offered worship in the Jain temples, Shaivism flowed deep in their hearts like the subterranean Phalgu River [of mythology]. All the Jain temples and idols that are found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were lavishly constructed by the Jain vaeshyas. They were not constructed by the ks&#x301;atriya kings [or the common people]. Shiva temples, on the other hand, could be built at little expense by the common people. In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h Jain temples are found every ten miles, but a Shiva temple can be found in every village. This proves the deep commitment to Shaivism among the common people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->As a result of Shaivism and Jainism coexisting in this way in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h for a long time, they influenced each other in quite a natural way. So the Shiva of Shaeva Dharma became transformed into the Jain Shiva. Moreover, it was under the influence of Shaivism that Jain Tantra came into existence. The Ambika&#x301; Devii of the Ambika&#x301; Devii temple in the city of Kalna, Burdwan District, is a Jain Tantric goddess; she came into being under the Shaeva influence. Shaeva Tantra, Jain Tantra and Buddhist Tantra had a combined influence on the land of Anandanagar in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, though the influence of the latter is little.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Vardhaman Mahavir propagated Digambara Jainism [Jainism that enjoined nakedness] in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, so all the idols of the Tiirthaun&#x32D;karas<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  that are found here are without clothes. The idols of the gods and goddesses are clothed and ornamented. However, the idols of those gods who enjoyed status equal to that of the Tiirthaun&#x32D;karas are naked.<!-- /block --></p>

The very name Pa&#x301;ncra&#x301; indicates that there is, or was, a Jain Pain&#x32D;caratna temple in the nearby area.

<a name="9..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Now the question is, what is the underlying spirit or essence of dharma? The underlying spirit or essence of dharma is that it carries a person in the direction of greater and greater expansion, and finally establishes that person in the supreme pervasiveness.

<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The essence of Shaeva Dharma [Shaivism] is all-round expansion &ndash; that is, it takes an individual from the loka&#x301;yata [objective] to the lokottara [noumenal] life. Shaivism is that which takes the individual to the supreme fulfilment along a sweet and more and more resplendent path. Shaeva Tantra [Shiva Tantra] is not a cult based on the sayings of the munis and rs&#x301;is, rather it is concerned with the hopes and aspirations of the masses. It is something which deals with the subtler mystic aspect of human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Here let us try to understand the subtle difference between the objective and the noumenal worlds. Suppose there is a bird &ndash; take the case of a bird confined in a cage. The bird in a cage eating little morsels of food can be likened to loka&#x301;yata [objective] sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and the restless, intense psychic urge to soar freely into the vast distant blue sky can be compared with lokottara [noumenal] sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Shaeva Dharma in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is Tantra-oriented; and as I have said, Tantra means all-round expansion. As the inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h accepted this Tantra from the core of their hearts, even in the distant prehistoric past, they made multidimensional progress: progress in art and literature, progress in dance and music, progress in architecture and sculpture. The inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h made unimaginable progress in all spheres of human life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->There should be a harmonious adjustment between movement in the psychic sphere and movement in the external sphere.

<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The women throughout Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h enjoyed great independence. Women were highly respected in society.

<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Later, the nirva&#x301;n&#x301;atattva and arhattattva [doctrine of renunciation] of Buddhism and Jainism entered the heart of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. This tattva [theory] was based completely on a negative outlook towards the mundane world and towards life. What became the guiding principle of life was a karma sannya&#x301;sa and sthiti sannya&#x301;sa<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.9.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#9.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  which was motivated by the attitude that the universe was full of suffering and affliction and was nothing but a realm of staticity created out of Avidya&#x301;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.9.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#9.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->); and which also cheated the physical world &ndash; that is, in a way, cheated oneself. Discarding rhythmic expansion in life, people began to feel that there was nothing in life except the gloom of staticity all around them. This is to extinguish that vigorous burning lamp which illuminates and at the same time glorifies the entire existence of humanity. Once the lamp is completely burnt out, its flame cannot be revitalized, even if a burning stick is brought to it a thousand times. This is an emphatic kind of negativism. This negative Jainism created fissures in the well-formed structure of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Both Buddhist and Jain philosophy can be summed up as a science that, as a result of inaction, as a result of karma sannya&#x301;sa, extinguishes the lamp of life.<!-- /block --></p>

Because Tantra, which is based on moks&#x301;a, is the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practice] of absolute expansion, the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of moving at lightning speed from the cimmerian darkness of staticity to the fullness of divine effulgence; while the pursuit of nirva&#x301;n&#x301;a is the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of knowingly extinguishing one&#146;s most precious treasure, one&#146;s lamp of life &ndash; it is nothing but to let the radiance of one&#146;s inner and outer world become dimmer and dimmer and to lose oneself in the deepest abyss of darkness &ndash; not only to lose oneself, but to deny one&#146;s existence under the impact of utter ignorance. The sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of extinction, the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of being lost in darkness, can never be the dharma or nature of human beings. So Jain and Buddhist philosophy brought incalculable harm to Shaivite Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. So the same Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h which had once, awakened by Shaivite philosophy, plunged into the ocean of vigorous activity, and, through tireless sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and struggle, etched a mark of unimaginable liveliness in all spheres of life, became engaged later on, under the evil influence of the negative sentiment of Buddhism and Jainism, in a useless attempt to establish a repulsive tortoise-like withdrawal as the spirit of the life of that age. This brought about a state of pause in the all-round development of the social life of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Though Jaena [&ldquo;Jain&rdquo;] is derived from the word jin and means &ldquo;to be victorious&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;to struggle and be victorious in all spheres&rdquo; &ndash; how is it possible to be victorious living like a tortoise? What is required for victory is a vigorous upward momentum. So Jainism leads people from light to darkness, throws them into a dark cavern of inactivity, and makes them total cynics. That is why Jainism has never spread outside India &ndash; it is not compatible with a natural philosophy of life. It is only in the western part of India, among a few merchants, that Jainism has survived. Today Jainism has been rooted out of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, where it had once originated.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->As was mentioned earlier, two diametrically opposite theories, nirgrantha Jainism (the Digambara Jain doctrine), based on the doctrine of nirva&#x301;n&#x301;a, and expansive Shaivism, remained side by side in the heart of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h for a long time. An age of synthesis came about in a natural way. During this period Jain Tantra spread among those of the Digambara Jains who were of sa&#x301;dhaka [ardent aspirants of the inner self] calibre, as the theoretical nirgranthava&#x301;da [va&#x301;da = &ldquo;ism&rdquo;] could no longer internally satisfy them. Indeed, Jain Tantra is just another name for Shaeva Tantra. The psychology based on this Jain Tantra gave rise to the Baul psychology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The Bengali word Ba&#x301;ul is derived from the Sanskrit word ba&#x301;tul. The Sanskrit letters ka, ta, pa and da are transformed into a in Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. Thus ba&#x301;tul became ba&#x301;ul. The person who directs all his or her psychic urges towards knowing the unknown and obtaining the unobtainable is deemed by the common people as ba&#x301;tul [mad] &ndash; ba&#x301;ul &ndash; as expressed here:<!-- /block --></p>

Pointing to the Bauls, people would say that they seem to be not really of this world; they seem to have come from a different world; they seem to be denizens of the noumenal world &ndash; they are a bit mad. The outlook and tunes of the Bauls have had a great impact on most of the folk songs of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The modern poet Rabindranath  was influenced to a great extent by the tunes and music arising out of the Baul mentality. In a well-known lyric by Rabindranath, there is a line:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..19"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Gra&#x301;m-cha&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; oi ra&#x301;una&#x301;ma&#x301;t&#x301;ir path<br>A&#x301;ma&#x301;r man bhula&#x301;y re.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->What is noticeable here is that it is not simply a &ldquo;path&rdquo;, but a &ldquo;path of red soil&rdquo;, that leaves the village heading into the distance and that casts a spell on the poet&#146;s mind. This clearly reflects the Baul mentality in Rabindranath. This is perhaps the reason that when the senior Baul singers of Birbhum hear Raviindra Sam&#x301;giita, they say, &ldquo;This is a song by Rabi[ndranath] Baul!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There are mainly two types of mentality at work behind an inclination towards spirituality: the selfish mentality, or a&#x301;tma&#x301;-sukha tattva [theory of selfish pleasure], and sama-sama&#x301;ja tattva [the theory of social equality]. When utter self-centredness manifests itself in people, when someone thinks only &ldquo;I shall eat and dress well, ride luxury cars and fulfil all my desires,&rdquo; that is the dualistic or selfish mentality, that is, to take shelter in a dogma and exploit others. Most of the religions of the world are based on this selfish mentality. This selfish mentality is at work behind people&#146;s worship of different non-scriptural gods and goddesses. People pray with folded hands to Laks&#x301;mii, the goddess of wealth, saying: &ldquo;Come, Mother Laks&#x301;mii, please be seated, Mother Laks&#x301;mii, stay in my house, Mother Laks&#x301;mii.&rdquo; In a hot, humid country, snakes pose a nuisance. So people introduced the worship of Manasa&#x301; Devii, the goddess of snakes, for the purpose of propitiating her. Smallpox also breaks out in hot countries. Hence people started worshipping Shiitala&#x301; Devii in order to ward off that disease. Thus people set about worshipping various gods and goddesses with their own self-interest in view. If we minutely scrutinize what we call majhab or dharmamata or religions, we shall clearly see that they all promise self-centred gain either in the near future or in the distant future. The extremely harmful signal that they send sometimes prompts people to forget their rationality and creates in them an inability to tolerate [other faiths]. Instead of love for mankind, imaginary selfish pleasure or heavenly pleasure becomes the be-all and end-all of life.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was born long after [the birth of] Jainism. Of all the factors that made Mahaprabhu &ldquo;Maha&#x301;prabhu&rdquo; [a great master], two are important: 1) His birthplace was the confluence of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Bagri. He was born during a transitional period in the social life not only of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, but also of Bengal. The philosophy of life [based partly on Jainism] which then prevailed in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h diminished human beings; it totally devalued humanity. Under the influence of an ideology of life that was opposed to the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a dharma [the pra&#x301;n&#x301;a dharma of a society means the distinctive characteristics of that society] of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the life of Bengal was drying up and turning into a desert. Endowed with a lofty mind and a deep sensitive heart, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was unable to bear this state of affairs. 2) Supra-sensory &ldquo;madness&rdquo; among the Bauls of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. In a bid to redress this unnatural situation [the devaluation of humanity] in social life, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu propounded Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma, which served to quite some extent as a balm for the stinking wounds of the then society.<!-- /block --></p>

Thanks to the pervasive influence of Shaeva Dharma in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, there was also some influence of sama-sama&#x301;ja tattva. And since the Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was based on Shaeva Dharma, sama-sama&#x301;ja tattva found a place in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h also.

Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h did not internalize, rather it rejected, Jainism insofar as the latter was not consistent with the fundamental rules of Shaeva Dharma. Though all the idols of the Tiirthaun&#x32D;karas found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are nude, in conformity with the Digambara Jain cult, none of the idols of Jain gods and goddesses found there are nude. The idols of the Jain goddesses Ambika&#x301; and Manasa&#x301; which have been found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are all clothed and adorned with ornaments. All the idols of the Jain gods and goddesses of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h that have been found and that were worshipped as orthodox or non-scriptural gods and goddesses [i.e., worshipped as different types of Hindu gods and goddesses] in a later period are nothing but different expressions of the human mind. And these feelings would become associated with each other, and would become sublimated into maha&#x301;bha&#x301;va [a higher stage of realization] and Paramashiva [Nucleus Consciousness]. It is not possible to find any consistency between these feelings and atheistic Jainism. Of all these Jain gods and goddesses, some have found a place in Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika [Puranic] scriptures, while others have been transformed into non-scriptural deities. Many, however, have not been recognized at all, directly or indirectly. Of many reasons for this, one was the torrential and irresistible advent in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of the Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma propounded by Mahaprabhu Chaitanya.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.11.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#11.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  At that point, the priests of that era did not find sufficient time to convert the [remaining] Jain deities into Puranic gods and goddesses.

Ducks, hens, pigs, buffaloes, etc., were offered as sacrifices. By that time, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had drifted a long way from Jainism, and most of the Jain temples in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had been transformed into Jain Shiva temples.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Ancient Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the mother of gems and jewels, was composed of mountain ranges surrounded by oceans. Those ranges at one time resonated with storms and tempests, rain and thunderbolts. There were no human beings, nor were there any other living beings. Even shrubs and creepers were not to be seen. Except for Parama Purus&#x301;a [Supreme Consciousness], there was no one to witness the exquisite beauty of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The mountains having become pulverized under the process of constant erosion, in between those mountains plains, valleys and plateaus began to come up. The rivers carried that silt and sand onwards. Those eroded mountains became the red soil that we see today. The eastern part of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, and Samatat were formed out of the silt and sand from the mountains, carried by the rivers. And many crores of years later, the rivers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were instrumental in forming even more of this new soil. That new soil is today&#146;s Samatat and Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k. Enticed by the smell of the rain-drenched dry earth (the earth had been created by the rivers), the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h wended their way to the east, towards that new soil, with axes, hoes and ploughs. Hence the soil [ma&#x301;t&#x301;i] is not merely ma&#x301;t&#x301;i for the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; it is ma&#x301;-t&#x301;i, ma&#x301;-go [&ldquo;the mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;O mother&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->At a time when eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was non-existent, Bagri [Samatat] and D&#x301;aba&#x301;k were inconceivable. The present-day mounds in the wavy soil of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are the decaying summits of the old mountains, and the bottoms of the slopes, and the small rivers and the rivulets, are other names for the last remaining parts of the valleys.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Much later the Aryans, moving from the north-west region towards the east and having crossed the plains of the Brahmaputra and the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;, finally reached the borders of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and came to a sudden halt. In the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of that time the crests of the undulating topography [the mounds] were covered with forests, while the troughs [the bottoms of the slopes] were sites of human habitation. It was for this kind of topography that the land was named Birbhumi or Birbhum in the Austric language. The word biir in Austric means &ldquo;forest&rdquo;. Instead of using the Austric name Birbhum, the Aryans gave it a new name, Varjyabhu&#x301;mi, which meant &ldquo;a land in which Aryans should not live&rdquo; &ndash; a land which the Aryans should reject. It is said that the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h at that time were not prepared to welcome the Aryans, and that instead of welcoming them, the inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h set their pet lions and wolves on them. So the question remains, why did the Aryans call the land Varjyabhu&#x301;mi &ndash; because of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s uncongenial geographical environment, or for fear of the wolves?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Whichever it may be, let us come to another topic. The searing summer heat of this tropical region, and the whirlwinds of red dust, spurred the inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h to break the bondages of this limited world and to run in the direction of limitlessness. And at the very sight of the natural landscape of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, tears welled up in their hearts, and their entire beings quivered, for the great unknown entity. This longing in their hearts made the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h mystical. What is mysticism? Mysticism is the never-ending endeavour to find out a link between finite and infinite. So the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are all mystical by birth. When they look up at the boundless sky, their inner self becomes eloquent in this way:<!-- /block --></p>

And this ba&#x301;tulata&#x301; gave birth to the Ba&#x301;ul Ma&#x301;rga [Path of Baul], Baul music and the Baul ideology. Baul music is always characterized by a single tune, a single resonated impact.

Kiirtana drew its impetus from Baul. The development of the rhythmic movement of the human mind in quest of the Supreme Entity is what is called kiirtana. Though kiirtana is prevalent in India and many other countries, the distinguishing feature of the kiirtana of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is that it is chiefly, if not entirely, based on Baul. It more concerns sweet devotional ideation on Parama Purus&#x301;a than descriptions of His hands, feet, eyes, nose and face.<!-- /block --></p>

The people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, who had heartily embraced Shaeva Dharma, started worshipping Shiva without crafting Shiva idols. They did, however, build Shiva temples. Though afterwards Jainism spread everywhere in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, Shiva remained unaffected. His influence did not decrease at all. It was Digambara Jainism that Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was under the influence of. All the idols of the Tiirthaun&#x32D;karas that have been found so far in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are naked.

<a name="14..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Long ago I said that the culture of the human race is one. But there are variations in the cultural expressions according to changes of time, place and person. These variations in expression are not cultural differences. If all the children in one family have different food habits and speak in different styles, then do they belong to different cultures? Nevertheless we speak much about culture, and we keenly observe cultural advancements and declines. The more introversial the movement of a culture is, the subtler it is.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It cannot be said just what the culture of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was like at the dawn of human history. But it is obvious that it could not have been developed, because the movement of the human intellect is from crude to subtle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->If there is anything that is sweet and anything that is worth following in the culture of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, it is due to the advent of Lord Sada&#x301;shiva. There is neither caste discrimination nor caste division in Shaeva Dharma, so where did the caste discrimination and caste division in today&#146;s Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h come from? Another question may arise here: why do I bring up caste discrimination and caste division while talking about culture? It is because culture cannot move in an appropriate way if caste division, which is the expression of a fissiparous mentality, exists. Hence everything comes within the purview of a discussion on culture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The Aryans entered India between seven and ten thousand years ago. This was well before the advent of Shiva. The conflict between the pre-Aryan civilization and that of the invading Aryans went on for centuries. Then in the course of time synthesis began to come. This state of synthesis went on for thousands of years and extended up to the Buddhist and Jain ages. The process of give-and-take between the pre-Aryan civilization and the invading Aryan civilization did take place, but not without much bargaining and many a tug-of-war. Of all the defective gifts of the Aryans that the indigenous Indians accepted, one was the system of caste division, which spread hatred between the high and the low.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The Aryan civilization came to a standstill at the threshold of the kingdom of Ka&#x301;shiira&#x301;jya (Varanasi). Then a lot of strenuous efforts were made in order for Mithila to be accepted in A&#x301;ryyavartta [Land of the Aryans], or Uttara&#x301;path [northern India]. But in the end Magadh did not win this acceptance. The word magadh means &ldquo;a population which is opposed to the Vedic system&rdquo;. Maga means &ldquo;opposed to the Vedas&rdquo; and dha means &ldquo;one who abides by&rdquo;. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, which was located on the further [eastern] border of Magadh, had no opportunity to become &ldquo;sanctified&rdquo; by the touch of the Aryans&#146; feet. But just as the system of caste division entered Magadh under the influence of A&#x301;ryavartta, so also did it enter Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h to some extent. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h too became segmented into so many castes, but thanks to the firmly-rooted Shaeva Dharma, caste-based hatred could not crystallize in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->That there was casteism in India even before the emergence of Buddhism and Jainism is best proven by the fact that Buddha came from a Ks&#x301;atriya varn&#x301;a [here, a sub-caste] belonging to the Malla branch of the Shakya pravara [dynasty]. (His father was a feudal king.) And Vardhaman Mahavir was born in a Vaeshya family of Bideha. His father, Siddhartha, was a businessman. So the caste system did exist in India. This caste system also reached a peak in Magadh in a later period. After the demise of Buddha, the kings &ndash; both Buddhists and non-Buddhists &ndash; said clearly that since Buddha was a Ks&#x301;atriya, they were entitled to the ashes from his cremation. But it was not like this in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The caste system was made to grow among the common people in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h [inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->There is no logic behind the contention that the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hiiya Utkal Brahmans came from outside. To say, based on imaginative stories, that the Brahmans of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were outsiders, would not be logical.

<a name="14..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->But it is true that caste discrimination came to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h much later. The Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma of Shankaracharya weighed Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h down and immobilized its social consciousness. It converted the spontaneous flow of life in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h into a stagnant pool and paved the way for countless weeds to burgeon. The defective mentality and way of life of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma became intolerable for people, hence a great number of people in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h-Samatat-Barendra-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k who came in contact with the more humanitarian Islam took shelter in it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The question remains as to the origin of the Utkal Brahmans in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. They live in large numbers in the south-west part of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Did lakhs of people, batch after batch, sail across the seven seas and thirteen rivers and settle down in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h? It is not possible. The fact is different. I have already mentioned that caste division was present in the Buddhist age. But it was not as strict as it had been in the pre-Buddhist age. Many elements were combined together in a confused way. So advocates of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma, and their Praya&#x301;giiya Bra&#x301;hman&#x301;a Sabha&#x301; [Prayag Brahman Conference], accepted and thereafter formally recognized a conglomerate of five branches of North Indian Brahmans, and another conglomerate of South Indian Brahmans, all of them followers of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma, in the names Pain&#x32D;ca Gaor&#x301;ii and Pain&#x32D;ca Dra&#x301;vid&#x301;ii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.15.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#15.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  respectively. As the Brahmans of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h represented a more developed culture, they found it hard to accept the dominance of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma (which teaches the supremacy of the Vedas, Brahmans, cows and kings). Besides that, there was an unwillingness to study the Vedas that was deep-rooted in their nature. For this reason they did not get the recognition of the Prayag conference. The Brahmans living in that part of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h which was under the rule of the king of Gaor&#x301;a at that time accepted that non-recognition. But as a mark of their own speciality, they introduced a beautiful social system, the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga system, and thus displayed an example of their own originality of thought. But the Brahmans living in those parts of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h which were not under the rule of the king of Gaor&#x301;a began to call themselves Utkal [Orissa] or post-Utkal Brahmans with a view to getting recognition from the Praya&#x301;giiya system. They went on with the old Mita&#x301;ks&#x301;ara&#x301; system. So none of them came from outside. Their lifestyle, customs and physical structures &ndash; all bear the stamp of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Does this mean that no Brahmans came from Utkal? No, a good many did come [later]. They were brought for their scholarly capacity. These invited Brahmans called themselves Da&#x301;ks&#x301;in&#x301;a&#x301;tya Vaedika (Southern, or Deccan, Vedics). They follow the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga system. Shibnath Shastri, M.N. Ray and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were all Deccan Vedic. (According to some, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was Western Vedic.) They live in the districts of Midnapore, Burdwan, Howrah, Hooghly, 24 Parganas, Jessore, etc. Some of them use common surnames such as Chakravorty and Bhattacharya, but some of course use the old Utkal Brahman surnames such as Panigrahi, Panda, Sarangi, Patra, etc.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Kayasthas of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are very few in number.

Rather, the Kayasthas in the whole of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and also in adjoining Bagri call themselves Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hiiya Kayasthas. In other words, they have completely identified themselves with the red soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Now, there is a tradition that Shashanka, the king of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, unified all the small Kayastha leaders in his battle against Buddhism. And let us judge whether it is believable that Vijaysingha conquered Lanka with the help of his Kayastha followers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the Buddhist age, the Kayasthas lived in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, and their domination also was immense.

The Buddhist and the Jain ages were really different expressions, according to changes of place and person, of the same age. So the Kayasthas were certainly there in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h during the Jain age. Since they were there in the Jain-Buddhist age, it can easily be supposed that they had been there even in the pre-Jain-Buddhist age. So according to their psychology and also from a historical standpoint, the Kayasthas are originally sons of the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Maybe a handful of Kayasthas who followed Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma came or were brought to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h from outside to assist the Brahmans in imposing Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h like a jagaddal stone [a kind of immovable stone]. But the idea that all the Kayasthas of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h have come from outside is absolutely untenable. Those who came from outside were probably honoured as kuliina Ka&#x301;yasthas [Kayasthas of noble descent]. The rest were denied that honour due to their relationship with Buddhism or Jainism. They are known everywhere as maolik [original] or ancient Bengalees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->A considerable number of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Kayasthas migrated from the Singur and Haripal regions of Hooghly District in the south of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and settled in Samatat across the Bhagirathi, and also in Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k further east. It is they who are the kuliinas [of noble descent] of those areas, and not those who had been living there previously. King Shashanka did unify the strength of the Kayasthas. Again, it just might be true that Vijaysingha, accompanied by his followers, conquered Singhal [Sri Lanka] and Kerala in c. 534 BCE. Though the Singhalese became Buddhists, Buddhism did not get firmly established in Kerala. The progeny of the followers of Vijaysingha still live in Kerala. They are known as the Kerala Kayasthas (Nairs). They use surnames such as Nair, Menon, Kaimal, Panikkar, etc. Their customs, lifestyle, facial appearance, everything, resemble those of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Kayasthas. Therefore it seems that Vijaysingha, in association with his Kayastha followers, may possibly have done something like this. But in conclusion I will mention that whatever I have said about Shashanka and Vijaysingha is more speculative than based on concrete information.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are a mixture mainly of two races, Austric and Negroid. In eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h there is also some Mongolian influence. Pure Austric and pure Negroid are not to be found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h; but Mongolian blood will not be found in the western part of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. So very fair-complexioned persons are very few in that region. The people there are dark-complexioned. But due to the Mongolian influence, the people of eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are a bit fair-complexioned. Though the inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are a mixture of Austric, Negro and Mongolian blood, they are not very flat-nosed. And they are taller than the Austrics. The Kurmis and the Mahatos of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are medium-sized or short, yet not shorter than the Austrics. The people of Midnapore are more or less short, but some are medium-sized, and a few are tall. The Sadgopes of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are medium-sized or tall. If anybody draws a straight line from Arambag of Hooghly District to the north across Burdwan and Kandi, the people living along that line, especially the Brahmans, the Kayasthas and the Sadgopes, are the tallest of all the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. They have comparatively high-bridged noses and are somewhat fair-complexioned. It was possibly due to the long-time political importance of this region, and its importance in trade and commerce, and the existence of Buddhist and Jain places of pilgrimage, monasteries, etc., that the Aryan outsiders&#146; blood entered in, and brought about these changes. But the people who live along that line are not the most long-lived. Those who have the longest lifespan in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are the Kayasthas of Bankura and Manbhum. They are also tall and have high noses, but they are not as fair-complexioned as those who live along the line of Arambag, Burdwan and Kandi.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->When the Puranic religion came to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h it did not come alone, it brought with it incalculable social ulcers and social ills.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->After the first Aryan migrations to India, caste divisions overtook Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h just as they did other parts of India. I have mentioned this before. Although caste divisions entered in, there was no caste discrimination; there was not even any social bar to inter-caste marriages. But when the kings of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h embraced the Puranic religion, they imposed an inflexible system of caste discrimination with the help of orthodox Brahmans and Kayasthas. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, which was not a restrictive caste-oriented society, could not accept this completely. As a result, there was a lot of social chaos. It became difficult for the people to categorize the many castes that arose from the social intermingling of Brahmans and non-Brahmans.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->When a particular wrong is decreed, one has to continuously support a chain of wrongs. Similarly, in promulgating one falsehood, a chain of falsehoods is created. So when this unnatural system of caste distinctions was adopted, other theories supporting this sort of discrimination needed to be invented. At this juncture,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  Raghunandan came and attempted to solve the problem. Being unable to trace the complicated lines of descent underlying the caste divisions, he gave his decision that Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h should not follow the four-caste system of India, rather it should recognize a two-tier system of Vipra and Shu&#x301;dra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The common people accepted this divisive social system out of fear of the kings who supported the Puranic religion (though mentally they did not accept it). The system of one-month purification [in mourning or as a penance], which had once applied only to Shu&#x301;dras, was imposed on 95% of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h [all non-Vipras had become classified as Shu&#x301;dras]. This two-caste system developed by Raghunandan did no good to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, rather it harmed the society enormously. It also brought down the curse of the kuliina [nobility] system on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The kuliina system was introduced among the Brahmans, Kayasthas and Vaidyas who blindly supported the Puranic religion. The intention was to keep those Brahmans, Kayasthas and Vaidyas recently converted from Jainism and Buddhism under the control of the orthodox Puranic Brahmans, Kayasthas and Vaidyas.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  It was proclaimed that a girl of a kuliina [noble] family must marry into another kuliina family, otherwise the kuliina status [of her family] would be lost. If, on the contrary, shrotriya Brahmans married their daughters to kuliina boys, their social status would increase. (In the Brahman social hierarchy the shrotriyas were non-kuliina, and in the Kayastha social hierarchy the maoliks were non-kuliina.) The result was that a kuliina Brahman or Kayastha could marry a hundred or more girls. Their numbers increased by leaps and bounds. The numbers of followers of the Puranic religion also increased by leaps and bounds, and the numbers of shrotriyas and maoliks considerably decreased. No one wished to marry their daughters into non-kuliina families. As another result, the influence of Buddhism and Jainism substantially waned. But quantitative growth does not necessarily lead to qualitative growth. Social vices overtook the society due to the rampant polygamy among the kuliinas and its opposite among the non-kuliinas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->During the Pathan rule,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  the prime minister of Bengal, Gopinath Basu, introduced a new system to save the Kayastha community from this vicious atmosphere. The eldest son of a Kayastha family must marry a kuliina girl [though the other sons were not required to do so]. But the Brahman community did not accept this system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Since as a result of the kuliina system, one section of society had a lot of marriages and the other few, society suffered a lot of degeneration and deterioration. Later on, Devibar Ghatak of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h introduced melbandhan (in Barendra it is known as pat&#x301;ibandhan) so that conversion to another religion or surrender to social vices might stop,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  and society might be saved from degeneration and distortion. Melbandhan meant the creation of groups made up of people having similar defects or virtues. This allowed them to remain within the [Hindu] society. In a community of people having similar qualities, no one could ostracize others. No doubt the Brahmans saved their skin through this system, but they could not maintain their honour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The social degeneration that resulted from the imposition of the Puranic religion in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h caused a simmering discontent in the minds of the people. The harmful effects of this became clearly visible after a few hundred years, particularly during the Pathan rule and during the days of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. These disgruntled people embraced either Islam or the Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaishnavism propagated by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the Buddhist-influenced parts of Bengal, the people converted to Islam in large numbers long before the birth of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Those who did not convert to Islam embraced Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaishnavism, especially in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h where the influence of Jainism was greater. Both internal and external differences between Jainism and Islam are great. For this reason the people of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h did not readily accept Islam. On the contrary, they accepted Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaishnavism in overwhelming numbers. For the differences in practical life between Jainism and Vaishnavism were minimal, whatever the philosophical differences may have been.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->We can find traces of the above-mentioned suppressed anger in the Shu&#x301;nya Pura&#x301;n&#x301;a by Ramai Pandit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The Puranic religion weighed heavily on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, like an immovable stone. It struck a heavy blow at the roots of sama-sama&#x301;ja tattva, the principle of social equality, the invaluable asset of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, and threw it deep into the darkest dungeon. One of the main factors responsible for the present backwardness of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, especially western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, is the Puranic religion that was forcibly imposed on it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is approximately thirty crore years old. It can be assumed that the first vibration of life in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h came at the same time as the first vibration of life on earth. The atmosphere of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h reverberated with the sounds made by animals at the same time that the atmosphere of the earth first reverberated with such cries. When western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was first created, there was no animated world there, but when the sand and silt carried by the rivers of the undulating western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h formed the plain lands of eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, different kinds of flora and fauna appeared there. It is assumed that eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was formed before the appearance of human beings on earth. The fossils that we have found in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h lead us to assume that Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h pulsed with the vibration of the animated world at the very dawn of [animate] creation. The fossils bear witness that hard-bodied tiny animals moved on the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h after unicellular tiny animals, and ekadharmii multicellular tiny animals [multicellular tiny animals sharing one characteristic], had come into being. Thereafter came the age of large animals on the earth, and the fossils of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are proof of that age also. All of this concerns western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. It does not seem that an age of large animals ever occurred in eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. At least no proof is available for that. It is also assumed that if there were lofty mountain ranges in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of that time, between the mountains there were very deep gorges, some of which had a link with the seas. We should remember that the whole of northern India and Samatat-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k were deep in the seas, and that for this reason we have found fossils of sea animals in the mountainous areas of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the past a short-lived ice age engulfed the world. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was not excepted. It is assumed that the large animals and other living beings of the prehistoric age were frozen to death for want of heat. We have found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h the fossils of animals that had been frozen to death in this way. But after the ice age, in the post-ice age, when Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h basked in warmth again, various kinds of animals appeared in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; because Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h got its heat back within a very short time. We can find fossils of lions and lion-type animals, mammoths, monkeys, monkey-type men and ancient human beings of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of this time. They did not become crippled and die out due to cold, because no ice age followed their emergence in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. They probably died from earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Today&#146;s Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h does not fall [geologically] in the volcanic belt. But in those times the volcanic belt probably went along the western end of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, because between those days and today a polar shift has occurred. Instead of having decomposed naturally, these suddenly-expired animals and men were transformed into hard fossils. We have found samples of all these kinds of fossils.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I have said before and will say again now that Samatat, Vaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; and Barendrabhu&#x301;mi, which had come up from the sea, were not the habitats of lions, but of large tigers. And Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was the habitat of large and medium-sized maned lions. It cannot be said, however, that there were not a small number of tigers in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. (In western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, in common parlance, lions are called tigers.) Tigers like damp climates and dense jungles, while lions like dry weather and less-dense forests. So it is assumed that tigers came via the north-east corner from the direction of China; but lions came to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h from no direction; lions are children of the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. As ancient Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h abounded with lions, the word sim&#x301;ha [lion &ndash; &ldquo;Sinha&rdquo;] is associated with the names of many a person and many a village. Scattered all around in the east of Ranchi District, and all around the Bagmundi, Dalma, Meghasini, Tilabani, Jaychandi and Panchakot hills in the west of Purulia District, and around [the Shushunia Hills], there are heaps of different fossils, known, or unknown, or unrecognized &ndash; the fossils of all those lion, mammoth, rhino, monkey and human species.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The small-sized indigenous cows that are found in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, besides being small, do not give so much milk; but the milk is very nice-tasting and nice-smelling. These cows are the descendants of the ancient cow-type forest animals of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Once upon a time the forests in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h teemed with wolves. The traditional story goes that when the Aryans first tried to enter Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, from their side, set their pet lions and wolves on them. It forced the Aryans to declare Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h as Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avavarjita [forsaken by the Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avas] or ana&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta [not part of A&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta, the land of the Aryans]. As long as King Shashanka was alive, the Aryans were unable to exert a pervasive influence on Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Of the many reasons for this, one was Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s fearful forests. After the death of Shashanka, there was no one with governmental power to save Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. So the land-hungry Aryans entered Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h through different waterways and did everything to rob Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of its freedom, and later on destroyed the priceless asset of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, its forest cover. In the wake of the destruction of the forests came the destruction of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s wildlife and natural beauty. Today Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is no better than a neglected desert. This all happened about 1750 years ago. Since then Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, bereft of its own rhythm of life, has remained as a colony of A&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h has never been recognized as a part of A&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta, but it had to live a life of disgrace under the rule of A&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="20..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The surface of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h slopes from the west and the northwest towards the east and the southeast. The courses of the rivers are the same. All the rivers from the Bansh River in the north to the Suvarnarekha in the extreme south follow the same pattern. These east-flowing rivers formed eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Samatat, and the silt and sand of these rivers, together with the silt and sand of the Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; and the Brahmaputra, formed Barendrabhu&#x301;mi and D&#x301;aba&#x301;k. The Kansai and the Keleghai-Suvarnarekha formed the south and the south-east of Midnapore District and the southernmost part of Samatat. Where the Damodar Valley, the Kangsavati Valley and the Suvarnarekha Valley come in closest proximity in the western extremity of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, there are some hills (in ancient times mountains) which are the principal watersheds of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The cultural evaluation of these rivers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h will be dealt with later. Let me now speak of their power to create fertility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the rock formations of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h we find all varieties of rock. For example, 1) ancient hard (granitic) rock &ndash; this provides us with gold, silver, copper, mercury, mica, manganese, etc.; 2) igneous rock &ndash; this provides us quartz and other rocks of certain special kinds; 3) ancient sedimentary rock and mrta prastar [dead rock] &ndash; this provides us coal, and sand of high quality. Presumably in the past diamonds were available in small quantities, since in the regions rich in coal, many a village bears the name Hirapur [&ldquo;a place where diamonds are available&rdquo;]. The Damodar, the biggest river in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, flowed down the course of a kind of rock, and on either bank there was in ancient times a dense forest, thick with tall trees. Those forests underwent gradual changes for a long time and have now turned into coal. In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, coal is colloquially called a&#x301;m&#x301;ga&#x301;r (am&#x301;ga&#x301;r in Sanskrit). There is no dearth of villages bearing the name A&#x301;m&#x301;ga&#x301;rd&#x301;ihi in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There being profuse coal beneath the riverbed, the river is known as Da&#x301;modar (da&#x301;m + udar). In the Sanskrit language da&#x301;m means &ldquo;fire&rdquo;. The river which has da&#x301;m in its udar [belly], or fire, is the Da&#x301;modar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There is also some coal in the Ajay Valley. We should remember that the existence of this coal depends on the extent of a special kind of rock on the bank of the river. Another noteworthy thing is that the coal-fields are situated in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, as the river-valleys there have an accumulation of coal. Not even one coal-field is to be found in eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is old, so are its forests. So coal is to be found there. Eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h emerged from under the sea; so in eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h there were no forests to be transformed into coal. However, in all the regions of eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h which were the site of sargasso seas, mineral oil may be available. In ancient times, this abundance of minerals in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h helped very much in its economic and social development.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Let me come also to another matter. While the wealth of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is under the ground, the wealth of eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is above the ground. Land as fertile as that of Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah [Districts], and East Midnapore and Kandi Sub-divisions, is rare in the world. This is so because of the ancient and medieval sedimentary rock, rich in calcium and other minerals, in the upstream parts of the Damodar and other rivers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. And however much silt and sand carried by the rivers may fall on the surface of the land, in almost all cases there is sticky soil, able to hold water, a little below the surface.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The hills of today in the watershed regions of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, such as Dalma, Bagmundi, Tilabani, Panchakot, Shushunia and Jaychandi, were once lofty mountains. Their melting snow nourished the rivers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The foothills were covered with dense forests. Because of the high mountains and the forests, rainfall was plentiful in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The rivers were navigable. Because of the forested tablelands on either side of the rivers, soil erosion was little. Ships used to navigate these rivers &ndash; not only in ancient times, but also in the middle ages. Not long ago the farmers cultivating their land in the valleys of the Damodar and Mayurakshi could retrieve masts from under the earth. Due to river currents washing over different types of rocks, even today sand (silica) of various qualities is found underground in eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->It will be a mistake if one thinks that the resources of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h lie under the surface only. The surface soil of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is red (laterite) soil. In the Austric language, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, or Ra&#x301;r&#x301;ho, means a land of red soil; such a land is called la&#x301;ti in Chinese and rir&#x301;i in Greek. This red soil is not completely barren. With a little effort, in this soil of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h rich in calcium (rocky lime and powdered limestone), apples, pears, mandarin oranges, papayas, guavas, grapes, custard-apples, etc., of good quality can be produced in large quantities. Also efforts can be made to create orchards, and to cultivate three strains of paddy (a&#x301;ush [early paddy], a&#x301;man [autumn paddy] and boro [late paddy]) in a single year, by introducing different kinds of irrigation (small-scale river irrigation, pond-water irrigation and lift irrigation). It is needless to say much about eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h as it has all potential for good agriculture.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->As ancient Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is our main subject matter, before we begin to discuss the language of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, we should say something about the origin of language. Though the inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are a mixed race of Austric and Negro (and in a few cases Mongolian), there is an abundance of Sanskrit words in the language of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The language is replete with tatsama words [Sanskrit words used in unchanged form in the Bengali language], bhagnatatsama words [Sanskrit words used in changed form in Bengali language], tadbhava words [Bengali words derived from Sanskrit root but used in a corrupted form in the Bengali language] and semi-tadbhava words [Bengali words derived from Sanskrit root but corrupted to the point of their roots being unrecognizable]. About ninety-two percent of the words are directly or indirectly related to the Sanskrit language. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is situated in the extreme east of India. If Sanskrit were a foreign language and if it were thought to have come into India across its north-west border, then how could so many Sanskrit words have entered the colloquial language of the remote outpost Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h? It will not, therefore, be out of place to guess that Sanskrit had almost no relation with the influx of the Aryans, nor is Sanskrit of foreign origin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The language in which the Vedic scriptures were composed was not Sanskrit; hence it is called the Vedic language. There is a heaven-and-hell difference between Sanskrit and Vedic. What many people say, that the Pra&#x301;krta language is a metamorphosed form of this Vedic language, is true to some extent. Some parts of Pra&#x301;krta are purely a popular form of Sanskrit, and other parts are a popular form of a mixture of Sanskrit and Vedic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A language survives for approximately one thousand years on the average. Were Pra&#x301;krta [entirely] a metamorphosed form of the ancient Vedic language, by now it would have veered so greatly from that Vedic that the trail of its lineage would have been lost. Instead of regarding Sanskrit as the changed form of Vedic, we shall have to search for the origin of Pra&#x301;krta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The few foreign words found in ancient Bengali literature did not come to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h either leaping or limping on horseback across the soil of the A&#x301;ryya&#x301;varta. Those words came by river through foreign trade with Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. We received words such as ka&#x301;gaj [paper], vana&#x301;t [velvet], palte [wick], ada&#x301;lat [court of law], ka&#x301;cha&#x301;ri [office], and rajju [rope] in this way. I said earlier that the Mayurakshi, Ajay, Damodar, Dwarakeshwar, Rupnarayan, Kangsavati and Suvarnarekha rivers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were navigable even a few hundred years ago. Ships navigated them, foreign trade went on. The principal exports of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were sha&#x301;l wood, fine rice, silk, tasar [cloth of non-mulberry silk], scented articles, fine cloth (Vishnupuri muslin, dhu&#x301;pcha&#x301;ya&#x301; saris made in Burdwan), sugar, copper, etc. It could be assumed that along with this export trade, the import of a few items would go on in a natural way. So on river-bank sites in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and the regions of Bagri near Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h we find earthenware from Egypt and drinking vessels from China. No wonder if some foreign words came in as well! An ancient port of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h engaged (lipta) mainly in the export of copper (ta&#x301;mra) was called Ta&#x301;mralipta (now Tamluk). In the past, copper was abundantly available in Ta&#x301;ma&#x301;khun of Puncha [Block], in the Manbhum area of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h [Purulia District and adjoining areas]. Following the destruction of the ancient port of Ta&#x301;mralipta, another port was built in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; Saptagram in the district of Hooghly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->There are seven metamorphosed forms of Sanskrit, that is, seven Pra&#x301;krta languages. (Pra&#x301;krta means &ldquo;related to the populace&rdquo;.) They are 1) Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta of eastern India, 2) Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta of mid-northern India, 3) Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta of north-western India, 4) Pa&#x301;shcatya [Western] Pra&#x301;krta of extreme northwestern India, 5) Saendhavii Pra&#x301;krta of the Sindhu Delta, 6) Ma&#x301;lavii Pra&#x301;krta of mid-western India and (7) Maha&#x301;ra&#x301;s&#x301;t&#x301;rii Pra&#x301;krta of south-western India.<!-- /block --></p>

Pu&#x301;rvii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii in turn has six daughters, and Pashcimii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii four daughters. The six daughters of Pu&#x301;rvii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii are i) Maethilii, ii) Angika, iii) Ba&#x301;m&#x301;la&#x301; [Bengali], iv) Assamese, v) Oriya and vi) Koshali. The four daughters of Pashcimii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii are i) Magahi, ii) Bhojpuri, iii) Nagpuri (Sadani) and (iv) Chattrishgarhi. Of them, though Nagpuri has come from Pashcimii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii, Ba&#x301;m&#x301;la&#x301; and Koshali have had a tremendous influence on it.

<a name="21..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Chattrishgarhi is such a remote language of Ma&#x301;gadhii that the languages of Shaorasenii Pra&#x301;krta did not have any influence on it. Chattrishgarhi does not show change in gender of a verb in consonance with change in gender of the subject in nominative case, which is one of the many characteristics of the Shaorasenii language. But though Maethilii has come from Ma&#x301;gadhii, it does show, in some cases, change in gender of a verb in consonance with change in gender in nominative case (only in the present perfect tense, such as Ra&#x301;m gela&#x301;h [&ldquo;Ram has gone&rdquo;], Siita&#x301; geliih [&ldquo;Sita has gone&rdquo;]). Such changes are more frequent in Bhojpuri. For example, Ra&#x301;m karata&#x301;, Siita&#x301; karatiiya&#x301;).

The dialects of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h as well as the [other dialects of the] Bengali language have a host of specialities in pronunciation. These specialities more or less follow the Yajurvedic system. Unlike &ldquo;a&rdquo; in the English alphabet, which has twenty-one different pronunciations, a [the first letter of all Indo-Aryan alphabets] is pronounced mainly in three ways in India: 1) sam&#x301;vrta [[closed]], 2) vivrta [[open]] and 3) tiryak [[distorted]]. When a is pronounced according to the sam&#x301;vrta system, it sounds like &ldquo;au&rdquo; in the English word &ldquo;authentic&rdquo;. When a is pronounced according to the vivrta system, it sounds somewhat like &ldquo;u&rdquo; in the English word &ldquo;but&rdquo;. And when a is pronounced according to the tiryak system, it sounds somewhat like &ldquo;o&rdquo; in the English word &ldquo;origin&rdquo;. In the Bengali language the sam&#x301;vrta and tiryak pronunciations of a are in use, while the vivrta is not in use.<!-- /block --></p>

In fact, except for the Sher Shahvadiya dialect, in no dialect do we find full pronunciation of maha&#x301;pra&#x301;n&#x301; [letters]. In Chattal and some other dialects, the pronunciation of maha&#x301;pra&#x301;n&#x301; is almost negligible. In the pronunciation of words of the Kolkata dialect, the maha&#x301;pra&#x301;n&#x301; pronunciation is given fully only at the beginning of the words: for example, chele [&ldquo;boy&rdquo;], d&#x301;ha&#x301;ka&#x301; [covered], jha&#x301;la&#x301;no [soldering], tha&#x301;la&#x301; [plate] dha&#x301;ma&#x301; [a basket made of rattan], etc. If such letters are in or at the end of words, they are converted into the respective hiinapra&#x301;n&#x301;: for example, ma&#x301;ch (ma&#x301;c) [fish], ma&#x301;jh (ma&#x301;j) [middle], katha&#x301; (kata&#x301;) [word], sa&#x301;dh (sa&#x301;d) [desire], etc.<!-- /block --></p>

There are, however, some exceptions, such as Shiva (Shiv), Ra&#x301;ma (Ra&#x301;m), ru&#x301;pa (ru&#x301;p), etc. The rules which govern such pronunciations are roughly as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->1) The consonants are fully pronounced if they are at the beginning of, or in the middle of, words, but if they are at the end of words, they are pronounced with consonantal mark; for example, ru&#x301;pa becomes ru&#x301;p, but ru&#x301;pava&#x301;n&#x301;ii will not be pronounced as ru&#x301;pva&#x301;n&#x301;ii, as pa is no longer at the end of the word, it has now come inside the word. So its pronunciation will be ru&#x301;p-a-va&#x301;n&#x301;ii. Shiva will be Shiv, but Shivara&#x301;m will be Shiv-a-ra&#x301;m, Shivaprasa&#x301;d will be Shiva-a-prasa&#x301;d.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="21..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->3) Even if the letter is not a conjunct, its pronunciation will be full, should there be a suffix like kta in krdanta or ta in taddhitartha;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.21.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#21.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  for example, sammata [&ldquo;agreed&rdquo;] (not sammat), grhiita [&ldquo;accepted&rdquo;] (not grhiit), sthagita [&ldquo;postponed&rdquo;] (not sthagit), a&#x301;locita [&ldquo;discussed&rdquo;] (not a&#x301;locit), diirgha&#x301;yata [&ldquo;prolonged&rdquo;] (not diirgha&#x301;yat), etc. It is a pity that very often incorrect pronunciations such as sthagit, a&#x301;pya&#x301;yit, etc., are heard on radio and television.

<a name="21..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->4) Even in the absence of suffixes such as kta and ta, non-[conjuncts] will be fully pronounced if the letter concerned is preceded by anusva&#x301;ra (<span class=Bengali>&#x0982;</span> [am&#x301;]), visarga (<span class=Bengali>&#x0983;</span> [ah]), the sign for <span class=Bengali>&#x0990;</span> [ae] or the sign for <span class=Bengali>&#x0994;</span> [ao], for example, Kam&#x301;sa (not Kam&#x301;s), vam&#x301;sha [&ldquo;lineage, pedigree&rdquo;] (not vam&#x301;sh), sim&#x301;ha [&ldquo;lion&rdquo;] (not sim&#x301;), duhkha [&ldquo;woe&rdquo;] (not dukh), nihsva [&ldquo;penniless&rdquo;] (not nis), Jaena [&ldquo;Jain&rdquo;] (not Jaen), gaon&#x301;a [&ldquo;inconsequential&rdquo;] (not gaon&#x301;), saodha [&ldquo;mansion&rdquo;] (not saodh), etc. Moreover, where as a consequence of metamorphosis vowels are used in place of consonants in Sanskrit, it is desirable to use i and u (respectively) instead of ae and ao even if there is no difference so far as pronunciation is concerned. (I have not mentioned <span class=Bengali>&#x0988;</span> [ii] and <span class=Bengali>&#x098A;</span> [u&#x301;], as they are not pronounced in Bengali.) Dadhi &rarr; dahi &rarr; dai (dai, not dae [though the pronunciation would be the same &ndash; dai indicates that a vowel has replaced a consonant]), badhu&#x301; &rarr; bahu &rarr; bau (bau, not bao), madhu &rarr; mahu &rarr; mau (mau, not mao).<!-- /block --></p>

This Shriihars&#x301;a script was the script of the whole of eastern India (Allahabad and the regions to the east). Manipuri (Mithei and Vis&#x301;en&#x301;purii), Assamese, Bengali, Maethilii and the like are written in this script, though with local variations, of course. Languages such as Angika, Magahi, Bhojpuri, Nagpuri and Chattrishgarhi also use this script. But those people&#146;s mother tongues having been suppressed for a long time, their mother script is unfamiliar to them. The script of Oriya also is this Shriihars&#x301;a script. The characters in the Shriihars&#x301;a script are basically angular. In Orissa it was the custom to write on palmyra leaves with an iron kitchen implement, but writing the angular characters in this way with that iron implement, the palmyra leaves were likely to be damaged. Thus the practice was introduced of avoiding angles and writing in a circular way. Hence the present Oriya script is nothing but the Shriihars&#x301;a script, avoiding angles.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As Shriihars&#x301;a is one of the ancient scripts of India, Sanskrit has been written in this script since ancient times, and most ancient books in Sanskrit were written in this script. The Devanagari script came much later. The deed of gift written in the Sanskrit language by King Chandravarma of Shushunia Hill, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, was written in Shriihars&#x301;a script, and that Shushuniya&#x301; script is the most ancient example of Bengali script.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  From this perspective, Shushunia Hill may be regarded by scholars and litterateurs as a sort of tiirtha [sacred place]. Such inscriptions carved in stone in ancient Bengali script are available in Jaida of Singhbhum District and Chiyada of Bankura District. If searches are carried out, such will be found in many more places. Some think that Devanagari is the script of Sanskrit, but this idea is totally wrong. Sanskrit has no script of its own. The Shriihars&#x301;a script is much older than Devanagari, and it facilitates swift writing (as one can write for a long time without raising one&#146;s hand).<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="22.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.22.fn1">1</a></b>)   The Shushuniya&#x301; script is 1100 years old. In 1984, a few years after writing the above, the author himself discovered some older scripts at Bhula-Pavanpur village under Patamda Police Station, Bangurda&#x301; village under Kamalpur Police Station, and at Jaida village under Chandil Police Station, all within East Singhbhum and Seraikela Districts. The author opined that these scripts must date back 1700 years or more, clearly indicating that they are older than the Shushunia script. The author named this script Da&#x301;lma&#x301; script, because the river basins where they were available (as mentioned above) are surrounded by the Da&#x301;lma&#x301; Hills in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.

<a name="23..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It cannot be said emphatically that there can be no literature in the absence of civilization. But the diamond splendour of literature bursts out in all its radiance and captures people&#146;s attention only when it is associated with civilization. No doubt the radiant literature of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h came only after civilization had dawned. When on that long-ago morning in the remote past the golden light of civilization fell on the bosom of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and diffused in all directions, the simple, open faces of the young men of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h in that bright dawn broke out in smiles; the flower-bedecked hair buns of the young women of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h tossed to the rhythm of a dance; and the rhythm of that dance spread amid the intoxicating fragrance of the mahul-tree groves; and the radiant literature of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was born.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The ancient folk tales and folk songs of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are now extinct, as that language is now extinct. But perhaps that oldest of compositions, the Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy of Kapil (from Jhalda) can be included within the classical literature. Presumably the language of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h at that time was the earliest form of Ma&#x301;gadhii Pra&#x301;krta. Rather than writing in that language, Kapil wrote in the classical language of that time, Sanskrit. And much later, Maharshi Patanjali (of Patun village of Burdwan) also wrote his Yoga Su&#x301;tram, or Seshvarsa&#x301;m&#x301;khya, in the classical language, Sanskrit, and not in the then-prevalent Pu&#x301;rvii Ardha-Ma&#x301;gadhii. In a still later age (the Sen dynasty), Jaydev, a poet of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, composed his Giitagovindam in Sanskrit, and not in the spoken language of that time (an ancient form of modern Bengali). But as one age gave way to the next, the spoken language gradually came to attain the status of a classical language. For this reason, Jaydev&#146;s Sanskrit is not classical Sanskrit in the true sense of the term, but rather Bengali with the Sanskrit anusva&#x301;ra and visarga endings [am&#x301; and ah].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is to be noted that what both Kapil and Patanjali composed was philosophical literature. The joys and sorrows and hopes and desires of the common people have not been reflected in their works. Jaydev&#146;s Giitagovindam is a devotional scripture. It is not a mirror of the common people either. Thus it is not difficult to understand that the literature of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h which was concerned with the life of the common people was handed down verbally, and did not attain the status of book form. Of the ancient books that first began to sparkle like rubies and emeralds with the joy and sorrow and tears and smile of the populace, Shriikrs&#x301;n&#x301;akiirtana, by Barhu Chandidas (of Chatna of Bankura) deserves special mention.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.23.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#23.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->People&#146;s tastes go on changing in accordance with changes in time, place and person. There is no good reason to think that people&#146;s judgement will become subtler and more introversial simply with the onward march of time. Just as we find instances of subtler feelings in ancient literature, so we find a profusion of crude taste and extroversial mentality in ultra-modern literature. In the Shriikrs&#x301;n&#x301;akiirtana we find an assortment of the various tastes of that age. So some parts of this book can be considered classical literature, some parts can be considered folk songs, and some parts, if tested on the touchstone of literature, are merely fool&#146;s gold. In the compositions of Dwija Chandidas (from Nanur village of Birbhum), characteristic human psychology, with its sometimes inward, sometimes outward, perspective, has been given more importance than the joys and sorrows of the common people.<!-- /block --></p>

Kavikankan Mukundaram (from Damunya of Burdwan) sketched a picture of the life of the distressed Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h of his time in his Phullara&#x301;r Va&#x301;ramasya&#x301; [&ldquo;Twelve Months in the Life of Phullara&#x301;&rdquo;]. In order to show how the deities of the Maun&#x32D;galka&#x301;vya wreaked havoc on those at whom they became angry, the poets have depicted in words the life of that distressed Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="24..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the post-Buddhist era, under the rule of the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika cult, no poet dared to express the kinds of tortures that were meted out to followers of Buddhism and Jainism.

In Shu&#x301;nyapura&#x301;n&#x301;a, by Ramai Pandit, in Nirain&#x32D;janer Rus&#x301;ma&#x301;, and in Dharmamaun&#x32D;gal by Ghanaram Chakravorty (Burdwan), etc., a clear picture has been presented of all this.<!-- /block --></p>

I am not speaking of Baul here since it is more verbal than written; whereas Vaishnavite literature, through writing, portrayal and oral expression has made itself exquisitely charming. The main theme of Vaishnavite literature is to define the relationship between the limited and the limitless. So wherever Vaishnavite literature has delved a little bit into one&#146;s inner feeling, it has become delicately sweet, unparalleled in its soothing beauty. Since long before the advent of Mahaprabhu Chaitanyadev, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava literature had been surging across Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Jaydev, Barhu Chandidas, Dwija Chandidas, Dina Chandidas, Lochandas Thakur, Brindavandas Thakur, Naraharidas Thakur, Govindadas Thakur, Gyanadas Thakur &ndash; all were sons of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, representatives of the aesthetic flow of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The deepest melody of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h reverberates on the ekta&#x301;ra&#x301; [single-stringed instrument] of Baul. It was in this way that Vaishnavite pada&#x301;valii [verses] and maha&#x301;janiiya kiirtanas originated. (Those who are great sa&#x301;dhakas and composers of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava literature are called maha&#x301;janas [great souls].) This kind of Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava mystic literature is unparalleled in this world. This literature has added heretofore-unseen verdure to the almost treeless Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Much later, Rabindranath too, sitting on the soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, created unique cadence on the ekta&#x301;ra&#x301; of Baul. Now the question is, from where did Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h get this unprecedented literary wealth and incomparable treasury of art?<!-- /block --></p>

[The waves that cause] all feelings and sensations, crude, subtle or causal, start from some source and proceed towards the infinite. From the very moment a feeling or sensation originates, it begins to stir the human mind and to make the soul surge with bliss. The farther it [the wave] travels from the source, the less power it has to stir and to saturate with bliss. Lord Sada&#x301;shiva, the central figure of universal humanity, appeared around 7500 years ago. It is not that He sat in just one particular place and created ideational waves; riding on his yak, He travelled all over the world and propagated the keynote of humanism. Though the keynote of this humanism has Parama Purus&#x301;a as its goal, this movement towards Parama Purus&#x301;a is multi-staged, is prolonged in manifold directions, and experiences myriad flows of sweetness, before it reaches its single goal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The world is rhythmic. The subtler reverberations in human brains which manifest themselves in the realm of language are the first mundane expressions of the subtle world. Hence the sound <I>tanma&#x301;tra<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I> is the subtlest of <I>tanma&#x301;tras</I>. Whether or not an individual is educated, he or she can give ecstatic expression to his or her deep feelings only through language. One may say that the subtlest stratum of art is the lines of drawing, and not words or language spoken or written. This is true, but are not &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; and &ldquo;writing&rdquo; here just two different names for language? &ldquo;Aban Tagore writes pictures.&rdquo; What is the meaning here of the word &ldquo;writes&rdquo;? It means that he actually writes language [through painting]. Human beings cannot express in the form of spoken language even one per- cent of what they feel deep inside; they cannot express in writing everything that they can express in spoken language; and they cannot express through drawings everything that they can express in writing. This is why I said elsewhere that the art of painting is a subtler art - because here even higher expressions remain confined within a few lines of drawing. It is like a violin, which has no frets, amid musical instruments studded with frets.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  But the fact of the matter is that the expression is purely acoustic. The resonance of wisdom that lies within these acoustic expressions easily captivates the human mind and seizes human attention, carrying it to the realm of ideas. This evidently happened in the past due to the inspiration created by the Shaeva ideal of Lord Sada&#x301;shiva, and thus it was possible to distribute the taste of aesthetic feelings through the medium of the inner sweetness of the human mind. This is Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s Baul,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  and that Baul is thoroughly drenched with Shaeva Dharma. The spirit of Baul is: &ldquo;I am unable to embrace Him and make Him my own &ndash; Him whom I know, recognize and realize, and who is my nearest kin, my life and soul (in Rabindranath&#146;s words <I>jiivan devata&#x301;</I>) &ndash; and in a bid to embrace Him, I roam about, searching him vigorously in heaven, earth and the nether world.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->If Shiva is the life and soul not only of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, but also of the world, we can say that Baul is the worldly reverberation of the Shaeva ideals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->I have already said that <I>kiirtana</I> is prevalent in various places and various forms. But one of the reasons for the ineffability and divine sweetness of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s <I>kiirtana</I> is that it is inspired by the ideas embodied in Baul. The other kinds of affair related to vocal and instrumental music are concerned with body and mind, i.e., their appeal is to body and mind. And therein lies their supremacy and other-worldly charm which can be touched, yet cannot be touched. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s <I>kiirtana</I>, on the other hand, based on Baul, appeals to the mind and also to the soul. So the <I>kiirtana</I> of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h not only overwhelms the human mind; it causes a person to become completely lost. <I>Kiirtana</I> composed according to <I>nandana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na</I> induces in a person the tactual perception of <I>mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I>. The <I>kiirtana</I> of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is not merely <I>sam&#x301;giita</I> [song, dance and instrumental music]; it sways the finite humankind with the vibration of the unlimited and infinite; it makes humans in their little homes hear the call of the far-away blue firmament. Hence it is outstanding and unparalleled.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->What we mean by <I>ma&#x301;rga sam&#x301;giita</I>, or classical music, is to control and direct musical notes and rhythmic expression through an approach based on acoustic science and psychology.

These local characteristics are called <I>ghara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;s</I> [styles particular to particular places]. <I>Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii kiirtana</I> also has four such styles, viz., 1) Manoharshahii, 2) Garanhata, 3) Reneti and 4) Mandaran. In other forms of musical culture also, besides <I>kiirtana</I>, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>had its own styles. Vishnupur, the capital of Mallabhum, for centuries occupied the highest place in the classical expression of music. Most of the famous singers not only of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, but also of Bengal as a whole, hail from Vishnupur or its neighbouring areas. Due to a lack of proper effort and zeal, the Vishnupur style is now on the brink of ruin.<!-- /block --></p>

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="26.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.26.fn2">2</a></b>)   In <i>A Few Problems Solved Part 1,</i> &ldquo;The Practice of Art and Literature&rdquo;, the author has said: &ldquo;Yet it is in painting and sculpture, which are considered the subtlest of all arts, that we find the true expression of the wonderful aesthetic sense of the human mind. In the calm stillness of a painting or a sculpture, all has to be vividly expressed &ndash; laughter and tears, hopes and fears, gestures and language. Indeed, it is the arts of painting and sculpture that beautifully bridge the gap between the mundane and the supramundane.&rdquo; &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="26.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.26.fn3">3</a></b>)   [[&ldquo;Baul&rdquo; most often refers to a community of singers, but it can also refer to an individual member of that community or to the school of music followed by that community. &ndash;Trans.]]</p>

It is the endeavour to ensconce the microcosmic entity, the individual entitative rhythm, in the eternal being, the infinite rhythm of <I>Parama Purus&#x301;a.</I> Other music comes within the scope of aesthetic science, but <I>kiirtana</I> comes within the scope of <I>mohana vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na.</I> So of all the branches of music, <I>kiirtana</I> is the best. &ndash;Trans.</p>

<a name="28..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Not only were the ancient civilizations and cultures that the river basins of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h carried with them in their eastward course assimilated in Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k; simultaneously with the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hiiya civilization, Aryan civilization along the Gangetic basin from north-west came and mingled, and the Mongolian civilization along the Brahmaputra basin from north-east came and mingled.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Hence the Bengalee civilization represents the confluence of the three civilizations. The mixture of the three is Ba&#x301;m&#x301;la&#x301; civilization &ndash; Ba&#x301;un&#x32D;a&#x301;lii culture. Bengal is not an appendage of A&#x301;ryya&#x301;vartta [northern India], nor is it an annex to greater China; nor is it only the flag-bearer of the Austric-Dravid [legacy]. So in trying to give an identity of Bengal, I am left with no alternative but to say that Bengal owes that identity to its river-based existence only. This soil is resplendent with its own originality, lively with its own existence. It is self-sufficient, with its own identity &ndash; Bengal is nothing but Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Manifestation [of culture] is coupled with purification of feelings &ndash; civility and decorousness of expression. This is how each and every river- or rivulet-centred part-civilization of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h moved ahead. In this respect, even an insignificant ditch (recognized neither as a river nor as a canal) should not be ignored. They not only moved towards [worldly] fulfilment along the river basins, they surged ahead from crude towards subtle along those same basins. Subtilization came in them through clash and cohesion. However much one may try, this clash can in no way be avoided. It does not dry up the flow of vitality, rather it triggers newer and newer waves. It was in just this way that different folk-songs, different dance forms and different rhythmic and lyrical expressions came into being.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->One  river basin saw the emergence of ra&#x301;iveshe [a form of dance] (in the Mayurakshi basin), somewhere else there was the leto dance (in the Ajay river basin, prevalent especially among the Muslims), somewhere else the na&#x301;cni dance, somewhere else jhumur, somewhere else the cho dance, somewhere else the lathi dance, and somewhere else t&#x301;usu-bha&#x301;du songs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->I have said that the flow continues, but new waves are created. The ra&#x301;iveshe dance in Mayureshwar Police Station is not the same as in the area of the Raniishvara and Rajnagar police stations. The leto dance in the Aushgram region is not the same as in Jamtura Subdivision. Similarly, the na&#x301;cni dance and jhumur in the plains regions of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are not of the same kinds as their counterparts in the mountainous regions. Variations have arisen in three realms: style of expression, rhythm and tune. However, the flow has been towards one single goal of perfection.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The cho dance<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.28.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#28.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  (cho means unusual gestures, or decorative dress, or adornments) was born in the Bagmundi palace of the ancient Barahabhum kingdom, but from there it has progressed in three streams. The three ghara&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;s [styles] of the cho dance are: 1) The Manbhum style. It is prevalent in Manbhum and Bankura Districts. One of the many characteristics of this dance is that the dancers are to sport masks (mohara&#x301; in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Bengali, rather than mukhos&#x301;a). 2) The Seraikela style. It is prevalent in Singhbhum District and the western part of Midnapur District. In this style, masks are used as needed. 3) The Bhanjabhum style. It was (and is) prevalent in Mayurbhanja and in the Nayabasan regions of Midnapur. This style does not use masks.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The ancient rhythmic and heroic dance of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was the lathi dance. Under the influence of Jainism in the Jain age, some people transformed the lathi dance into the stick [a thin and very small stick] dance; they thought that dancing with lathis was against the Jain ideology. The lathi dance nevertheless survived, but later, when the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were initiated into Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma, it met its death and was [finally] transformed into the stick dance. Whether these changes were good or bad, they were effected either by the pressure of change of place, or by the pressure of change of time, or by the pressure of change of person.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.28.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#28.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  I would include ideological pressure within the pressure of change of persons, since ideology is carried forward through the medium of persons.

Inexpensive and common adornments are ingrained in the life of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h; but they have never been allowed to stand in the way of the simple lifestyle of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. From time immemorial, the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, like other Dravidian and Mongol populations, used to chew betel leaf and exchange it with others, and make wide use of non-Aryan things such as betel-leaf, betel-nut, banana, pieces of sugar cane, etc., during festivals, wedding ceremonies and other social functions. These things are absolutely non-Aryan. Equivalent words for these things are not to be found in the Aryan Sanskrit language; they are found in non-Aryan Sanskrit only. For example, &ldquo;betel-nut&rdquo; has no equivalent word in Aryan Sanskrit; in non-Aryan Sanskrit it is called guva&#x301;k or puun&#x32D;giphalam.

This freedom has brought a sort of comfort in the life of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. In market-places and in paddy-fields, women and men work side by side. In ancient times, when hunting was a very widely-practised feature of life in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the men used to do the hunting and the women came back home with the killed birds and animals on their heads. The simple cosmetics which these women living in a free and clean manner used to resort to, after working in the paddy-fields, and coming back home with bundles of sticks on their heads, were to take a bath, applying a paste of raw turmeric over the body, and then to apply collyrium on their eyes, cakitaharin&#x301;iipreks&#x301;an&#x301;a&#x301; [&ldquo;like the long and startled eyes of a deer&rdquo;]. The wide use of this collyrium would give the dark-complexioned women of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h a graceful appearance.

When in the remote past the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h first received from Lord Sada&#x301;shiva an opportunity to fly the colours of victory of humanism far and wide, they thought that they would need to congregate at a particular place to chalk out plans for their constructive religious activities. It was in order to meet together that they conceived the idea of building temples.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The villages and towns of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, be they big, medium or small, abound with Shiva temples, most of which have Shiva lingas based on different ideations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->As I have mentioned, this was in the remote past, when Jainism was yet to come to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. The people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were faced with the problem of how to build the necessary temples &ndash; a question that was both easy and difficult. The people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h used to build &ndash; and still build even today &ndash; thatched huts with bamboo poles and mud walls. Naturally their temples would be in keeping with that same system of building houses. The temples of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h resemble huts with thatched roofs above the walls. This is the famous Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hiiya style. According to the style of construction of a particular temple, there will sometimes be one roof, sometimes two, or other variations. The four styles basically used in the building of temples in India are: 1) The Rajput style of north-western India, in which the roof tapers upwards to a point. 2) The Dravidian style, in which there is a small roof atop the temple, along with a special type of gopuram [a special kind of decoration]. 3) The Utkal style. 4) The thatched-hut style of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. (The Kalighat temple is to be noted here.) It is impossible to fix the exact day and time that saw the beginning of this temple-building in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. There is no doubt, however, that it is more than six thousand years old. In this style, the artisans of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h who built the temples showed their ingenuity and excellence in the dexterity of their construction. All such temple places as Vishnupur, Kalna, Burdwan, Chandrakona, Banshberhe and Guptipara have generally followed this Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hiiya style of roofs with a single roof (or [up to] eight roofs).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It cannot be said, however, that there are no exceptions to the thatched-roof style of one roof or eight-roofs. Generally speaking, we find exceptions in these places: 1) Nerhadeul of Midnapur; 2) Rekhadeul of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h in the Barakar River basin; 3) the Khargeshvara temple of Birbhum; 4) the Hangsheshwari temple of Banshberhe; 5) the Ekateshvara temple of Bankura; etc. Of all these temples, the Hangsheshwari temple of Banshberhe stands apart and independent as regards the idea therein, though the temple is not so old. This kind of temple is unique and unparalleled. There are many temple towns in India, such as Varanasi, North Varanasi, Jammu, Jamnagar, etc. They are generally built in accordance with the style of north-western India. The temple towns in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h &ndash; 1) Vishnupur, 2) Kalna, 3) Chandrakona, 4) Burdwan, 5) Banshberhe and 6) Guptipara &ndash; are chiefly built in accordance with the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hiiya style. What is more noteworthy is that the most ancient temples of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are situated in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and the less ancient temples in eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, especially in Hooghly and in the Vishnupur Subdivision of Bankura. There are quite a few temples in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h that are over two thousand years old. The Pareshnath temple on the bank of the Kangsavati River in Bankura District is one such. It is an ancient Jain temple. The Ekateshvara temple of Bankura is somewhat ancient, though perhaps not very ancient. It is either a Shaeva-influenced Jain temple or a Jain-influenced Shaeva temple. At one time there were many Jain Pain&#x32D;caratna<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.30.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#30.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  temples in western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, but none of them have remained completely intact. Either they faced decay due to the wear and tear of time or they were destroyed in later days by the followers of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma. The word pa&#x301;ncra&#x301; is a distorted form of the word &ldquo;Pain&#x32D;caratna&rdquo;. There are many places in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h which have Pa&#x301;ncra&#x301; as their name. If searches are undertaken, many Jain temples will be found in or around such places.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Burdwan was one of the many important hubs of Jain culture and Jain civilization. Having been somewhat disappointed in preaching his religion in Magadh, Vardhaman Mahavir came to this town, and with the town as his nucleus, he preached the Jain religion in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h for eight years. The town is very ancient. Its Sanskrit name was A&#x301;stiknagar. Later on it came to be known as Atthinagar in Pra&#x301;krta. The meaning of the name is &ldquo;a town whose inhabitants believe in God&rdquo;. After Mahavir had come to this town, a handful of vaeshyas [capitalists] first accepted him, and with their cooperation, the Jain religion struck its roots in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. It was these vaeshyas of the city who renamed that city Vardhaman (Burdwan), after Vardhaman Mahavir. This happened 2500 years ago. Burdwan is the most ancient of all towns not only in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, but in the whole of Bengal. It is one of the oldest towns in India also. As the laterite soil of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is the oldest soil and as Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hiiya habitations are the most ancient human habitations and the most ancient human civilization, it will not be unjust to assume that Burdwan is the oldest town in the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->To the far north of Burdwan, there is a town Sainthia, the Sanskrit name of which is Sva&#x301;miistha&#x301;na, which was within the territory of the ancient Gopabhum kingdom (now Birbhum District). Vardhaman Mahavir himself came to this town on foot in order to preach Jainism. Hence Sainthia is also an important holy place for the Jains. Situated on the bank of Mayurakshi, this town also is over 2500 years old.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Adyapur was another great centre for Jain culture in eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. (A&#x301;dya&#x301;pur in Sanskrit &rarr; A&#x301;jja&#x301;pur in Prakrit, &rarr; A&#x301;ja&#x301;pur in modern Bengali.) The name A&#x301;dya&#x301;pur came from the names of the Jain deities A&#x301;dya&#x301;shakti and A&#x301;dya&#x301;devii. This big village with well-educated people is situated a stone&#146;s throw from the Masagram railway station on the Howrah-Burdwan cord line under the Jamalpur Police Station of Burdwan District. The historically important relics of this village are now on the way to fast extinction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now, the question is, were the Jain temples destroyed by wear and tear only, or was there any other reason? When the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Age came to Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the initial tendency was to accept the Jain deities as being different forms of the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika ones and to arrange for their preservation. Wherever this was possible, meaning that these jain deities could become deities of Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika scripture, those temples and the deities in them survived, and the Brahman priests started worshipping them with appropriate mantras. But the deities which could not be accepted as scriptural deities became accepted as non-scriptural deities. Somehow or other, they also survived. They lived on amid people&#146;s mixed feelings of reverence and neglect. The priesthood was carried on by the indigenous Bengalees &ndash; the Sadgopes, the Jalik Kaivartas, the Kurmi Mahatos or the la&#x301;ya&#x301;s of the Sim&#x301; Mun&#x301;d&#x301;as. (The la&#x301;ya&#x301;s, or na&#x301;ya&#x301;s, are the priests of the Mun&#x301;d&#x301;a community.) The idols of all the Jain deities that could in no way be accepted were transfigured a little, and thus attempts were made to upgrade their status. Thus in the case of many a male Jain deity with a serpent on the head, breasts were added onto the chest with chisels and hammers, and it began to be worshipped, and is still being worshipped today, as the serpent goddess Manasa&#x301;. If the researchers cast a searching glance even today, they will find the later marks left by the chisels and hammers. But the temples of those deities which could in no way be made fit for worship became neglected and were destroyed, or are being destroyed; and the deities themselves had to take shelter under trees. This &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; of deities in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h continued for a long time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->[As mentioned earlier,] The idols of the Jain Tiirthaun&#x32D;karas were all nude. So there was no means by which they could be considered as Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika deities. So almost all of the Tiirthaun&#x32D;karas were left under trees. A great many gods and goddesses from the neglected Jain temples were strewn here and there. Many a person from outside has removed these idols in order to decorate their drawing-rooms. In many cases, villagers have handed the idols over to the outsiders in exchange for a small amount of money. And in some cases, even government officals have shifted such idols to distant museums, the whereabouts of which are unknown even to the local people. This state of affairs calls for a museum in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h immediately. If the artefacts or archaeological remains of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are allowed to remain in neglect any longer, there will be no vestige of such things in the near future. It was in just this way that the Maradu temple village (under Silli Police Station of Ranchi District) on the bank of the Suvarnarekha was destroyed; and Deulghata (Devalayaghata &ndash; situated on the bank of the Kansai River of Purulia District), and the temple complex near Pareshnath in the Kansai River basin of Bankura District, and the Jinshahar area on the bank of the Kansai near the city of Midnapore, and Panchra in the basin of the Ajay of Burdwan District, and Panchra in the basin of the Kopai of Birbhum District, were all ruined. Further things cannot be allowed to be ruined in this way. The necessary steps should be taken without delay. The Rupnarayan basin, which comprises Gandheshwari, Dhalkishore, Dwarakeshwar, Shilavati, Jaypanda, etc., is rich in artefacts, yet still lies neglected; still no proper research has been undertaken. The need of the hour is research in these areas. If a museum is set up, it may inspire speedy research work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Another contribution of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, along with its culture and architecture, and which is unique in the world, is its terracotta art fixed on the exteriors of temples. There are no hills in the middle-east of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, though hills are numerous in the western region. So temples were by and large built of brick. Where temples were built of stone, there was scope for stone sculpture, but where the temples were built of brick, the need for a special kind of art arose. And that was nothing but terracotta art. The artisans of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h wrought their work in the soft clay, then fired it, and finally cemented the work to the exterior of the temple with a mixture of lime and sugar or of other ingredients. This is how terracotta was introduced in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s temple architecture. Places such as Kalna, Chandrakona and Vishnupur were witnesses to exquisite examples of this art, and are witness to a few even today. Vishnupur (in Bankura District) was the birthplace of this art. Hence wherever in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h the temples most richly display this terracotta art, research will reveal that the artisans who created it were all from Bankura.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Inseparably connected with the temple art of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were two other arts &ndash; flower art, or cork art,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.30.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#30.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  and the art of making sweets. So famous did the flower art of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h become at one time that its reputation reached as far as Persia. Every time the Mughal emperors came to Bengal, they were greeted with gifts of floral ornamentation of various kinds. The cork art of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is so old that it would be an exercise in futility to trace its date of origin. So beautiful were the works of this cork art that the people of Egypt, China, etc. would buy them with utmost interest. The Ma&#x301;la&#x301;ka&#x301;rava&#x301;s [a community of artisans with this specialization] of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were skilled in both flower art and cork art. Today these artisans are just barely surviving. I am hereby drawing the attention of lovers of beauty in this country to this state of affairs.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->This is a haunt of gods side by side with human beings. So countless temples were built for countless gods. As has been said earlier, the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were sociable by nature. They were not only sociable in their behaviour and actions; they were also sociable in regard to sweets. Similar arrangements were made for the deities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The sweets to be offered to the deities as food differed from one temple to another. In this way a temple-centred sweets art developed in every town and in every village that had various temples. The gods also became sociable as regards the enjoyment of sweets. The sweets of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h were made mostly of condensed milk and cha&#x301;na&#x301; [the solid part of curdled milk], but grams (chick-peas), black grams and mung beans were often used. I wonder how many of us know that Patiram Moyra of Janai village (Hooghly) in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h invented the present-day nimki and siuna&#x301;r&#x301;a&#x301; [popular salty snacks]. It was in this village that sandesh, manohara&#x301; and khaecur&#x301;  (all made of condensed milk) were invented.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="31..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is a land of rough and undulating red soil. Even if this does not completely hold true for eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is a rather high and arid land compared to Bagri. So the air of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is clear and the climate is conducive to good health. The clean air blowing across western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h can hardly be found anywhere else. And its water is equally good. Adequately rich in minerals, it is, as it were, nectar (sudha&#x301;). A long vein that runs from Bakreshwar to Nannur (in Birbhum District) in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, sometimes beneath the surface, sometimes above, is rich in sulphur ore. Hence the water there is warm and healthful. Besides, it contains some special kinds of minerals and gases, some of which, if not all, are good for health. The milky fountain of Bankura in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is a magnificent gift of nature. Its water is crowned with milky froth and is like nectar (amrta) as a drink. This kind of thing is rare in the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The undulating soil, the clean air and the mineral-rich water can make Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h an attractive destination for those who want to recover their health. So I think that if cheap health resorts or sanatoriums are built in selected places, people may come here from outside in order to regain their broken health quickly and at little expense, and in this way the local poor people will get an opportunity to earn some money.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A dreaded disease in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is leprosy. Why does leprosy break out in such an incomparably healthy place as this? In no way is the soil, water, climate or nature responsible for this. It is only a defective man-made socio-economic system that is at fault. People cannot live on water and air alone. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is trapped in extreme poverty. A large part of the population cannot fill their stomachs with nutritious food. It is due to this malnutrition that they contract leprosy. If poverty is removed through people&#146;s efforts &ndash; the efforts not only of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h themselves, but of everyone &ndash; the bodies of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h will once again resemble those of the Greek heroes as seen in sculptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->While discussing the health of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, the pu&#x301;rva&#x301;dra theory needs to be discussed. [Pu&#x301;rva = &ldquo;east&rdquo;. A&#x301;dra = &ldquo;damp&rdquo;.] Basically the rule is that the farther east the land is, the damper or more moist the climate is, the more unhealthful the place is, and the more unhealthy and the more averse to labour the people are. In other words, &ldquo;east&rdquo; and &ldquo;damp&rdquo; are basically correlated. Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k is in the extreme east, hence it is very moist. The people there are in ill health and unable to toil much. Samatat-Bagri is on the west of Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k and is a little less moist and a little more healthful, and the people are healthier and more hard-working. In comparison, eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is farther to the west and hence more arid and more healthful, and the people are still more hard-working.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="31..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is in the extreme west and is very dry, so the climate there is very healthful, and the people are healthy and very hard-working. The people of western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h come to eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h to earn a living as labourers, but the people of eastern Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h do not go to western Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h to work, because they cannot compete with the local people as regards manual labour. When Pratapaditya, the local king of Jessore, was preparing to fight against the Mughals, one part of his preparations was to beef up his infantry with a large number of Bagdis from the Burdwan area of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. He settled them with landed property in Jessore and Khulna, and their descendants have remained there permanently.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="32..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The land of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is very ancient. Just as its people are ancient, so their civilization and culture are ancient. There cannot be a very interesting history of the Shu&#x301;dra Age. Its history is the history of how humanity marches onward towards the Ks&#x301;atriya Age.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.32.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#32.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  This Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, which was called Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h in the histories written in the middle ages, Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301; Rid&#x301;i in some languages, and La&#x301;ti in some other languages, can be roughly divided into two parts &ndash; north and south &ndash; parts which, in ancient times, were called Brahmadesh and Suhmadesh respectively. Later the northern part of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h came to be called Burdwan Bhukti and the southern part Dan&#x301;d&#x301;a Bhukti (the Midnapur region). Following the end of the rule of powerful kings in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, there emerged numerous small and medium-sized kingdoms or regions. Some of their rulers were sovereign kings, some were feudal lords; while others remained in a position of half-sovereignty, paying a nominal tax or giving occasional presents to the king of Gaor&#x301;a. Others who had lost their power turned into zamindars [landlords].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->One thing that was very noticeable was that most of the kingdoms or regions had names ending with bhum. Though there were a few exceptions, this bhum ending was a speciality of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. A brief history of such places is as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><b>1) Birbhum</b>: In the Austric language, biir means &ldquo;forest&rdquo;. This Birbhum consisted of Rajmahal and Pakurh Subdivisions of Santal Pargana District, Rampurhat Subdivision of Birbhum District, Kandi Subdivision and the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h portion (the areas to the west of the Bhagirathi River) of the district of Murshidabad. The rulers of Birbhum were Kayasthas whose surname was Sinha. They thwarted the inroads of Buddhism for a long time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When Santal Pargana District was created in 1856, Pakurh Subdivision and Rajmahal Subdivision were annexed to that district. Later, even Kandi Subdivision was cut out of Birbhum and made a part of the district of Murshidabad.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><b>2) Gopabhum</b>: The Gopabhum kingdom consisted of Deoghar and Dumka Subdivisions of the district of Santal Pargana and Shiuri Sadar Subdivision of Birbhum. This entire kingdom was included in the Zilla [district] Birbhum during the Mughal period. The Sadgope kings, whose surname was Ghosh, ruled the land. Ichai Ghosh was the most notable of all the kings of the Ghosh dynasty. Most probably it was Ichai Ghosh who for the first time used Bengali in place of Sanskrit for the administrative work. It was Ichai Ghosh who brought a good number of Brahmans and Kayasthas to his kingdom, settled them on tax-free land, and planned to build a society of scholars. The Brahmans came from Burdwan and the Kayasthas from Kandi. A somewhat similar thing happened in Chut&#x301;iya&#x301; Nagpur (it is erroneous to call it Chota Nagpur). King Ratu of Ranchi brought a large number of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Brahmans from Burdwan and settled them there, in his own kingdom. In Ranchi District they are now known as Deoghariiya Brahmans [Brahmans of Deoghar origin &ndash; Deoghar was within Burdwan District at the time of their arrival]. It was these Deoghariiya Brahmans who established the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika cult in the Silli, Tamarh and Bagmundi regions. Afterwards, when Santhal Pargana was created, Dumka and Deoghar Subdivision were included in that newly-created district.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><b>3) Samantabhum</b>: Samantabhum consisted of Durgapur and Asansol Subdivisions of Burdwan and Jamtara Subdivision of Santal Pargana District. At one time the whole of Samantabhum had fallen within Ranigunj Subdivision of the district of Burdwan. Later, when Santal Pargana came into existence, Jamtara was joined with it. Asansol being a bigger town than Ranigunj, the headquarters of the subdivision was shifted to Asansol. Later, the importance of Durgapur having increased, Durgapur Subdivision was formed out of the eastern part of that subdivision, and Asansol Subdivision was formed out of the western part. The Ugraks&#x301;atriya [a ks&#x301;atriya sub-caste] kings with Samanta as their surname ruled Samantabhum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><b>4) Shikharbhum</b>: The expanse of this Shikharbhum kingdom included the present-day district of Dhanbad and everything west up to Sametshikhar, or the Pareshnath Hills. The kingdom of Shikharbhum was named after Sametshikhar. The Shikharbhum kingdom of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h lay to the east and south, and the kingdom of Jharkhand to the north and west, of Sametshikhar. Later the kingdom got divided up into the regions of Jharia, Katras, etc. A branch known as Shikhar Samaj exists among the Rajuaras, the Bede Mahatos, the Bauris and the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Maithili Brahmans of Bengal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><b>5) Mallabhum</b>: Vishnupur Subdivision of Bankura District was known as Mallabhum. Vir Hambir Malla was the founder of this kingdom, hence it was so named.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><b>6) Senbhum</b>: Senbhum consisted of the Sadar Subdivision of Bankura. Vaidya kings with the surname Sen ruled here, hence the name Senbhum. Among the Vaidyas of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h there is a distinct section called the Senbhum Samaj. Though there is some controversy about the matter, it seems likely that Bankura owes its name to Banku Ray, a king of Senbhum. During the time of the Vaidya kings, Senpaharhi also was an important place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>7) Manbhum</b>: Manbhum was also known as Panchakot, Panchet or Pacheti. The present-day district of Purulia, the land to the south of the Damodar River in the district of Dhanbad (Chas, Chandankeyari and Bokaro), and Jeredi, Peterwar, Kasmar, Gola and Ramgar of Hazaribag District (now Giridih District) were included in this kingdom.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This kingdom owes its name to King Mansingha Dev. Its former capital was Manbazar. Later the kingdom of Kashipur was formed out of a large part of Manbhum. The zamindaries [estates] of Jaipur and Jhalda were also a part of it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><b>8) Barahabhum</b>: This kingdom consisted of the southern part of the district of Purulia, that is, Barahabazar, Balarampur, Bandwan and Bagmundi; the Chandil, Patamda, Ichagar and Nimdi areas of the district of Singhbhum; and the Panch Parganiiya areas of Ranchi District, that is, the Silli, Sonahatu, Bundu and Tamar areas. Two Munda brothers, Adibaraha and Keshbaraha, founded this kingdom. Later, it disintegrated into the small zamindaries of Barahabhum, Bagmundi, Silli, Tamar, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>9) Singhabhum</b>: This kingdom consisted of the central and western parts of the present-day district of Singhbhum. The kings of the Kole sub-tribe ruled this kingdom. In course of time, this kingdom broken into two segments &ndash; Singbhum in the west and Porahat in the east. Still later, the kingdom of Porahat split in two &ndash; Kharsoyan in the west and Seraikela in the east. During the British rule, Kharsoyan and Seraikela were two principalities. The Keraikela region was also included within this kingdom.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><b>10) Dhabalbhum or Dhalbhum</b>: This kingdom consisted of Dhalbhum Subdivision of Singhbhum District and Jhargram Subdivision of Midnapore District. The surname of the kings was Dhabaldeo, and the kingdom was named after them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><b>11) Shabarbhum</b>: This kingdom was formed out of most of the areas of the district of Midnapore. The kings of the Shabar clan (of the Kher&#x301;iya&#x301; Mun&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;) ruled it. Later this kingdom broke up into numerous small zamindaries.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><b>12) Bhanjabhum</b>: The ancient name of the kingdom of Mayurbhanja was Bhanjabhum. As each and every emblem of the royal family bore the figure of a peacock [mayu&#x301;r], the kingdom was called Mayurbhanja. The kings of Mayurbhanja also had zamindaries in the Nayabasan area of Midnapore District. The British long ago annexed the Nayabasan area to British India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><b>13) Saptashati</b>: The Saptashati region consisted of the eastern parts of the districts of Burdwan and Hooghly. The Saptashati (i.e., Satshaika) Brahman kings ruled here. Their rule came to an end during the Muslim period and then some parts of this kingdom went into the formation of Sharifabad Pargana (an area near the city of Burdwan).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><b>14) Bhurishreshtha, or Bhursoot</b>: Bhurishreshtha, or Bhursoot Pargana, consisted of the southern part of Burdwan District, the western part of Hooghly District, and Howrah District. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;hii Brahman kings with the surname Ra&#x301;y (or Bandyopa&#x301;dhya&#x301;y) ruled here. This kingdom also was reduced to zamindaries during the Muslim period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Having no lofty goal or ideal [during this period], the kings of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h used always to be engaged in quarrels among themselves. They ignored the greater interest of the people. Even after Gaor&#x301;a had been conquered by the Pathans, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had its freedom. Had the kings of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h remained unified, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h could have resisted foreign invasions and the history of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h also would have been different. When Alexander invaded India, Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was well-organized and united. For that reason Alexander desisted from proceeding towards the east. But later the situation changed. It was due to the folly of the local rulers of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h that Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h had to wear the chains of slavery for a long time. They would get involved in hostilities over just a small piece of land. Thus the people had to undergo untold miseries, which they did not like at all. It was under a kind of pressure of the common people that the warring kings of Senbhum, Mallabhum and Dhabalbhum were forced to sign a treaty of peace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->At that time the custom in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was that in case of a newly-formed alliance, all concerned would sit together to dine on rice, [black gram, and rice boiled in sweetened milk. In the place where they held this feast to mark their unity (ekata&#x301;), they built a temple named Ekateshvara. This temple is situated in the district of Bankura. As I have mentioned earlier, this temple was either a Shiva temple influenced by Jainism or a Jain temple influenced by Shaeva Dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was subjected to continuous socio-economic exploitation, and moreover, the tyranny of their kings was equally bad. The nature of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is such that unless they are incited they do not protest. The ideals of Digambar Jainism are largely responsible for this. Later, the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h who refused to embrace the Paora&#x301;n&#x301;ika Dharma had to tolerate the pangs of social indignity, and as a result they fell victim to an inferiority complex. Still later, in a bid to come out of the vortex of inferiority complex, they accepted, in throngs, the Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma. Apart from the burden of this inferiority complex for seven hundred years, the way they had to accept Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma, or the way this Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma was presented to them, made them somewhat averse to struggle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="32..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Here it should be borne in mind that Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma does not emphasize excessive ahim&#x301;sa&#x301; as much as Jainism does. And the doctrine of ahim&#x301;sa&#x301; in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma was explained differently in different places. There are some excesses in the practice of ahim&#x301;sa&#x301; in the Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava doctrine of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, though maybe they are not so great as in Jainism. For example [in Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avism] one must say &ldquo;prepare&rdquo; vegetables and not &ldquo;cut&rdquo; them, rasa&#x301; and not jhol [both meaning &ldquo;soup&rdquo;, the liquid part of a vegetable preparation, but the latter suggesting a non-vegetarian preparation], or&#x301; flower and not jaba&#x301; flower [both names for a blood-red flower, the China rose, or hibiscus, but the latter name used when worshipping Ka&#x301;lii with this flower], seha&#x301;i and not ka&#x301;li [both meaning &ldquo;ink&rdquo;, but the latter suggesting the goddess Ka&#x301;lii], etc. The excessive ahimsa&#x301; in Digambara Jainism and a type of excessive ahimsa&#x301; in the Gaor&#x301;iiya Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava Dharma prevalent in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h did a lot of damage to the spirit of valour of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Notwithstanding their strength, capability, courage and diligence, they were not easily able to leap into a struggle. It is really a pity that Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, which had once been noted for its military skill, began to enter into a repulsive tortoise-like withdrawal. And it is probably for this reason that we notice that the role played by Bagri in the struggle for the independence of India was much greater than that played by Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. Moreover, the role played by Vaun&#x32D;ga-D&#x301;aba&#x301;k (Dhaka, Barisal, Mymensingh, Chittagong, etc.) was even greater than that of Bagri. It is to be noted that the further east one goes in Bengal, the greater was the influence of Buddhism and the less was that of Jainism. Places where the influence of Buddhism was greater, had a greater role in the struggle for independence. This was so, among other reasons, because Buddhism does not have the same excessive ahim&#x301;sa&#x301; that we see in Jainism. The people of the south-eastern parts of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h (Midnapur, Hooghly, Howrah, etc.), where the influence of Buddhism was great in comparison with that of Jainism, played an important role in the struggle for independence.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="33..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->This world of ours is made up of good and bad. And the good and the bad things are done not so much by nature as by human beings. The good things that humans have the capacity for are friendliness, intimacy, love, sweet amiability &ndash; both internal and external &ndash; sitting together to eat and to talk, trying to feel the joys and sorrows of others, and so on. And of the bad things that humans do, the first and foremost is the exploitation of one human by another. This exploitation occurs sometimes in the religious sphere, sometimes in the social sphere, sometimes in the mental sphere and sometimes in the economic sphere.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When human beings first appeared on earth, that was the Shu&#x301;dra Age. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was no exception. When the people of that age all began to feel that they should live collectively in order to fight against the obstacles and dangers of their adverse environment, they began to search for a chieftain. At the initial stage, a woman used to be the chieftain. Even though she may not have had to do anything, she served as a symbol of group-oriented living &ndash; just like a queen ant or a queen bee or a queen white ant. In this way there emerged the ancient matriarchal society. When, later on, it made way for the patriarchal society &ndash; when it became evident that a patriarchal society [patrilineal order] was necessary for determining the lineage of the children &ndash; males began to assume the roles of chieftains. These chieftains used to be called, in more polished language, ra&#x301;ja&#x301;s [kings]. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h too saw the emergence of patriarchal society. But it was slightly different than in other parts of the world. In most countries, where the society was matriarchal, the matrilineal order of lineage prevailed, and where the society was patriarchal, the patrilineal order prevailed. Though Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h&#146;s present social system is patriarchal, the systems of lineage and right to perform the last rites, and, in some cases, inheritance, are not completely patrilineal. What is found is a beautiful mixture of the patrilineal and matrilineal orders.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The male-dominated society is followed by the Ks&#x301;atriya Age. At the initial stage there is only the ks&#x301;atriyas&#146; sha&#x301;san [control and administration], but later comes shos&#x301;an&#x301; [exploitation] as well. During the Ks&#x301;atriya Age, if the populace can flatter their king, they can pass their days happily. But when the Vaeshya Age eventually follows, people&#146;s very existence becomes unbearable. The Ks&#x301;atriya Age lasted for a long time in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. But soon after the fall of local kingdoms, the Vaeshya Age with all its ruthlessness tightened its noose around the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. There being no way out, the hapless people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, like the people of other countries in the world, gave in to the exploitation of the Vaeshya Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The exploitation in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was very extreme, and it still is. The vaeshya control and administration and vaeshya exploitation in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h manifests itself in two different ways: 1) exploitation by the local vaeshyas, which is relatively insignificant, and 2) exploitation by the outsider vaeshyas, which is very extreme. The fundamental difference between the exploitation by the local vaeshyas and that by the outsiders is this: though both are exploiters and the exploitation of both causes people to cry aloud for relief, the local exploiters mostly keep their exploitation-gotten wealth within the territory of the land, and hence there is a chance for that wealth to be utilized in future in the service of the people. But the outsider exploiters will in most cases transfer outside all the wealth that they have ruthlessly squeezed out of the land. This means that there is no chance whatsoever for those resources to be utilized in future in the service of the local people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="33..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Today a heavy load of exploitation is breaking the backs of the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h. To save Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h without delay, an all-round socio-economic rehabilitation plan is needed. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h is filled with nature&#146;s inexhaustible store, and yet the people of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are not able to eat their fill of nutritious food. What a heart-rending sight! It may not be possible for the present inhabitants of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h alone to do all that is necessary to save their land from this miserable plight. So those from outside Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h must also come forward to help Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, otherwise a highly-civilized and cultured human population will be ruined.<!-- /block --></p>
