<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam (&ldquo;Blissful Discourses&rdquo;) series assembles all the known General Darshan discourses given by Ma&#x301;rga Guru Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti. General Darshan (GD) speeches, or discourses, were those given to Ananda Marga members, often as a part of the daily routine, in whatever locality Ma&#x301;rga Guru happened to be staying in at the time. Normally briefer and lighter in tone (though no less profound in their fundamental meanings) than the discourses given on the formal occasions of Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra, these talks were sometimes delivered in a very intimate way to relatively small groups of Margis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam series was begun in 1978 with the GD discourses given by the author at that time; it then kept pace with the GD discourses that the author gave over the subsequent six years. The present, twenty-third, part of the series includes for the first time a number of GD speeches given before 1978.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Some of the discourses included here, judging from their length and style, may well have been DMC discourses. We would appreciate any information that readers can provide in this regard. Any discourses that can be identified as DMC&#146;s will in future be transferred to the Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha series.<!-- /block --></p>

At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the cases of some of the discourses published here, no written record was found of the language in which the discourse was given; but if the language could be clearly inferred from the location and other circumstances of the discourse, we have cited that language.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix.

Notes: <p class="Para_Notes">This discourse was originally published, as  &ldquo;Srs&#x301;t&#x301;icakra and the Dhyeya  of the Microcosm&rdquo;, in an  Ananda Marga magazine. It was subsequently published in  Supreme Expression Part 1, and later once again in A&#x301;nanda  Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 23, under the same title. It has now been  reprinted in Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha Part 24,  as recent research has proved that this is a DMC discourse  and therefore rightly belongs in the Subha&#x301;s&#x301;ita Sam&#x301;graha  series.</p>

<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is the primary cause of this creation and what is it that humans should worship? In reference to this, scripture says that no relative factor can be the primary cause of creation:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;lah svabha&#x301;vo niyatiryadrccha&#x301; bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni yonih purus&#x301;a iti cintya&#x301;;<br>Sam&#x301;yoga es&#x301;a&#x301;m&#x301; na tva&#x301;tmabha&#x301;va&#x301;d a&#x301;tma&#x301;pyaniishah sukhaduhkhahetoh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->[It is debatable whether time, nature, fate, accident; or the five fundamental factors of matter; or unit consciousness &ndash; any of these separately &ndash; is the ultimate cause of creation. Even collectively they are not the cause of creation, although the a&#x301;tman, unit consciousness, is the catalytic agent. The unit consciousness is not the cause of creation, because it can be affected by virtue or vice.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;la. Does this universe, comprising all these animate and inanimate objects, owe its existence to ka&#x301;la [time]? Is this universe inherent in the womb of time? No, time is no independent factor. Time is the psychic measurement of the motivity of action. For there to be time, there has to be a &ldquo;place&rdquo;, for without a place no action can be performed. Over and above time and place, a &ldquo;person&rdquo; is also necessary, for that person will take the measure of the motivity of action. And thus where there is ka&#x301;la [time], there have to be place and person as well. So time is a relative factor, not an eternal or absolute factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Space, or place, is that in which all the solar systems of the universe exist. Round the nucleus of one solar system, that is, the sun, the earth revolves. When the earth completes one such circumambulation, we say that a year has gone by [i.e., we have defined time in terms of place].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->But the mere existence of the sun does not give us the idea of a year, nor even does the existence of the earth and the sun together give us the measure of time. For this a person, endowed with the power of judgement, becomes indispensable. So we see that in the absence of a person also, time does not exist; so time is entirely a relative factor. Some people say that &ldquo;Maha&#x301;ka&#x301;la&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Eternity&rdquo;, knows whatever took place in the past, whatever is taking place in the present, and whatever will take place in the future. But as a matter of fact there exists no such absolute or supreme entity as &ldquo;Maha&#x301;ka&#x301;la&rdquo;, for time is measured on the basis of relativity, that is, of place and person. Hence time cannot be the noumenal cause of this phenomenal universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Svabha&#x301;va. Then is svabha&#x301;va the primary cause of this creation? The English equivalent of svabha&#x301;va is &ldquo;nature&rdquo;. Nature is a blind force. Everything mundane is dependent on nature. But if we leave everything to nature, all sorts of confusion will arise. An infant has neither any intelligence nor any judgement; but when it puts its hand into a fire, its hand gets burnt. Wise people would not punish the little child in this way; but nature admits of no judgement. So this discriminating world can never be evolved by undiscriminating nature. Thus svabha&#x301;va, or nature, is not the rudimental cause of the creation of the universe either.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Niyati. The word niyati is derived ni [-] yam + ktin, [and its synonym is adrs&#x301;t&#x301;a.] [Adrs&#x301;t&#x301;a means] &ldquo;what is not seen with the eyes&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> That which seems to be invisibly controlling us is called niyati. Niyati in English is &ldquo;fate&rdquo;. But is the advent of humans in this world only a play of fate? Humans experience various kinds of pleasure and pain in their lives. But are they due to fate?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Original actions are of two kinds &ndash; psychic and psycho-physical. A person steals mentally; then he or she repeats the performance physically, but at the behest of his or her mind. So [in either case] the responsibility for the act lies with the mind. Therefore it is in the body of the mind that reaction will get awakened. If we think uncharitably of others, we have to endure the reaction or requital thereof in our mind. Reaction must follow mental action, whatever it may be. Reaction takes place in accordance with the nature of the original action. So we have got to be ever alert about our actions, not about their fruits. In reference to this the Giita&#x301; says:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Karman&#x301;yeva&#x301;dhika&#x301;raste ma&#x301; phales&#x301;u kada&#x301;cana;<br>Ma&#x301; karmaphalaheturbhu&#x301;ma&#x301; te saun&#x32D;go&#146;stvakarman&#x301;i.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->[You have the right to action but not the right to the fruits of the action. You must not do actions that will bind you, but you must not be averse to action, either.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When an action has taken place but the karmaphala-bhoga [reaction] has not, the reaction to the action remains in seed [form], which is called sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ra, or reaction in its potentiality. When the reaction immediately follows the performance of some action, a person says that he or she is undergoing or experiencing the fruits of such-and-such action. But when the body undergoes a change due to physical weakness or infirmity (that is, when death takes place), then in the next birth the person has to serve the accrued requitals, that is, the unserved reactions of the previous birth &ndash; and at that time persons will not be able to understand which of their actions have brought upon them the reaction that they are now serving. It is just because [the cause] cannot be seen or understood that it is called adrs&#x301;t&#x301;a, or unseen, requitals, or fate. Niyati, or fate, is merely the accrued reactions of the original actions. Niyati is no guiding factor. Wise persons do not waste time musing on reactions. Humans can mould their own fate in accordance with their actions. They must not become slaves to their fate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Yadrccha&#x301;. The English equivalent of yadrccha&#x301; is &ldquo;accident&rdquo;. I must say at the very outset that accident can never be the primary cause of evolution or of the Cycle of Creation. Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;va&#x301;t ka&#x301;rya&#x301;bha&#x301;vah; that is, &ldquo;Without a cause there can be no effect.&rdquo; When we come across an effect and along with it we get acquainted with its causal factor, we then call that effect an &ldquo;incident&rdquo;. But when, due to ignorance, we cannot know the cause of the effect, or when the causal factor gets transformed suddenly into the effect factor, we call that effect an &ldquo;accident&rdquo;. But in the universe there is no such thing as an accident. It is only to cover up one&#146;s ignorance of the real cause that one talks about an &ldquo;accident&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Bhu&#x301;ta. Bhu&#x301;ta is translated &ldquo;matter&rdquo; in English. There are many materialists, such as Charvaka, who say that this universe is begotten of matter alone. According to Charvaka what is non-perceptible is non-existent. We cannot see the mind, or air, but do they not exist? Through our judgement we know that matter is an inert object, and hence without intelligence. Intellect, and conscious beings, cannot be begotten of a non-intelligent inert object, that is, matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Prakrti. Now the question is, whether Prakrti [Cosmic Operative Principle] is the primary cause of this manifest universe. No, it certainly is not. Pra karoti iti Prakrti [&ldquo;The entity that gives form to different objects is called Prakrti&rdquo;]. A light bulb is lit by electrical energy. A fan, too, moves electrically. But this electrical energy is controlled and harnessed by humans; there is a switch for it, also. If people do not want any electric light, they just switch it off, and there is no light. The manifestation or unmanifestation of electrical energy depends on the human will. The shakti [energy, power] of Prakrti is that of Purus&#x301;a &ndash; Shaktih Sa&#x301; Shivasya Shaktih. So without the permission of the Supreme Purus&#x301;a, the universe could not have been evolved. Prakrti is the secondary [efficient cause], Purus&#x301;a is the chief [efficient cause].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; [synonymous with purus&#x301;a in the shloka]. Is the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; [unit a&#x301;tman, unit consciousness] then the causal factor of this Srs&#x301;t&#x301;icakra [Cycle of Creation]? Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya philosophy says that in the universe there are many jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;s and one Prakrti. But we know that a jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301; has no independent entity of its own. It is upahata [affected] by, and vulnerable to, pleasure and pain, though it does not take part in action. A mirror has no colour, but it becomes red if a red flower is placed before it. That is why the a&#x301;tma&#x301; of a pa&#x301;pii [sinner] is called pa&#x301;popahata&#x301;tma&#x301; [a&#x301;tman affected by sin] and that of a pun&#x301;yava&#x301;n [virtuous person], pun&#x301;yopahata&#x301;tma&#x301; [a&#x301;tman affected by virtue]. Both pa&#x301;pa&#x301;tma&#x301; [sinful a&#x301;tman] and pun&#x301;ya&#x301;tma&#x301; [virtuous a&#x301;tman] are wrong terms. When a football match is being played in some field, keen competition exists between the two groups. The spectators too betray their mental agitation regarding the defeat or victory of a particular side. Similarly with the jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;. The a&#x301;tman which is involved with the mind<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> [is] an entity vulnerable to vice and virtue, and can never be the causal factor of the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->[Sam&#x301;yoga, &ldquo;combination&rdquo;.] Two imperfect entities together cannot create an infinite entity, either. So [no combination of] time, nature, fate, accident[, and jiiva&#x301;tma&#x301;] collectively can create a Supreme Entity. None of these entities is the subtlest entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The citta [ectoplasm, mind-stuff] is responsive to material waves. When the movement of the [citta is pro-noumenal, the citta merges in the spiritual sphere. When the movement is pro-phenomenal], the sense of the material waves wakes up in the citta. We then call it bodha [perception]. But when the psychic pro-[noumenal] wave is reflected on the a&#x301;tma&#x301;, it is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The reflecting plate is more important than the reflected one. So among all these factors, the subtlest and final plate [within the unit] is the a&#x301;tma&#x301; [unit cognition]. But though it is very subtle, it is shelterless, so it always needs a vast shelter. The unit cognitive force is in search of that vast shelter, which is the Supreme Cognition. This Supreme Cognition is the noumenal cause or the Causal Matrix. The Vedas say,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Yato va&#x301; ima&#x301;ni bhu&#x301;ta&#x301;ni ja&#x301;yante yena ja&#x301;ta&#x301;ni jiivanti;<br>Yat prayantyabhisam&#x301;vishanti tad vijijin&#x32D;a&#x301;sasva tad Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..21"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->[All created beings emerge from, are maintained in, and finally dissolve in, the Supreme Entity. You should desire to know that supreme stance as Brahma.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->So this Supreme Cognition, and no second entity, is your dhyeya [object of meditation].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->A question arises: &ldquo;Have all the above &ndash; time, nature, etc. &ndash; no value at all?&rdquo; But the answer is, yes, they certainly have.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Cognition is called Parashiva in the scriptures. The movement towards Parashiva is called para&#x301;gati, or introversive movement. For this movement all the aforesaid relative factors &ndash; time, nature, fate, accident, and matter &ndash; are certainly needed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Time, as has already been said, is purely a relative factor. But time should not be neglected, as neglect of the time factor produces many undesirable consequences. A child of five, for instance, thinks that he or she will start sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; at the age of twenty-four. When he or she becomes a young person of twenty-four, the person thinks that he or she will start sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; at the age of forty-five. And  at the age of forty-five the person decides to start it ten years later. Thus  time is wasted, and at the end of the person&#146;s life the person realizes his or her mistake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The study of nature is no less important, when you come to serve the world. When you attend on a patient, if you are aware of the svabha&#x301;va, or nature, of the disease, treatment becomes easy. If you know the nature of your friend and foe, you will know better how to deal with them individually.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->And fate serves as an eye-opener. When a person does an act, the person forgets that one day he or she will have to serve the reaction to that action. So when people suffer, they should understand that they are being punished for their past misdeeds. This will help the person to be serene [about the punishment] and alert about the consequences of any [future] evil act.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;Accident&rdquo; is a misnomer. No effect can take place without a cause. When a person receives an opportunity to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, it is to be understood that the person is being allowed today to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; due to the good and virtuous deeds he or she performed in various past lives. The opportunity is the effect of the factors that lie behind it. So the present should be properly utilized for the future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->And finally, our bodies have come from this material world, so we must not neglect matter. Since matter too is a manifestation of God, we should behave properly with it; otherwise living will be impossible, and so will sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->So we see that humans are benefited by these things, but this does not mean that they are the only aim of human beings. The summum bonum of human life is to attain Parashiva. To attain that Supreme Entity you will have to adjust with these ingredients.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Shakti helps in such adjustments. You cannot [ignore] Prakrti. A sa&#x301;dhaka of Shivatva or Cosmic Consciousness does not disregard Shakti. One who is a Shaeva in the world of thought is indeed a Sha&#x301;kta on the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. (And, since Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u means &ldquo;All-Pervading Entity&rdquo;, one who sees the All-Pervading Entity in every object of this practical world is indeed a Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava.)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> There is no question of quarrelling among Shaivite, Sha&#x301;kta and Vaishnavite.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Shakti is not the dhyeya. Shakti is earned through the thought of Shiva, but Shiva is not attainable through the thought of Shakti. Shaktih Sa&#x301; Shivasya Shaktih &ndash; &ldquo;Shakti abides in Shiva.&rdquo; Shakti is always being converted into Shiva. In reference to the ways of Shiva and Shakti, the Vedas say, Sa nityanivrtta&#x301; [&ldquo;She is ever-waning&rdquo;]. After a limitless time [according to the Vedas] all the shaktis will be transformed into Shiva, and then alone will the universe come to its end.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->There is [only a philosophical] difference between Shiva and Shakti. Let no one say that they could not worship Shiva for want of Shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->People may think, &ldquo;Will Shiva be kind to us? Will He not be angry since our past is full of ills and depravities?&rdquo; To Him there is no difference between sinners and the virtuous. On the contrary, a virtuous person may harbour vanity. The person may think, &ldquo;I have never done anything wrong.&rdquo; But a sinner is a helpless person. He or she has nothing to his credit. He or she is absolutely shelterless. So Shiva extends His arms first to the sinners. Giving help and shelter to the helpless and shelterless is indeed the mark of real greatness, of the really great. If Shiva failed to give shelter to the sinners, we might infer that hatred abided even in Parama&#x301;tman, and that He distinguished between a sinner and a virtuous person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->What does a mother do? If one of her two sons is strong and the other weak, she takes more care of the weak child. Similarly Shiva showers His blessings more upon the helpless.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->There is no need of flowers, etc., in the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of Shiva. To progress towards Paramashiva, love is necessary. Verbal enthusiasm alone will be of no use.<!-- /block --></p>

Here the Supreme Self says that if even a sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra does bhajana &ndash; &ldquo;ideates on Me&rdquo; &ndash; ananyabha&#x301;va [or ananyabha&#x301;k &ndash; &ldquo;with single-minded devotion&rdquo;] &ndash; then what will happen? So&#146;pi pa&#x301;pavinirmuktah &ndash; that is, &ldquo;even that sinner, that sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra, will be freed from all the bondages of sin.&rdquo; That is, &ldquo;I free him from all the bondages of pa&#x301;pa [sin],&rdquo; and mucyate bhava bandhana&#x301;t.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Mucyate Bhava Bandhana&#x301;t<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->What is pa&#x301;pa? What is the bandhana of pa&#x301;pa? You know, there are two main varieties of pa&#x301;pa. One is pa&#x301;pa itself, and the other is pratyava&#x301;ya. In the code of morality, there are several dos and don&#146;ts. &ldquo;Do this&rdquo; &ndash; these are dos. &ldquo;Don&#146;t do this&rdquo; &ndash; these are don&#146;ts. Dos are called vidhi in Sanskrit, and don&#146;ts are called nis&#x301;edha in Sanskrit. If one does not adhere to the code of dos, one commits pratyava&#x301;ya, and if one does not adhere to the code of don&#146;ts, one commits pa&#x301;pa. &ldquo;Don&#146;t steal&rdquo; is a don&#146;t, so if one steals, one commits pa&#x301;pa.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now within this pa&#x301;pa there are three varieties. One is pa&#x301;taka. The sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii; the sinner of the worst category is a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii. But pa&#x301;taka means simply disobeying the code of morality. Suppose one forcibly takes ten rupees from a particular man. The one who takes it commits pa&#x301;pa. But if that person pays back that amount, and that particular man from whom the ten rupees were stolen excuses the thief, then that pa&#x301;pa committed by the thief is neutralized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->But atipa&#x301;taka cannot be neutralized; there is no atonement for that kind of pa&#x301;taka. Suppose a man cuts off the hand of an innocent person: he cannot give back that particular hand; that is, in such a case the pa&#x301;pa is unatonable. Here you say that he has committed [atipa&#x301;taka]. And maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka &ndash; maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka is a kind of atipa&#x301;taka, but its result is of recurring nature. Suppose a bad man, a corrupt businessman, discovers a particular method of adulteration. For example, he discovers the method of using papaya seeds in the [black pepper]. Here he starts a particular pa&#x301;taka, and this pa&#x301;taka will be of recurring nature, because other businessmen will learn it from him; so its effect will be of recurring nature. This particular nature of pa&#x301;taka is called maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->So pa&#x301;taka is atonable, but atipa&#x301;taka is not atonable; and maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka, you know, is the worst type of [ati]pa&#x301;taka. If one wants to atone for maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka, one will have to sacrifice one&#146;s life for the cause of the entire universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->But here the Lord says, &ldquo;If that sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra&rdquo; &ndash; that is, that maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii &ndash; &ldquo;ideates on Me, then I will help that person, I will free that person from the bondages of pa&#x301;pa.&rdquo;  And mucyate bhava bandhana&#x301;t &ndash; that is, &ldquo;that person becomes free from bhava.&rdquo; What is bhava? Bhava means &ldquo;reactive momentum&rdquo;, as the factor [of unserved sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras] causing rebirth. &ldquo;The sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra even becomes freed from bhava&rdquo; &ndash; that is, he or she attains the supreme state. &ldquo;He or she becomes one with Me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

When the Cosmic Entity within Its mind creates this pillow within It as an external material entity, we think it is actually a pillow, but for the [Macrocosm] it is His mental creation. You can create something in your mind; in your mind you can create an elephant; for you that elephant is a mental entity. But if in your mind you create a mahout for that elephant, then for your mental mahout, your mental elephant is not something mental. It is something concrete, something physical. So the elephants we see in this world are for Him mental entities, but for us, external physical entities. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->So this is His process of conation. Now, from this quinquelemental world come the microcosms, and after their creation, these microcosms are to live within the Macrocosm, within the mind of the Supreme Self. They cannot function, they cannot remain, without the mind of the Macrocosm, so they will have to remain within it, and they will have to move within it.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..6"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->This microcosm, or these microcosms, are moving within the scope of the Macrocosm and around the nucleus of this Macrocosm. The mind of this Macrocosm is so vast, but there is a controlling point within His mind, and that point is the hub of His mind, is the nave of His mind, is the nucleus of His mind. This Cosmological nucleus, the nucleus of this Cosmological order, is called Purus&#x301;ottama in Sanskrit, and these created microcosms are moving around this Purus&#x301;ottama with their own peculiar radii. Each and every microcosm has its own radius. And that is why no two microcosms are the same. The microcosm of Mr. X and the microcosm of Mr. Y are not the same, because both of them are moving around this Cosmological Hub, but they have got their own radius. And because of the difference in their radii, they are different.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Now you know, wherever there is any existence, there is a particular system in it. Everybody, every entity, will have to obey a particular system, and this system is its property, is its dharma, is its wont. And we can feel or understand a particular entity according to its dharma, or property, according to its peculiar radius. Why does water have its drenching property? Because of its peculiar radius. Why does fire have its burning property? Because of its peculiar radius.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now, there is system everywhere, in each and every entity. And if by artificial process, if by scientific process, we can change the radius, we can change the curvature, then a particular element will be converted into another element. By such artificial process we can change gold into mercury, we can transform platinum into radium; everything is possible by changing the radius and by changing the wavelength. And wherever there is any such system, that is, an entity moving around a nucleus, you know two forces are functioning there &ndash; one is centripetal and the other is centrifugal. Even in the smallest atomic system, around that nucleus electrons are moving. And when the electrons are moving, certainly these two forces are functioning there, the centripetal force and the centrifugal force: the centre-seeking force &ndash; the concentric force &ndash; and the eccentric force. And you know in our ethereal system also, this earth is the nucleus, and the moon is moving around this earth. There also these two forces are functioning. In a bigger system, in our solar system, the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving around the sun. There also these two forces are functioning; and each and every planet has its own radius.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, the biggest system is our Cosmological system, the Cosmological order. The campus of this Cosmological order is the expressed universe, or Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, and the nucleus of this Cosmological order is Purus&#x301;ottama. So each and every microcosm is moving around this Purus&#x301;ottama with its own radius.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now here also, in the case of the Cosmological Hub and microcosms moving around this Cosmological Hub, these two forces are functioning, kendra&#x301;tiga&#x301; and kendra&#x301;nuga&#x301;, eccentric and concentric. In the case of this Cosmological order, the centripetal force is called vidya&#x301; shakti, and the other force is called avidya&#x301; shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->What is vidya&#x301; and what is avidya&#x301;? There is a fight between sentient and static; and when as a result of this fight between sentient and static, the resultant goes in favour of the sentient, we say it is the resultant sentient principle, we say it is vidya&#x301; shakti. And when as a result of this fight the resultant goes in favour of the static principle, we say it is avidya&#x301; shakti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Now you know, these two shaktis, that is vidya&#x301; shakti and avidya&#x301; shakti, have their own effect on the human mind, on the microcosm, and when a microcosm is influenced by avidya&#x301; shakti, it always tries to go away from the Hub, and tries to keep itself covert so that the Cosmological Hub may not be able to see it. Purus&#x301;ottama is seeing everything, witnessing everything; but when a person is propelled by the force of avidya&#x301;, that microcosm tries to go away from the Hub, that is, increase its radius, and tries to keep itself covert, concealed, hidden from the Cosmological Hub. It thinks, &ldquo;When I am doing this thing, perhaps the Cosmological Hub, Purus&#x301;ottama, is not seeing me, is not able to see me.&rdquo; This sort of idea is guided by this sort of thinking. Now, the first idea, that is, to fly away, to move away, from the Hub, is called viks&#x301;epa shakti. And to try to hide oneself from that Supreme &ldquo;I&rdquo; [perhaps meaning also &ldquo;Supreme Eye&rdquo;] is called a&#x301;varan&#x301;ii shakti. Avaran&#x301;a means &ldquo;to cover&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And similarly, when the human mind is influenced by vidya&#x301; shakti, what happens? All of a sudden it feels that &ldquo;I should do something. I have a human structure. I am a human being. I should do something. I should act like a human being. I should try to goad myself to the realm of divinity, it is my dharma. I should follow dharma, I should strictly adhere to the code of dharma.&rdquo; This idea is a gift of vidya&#x301; shakti, and this particular expression of vidya&#x301; shakti is called sam&#x301;vit shakti. Conscience, when it is roused all of a sudden, is called sam&#x301;vit. &ldquo;I should do something, I should do something.&rdquo; As soon as it comes in contact with sam&#x301;vit shakti, in the next moment you feel, &ldquo;I should do something practical. Theory won&#146;t help me; I should do something concrete, I should do something practical.&rdquo; And when this desire to do something practical is created in the mind, this created force is called hla&#x301;dinii shakti or Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti. With the help of this Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti one can move towards that Cosmological Nave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The Cosmological Nave is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, because He attracts everything. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;the supreme charmer&rdquo;, &ldquo;the supreme attracter&rdquo;, who attracts everybody towards Him with the help of His &ndash; what? His supreme flute. That supreme flute is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. He creates universal acoustic waves, and those waves bring people towards Him; that is why He is called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. And microcosms come in contact with Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a with the help of that particular expression of sentient vidya&#x301; shakti which is known as Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti. And when with the help of Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti the microcosm comes in contact with the nave Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Purus&#x301;ottama, then we say it is the union of Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a and Ra&#x301;dha&#x301;. (Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is not a male being of Vrindavan, and Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; is not a lady. You should understand it properly.) Now, this Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti is the cogitative faculty, the subject matter of today&#146;s discourse; it is the cogitative faculty, and it is the divine force, and it is the devotional principle, it is devotion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now, one may say, &ldquo;I understand everything, and I feel that devotion is something heavenly, is a heavenly entity &ndash; but how can I get it?&rdquo; Now, human expressions, human entities (and not only human entities, all entities) are moving from imperfection towards perfection. This never-ending endeavour to move from imperfection towards perfection, from limitation towards the Unlimited Entity, this supreme mysticity, is life. It is a never-ending process, a never-ending march. And that is why it has been said, a life is a constant effort to restore an unstable equilibrium.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now in this march of life &ndash; and particularly in human life &ndash; there are three kinds of expression; and those three expressions, or those three factors, are jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, karma and bhakti. Bhakti is the supreme one. And how to acquire bhakti, how to get bhakti? The simple formula is, karma minus jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is equal to bhakti. Suppose there is a Mr. X. Mr. X has no jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, he is illiterate; but he has rendered two hundred degrees of service, selfless service, to society. So in his stock of karma there is two hundred; and jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is zero, nil; two hundred minus zero is equal to two hundred &ndash; he acquires two hundred degrees of bhakti. And suppose that Mr. P.K. Nair is a learned man, MA in ten subjects; and he has five hundred degrees of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. In order for him to acquire two hundred degrees of bhakti, he will have to acquire &ndash; five hundred plus two hundred &ndash; seven hundred degrees of karma. He will have to render so much selfless karma, selfless service, to the society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->An illiterate fellow acquires two hundred degrees of bhakti by rendering two hundred degrees of karma. But that learned man has to render seven hundred degrees of karma in order to acquire two hundred degrees of bhakti. So in his case, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is nothing but a liability. A liability! And that is why you will sometimes see people who are illiterate, [completely] illiterate, but who have developed bhakti easily.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->So the formula is, karma minus jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is equal to bhakti. You must remember it. Now, this bhakti is Ra&#x301;dhika&#x301; shakti, this bhakti is the cogitative faculty. In the Vedas it has been said, Na&#x301;yama&#x301;tma&#x301; pravacanena labhyah &ndash; &ldquo;You cannot get that Supreme Entity by tall talk.&rdquo; Na medhaya&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;Not by your intellect.&rdquo; Na bahuna&#x301; shrutena &ndash; &ldquo;Nor by reading or going through so many books or lectures.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Today a spiritual aspirant asked me regarding the process of mental concentration. His question was, how to concentrate on that Supreme Tangential Point? The reply should be known to all intuitional aspirants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->According to the standard of intellect, microcosms come within three broad categories. They are brute mind, human mind, and divine mind. Intuitional practice is a practice of transmutation of brute mind into human mind and human mind into divine mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In our human society we find microcosms of all these three varieties; that is, in our society there are brute microcosms in human structure &ndash; animals in human structure, animals in human framework; there is man in human framework; and there is God in human framework. And in our social life, all the problems are created by brutes in human structure; and those problems are experienced by men in human structure; and those problems are solved by gods in human structure. So a spiritual aspirant is to solve the problems of the society, he is not to create fresh problems.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is for all, intuitional practice is for all. You know, there are brutes in human structure, and there are brutes in animal structure; but the fundamental difference between these two brutes is that a brute in animal structure does not know that it is a brute in animal structure, but a brute in human structure does know that he or she is a brute in human structure. He or she should do something noble.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->And the process of concentration is in the first phase physico-psychic, and in the second phase psycho-spiritual. A person has a physical body, a mind, and a spirit; so in the first phase the intuitional practice should be physico-psychic, starting from the arena of physicality and culminating in the common point of physicality and mentality. That is, the approach is physico-psychic. And in the next phase the approach will be psycho-spiritual, starting from the psychic realm and ending in the realm of spirituality.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The human mind is moving towards so many propensities; there are so many propensities in the human mind; and according to the complexity in the mind, the physical body also becomes more and more complex. The physical structure of an animal is less complex than that of a human being, because the human mind is also more complex than that of the animal. The number of glands in a human body is more than that in an animal structure, in an animal body. Now the first phase of the process is physico-psychic &ndash; that is, withdrawing the mind from different physical objects and bringing it to a particular point, and directing that point towards the realm of mind. And next is a phase of withdrawing the mind from different mental objects, from different mental pabula, and directing it towards the Supreme Subjectivity. Now this process of movement is the process of concentration.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Concentration is a major sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, is a major intuitional sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But there are certain helping sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;s. A&#x301;sana and pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, for example, are helping items. They are not sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, they are called sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;un&#x32D;ga. Now if, during this process of movement, this phase of movement, the mind becomes heavy, it will not be able to move forward. Suppose you are crossing a river. If the boat becomes heavy due to water percolation, what will happen? You will not be able to cross the river. You will have to arrange to pump the water out.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So what is this process of pumping out the water in the case of the human mind? It means freeing the mind from mundane impurities. And how to free the mind from mundane impurities? By rendering selfless service to society without any restriction of caste, creed, nationality, or sex. Similarly on the mental level, the pure mental level, we have to free the mind from propensive ideas. That is, in the first phase there should be physico-psychic karma, and in the second phase there should be psycho-spiritual karma. One will have to render social service if one wants salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, to establish oneself in this realm of karma, what are the essential factors for success? Lord Shiva, when asked by Pa&#x301;rvatii, said, &ldquo;You know, Devii, there are seven essential factors for success in physico-psychic karma or in psycho-spiritual karma, whatever it may be. But there are seven essential factors, you must remember those seven factors.&rdquo; What are those factors?<!-- /block --></p>

You know, there is no corresponding word for shraddha&#x301; in English or Latin. Shraddha&#x301; means Shrat Satyam&#x301; tasmin dhiiyate iti shraddha&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;My objective &ndash; &rdquo; What is the objective? The Supreme Subjectivity here becomes the objective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Self, the Transcendental Entity, is the subjectivity of all subjectivities, hence it is the Supreme Subjectivity; but here, in the case of psycho-spiritual practice, that Supreme Subjectivity becomes the object. So one should develop shraddha&#x301; for this Supreme Subjectivity, that is, for one object. And what is shraddha&#x301;? Shrat Satyam&#x301; &ndash; accepting that goal as Absolute Truth. (Shrat means Satyam&#x301;.) Tasmin dhiiyate &ndash; that is, &ldquo;Withdrawing the mind from all other objects, and guiding that mind unto that object which has been accepted as the Absolute Truth, is shraddha&#x301;.&rdquo; It has no corresponding term in English or Latin, or in any other language. The Sanskrit is the term. Dvitiiyam&#x301; shraddhaya&#x301; yuktam&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;one must develop shraddha&#x301; for the object.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

He is an Ezhava &ndash; he is inferior to me.&rdquo; This idea is dangerous. If one encourages this idea, one will not be able to attain that supreme beatitude.

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know that Tantra is a spiritual cult. It is a cult because Tantra clearly explains how to do a sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of a particular type and stage, and what the achievement will be from each such sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. All possible details have been worked out. It is a systematic practical science. It is vaevaha&#x301;rika [practical] &ndash; not bookish. Tantra is dharma, and &ndash; since A&#x301;ca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t dharmah [&ldquo;Dharma is the assemblage of all your conduct&rdquo;] &ndash; one has to do Tantra practically in one&#146;s individual life. But the practical side of Tantra is very abstract and subtle. One has to be very careful indeed in practising it. So that sa&#x301;dhakas might know and understand the practical side clearly, Pa&#x301;rvatii posed questions to Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva answered them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The questions of Pa&#x301;rvatii were for the sake of lokashiks&#x301;a&#x301; [education of the people]. Those questions which are only for the sake of questioning or for the sake of measuring the knowledge of the other person have no value on the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; ma&#x301;rga [path of spiritual practice]. They are a sheer waste of time. When the questions asked are intended for the purpose of knowing and then doing, the questions are termed pariprashnas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What to do; how to do; why to do &ndash; these are pariprashnas. Such pariprashnas make up the nigama sha&#x301;stra. Such pariprashnas constitute the philosophical, theoretical, side. And the practical side, constituted by the answers of Sada&#x301;shiva, is the a&#x301;gama sha&#x301;stra. In other words, the pariprashnas of Pa&#x301;rvatii go to make up the nigama sha&#x301;stra, and the practical answers of Sada&#x301;shiva make up the a&#x301;gama sha&#x301;stra. Nigama and a&#x301;gama together make up the Tantra sha&#x301;stra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->One of the questions posed by Pa&#x301;rvatii was, &ldquo;What is to be done to get self-realization?&rdquo; She had posed this question for the sake of lokashiks&#x301;a&#x301; &ndash; so that sa&#x301;dhakas might be highly benefited. Actually, the intellect in those days had not developed to the point that there were people who could pose such subtle questions about sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But as the subtle truths of the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; had to be handed over to people, Hara [Shiva] and Pa&#x301;rvatii had decided to enter into a dialogue of the type compiled in the nigamas and a&#x301;gamas. Pa&#x301;rvatii posed questions, and Shiva answered them.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So the question of Pa&#x301;rvatii was, &ldquo;What is to be done for self-realization?

<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Questions related to spiritual practice and spiritual progress &ndash; questions not simply for inquiry&#146;s sake but for the sake of understanding and for the sake of following the instructions given &ndash; are known as pariprashnas (for example, questions put by disciples to their gurus as to how to sit, how to bid pran&#x301;a&#x301;ma [respectful salutations], and how to repeat mantra). Pran&#x301;ipa&#x301;tena pariprashnena seva&#x301;ya&#x301; [&ldquo;By surrender, spiritual questioning, and servicefulness&rdquo;]. Questions put only for logic&#146;s sake are not pariprashnas; with such questions the time of the questioner and that of the answerer is wasted. And sometimes questions are put not in order to know but in order to test the scholarship of the guru &ndash; such questions are not pariprashnas either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->If pariprashnas are put and answered, and then recorded, or if people somehow get acquainted with such questions and answers, people will be benefited. But during the time of Sada&#x301;shiva nobody was there to put such questions. Pa&#x301;rvatii learned sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; from Shiva (as did their son Bhaerava). Pa&#x301;rvatii and Shiva decided that the former would pose the questions, and the latter would reply, and thus people would get acquainted with the questions and answers and be benefited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->They decided to formulate these questions and answers for the all-round development of human society. They decided to cover all branches of knowledge &ndash; art, architecture, literature, medical science, spiritual science, etc. For example, you know that in ancient times there was [a simple form of] giita [song]. There was also [va&#x301;dya, basic instrumental music]. And people were performing some mudra&#x301;s unconsciously with their hands and feet. So Lord Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii decided to coordinate and systematize giita, [va&#x301;dya] and mudra&#x301;. Pa&#x301;rvatii began to pose questions, and Shiva began to answer; and the sam&#x301;giita sha&#x301;stra [science of music] was produced. (The combined name of nrtya [dance], giita and va&#x301;dya is sam&#x301;giita.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Dance was known in quite a primitive age. This kind of dance was rhythmic. Even now the dances of soldiers are mainly rhythmic. There is no important role of mudra&#x301; in their dance. The rule is that rhythmic dance requires strength; only males can do it; because it is tiring. But Pa&#x301;rvatii gave lalita nrtya, in which mudra&#x301; has an important role. Indian dances and other Oriental dances are mudra&#x301;pradha&#x301;na [dominated by mudra&#x301;]. And Occidental dances are chandapradha&#x301;na [rhythmic].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->They decided to categorize mudra&#x301;. So Pa&#x301;rvatii questioned and Shiva answered. Pa&#x301;rvatii would ask, &ldquo;What is the meaning of such and such mudra&#x301;?&rdquo; and Shiva would reply. In this way mudra&#x301; sha&#x301;stra came about, sam&#x301;giita sha&#x301;stra came about. Shiva invented a rhythmic dance and Pa&#x301;rvatii created a dance dominated by mudra&#x301;. In Shiva&#146;s rhythmic dance one has to jump. In Sanskrit tan&#x301;d&#x301;u&#x301; means &ldquo;to jump&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So the dance dominated by jumping is known as ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava. The dance of Shiva is ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava &ndash; &ldquo;dominated by jumping&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Mudra&#x301; directly touches the mind. For instance, if one calls to a person, as soon as the sound vibrations of &ldquo;Come&rdquo; touch the person&#146;s ears, they directly reach the mind. But the person can be made to understand through mudra&#x301;s [gestures of the fingers] also. Similar are the cases of expressing that one feels hot and sweaty, that one feels thirsty, etc., without speaking, through different physical gestures. Hence, mudra&#x301; has sha&#x301;nta bha&#x301;va [it is peaceful, calm]. It is just the opposite of ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava, and that is why it is known as lalita [graceful].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->When people were being taught ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava and lalita, they found difficulty with both. With ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava they found difficulty in jumping, and with lalita they felt troubled in expressing the correct bha&#x301;va [ideation] through mudra&#x301;. Therefore they requested Lord Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii to bring about a balance between the two. Pa&#x301;rvatii posed some questions, Shiva replied, and a balance was brought about for the good of the people. The new [beat or rhythmic expression] thus produced was called ta&#x301;la &ndash; ta&#x301; from ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava and la from lalita.<!-- /block --></p>

Therefore, that Pa&#x301;rvatii got the opportunity to ask spiritual questions and to listen to the answers, and that Shiva could make her understand, was a very rare thing. The questions of Pa&#x301;rvatii, together with Shiva&#146;s practical answers, can be called &ldquo;philosophico-spiritual cult&rdquo;. This means the combination of all philosophy, pariprashna, and spiritual practice, along with Shiva&#146;s practical answers.

Animals and inanimate objects are at a lower standard. At this lower standard, the spirit is personal [or individual] and the medium impersonal [or Cosmic]. Animals and inanimate objects progress due to an impersonal medium. Therefore they can only progress &ndash; they cannot have a downfall. But if a human, with a particular intellectual standard, makes good use of that intellect, he or she will have progress, whereas if he or she abuses that intellect, he or she will have a downfall. So a human has intellect, but the intellect is double-edged. Therefore one must be very careful in making use of one&#146;s intellect.<!-- /block --></p>

Once Pa&#x301;rvatii posed a question to Shiva. (Actually she asked it not for herself, but just to make people understand the desideratum of human life.) The question asked was, &ldquo;What should be the object of worship for those who are doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;?&rdquo; Humans create the objects of their worship according to their own intellectual standards. Primitive humans worshipped plants, trees, earth, rivers, etc. It is not logical to think that one can acquire pun&#x301;ya [virtue] by immersing oneself in the Ganges, but cannot acquire it by immersing oneself in the Thames. If pun&#x301;ya can be acquired by immersion, it can be by immersion either in the Ganges or in the Thames. And can there be no pun&#x301;ya from taking a dip in the Yamuna, which originates, like the Ganges, in the Himalayas, and runs side by side with the Ganges? There are some who worship stone: they make idols out of stone, according to their imaginations, and they worship them. How can an idol give you salvation &ndash; an idol made by you? You have shaped the idol with different chisels and hammers; you are its father, its creator; so how can it give you salvation? It is all unscientific.<!-- /block --></p>

Secondly, idol worship is more harmful than the worship of flora and fauna; because the flora and fauna have been created and shaped by the Operative Principle, and not by human beings. Plants and trees are in a process of growth. But the idol has been created and shaped by you, by your chisel and hammer &ndash; how can it give you salvation?&rdquo; Pa&#x301;rvatii then said, &ldquo;[Is] idol worship, too, sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

True, both cap and shoes are Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, but each of them has its proper use. The proper use of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; in the form of shoes is on the feet.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

You must have reverence for the Ganges, as the land in north India has been made fertile by its waters.

<a name="8..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Japastuti [mantra repetition and flattery] is adhama&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. There is no real love for Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;; it is simply flattery. Worshippers address Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; and say, &ldquo;O Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, give us food to eat and clothes to wear.&rdquo; You will find such things said in some places. This is flattery. Stuti means &ldquo;flattery&rdquo;. Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is the Supreme Father; will you flatter the Supreme Father?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Suppose a student is studying for his MA, and during the holidays he has come home.

<a name="8..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->If he utters such things, the father will say that the son has gone vagabond, and will catch hold of him and give him a good beating. Just think for yourself how unnatural this would be. Flatter you may your boss, but not your father! Hence japastuti is adhama&#x301; sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Japa [mantra repetition] here really means nirbiija japa. Sabiija japa is a different thing; it comes within the scope of dhya&#x301;na [meditation]. This I will explain later. (It is connected with sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, so it is not proper to discuss it openly.) If you repeat &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo; &ndash; a parrot can also do that! Can that bring about any spiritual progress? Never &ndash; because there is no ideation on the meaning. It is mantra devoid of caetanya.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> So one has to ideate.

Then, &ldquo;The day after tomorrow there is DMC. I have to attend it in Delhi.&rdquo; Finally the person again repeats &ldquo;Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. What is this?

Dhya&#x301;na is madhyama&#x301; because there is duality between the sa&#x301;dhaka and the object of his or her worship. And the supreme state, the uttama&#x301;vastha&#x301;, is that where the sa&#x301;dhaka and the object of worship are one &ndash; where the worshipper, the worshipped and the worship unify themselves into one. Therefore, sahaja&#x301;vastha&#x301; is supreme &ndash; it is uttama&#x301;. This is the saying of Shiva. Kabir has also said, Sa&#x301;dhu sahaja sama&#x301;dhi bhalii [&ldquo;The seeker attained sahaja sama&#x301;dhi&rdquo;]. Sahaja is derived from the prefix saha plus the root jan plus the suffix d&#x301;a. Ja means &ldquo;that which is born&rdquo;. With what is it born?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Now regarding this sahaja&#x301;vastha&#x301;, there is nothing to be had from without &ndash; everything can be had from within.

Those who roam about looking for Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; outside themselves, and make [ritual] offerings of water to Him &ndash; all of these people are roaming outside instead of looking inside.

If this feeling creeps into the mind, samata&#x301;bha&#x301;va is lost, because then one begins feeling that there is a group of people far inferior to oneself. Such a pattern is to be observed in the case of people who have come to the city from the village. They say that they don&#146;t feel like returning to the village, as the villagers are illiterate and under-developed. This feeling is very dangerous. And if such feelings creep into the mind as a result of having acquired a little intellectual knowledge, the chances of developing this complex are much greater in the realm of spirituality, when a sa&#x301;dhaka begins feeling somewhat elevated with the development of some occult powers and the feeling of a little bliss.

Irreverent concentration will eventually become reverent concentration.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="8.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.8.fn6">6</a></b>)  That which is known as anna (ad + kta) in the Sanskrit language is called pin&#x301;a in the Vedic language. I remember having mentioned before that in ancient times, when the Aryans from Russia came to India, they started cultivation. The border country of Bha&#x301;rata [India] was called Saptanada Desha [Land of Seven Rivers], which later on came to be known as the Punjab. (Those seven rivers were the Jhelam, the Chenub, the Satluj, the Ravi, the Beas, the Kabul and the Sindhu.) The people of that place used to sit together at noon to have their meal &ndash; that is, in the Vedic language, to have their pin&#x301;d&#x301;a. So a place where the farmers would have their meal was called pin&#x301;iika. That pin&#x301;d&#x301;iika in Paesha&#x301;cii Pra&#x301;krta became pin&#x301;d&#x301;ii-a, and this in old Punjabi became changed to pin&#x301;ae, or pin&#x301;d&#x301;ii. In the Punjabi language, pindi means &ldquo;village&rdquo; &ndash; for instance, &ldquo;Rawalpindi&rdquo;, &ldquo;the habitation of the Rawals&rdquo;.</p>

<a name="13..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Virtue and vice are temporal entities. These things have nothing to do so far as a person&#146;s relationship with the Supreme Father is concerned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Suppose several boys are moving along a particular road and one particular boy falls into the drain. His dress, his body, become dirty; other people, passers-by, will laugh at him, but when the boy&#146;s father sees his boy in that condition, what is he to do? Will he laugh at his own son? No, no, no. What will he do? He himself will go there, into the drain, and take his boy in his own lap, and clean his dress, clean his clothes, clean his body; and after that he will say, &ldquo;My boy, you should walk carefully.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Sinning persons are just like those boys in the drain. Now, high or low, upgraded or degraded, all are equal, all are equal for Him, because heaven is His creation, and hell is His creation. If we say that He is only in heaven, it will not be a correct utterance, because He is in hell also. His sons, His daughters, are never alone. He is with you even in hell.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What are you to do? You are always to remember that you are the child of a Great Father. You must not think that you are a sinner, you are a degraded person. If you think that you are a sinner, it means you are meditating on sin! And when sin has become your object of meditation, actually you will become a sinner, because a person becomes just like his or her object of ideation, object of meditation. If you always meditate on sin, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner,&rdquo; actually you will become a sinner. The psychological approach is, you should forget it &ndash; even if you are actually a sinner, you should think, &ldquo;I am the son of a Great Father, I am the son of a Great Father, I am the son of a Great Father.&rdquo; And thus you are meditating on the Great Father, and a day is sure to come when you will become one with your Great Father. But to think, &ldquo;I am a sinner, I am a sinner, oh Father, save me, oh Father, save me,&rdquo; is a defective approach! You should say, &ldquo;I am your son, I am your daughter, oh Father, take me on your lap, I am your son, I am your daughter.&rdquo; This will be the approach. You should forget what you do not want.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now in the phase of creation, the first point of creation is called Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga. Liun&#x32D;ga means &ldquo;the point, the supreme point, the terminus of all expressions, all movements&rdquo;. And that terminus is a singular entity. In the phase of extrovert, it is the starting-point, and in the phase of introvert, it is the culminating point. It is the Supreme Desideratum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->At this starting-point, wherefrom the first expression takes place in the first phase of creation, what happens? In that triangle of forces, triangle of principles, sentient, mutative and static, what happens due to their intertransmutation? All of a sudden the triangle becomes unbalanced, and the released resultant force comes out from one of the vertices of the triangle. There are three vertices, and it comes out from one of the vertices. And the point from which this extroversial force comes out is called Shambhu&#x301;. In the phase of extrovert, in the phase of creation, it is Shambhu&#x301;; and in the phase of introvert also it is Shambhu&#x301;. In the phase of creation it is the starting point, it is the fundamental positivity. It is the fundamental positivity because in it lies the seed of all creation. And in the phase of introvert, it is the Supreme Desideratum, because here in this point all the aspirations, all the hopes, all the desires, of all living beings terminate.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Similarly, in the unit structure, in each and every unit structure, there is a starting-point, a microscopic expression of Shambhu&#x301; in the entire Macrocosm. That is, in the entire Cosmological order there is a Shambhu&#x301; point, the starting-point, and similarly, in the unit expression, in the microcosm, there is Shambhu&#x301; in miniature form, in microcosmic form, controlling the microcosm. And it is this point [crown of the head], the controlling point of the pineal gland. It is the site of Parama Purus&#x301;a, Paramashiva. And in the phase of creation, while Shambhu&#x301; is the starting-point, the last point of creation, the crudest point, is called Svayambhu&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Shambhu&#x301; and Svayambhu&#x301;. In Sanskrit, sham means &ldquo;to control&rdquo;, and bhu&#x301; means [&ldquo;created&rdquo;]. So shambhu&#x301; means &ldquo;the controller, self-created controller&rdquo;. And Svayambhu&#x301; &ndash; svayam means &ldquo;self&rdquo;, [so svayambhu&#x301; means] &ldquo;self-created&rdquo;. But it is not the controller, because it is the crudest point. It is the last point, the crudest point.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, wherever there is any expression or wherever there is no expression, the Witnessing Entity is there, just like the light of a stage, a theatrical stage. When there is an actor, the light is there, witnessing the activities of the actor. The actor says something, recites something, and the light of the stage witnesses the activities of that particular actor. And when a singer comes, that light witnesses the activities of the singer. A dancer comes, and that very light witnesses the activities of the dancer. And when nobody is present &ndash; no actor, no dancer, no singer &ndash; the light, that very light, witnesses that &ldquo;Nobody is present here now.&rdquo; It expresses the fact before the audience, before the spectators, that there is nobody on the stage. Similarly, where there is expression, that Cosmic Light, that Cosmic Father, is there. And where there is no expression, the Father is there to say that nobody is present now &ndash; just like that light of the theatrical stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Now in the case of Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, the fundamental positivity from where the creation starts, the Supreme Entity is there. And where the creation terminates, the last point, the crudest point, the Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga &ndash; the Witnessing Entity is there also, the Supreme Father is there also. Now in [Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga], the human entity, the entity of a living being, is in subtlest form, is in purest form, is in unadulterated form. And in Svayambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, in the lowest point, in the lowest bone, of your body, the created being, the living being, is in crudest form. Because of that crudest expression, the living being will also be in crudest form. That is, all one&#146;s divinity, one&#146;s divinity in its entirety, is sleeping there, is in latent form there, in the last bone of the body. That sleeping divinity &ndash; actually it is divinity, but it is sleeping &ndash; is called kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii in Sanskrit, &ldquo;coiled serpentine&rdquo; in English. &ldquo;Coiled serpentine&rdquo;. It is just like a serpentine loop.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Now, by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; &ndash; what is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;? Whenever a sa&#x301;dhaka gets his or her own peculiar incantation from his a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya, his or her own mantra to be practised, that sleeping divinity, kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, is aroused by the vibration of that mantra. And by dint of the person&#146;s constant practice, regular practice, what happens? It moves that serpentine loop upward. Its original residence is in the mu&#x301;la&#x301;dha&#x301;ra cakra, the lowermost cakra. Now when the sa&#x301;dhaka by dint of his or her sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, intuitional practice, exalts that kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, and when the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii crosses the sva&#x301;dhis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;na cakra, the next higher cakra, the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s feeling, his or her expression, his or her status, is known as sa&#x301;lokya. It is the first stage of sama&#x301;dhi. A sa&#x301;dhaka by constant practice is sure to attain that status. But you know, the yogis say that a sa&#x301;dhaka cannot attain that status without the special favour of the spiritual guru. This is what they say. That stage is called sa&#x301;lokya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;lokya means that the sa&#x301;dhaka feels that in the stratum, or sphere, where he or she is, where that person&#146;s exalted mind is, he or she is not alone; the Supreme Father is also there. This sama&#x301;dhi, where the feeling is that in the stratum, or status, where the person is, that person&#146;s Supreme Father is also there, gives the person very much pleasure. This first pleasure is called sa&#x301;lokya sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Then when this coiled serpentine, sleeping divinity, crosses the man&#x301;ipura cakra, just near the hub, the controlling point, of the pancreas, the person enjoys another sort of pleasure, and that pleasure is called sa&#x301;miipya sama&#x301;dhi. Sa&#x301;miipya is a Sanskrit word. It means &ldquo;proximity&rdquo;. That is, the sa&#x301;dhaka feels his or her proximity to the Supreme Father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In the first stage, the sa&#x301;dhaka felt that the Supreme Father was there in the same status. He is not in the sky, he is everywhere, He is with you. If you are here and He is in the sky, then you are alone here, and He is also alone there. No, no, no, no. In the first phase the feeling was that &ldquo;Where I am, He is also with me.&rdquo; And in the second phase, &ldquo;I have come very close, very near, that Supreme Father; I am in close proximity to the Supreme Progenitor. By dint of my sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the gap between my Father and myself is being bridged.&rdquo; It is the second phase, known as sa&#x301;miipya. Sa&#x301;miipya means &ldquo;proximity&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Then when that sleeping divinity, that kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, crosses the ana&#x301;hata cakra, this plexus, this &ldquo;solar plexus&rdquo; (in Latin), the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s feelings are known as sa&#x301;yujya. Sa&#x301;yujya means &ldquo;in close contact&rdquo;. In Sanskrit sa&#x301;yujya means &ldquo;close contact, just side by side, just touching&rdquo;. In sa&#x301;lokya He is with you. In sa&#x301;miipya you feel the proximity, the nearness. And here in sa&#x301;yujya what do you feel? A tactual experience. You get a tactual experience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Then when by dint of your sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; the divinity, the sleeping divinity, the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, crosses this point [the throat], one will experience another sort of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a subtler sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, subtler sama&#x301;dhi. And that one is called sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya. In sa&#x301;ru&#x301;pya the feeling is &ldquo;I am one with Him.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am one with Him&rdquo; &ndash; not close contact, but oneness. &ldquo;I am one with the Supreme Progenitor, I am one with the Supreme Cognition.&rdquo; This is sa&#x301;rupya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Then by still more sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, when the sleeping divinity crosses this point [between the eyebrows], the controlling point of the pituitary gland, the a&#x301;jin&#x32D;a&#x301; cakra, the sa&#x301;dhaka&#146;s feelings, or experiences &ndash; another sort of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, still more high &ndash; are known as sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi in Sanskrit. At that point, the feeling is that &ldquo;I am He;&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;He&rdquo;, these two entities, have become one. &ldquo;I am;&rdquo; but &ldquo;He&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; have coincided.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;I&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;He&rdquo;. There is one gap. &ldquo;I am the Supreme Entity, I am the Supreme Entity.&rdquo; There is still the connecting link &ldquo;am&rdquo;. But when &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Supreme Entity&rdquo; coincide, the gap &ldquo;am&rdquo; disappears. &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;Supreme Entity&rdquo;, and the connecting link &ldquo;am&rdquo;. When this will coincide with this, the connecting &ldquo;am&rdquo; will disappear, because there is no gap. &ldquo;I&rdquo; becomes one with &ldquo;He&rdquo;. Clear? Or &ldquo;He&rdquo; becomes one with &ldquo;I&rdquo;. This stage is called sa&#x301;rs&#x301;t&#x301;hi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->And the last stage is when that kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii comes here [crown of the head]. I said that in the unit structure, Shambhu&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga, Parama Purus&#x301;a, is here, at the controlling point of the pineal gland. The divinity, the sleeping divinity, is to be exalted to that point, to the controlling point of the pineal gland. And there is the final stage of sama&#x301;dhi. That final stage of sama&#x301;dhi is called nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi in yoga, and kaevalya in Tantra. In Sanskrit kaevalya means &ldquo;only&rdquo;. Kevala means &ldquo;only&rdquo;, and the noun of kevala is kaevalya.<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="14..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->[Seven thousand] years ago there was a great yogi; His name was Sada&#x301;shiva &ndash; Shiva. You know, in Tantra there are two cadres, two stages, or two varieties, amongst yogis. One of the stages is known as kaola, and the other Maha&#x301;kaola. Kaola means the spiritual aspirant who has raised the coiled serpentine, known as kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii in Sanskrit, and brought it to the controlling point of the pineal gland. (To establish the union of the fundamental negativity with the fundamental positivity; of the starting point with the culminating point.) Such aspirants are called kaola because they have raised the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii; the adjective of kula is kaola. Kula<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.14.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#14.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is the noun, kaola the adjective. All sa&#x301;dhakas, each and every sa&#x301;dhaka, can become a kaola through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Maha&#x301;kaolas are rare personalities. For a devotee, the Maha&#x301;kaola is called Ta&#x301;raka Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is Ta&#x301;raka Brahma? The movement of this world, or the movement of each and every entity, is of a particular nature. There is in the centre [of an atom] the nucleus, and electrons are moving around the nucleus. In each and every system there is a nucleus, and other objects are moving around the nucleus. If there is any change in the comparative applied force of the centripetal and the centrifugal forces, then the cyclic order will undergo metamorphosis. This is the expression, and in that case it will take a parabolic form, a parabolic movement. The point where the parabolic and the elliptical figures touch each other &ndash; that tangential point &ndash; is Ta&#x301;raka Brahma so far as the Cosmological order is concerned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->That Ta&#x301;raka Brahma takes shape, physical shape, to help the general people in their progress in the realm of Tantra and yoga. Such people are Maha&#x301;kaolas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Shiva was a Maha&#x301;kaola. He came here about 7000 years ago. After Him, about 3500 years ago, there came another Maha&#x301;kaola. He was called Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. The difference between kaola and Maha&#x301;kaola is, the kaola raises his or her coiled serpentine, kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii, through his or her sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, and establishes the union [of] the fundamental negativity and the fundamental positivity; where in the case of the Maha&#x301;kaola, the Maha&#x301;kaola has the power to raise the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii of others also. A kaola can never raise the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii of others; he or she can raise his or her own kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii. A Maha&#x301;kaola can, if He so desires, raise the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii of others also. So Shiva, or Sada&#x301;shiva, was a Maha&#x301;kaola. And He brought all the expressions and activities, all the secrets, of Tantra, within the framework of a system. That is, He systematized all Tantric and yogic pursuits, or actions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Shiva&#146;s spouse was Gaorii. She was also known as Pa&#x301;rvatii. In Sanskrit parvat  means &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;. Gaorii was a mountain girl, Himalayan girl; that&#146;s why she is commonly known as &ldquo;Pa&#x301;rvatii&rdquo;. She was also a great yogi. Now, Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii are treated as ideal. They are looked upon as the ideals of each and every yogi, whether family person or ascetic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->For a family man, a yogi who is a family man, Shiva is the ideal. For a lady who is a yogi and a family [person], Pa&#x301;rvatii is the ideal. For an ascetic, male or female &ndash; for a male, Shiva is the ideal, and for an avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; [an avadhu&#x301;tika&#x301; is a female ascetic], Gaorii is the ideal, Pa&#x301;rvatii is the ideal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now I think you have understood the story? It is not a story, it is a fact, and most of the books on yoga are nothing but conversations, dialogues, between Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii. Shiva is treated as the ideal man, and Pa&#x301;rvatii as the ideal lady.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Life is movement from imperfection to perfection. When inanimate objects become animate there is progress. There is further progress when animate beings become multicellular, metazoic organisms, more and more complicated structures. The imperfection of a crab is not seen in a serpent. The human being is the highest being, the most perfect in structure. The human is thus a perfected animal. But this is only the beginning of progress for the human. The human still has to achieve further physical, intellectual and spiritual perfections.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Movement towards perfection, that is, God, is dharma; while movement towards imperfection is adharma.

Movement towards perfection is obstructed by all the forces of imperfection. The sinful, the crude, the narrow, obstruct all movement for the expansion of a human being&#146;s mind.

The creation of this universe &ndash; the substance of this universe is one, though the creation is manifold. Why this creation of one into many? The reply is only with the Creator, the Supreme Lord. Philosophers try to answer this question but fail; how far can a microcosmic brain with its small nerve fibres go? Even if an individual utilizes all his or her mental powers, that individual will not succeed in answering. The devotee&#146;s approach to this question is, however, different. The devotee enters God&#146;s mind, mingles his or her mind with that of the Supreme Being, and knows some of the secrets of God&#146;s mind from within.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The devotees say God is Supreme. They sing His glory and defend all His actions.

We are all suffering and you call it a play.&rdquo; The devotee, however, defends God with this: &ldquo;My Lord was utterly alone before the creation. A person becomes mad if he or she is alone in a big vacant house. God was restless before the creation. He could neither love, nor feel angry with, anyone. So creation was a compulsion. He has created all these forms by multiplying Himself. When God was alone, He had the power to see, but there were no objects to be seen. Now that He has started the creation, He sees whatever He thinks. If we are His own forms and feel a little restlessness in His creation, we are blessed, for we are saving our Lord from the restlessness of utter loneliness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->This is the way a devotee looks at the secret of creation. We are all part of that Supreme Being &ndash; He is playing with Himself in all our forms. This is a divine play. He is playing hide-and-seek with Himself.

For instance, in an awakened state you may have eyes, ears, and other indriyas working, but your power to see, hear, etc., comes from one Supreme Being. Parama Purus&#x301;a can snatch away these powers of your indriyas. He can snatch these powers away from you at any stage of operation. For instance, when He snatches away your power of speech, you will have a tongue, but you will have no power to speak. Without His support you are nothing, you can perform nothing. He can stop you just at the stage when you are about to assert a particular power of yours.<!-- /block --></p>

In fact He hears your words before you do, before they become mental. He, therefore, has the full knowledge of all that goes on within, without, and beneath the mind.

<a name="18..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Those who have established themselves in their spiritual being through the practice of spiritual cult are the real human beings. Others, who do not move on the subtler and sublime path of spirituality, and behave like animals, are humans only in name. Human beings alone have the privilege to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. Animals, because of their intellectual deficiencies, are unable to adhere to the spiritual cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Animals are guided by instincts. They do not know the why and the how of things. Human beings, on the other hand, are led by the mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Animals cannot go beyond their instincts. In case of [great] intellectual clash, however, the animal mind, like the human, gets subtilized. This is generally found to occur with those animals who remain in contact with humans. But the development that is discernible in this case is not spiritual, it is simply intellectual. Dogs and monkeys who are trained, for instance, can be made a bit [more intelligent] than other ones.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Human beings, on the other hand, have the capacity to develop even in the spiritual realm. Those who do not pay heed to this special gift are animals, nay, even worse than animals. Animals are unable to make efforts for their spiritual development, whereas humans do have this ability. You cannot call a beggar a miser, for the beggar has no money to donate. If a moneyed person, on the other hand, hesitates to donate, that person is presumably a miser.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The human is sometimes described as a rational animal. Such a view does not seem consistent. A human cannot be an animal. In the Cosmological order, at one particular stage of development a unit is called an animal; at another particular point it is inanimate; and at another particular point it is a plant. Therefore, it does not behove to call a human a rational animal, for in that case the human can also be called a rational stone. When in the process of psycho-physical development the physical structure becomes complicated, and the psychic structure also develops to the extent that it starts controlling the physical body, you call that particular phase human.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In the creation of the universe, the consciousness that is existing as the nucleus of the triangular Basic Principle is the Supreme Father, the Basic Cognition. The avidya&#x301; shakti that is working with the Basic Cognition as the Operative Principle, but is not yet manifested, is called the Basic Principle. There is no expression in the Basic Principle, neither physical nor psychic. She is active but there is no effect of operative nature. The expression does not occur so long as there is proper equilibrium between the Basic Principle and the Basic Cognition. When they lose their balance, a theoretical expression takes place as a sequel. In this stage it is called the Primordial Principle. The Primordial Principle is something theoretically manifest. It does not fall within the periphery of experience, due to the equilibrium of Shiva and Shakti [Basic Cognition and Basic Principle], but it is theoretically well established.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->It does not seem proper to attribute&#8230; to such a state, yet the situation is akin to&#8230;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> There is actional vibration in the Basic Principle, but due to the absence of any measuring psychic entity it cannot be said to be temporal, though it is related to the time factor. There does not exist any second entity brought about due to curvatures in the Primordial Principle. That is why we do not find another, time-measuring, factor there. This curve is its special characteristic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the third phase of manifestation, due to internal clash and cohesion, curvatures come into existence. The difference between the vibrational principle and the Witnessing Counterpart becomes explicit. The vibrational principle is called in Sanskrit Bhava&#x301;nii shakti. The temporal factor is established in the development of ka&#x301;la. What is ka&#x301;la, or time? Time is nothing but the psychic measurement of the relative motivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..9"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->If the vibrational expression is towards the crude, the unit will face retardation. The final, or culminating, point of retardation [contains within it] the history of the full expression. In the crudest point of the human mind, therefore, lies the history of its innumerable lives. Even a timorous stroke will rip open the burden a person is carrying and make one able to see oneself. The development [upwards] from the nadir of Supreme Cognition is progress. So long as the fundamental negativity does not receive a stroke, there does not occur any progress, any development. A seed sprouts forth if struck by light, water, and soil. Similarly, when the fundamental negativity of a unit &ndash; that is, the kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii  &ndash; receives the stroke of the mantra, it awakens. But so long as the desire to move towards Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; is not aroused, this phenomenon does not take place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->This does not happen with an animal because of its intellectual deficiency. Matter, due to external and internal clash, is converted into ectoplasm &ndash; the crude stuff is metamorphosed into citta&#x301;n&#x301;u [&ldquo;mind-atoms&rdquo;, ectoplasmic particles]. The intensity of this clash and cohesion depends upon the intensity of internal and external clashes. [After] the animal mind, the mind that succeeds due to immense physical and intellectual or even intuitional clashes is the human mind, and the body that is associated with it is the human body. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the spiritual cult, is a progress from the crudeness of matter to the subtlest entity, that is, a march, a movement, from the last point of the vibrational principle to the nucleus of the Basic Principle, the controlling point of the fundamental triangle of forces. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is, therefore, a march to the place from where one has come.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Those who want to make themselves the attraction or the ideal of the world add a Shrii before their names. The term connotes the charming entity, Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, Prakrti. Supreme Cognition is the shelter of Shrii, and that is why He is also called Shriiniva&#x301;sa in Sanskrit. The movement towards the entity that has sheltered the universe is sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Since humans [are] weak, they need the aid of some other entity for this movement. From where will they get the stamina, the strength, for this movement? Assuredly it can be had only from the Entity that is the source of this stamina, this strength. Whatever stamina, physical, mental, or spiritual, exists within you, is not your creation. Can you create anything? No, you cannot. You convert the external energy derived from food, light, water and soil into vital energy. You cannot create any energy, you can simply convert it into other forms. You convert sound energy, magnetic energy, etc., into vital energy. You then reconvert that vital energy into other forms of energy. While working, you convert your vital energy into mechanical energy. While speaking, you convert your vital energy into sound energy. The moment this vital energy is gone, the living unit turns into a corpse. You derive your vital energy from the external world, a gift of Parama Purus&#x301;a. Similarly, the strength to move towards the Supreme Father can also be obtained from Him. But the tragedy is that you do not ask for spiritual force from Him. Your sole concentration is on earning name, fame, money, promotion, prestige, and other such worldly gains. You remain so busy with your worldly desires that you hardly manage to get any time in your daily life to ask for spiritual strength.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In ancient times, when the desire to move on the path of spirituality was aroused, human beings felt the need of a guide to show the path. It is this desire that is manifested in the Vedas. When the desire to move on the path is aroused, He is compelled to come as a guide to the seeker. He cannot just ignore the seeker. Ask the way and you will get it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->But it is not enough to get the way, for one also needs to walk on that way, on that path. The strength to move forward lies within you &ndash; the only impediment being the encumbrance of sins that is on your head due to your past actions. Remove that burden, be light, and march on. Bhagava&#x301;n [Lord] Buddha said the same thing when he asked his disciples to jettison the burden that is in the boat. Desire is, therefore, not enough. One needs to perform some tangible action. That action is called intuitional practice &ndash; spiritual cult. This cult is also called Tantra. It is not enough to read books, scriptures &ndash; one will have to be practical, will have to do something in practical life. You need to move from the fundamental negativity to the fundamental positivity. Thus, through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a person makes himself or herself light and at the same time gets the attraction of Him. Furthermore, one needs to surrender oneself completely. Until and unless there is cent percent surrender, it is naive to think in terms of accomplishing the task.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Surrender<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The story goes [in the Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata] that so long as Draopadi kept even a grain of dependence on her own strength, she remained constantly under the threat of being exposed before the congregation. The moment she found herself completely helpless and reposed all faith in the Lord, Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a, she got the divine help. So one who feels this attraction and surrenders oneself completely to Him is bound to get His help. One, on the other hand, who keeps even one paisa with oneself, fails to get that help.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->A natural question comes up here. Since human life is evolved through animal stages, the impression of the animal life is bound to work within the framework of human psychology. In this situation, it is not unlikely for human beings to commit mistakes, to commit sin. How is it possible to move forward with this encumbrance acquired during the animal stages?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The answer has been provided by the Lord Himself. If even the most degraded person remembers Him single-mindedly, He will relieve that person from his burden of sin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->There is, however, a difference between the English term &ldquo;sin&rdquo; and the Sanskrit word pa&#x301;pa. In &ldquo;sin&rdquo; there are involved religious, doctrinal and biblical connotations. The Sanskrit term pa&#x301;pa is more explicit. Paropaka&#x301;rah pun&#x301;ya&#x301;ya pa&#x301;pa&#x301;ya parapiid&#x301;anam &ndash; &ldquo;Those actions that help to develop the physical, intellectual, and spiritual strata of human beings are pun&#x301;ya, and those that obstruct this are pa&#x301;pa.&rdquo; The biggest pa&#x301;pii is called dura&#x301;ca&#x301;rii in Sanskrit, and one whom even the dura&#x301;ca&#x301;riis call pa&#x301;pii is a sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->There is a common term in Sanskrit, pa&#x301;taka [sin]. There are two forms of pa&#x301;taka, pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya. Going against the don&#146;ts is pa&#x301;pa; pratyava&#x301;ya means not to do what one should do. In Sanskrit dos are called vidhi and don&#146;ts nis&#x301;edh. The whole social structure revolves around vidhi and nis&#x301;edh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Those who shirk duties and responsibilities do commit a great harm to society. It is this lack of dutifulness in our country [India] today that has caused great retardation in different spheres of life. It has also caused spiritual degeneration. One should perform good actions regularly, should do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; properly &ndash; these are the dos which everyone is expected to perform. Those who do not pay heed to these responsibilities do indulge in pratyava&#x301;ya. Pa&#x301;taka is the collective name of pa&#x301;pa and pratyava&#x301;ya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Pa&#x301;takas are of three kinds. First, the ordinary kind. These are undesirable acts after which the person [may repent]. For instance, someone takes the money of others. That person&#146;s act will be called pa&#x301;taka, for he or she can pay back the money and repent of the act.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->There is no atonement, however, for atipa&#x301;taka. If, for example, one chops off the [arms] of an innocent person, one cannot pay those limbs back in the same capacity. According to the sha&#x301;stras [scriptures], persons indulging in these atipa&#x301;taka acts can make atonement only if they renounce their worldly life and fully offer themselves to the cause of humanity in the service of mankind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The third kind of pa&#x301;taka is maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka. There is no penance that will atone for maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka, either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Furthermore, the result of maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka is of recurring nature. If a businessman, for instance, discovers a new method of adulteration, he commits maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka. Mixing papaya seeds with the black pepper is bound to deceive purchasers. The discoverer of this new method shows the world a new path in the sphere of adulteration. The effect of this act is bound to be of recurring nature. The atonement for maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka is like atipa&#x301;taka, that is, this person also should renounce his or her worldly life and should offer himself or herself in the service of mankind. There is, however, a difference. Since this person&#146;s act is more serious, this person will have to invent something that will have a recurring good effect on society. The invention of penicillin would be a case in point. There is no other way out for the maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="18..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->There is an interesting story about this. When the defeat of Ravana became almost certain, he sat in prayer, imploring Lord Shiva to save him from the oncoming disaster. But Lord Shiva remained quiescent and did not pay heed to his prayers. Pa&#x301;rvatii was also there. What happens is that the heart of the mother is more soft than that of the father. Seeing the miserable condition of Ravana, a devout of Lord Shiva, she started pleading with Lord Shiva on his behalf. The latter, however, refused to listen to even Pa&#x301;rvatii&#146;s implorings. He had to see to his duties and not to hear Pa&#x301;rvatii&#146;s lecture. When Pa&#x301;rvatii finally pressured Him very much, Lord Shiva revealed the situation. He said that Ravana was a great pa&#x301;pii, so He could not do anything for him. Pa&#x301;rvatii continued in her obstinacy. Pleading on behalf of Ravana, she said that at most he might be an atipa&#x301;takii. The Lord thereupon said that he was a maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takii. Though it would have been atipa&#x301;taka to kidnap a lady, Ravana&#146;s act was maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka, for he carried out his act in the garb of a sa&#x301;dhu. If he had done it as Ravana, he would have been an atipa&#x301;takii. His act would not have had a lasting effect. But since thenceforward no housewife would believe a sa&#x301;dhu, the effect of his act was of recurring nature.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="18..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a, the Father of all fathers, the multiple of all multiplicities, the nucleus of all nuclei, knows everything. He is omniscient. He knows sarva &ndash; the Cosmic Father knows everything. He is omniscient, prescient and post-scient. The earth is [created] in Him. What has happened in the past comes within the vibrational principle. What is going to happen in the future also comes within the vibrational principle. (The present has no independent existence. It is nothing but an adjustment between the past and the future. That is why the present varies in accordance with personal differences.) The omniscient Purus&#x301;a, Pratyaga&#x301;tma, is the Lord of both heaven and hell. He is the Father of both developed sa&#x301;dhakas and of sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ras or maha&#x301;pa&#x301;takiis. There is, therefore, no question of His hating the sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ras and loving the good sa&#x301;dhakas. All are one to Him. He cannot ostracize the former and embrace the latter. There is no place outside Him where He can throw off the sudura&#x301;ca&#x301;ras. He cannot disown them either, for in that case He would not remain Patitpavan [Saviour of the Degraded].<!-- /block --></p>

He or she should, on the contrary, do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and undergo the prescribed penance. There is no reason to fear. This world is not for cowards. Only the brave can enjoy the world.

Your attraction to the Supreme is called devotion [bhakti], whereas attraction to any finite objectivity is called a&#x301;sakti. Attraction to friends is a&#x301;sakti, attraction to God is bhakti.

The first is psycho-spiritual devotion, whereas the second is pure spiritual devotion. The reactive momenta remain mixed into this type of psycho-spiritual devotion of internal projection of the subliminal human mind, and these reactive momenta of the subliminal human mind disturb mental equipoise. As a result, the mind eventually comes back again to the lower status. A person rises during the period of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and comes back to the original stage when in normal life. Here, love for God does not become of permanent nature. (While quarrelling unnecessarily, one does not remember the untoward nature of one&#146;s act. Later on one repents. But when the remembrance of the nature of the act becomes of permanent nature, it is called dhruva&#x301;smrti.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.18.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#18.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->) In the non-attributional devotion of pure spiritual type, the reactive momenta cannot function within the scope of the subliminal stratum.<!-- /block --></p>

It is through jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma that bhakti is aroused, and it is bhakti that leads human beings to that supernal bliss.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->While bhakti is free from any defect, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma may create certain shortcomings. The acquisition of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na often results in making a person alasa [lazy] and aham&#x301;ka&#x301;rii [proud]; while karma has the possibility of making a person proud. Unless a spiritual aspirant is able to get rid of these defects, the aspirant cannot be established in kevala&#x301; bhakti [non-attributional devotion], which is absolutely essential for the attainment of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The wise will, therefore, adopt such a conduct as to save themselves from the evil effects of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In order for sa&#x301;dhakas to save themselves from the evil effects of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, they must learn how to get rid of those effects, and thus preclude the possibility of allowing their jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na to be converted into bandhya&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [sterile knowledge], which is so much in evidence among the intellectuals of today. This bandhya&#x301; jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, instead of being a source of inspiration to march on the path of progress, leads humans or society to utter destruction and decay.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It has been observed that those engaged in the acquisition of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na lose touch with practicality. Their constant preoccupation with books makes them lazy and lethargic, and they become shy of work; and this eventually leads to their downfall. The golden rule for getting rid of one&#146;s defects is that one should first create opposite feelings and ideas in the mind, and then bring them into execution. In order to avoid laziness, therefore, one will have to work hard. Work is the manifestation of the Supreme Entity, so everyone will have to work, and work in greater and greater measure. Karma Brahmeti karma bahu kurviita [&ldquo;Work is Brahma, therefore work more and more.&rdquo;]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Work here does not mean just any engagement [of the faculties] which yields no result. Work is work only when it is directed towards collective welfare. It is of utmost importance that everyone engage himself or herself in materializing the plan for collective welfare. That alone will save him or her from the evil of laziness and lethargy.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="19..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra [pride] that creeps into a person due to the acquisition of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na has very serious repercussions in human life. It can lead to the complete downfall of the individual. Aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra falls into three basic types, and each of the types brings disastrous results:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..8"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Abhima&#x301;nam&#x301; sura&#x301;pa&#x301;nam&#x301;<br>Gaoravam&#x301; raoravam&#x301; dhruvam;<br>Pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; shu&#x301;kariivis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;<br>Trayam&#x301; tyaktva&#x301; Harim&#x301; bhajet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..9"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->[Abhima&#x301;na is like sura&#x301;pa&#x301;na, gaorava leads to raorava, and pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; is like shu&#x301;kariivis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;: an inflated ego is like drinking wine, self-aggrandizement leads one into the deepest hell, and social status is like the excrement of a pig. Give up all three of these and only sing the glories of the Lord.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The first type of aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is called abhima&#x301;nam, which means that a person thinks that he or she deserves more than what he or she is getting; and consequently develops an overbearing attitude towards everyone. Abhima&#x301;na has been compared with drinking: anyone who indulges in it loses his or her discriminating judgment, just as a drunkard does. (A human is different from an animal only because he or she possesses viveka [faculty of discrimination] and buddhi [intellect]. And just as a drunkard gradually loses these priceless faculties, an abhima&#x301;nii also becomes bereft of them.) Since the loss of the rational faculty goes against cardinal human virtues, drinking is a pa&#x301;pa [sin]. Similarly, abhima&#x301;na is a pa&#x301;pa, and leads to the downfall of the individual.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Gaorava is the second type of aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. It means &ldquo;self-aggrandizement&rdquo;. Puffed up with vanity, a person will want to project his or her image in an exaggerated manner. Often we hear somebody say, for example, that they have a rose the size of a balloon in their garden &ndash; whereas actually the rose may be the size of a ping-pong ball. Constant indulgence in this type of activity converts the mind into matter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->We have seen bulls moving about in the streets with an air of arrogance. Such a bull creates a sound expressing the idea that it is big &ndash; Ham bar&#x301;a&#x301;. But when the bull dies and ta&#x301;n&#x32D;t [vina string] is made out of its intestines and musicians start playing on it, the sound which is then emitted expresses the idea Tun&#x32D; bar&#x301;a&#x301; &ndash; meaning thereby that the bull realizes that others are big, and realizes that he has arrived at this condition because of his arrogance.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.19.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#19.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In fact the inculcation of gaorava leads one to the worst hell. Just as there are six layers, or lokas, of the Cosmic Mind above the crude world, so are there six types of hell, six narakas, below the physical world. The names of these hells are tala, atala, tala&#x301;tala, pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, atipa&#x301;ta&#x301;la and rasa&#x301;tala. Another term for rasa&#x301;tala is raorava naraka &ndash; and a person indulging in gaorava will certainly go to raorava.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->(It must, however, be remembered that all these hells or narakas are not actually to be found below this earth. These various narakas denote the mental and physical states of human beings. A person whose mind has been converted into matter like that of a stone is really not worthy to be called a human being, because he or she has lost the mental qualities of a human being. A person of this type is said to be living in naraka. This point has been clarified in Ananda Su&#x301;tram [by the author, 1962]: Na svargo na rasa&#x301;talah [&ldquo;There is no heaven and no hell&rdquo;].)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The third type of aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is [the desire for] pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; &ndash; the desire to make oneself known. A person influenced by [the desire for] pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; expects respect from everyone, and hankers after name and fame. This mental state can be easily compared with the mental condition of a beggar. The beggar asks money from others, while the person craving for prestige begs others to give him or her respect. [The person desires something that] is really meaningless and possesses no value, something that has been fitly compared to the excrement of a pig.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Curing These Defects<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->After having analysed the various types of aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra and their evil effects, we need to examine the ways and means of getting rid of these defects. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has offered a psychological method to save oneself from the malady of aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. Aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is really a mental ailment, and a person suffering from this disease requires psychological treatment. The following shloka summarizes the line of treatment suggested by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..18"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Trn&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena taroriva sahis&#x301;n&#x301;una;<br>Ama&#x301;niina&#x301;m&#x301; ma&#x301;nadeyam&#x301; kiirttaniya sada&#x301; Harih.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..19"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->[You must be more humble than the grass and more tolerant than the trees. You must give respect to those whom no one respects, and always do kiirtana to the Lord.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In order to get rid of abhima&#x301;na, one will have to cultivate the habit of being polite and humble. Just as a [blade of grass] may lie on the ground [underfoot], but does not, through its remaining humble, lose its importance, so a person will never become insignificant by being humble. Humility such as that of the [blade of grass] can alone save a person from abhima&#x301;na. Forbearance and tolerance like that of a tree which, even while being cut, continues to give its cool shade, are also necessary in order to keep away from abhima&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->A person who is always engaged in the thought of his or her pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; must learn how to care about the respect and prestige of others. Such a person must never forget that respect begets respect, and that he or she should always honour those who are not honoured by anyone. A constant practice of this type will remove the evil effects of the desire for pratis&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301;. One easy way to do this is that you always do namaska&#x301;ra first and do not create a situation in which you may have to do prati-namaska&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->And finally, a person who moves about puffed up with vanity and arrogance, and is always engaged in gaorava, self-aggrandizement, will be able to improve only by utilizing his or her time in kiirtana. If a person keeps himself or herself engaged in kiirtana, that person will not have time to criticize and slander anyone in order to project his or her own image by comparison and contrast. So it is a must for such a person to do a lot of kiirtana, so that the person does not get time to indulge in the despicable activity of paraninda&#x301; [slandering].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="19..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Therefore spiritual aspirants who have set their eyes on Parama Purus&#x301;a as their goal must always strive to get rid of a&#x301;lasya [lethargy] and aham&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, and gain the full benefits of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and karma, so as to arouse and enliven bhakti, which is the only road to the journey&#146;s end. The person will have to engage himself or herself in work for the collective welfare, will have to cultivate the qualities of humility, forbearance and tolerance, will have to learn to honour those who are honoured by none, and will have to participate in and organize kiirtanas.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="20..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You know, knowingly or unknowingly, each and every created being wants to be loved by the Supreme; and loves the Supreme.

<a name="20..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sarve veda&#x301; yat padama&#x301;mananti. Sarve veda&#x301; &ndash; &ldquo;All the vedas&rdquo;. You know, in old Sanskrit the root verb vid means &ldquo;to know&rdquo;. So veda means &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;, the faculty of knowing. So in the process of all faculties, or on the functional side, the actional side, of all faculties, the goal was then the Supreme Purus&#x301;a; and even now the goal is the Supreme Purus&#x301;a; and in future, in all that is to come, the goal will be the Supreme Purus&#x301;a. Sarve veda&#x301; yat padama&#x301;mananti &ndash; &ldquo;All the vedas are in search of&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Tapa&#x301;m&#x301;si sarva&#x301;n&#x301;i ca yad vadanti. Tapah means to undergo trouble, difficulty, just to give relief to others; and in the spiritual arena, tapah means to undergo trouble only to satisfy one&#146;s dearest Supreme Being: that is tapah. So tapa&#x301;m&#x301;si sarva&#x301;n&#x301;i ca yat vadanti &ndash; &ldquo;aspirants, spiritual aspirants, are undergoing tapah just to give pleasure to the Supreme.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->And, yaddicchanto Brahmacaryam&#x301; caranti &ndash; &ldquo;the Brahmaca&#x301;rii adheres to the code of Brahmacarya just to get Him, just to keep in contact with Him.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Do you know what the meaning of Brahmaca&#x301;rii is? Human life is for spiritual sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; only. There is not, there cannot be, any other motive; there cannot be any other intention; there cannot be any other desideratum. But your physical body is within the scope of this physical world, and to maintain this physical body you require food, dress, a house, and so many things. So a certain portion of your thoughts will certainly be occupied by those physical entities, by those physical objects. So what are you to do? You are to ascribe Brahma-hood, you are to ascribe Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a-hood, to all physical objects, all physical entities, when you come in contact with those entities, physically or mentally. When you do this &ndash; when you ascribe Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a-hood to each and every physical object, when you ascribe Brahma-hood to each and every physical object &ndash; then you are following the code of Brahmacarya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..11"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Yaddicchanto Brahmacaryam&#x301; caranti<br>Tatte padam&#x301; sam&#x301;grahen&#x301;a vraviimyon&#x32D;mityetat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Yama [the god of death, the speaker in this scripture] said, &ldquo;Just to get oneself elevated to that supreme rank, just to get oneself to that status, I utter the word on&#x32D;m.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now you know, in this universe of ours, nothing is fixed, nothing is stationary, everything moves. Everything moves within the scope of the three fundamental relative factors &ndash; spatial, temporal and personal. The entire universe in its collective body also moves, because there is movement in the thought process, the thought projection, of the Supreme. Wherever there is movement, there is vibration, and there is expression of energy. And you know, energies are inter-transmutable. Light energy may be converted into sound energy; and the vital energy of human beings may be converted into spiritual energy, into electrical energy, into light energy, or into sound energy.  When you speak, you convert your vital energy into sound energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Now, this conversion goes on from ana&#x301;di [the beginningless] to ananta [the endless]. And within this vast scope, the span between ana&#x301;di and ananta is this universe of ours, is the phenomenal world, the creation of a single Noumenal Entity. Now, because of this movement, sound energy is produced. By dint of one&#146;s sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; one gets one&#146;s ears suitably trained to catch that sound. Everyone can catch that sound with his or her physical ears, after those ears are properly trained by sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. And that sound is known as on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra. It is the collective sound of all sounds of the universe, of all physical and psychic sounds within and without. It is on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra, and because all waves, all vibrational expressions, emanate from the singular Nave, by the process of negative approach you move towards that Nave.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->I should say, if the movement from the Supreme Nave towards crude entities is treated as a positive movement, then your approach should be treated as a negative movement &ndash; because your movement is physico-psychic in the first phase; then pure psychic in the second phase; then psycho-spiritual in the third phase; and in the final phase, purely spiritual. We call these four phases in Sanskrit ka&#x301;ma, artha, dharma and moks&#x301;a. These phases are known as the caturvarga &ndash; &ldquo;four phases&rdquo;, &ldquo;four classifications&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->So the starting point of on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is in close contact with the Macropsychic Entity. And it has its micropsychic counterpart also. And that&#146;s why on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is also known as pran&#x301;ava: pra&#x301; prefixed to  the root verb nu, plus the suffix al. Pran&#x301;ava means &ldquo;the entity that guides you unto the supreme status, unto the supreme rank&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Now I think you understand that pran&#x301;ava is to be heard, and not to be pronounced. Your tongue can&#146;t pronounce it properly. It is a never-ending sound. That is why it is also known as Shabda Brahma. And regarding one&#146;s Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra &ndash; first, what&#146;s the meaning of is&#x301;t&#x301;a? Is&#x301;t&#x301;a means &ldquo;loving&rdquo;, &ldquo;favourite&rdquo;, &ldquo;dear&rdquo;, &ldquo;attractive&rdquo;, &ldquo;goal&rdquo;, &ldquo;terminus&rdquo;, &ldquo;desideratum&rdquo;. There are so many imports of that single term is&#x301;t&#x301;a. And mantra? There is no proper English word for the Sanskrit word mantra. We use the word &ldquo;incantation&rdquo; for mantra, but it is not a proper word for the Sanskrit term. In Sanskrit, the spirit of the term mantra is Manana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sa mantrah parikiirtitah [&ldquo;A mantra is that collection of sounds which, when meditated upon, leads to liberation&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Manana means &ldquo;inner suggestion&rdquo;, &ldquo;repetition within&rdquo;. And ta&#x301;rayet yastu &ndash; &ldquo;after this manana, when that entity liberates you from all metaphysical, all psychic and suprapsychic, and also from all spiritual, bondages&rdquo;, then it is known as mantra. Manana&#x301;t ta&#x301;rayet yastu sa mantrah parikiirtitah.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->For a spiritual aspirant, for a sa&#x301;dhaka, his or her Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra is pran&#x301;ava, because it goads the person towards the Supreme Entity; it guides the person towards the Supreme Entity; it helps the person in coming in contact with, or rather becoming one with, or ensconcing oneself in, that Entity. So for a sa&#x301;dhaka, on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra is not pran&#x301;ava; his or her Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra is pran&#x301;ava. And that&#146;s why so much importance is attached to one&#146;s own Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra. And one must also remember that for each and every sa&#x301;dhaka the most important of all words is his or her Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra. For a particular sa&#x301;dhaka, the only meaningful word, and the most precious word, is that person&#146;s own personal Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra. For the sa&#x301;dhaka, the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantras of others have no value. For you the most meaningful, most valuable, mantra is your personal Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra; and others&#146; personal Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantras have no value for you. They are meaningless words. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->You know the old story of Hanuman, a great devotee. In mythology it has been stated that once upon a time Hanuman was asked by certain other devotees, &ldquo;Hanuman, you know that there is no difference between Ra&#x301;ma and Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a. They are the same thing, no difference.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;ma means Ra&#x301;mante yoginah yasmin &ndash; &ldquo;the most precious, the dearest, object of yogis&rdquo;. Who is the dearest object of yogis? Parama Purus&#x301;a. So [Ra&#x301;ma] means Parama Purus&#x301;a. And what&#146;s the meaning of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a? Na&#x301;ra means Prakrti; na&#x301;ra means bhakti; and na&#x301;ra means &ldquo;water&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit, the word na&#x301;ra has three meanings. One meaning of na&#x301;ra is niira, that is, &ldquo;water&rdquo; &ndash; niiram, jalam, pa&#x301;niiyam, toyam, udakam, [kambalam].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->And another meaning of na&#x301;ram is bhakti, devotion. You know there was a great muni [seer] named Na&#x301;rada. Da means &ldquo;donor&rdquo;. His duty was to move throughout India and Tibet and Southeast Asia singing the kiirtana of the Lord &ndash; that is, distributing na&#x301;ra, distributing bhakti, amongst the general public; and that&#146;s why he was popularly known as &ldquo;Na&#x301;rada&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Na&#x301;radeneoya&#x301;la&#x301;&rdquo; [&ldquo;Distributor of Devotion&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->Regarding na&#x301;ra&#146;s first meaning, you know, even in railway stations there are certain persons who serve passengers water; they are also na&#x301;rada. [laughter] Pa&#x301;niipa&#x301;r&#x301;e, pa&#x301;niipa&#x301;r&#x301;e.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.20.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#20.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> And the second meaning of na&#x301;rada is &ldquo;[one] distributing devotion&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->And the third meaning of Na&#x301;ra is Parama&#x301; Prakrti &ndash; Maha&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, Maha&#x301;laks&#x301;mii &ndash; the Creator of this universe, the Creating Faculty, the Binding Faculty, the Attributional Faculty. That is Na&#x301;ra; and ayana means &ldquo;shelter&rdquo;. For ink, the ink-pot is the shelter. Similarly for Na&#x301;ra, in the sense of Prakrti, Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is the shelter, Parama Purus&#x301;a is the shelter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->So there is no philosophical difference between Na&#x301;ra&#x301;ya&#x301;na and Ra&#x301;ma. The meaning of Ra&#x301;ma is Parama Purus&#x301;a; the meaning of Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a is also Parama Purus&#x301;a. &ldquo;Oh, Hanuman, when you are a devotee, you are an elevated soul, then why do you use the word Ra&#x301;ma only and not Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a?&rdquo; But you know, his Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra was Ra&#x301;ma. The reply given by Hanuman is very important. You should remember it. He said,<!-- /block --></p>

Shriina&#x301;tha means Shriiniva&#x301;sa, Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a &ndash; the same meaning.

<a name="21..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->It is wrong to presume that by reading voluminous books or by delivering beautiful lectures, one can attain Parama Purus&#x301;a.

Similarly, for God all persons are equal for the spiritual food He will give them.

They read different theories and philosophies, and these things create a clash in their minds. They are unable to decide whether this philosophy is correct, or that one is correct. The uneducated, on the other hand, are better off, as they walk on the spiritual path with steadiness, undisturbed by warring ideas. The intellect is incapable of comprehending Parama Purus&#x301;a.

Whatever you consider as the summum bonum of life is sat. And when you direct all your faculties and sentiments towards the attainment of this goal, this is called shrat. And the feeling associated with this is called shraddha&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Even when you think of God as an enemy, you are involved in Him.  Really, our mind is more activated [to think about somebody] by anger and hatred [than by positive propensities]. When we have a quarrel with somebody, we keep on thinking that the next time we meet that person, we will say this or that. Therefore, God will be attained whether you love Him or hate Him. Ravana was constantly thinking of Rama as his enemy and therefore he also attained salvation through His hands. But merely listening to scriptures or talks is not going to bring about the desired results.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Another fact must be remembered: that God is realized only by those whom He graces with compassion. You should not have the feeling in mind, &ldquo;Now I have done so much; God should shower His grace on me.&rdquo; Rather you should feel, &ldquo;It is for You, O Lord, to grace me or not. This body of mine will work like a machine until You grace me with love.&rdquo; If you are proud of your meritorious actions, this pride will remain in the end and not the grace of God. For Him, all are equal. For society, the differences matter, but not for God. His grace is raining on all, but if you are carrying an umbrella of ego on your head, how will you get drenched by His Grace? Everyone has a right to enter Brahmaloka [the subtlest layer of the Macrocosmic Mind]; this is the birthright of all. He is kind to all, every moment of one&#146;s life. One has only to receive this kindness by removing the ego.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->However great a sinner one may be, the moment one surrenders to the Lord, one becomes a devotee &ndash; his or her salvation is guaranteed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Entity whom you are trying to attain &ndash; Parama Purus&#x301;a &ndash; is your own innermost self. Your relation with Him is not external, to be defined by courts, laws, or society. It is a family relationship. The desire in your mind to meet God is only born when He is inclined towards you. It is the result of His desire to meet you. Your meeting with God is not a unilateral affair, it is a mutual thing. You walk one step towards Him and He will come twenty towards you.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->When an infant starts walking, the parent first asks it and goads it to walk a little. It tries to walk, but falls. Then the parent advances and lifts it up onto his or her lap. God does the same. Make the slightest effort, and He will pick you up and place you on His lap.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="21..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Your relation with God is personal. No one can sever this relationship. It is part of your being, your birthright.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the Sanskrit language, the word na&#x301;ra has many meanings. One meaning is &ldquo;water&rdquo;. Another meaning is Parama&#x301; Prakrti &ndash; the Causal Matrix or Supreme Operative Cosmic Principle. The third meaning is &ldquo;devotion&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The main and inevitable aim of every sa&#x301;dhaka is not to enjoy the nectar of devotion by himself or herself, but to distribute it all around. Sa&#x301;dhakas are eager to share with others the bliss which they enjoy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In ancient times there was one such devotee who used to go from place to place distributing the bliss of devotion. His name was Narada. Once he said to Parama Purus&#x301;a: &ldquo;O Lord, all the scholars and philosophers say that You are omniscient, but people do not feel Your presence everywhere. Where, therefore, is the place where Your presence can most be felt? Or which place do You consider as dearest to You?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The Lord replied, &ldquo;It is true that I am everywhere; there is no action, no thought, no feeling, in which I am not present. All actions take place before My eyes, within My mind. Nothing [should] be done or thought which is meant to be hidden from Me. Still, I do not live in the seventh heaven as people think. Minds which are free from narrowness, limitations, and isms are the places dear to me.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The true meaning of the word yoga is &lsquo;to unify&rsquo;. But those who do a&#x301;sanas, pra&#x301;n&#x301;a&#x301;ya&#x301;ma, etc., without devotion are cultivating the desert. Without the water of devotion, their effort will not succeed. I am not in the hearts of such dry yogis.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The meaning of the word bhakti is &ldquo;attraction to the Supreme&rdquo;. When the attraction is to something limited, it is called a&#x301;sakti, and when the attraction is to the Supreme, it is devotion, bhakti. There is no compromise, no meeting point, between a&#x301;sakti and bhakti, between attraction to the Supreme and attraction to the objects of the world. In a&#x301;sakti, the feeling is that I get the object. In bhakti, the feeling is that I merge myself in Him. Where there is no desire, there the Lord lives. The Lord and the desire for the world, like the sun and the night, cannot coexist.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->For devotees, all other enjoyments are insipid. They are like saltless food. Hence the Lord says, &ldquo;Where My devotees sing My praise, do kiirtana, there I go &ndash; I cannot help going there.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->One person is scholarly, another is rich; but they may or may not be devotees. The only thing that the devotee needs is love for the Lord.  When all feelings, all attachments, are directed towards Him, then it is devotion. The only qualification is a sincere heart. If your heart is pure, you need nothing else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Nothing is gained by becoming a jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nii. [Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na] has use only so far as devotion has not been born. When you eat tasty food, the paper on which you place this food is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. The food itself is karma, and the taste of the food is bhakti.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> If you have absorbed the food and got its taste, the dirty paper of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na has to be thrown in the dustbin. This alone is wisdom. Be wise!<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="23..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->There is a famous verse from the Upanishads which says that you cannot reach Parama Purus&#x301;a unless you are strong and full of energy. The word bala means that spiritual force which functions in a jiiva [living being] base. In ordinary parlance, however, bala means &ldquo;capacity&rdquo;. It depends upon the extent to which one makes use of one&#146;s physical, psychic and spiritual energy.  A person may have immense capacity, but to the extent that he or she does not utilize it, it does not become helpful in God-realization. Bala, therefore, depends on the extent of the use of one&#146;s capacity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->When the divine bridge was constructed by Rama to cross the ocean, Hanuman brought mountains, but the squirrel brought only small pebbles. Both were strong and full of energy, as each was working to his full capacity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Thus even a comparatively weak person can become balava&#x301;n [strong] by utilizing the small energy he or she has. Whatever power, energy, you have, utilize it for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; and service, and you are balava&#x301;n, fit to reach Parama Purus&#x301;a. None of you need, therefore, despair. Each has the requisite wherewithal to reach the Almighty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The utilization of energy should be in the proper direction. If you have to move to the east and you start moving towards the west, your action will be considered full of pra&#x301;ma&#x301;da, or madness. Ananda Marga has the correct way, through subjective approach and objective adjustement. While followers of Ananda Marga keep their eyes steady on the absolute, they do not ignore this relative world. They work for self-realization and social upliftment, and hence the utilization of their energy is never in vain. When the effort is correct and the utilization right, you will certainly reach the goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="23..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->I do not want you to wait life after life to reach your goal. You should realize the goal in this very life. Why will you waste even one precious moment of this life? Therefore fear not, success is yours for the asking. Go on making the correct effort.<!-- /block --></p>

But in a transitional period, when one era is about to end and the next one is yet to dawn, a critical situation arises in social life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->How the Giita&#x301; Addresses a Critical Situation<!-- /block --></p>

What is Bhagava&#x301;n? Bhagava&#x301;n is [He who possesses] the totality of aeshvarya; and in addition yasha, shrii, jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Aeshvarya is the sum total of all [occult] powers &ndash; an&#x301;ima&#x301;, mahima&#x301;, [laghima&#x301;], etc. The Lord ought to have powers. His mission is going to be accomplished [by] the use of His powers. Clumsiness is not going to help.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Another attribute of the Lord is yasha. His greatness is recognized and sung[, but] not by all people. Particularly in a transitional period, there is a sharp polarization. People get divided into two blocs. Some pray to the Lord, and some discredit Him.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The Lord has yet another characteristic, that is, shrii. Shrii denotes &ldquo;attraction&rdquo;. Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is one who attracts. Within the word shrii, sha denotes the mutative principle and ra is [the] acoustic root of energy. &ldquo;Shrii Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;, with this shrii, is &ldquo;the Lord who attracts everybody&rdquo;. ([Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a] has another meaning, [krs&#x301;ibhu&#x301;h] &ndash; that is, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is &ldquo;He because of whom we all are&rdquo;, that is, Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is Parama Purus&#x301;a. We all owe our existence to Parama Purus&#x301;a, just as a fish owes its existence to water.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Two more attributes of the Lord are jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na and vaera&#x301;gya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, or knowledge, is the subjectivization of an objectivity. And regarding vaera&#x301;gya, vaera&#x301;gya is not renouncing the world and going to the Himalayas. Vaera&#x301;gya is derived vi &ndash; ran&#x301;j [+ ghain&#x32D; + vyain]. If in spite of remaining amidst objectivities, a person does not get attached to them, then it is called vaera&#x301;gya. Lead life fully, but keep the mind unaffected by it. Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; is for the living, not for the dead.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Dhr means &ldquo;to [uphold]&rdquo; or &ldquo;to support&rdquo;. Dharma is that which supports life and its properties. Dharma alone stands forward, come what may. The dictates of dharma ought to be heeded. Everything else &ndash; wealth, logic, intellect &ndash; is secondary.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Those who abide by the dictates of dharma are called sa&#x301;dhus. In the traditional sense, a sa&#x301;dhu means a devotee wearing white clothes, with the word da&#x301;sa suffixed to his name, and after whose death the ceremony of shra&#x301;ddha and bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;ra&#x301; is performed.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="25..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->But this is only a traditional meaning of sa&#x301;dhu. Sa&#x301;dhu really means &ldquo;one who abides by dharma&rdquo;. Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a says [in effect]: &ldquo;Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.&rdquo; That is, whatever is required by me may also be required by others. This consideration for others is dharma, and one who acts like this is a sa&#x301;dhu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Dharma is your real friend. So, strengthen dharma when dharma itself starts deteriorating, when life becomes unnatural and [threatens] our destruction; because everything in life has to have its proper place. [When] dharma [is moved from] its place, that is called the gla&#x301;ni of dharma; when dharma gets displaced from its proper position in life, then there is dharma[sya] gla&#x301;nih.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->In our shloka [couplet], bha&#x301;rata means &ldquo;king&rdquo;. That is, one who does bharan&#x301;a. Bhr means &ldquo;to feed&rdquo;. One who feeds life, in the physical, mental and spiritual strata, is a bha&#x301;rata, a king.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Abhyuttha&#x301;na means abhi &ndash; uttha&#x301;na, that is, the &ldquo;ascendancy&rdquo; of adharma. In such a situation the Lord says, tada&#x301;tma&#x301;nam&#x301; srja&#x301;myaham &ndash; that is, &ldquo;I create myself.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Tra&#x301;n&#x301;a is just &ldquo;relief&rdquo;, as one is to give in floods, cyclones, earthquakes, etc., where the tragedy will recur. But paritra&#x301;n&#x301;a means &ldquo;permanent protection or relief&rdquo;. The Lord appears in order to give permanent protection to sa&#x301;dhus. [To build a perennial and just social order is the job of the sadvipras, spiritual revolutionaries.] But when the sadvipras are not able to do their job by their own power, the Lord [creates Himself] and applies His power to that job.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="25..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Vina&#x301;sha is to be differentiated from prana&#x301;sha and na&#x301;sha. Na&#x301;sha means &ldquo;destruction&rdquo;; prana&#x301;sha means &ldquo;transformation of an entity [back to its] original [source]&rdquo;; but vina&#x301;sha means &ldquo;special destruction&rdquo;.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.25.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#25.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="26..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->What is jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na [knowledge]? It is subjectivization of the external objectivity. It leads a person from crudity to subtlety; that is, wherever this tendency is found, that can be termed jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, and where the tendency is not present, [there is no] jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. And what is the base of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na? Where jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na is completely physical, its base is the mind; where it is entirely spiritual, its base is the soul. Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na unifies the mind with the a&#x301;tman; this itself is the greatest quality of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. That jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na which does not unify the mind with the a&#x301;tman, is not jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na but the confusion of jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. Because of this so-called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, vanity creeps into a person. If you see a person with vanity, you must understand that that person has no knowledge, but the confusion of knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the fifteenth century in India, and especially in Bengal, this confusion of knowledge developed excessively. The people of Bengal would keep arguing about minor things. For hours together they would talk about subjects such as sound, shape, etc. They thought themselves to be great in doing so, and the person having victory considered himself to be a great pandit. But these persons were neither pandits nor jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis. They were not pan&#x301;d&#x301;its because they were not established in pan&#x301;d&#x301;a bha&#x301;va [the feeling that one is Brahma], nor were they jin&#x32D;a&#x301;niis, as their knowledge had not been subjectivized. They were arguing about pa&#x301;tra&#x301;dha&#x301;ra taela or taela&#x301;dha&#x301;ra pa&#x301;tra [&ldquo;whether the pot is the container of the oil or the oil is contained in the pot&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->There was once an argument between two great pandits as to whether the sound of a falling palm-fruit is produced first, or the palm-fruit falls first. The discussion continued for a good number of months, but with no decision. They then decided to see practically, sitting under a tree one night, whether the palm-fruit falls first or the sound is produced first. The next morning it was found that both of them had been killed by palm-fruits falling on their heads. Hence this so-called knowledge is not a knowledge at all, but the confusion of knowledge, which you surely do not want to possess.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the first stage, the mind itself is the base of knowledge. What is the mind? The structure of human beings is metazoic. In that structure there are innumerable protozoa, protozoic minds, and protozoic microcosms. The resultant of all these protozoic microcosms is in the human mind. And in this metazoic structure there are metazoic minds, and with them are metazoic microcosms. Actually, each metazoic mind is a collection of [a number of] protozoic minds. For a human with a complex physical structure, there is also a unit mind. So the mind of a human has three compartments: the first is the collective protozoic [mind], the second is the collective metazoic mind, and the third is his or her own separate mind. Taking all three together, we get a human&#146;s unit mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The protozoic minds are guided by instinct only. The protozoic mind is citta only, with no development of aham&#x301;[tattva] or mahattattva. Ingesting food, supporting offspring &ndash; this is all done instinctively, according to their svabha&#x301;va [spontaneously], the reasons being quite unknown to those creatures. The earthworm does not know that it is an earthworm. It moves instinctively, spontaneously, according to its undeveloped mind. The protozoic minds and the protozoic microcosm can be said to be the physical mind. A protozoic creature has only physical mind. The collection of protozoic minds in the human can be said to be the physical mind of the human, known as the [ka&#x301;mamaya kos&#x301;a]. It is guided by instinct, there is no discrimination.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->But the metazoic mind moves with some intellect, or discrimination, as there has been some development of intellect in it. Hence the metazoic mind has control over the protozoic mind. The more the metazoic mind is developed in a creature, the more developed the creature is; that is, a metazoic structure will be more complicated. And where this complication has increased considerably, that physical structure is the human physical structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The individual mind in a human is a metazoic mind. Some one million years ago, the first parents of humanity were australopithecines. The metazoic minds of the then people were very, very simple as compared to those of present-day people. Hence in the intellectual realm, the then people were quite underdeveloped. In the course of this one million years, the metazoic structure and physical structure of humans became very complicated. This resulted in the complication of their metazoic minds, too. Different propensities, a number of propensities, were added to their minds. The number of propensities in the human mind is far more than in animals&#146; minds. The reason is that the metazoic structure, the physical structure, of a human is very complicated, hence the human&#146;s metazoic mind is very developed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->The whole of a person comprises the person&#146;s own mind, the person&#146;s physical mind, and the metazoic minds. But in the protozoic minds there is a dominance of instinct. An animal does not understand discrimination, but the stick. You know that a person within whom there is a dominance of animality does not agree with logic, but [understands discipline].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->You know that at the time of the fight between the Kaoravas and the Pa&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;avas, the latter [tried] very reasonably to make the former understand, but in vain. Yudhis&#x301;t&#x301;hira even prayed to God for a change in them. There was the grace of Parama&#x301;tman also, but they were too crude to understand this. But they could very easily understand when they heard the thundering sound of Ga&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;iiva [the bow of Arjuna]. Hence the protozoic mind succumbs to physical [discipline], and nothing else.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->All the protozoic minds in a human try to influence the human mind. The metazoic minds try to do likewise. Where the personal mind of a human is not vigilant, it becomes influenced by the protozoic minds and the metazoic minds. The person is led towards animality. But when the personal mind is vigilant, it has full control over the protozoic and metazoic minds. To maintain control is an internal fight. This fight is [the] first stage of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. This fight is quite essential for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. On the one side there is dharma buddhi [good thought], and on the other, the forces of instincts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Protozoic minds move instinctively, whereas metazoic minds move with abhijin&#x32D;a&#x301;ta&#x301; [acquaintance, experience]. Hence undeveloped and underdeveloped metazoic structures work with both acquaintance and experience. Sub-human animals such as dogs and monkeys learn through this acquaintance [and experience]. The mind of an Alsatian dog becomes developed a lot when it comes in contact with a trainer; that is, it learns through training, for it has a metazoic mind. The jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na of a protozoic mind, that is, instinct only, is known as &ldquo;physical knowledge&rdquo;. The knowledge that a human acquires in touch with physicality is in its first stage physico-psychic. And when this physico-psychic knowledge becomes established in the mind, it is known as &ldquo;psychic knowledge&rdquo;. And psychic knowledge, when it is translated into the physical world, is psycho-physical knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Worldly knowledge, the confusion of knowledge, is in its first stage physico-psychic, and then psychic. That itself is translated into the physical world, hence it is psycho-physical. And what is the source of this physico-psychic knowledge? &ndash; let us see how far it is authentic. You derive jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na from books. You will read &ldquo;Lahore is the capital of the Punjab&rdquo; in a book twenty-seven years old. But this does not stand correct today. This is because the source of physical knowledge is bound up by time, space, and person. With the change of time, space, and person, physical knowledge will change. Hence it is not a permanent knowledge. It is based on falsehood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->There can be still one more flaw in the source of physical knowledge, and that is a printing mistake. Because of it you read &ldquo;Lahore&rdquo; as &ldquo;Labore&rdquo;. Next, there can be something wrong with your eyes, also, which causes you to read &ldquo;Lanore&rdquo;. These things provoke laughter in the audience.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Hence because of defects in the different media, this knowledge will be wrong knowledge. If with this very knowledge a person is full of vanity, is that person not a first-class fool?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->This physico-psychic knowledge has value to some small extent in the physical world. But its value is always changing. The theory which is appreciated today changes tomorrow. Hence every knowledge in the world &ndash; every physico-psychic knowledge &ndash; is defective. To be proud of this kind of knowledge is not at all the job of the wise. It is better to say, &ldquo;I do not know anything.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->So what is true knowledge? True knowledge is the knowledge of that object which never undergoes any metamorphosis due to changes in time, space, and person. Everything in the world is causal; that is, the effect is followed by the cause, and the cause by the effect. It goes on like this. The effect of one phase becomes the cause of the next. This is known as sadrsha parin&#x301;a&#x301;ma in Tantra. As long as we are under temporal, spatial and personal factors, the cause-and-effect factor will work. Where the cause-and-effect factor works, there only imperfection exists. One cannot be proud [of] the knowledge springing out of that source.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->It is said in the Vedas, &ldquo;I don&#146;t speak [about what] I don&#146;t know, nor do I speak [about what] I do know. Because the Transcendental Entity is known only by the person who knows that Parama&#x301;tman is beyond knowing and not knowing.&rdquo; This is because knowing is a particular psychic projection coming within the scope of time, space, and person. And not knowing is another psychic projection coming within the scope of time, space, and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The Supreme Entity is beyond time, space, and person. It being non-changing, if a person makes an effort to acquire spirituo-psychic knowledge instead of physico-psychic, in order that the source of his or her knowledge be not the external physicality but rather internal spirituality, in that case that knowledge will be a perfect one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->What happens in the case of spirituo-psychic knowledge is that though its source is absolute, its subject is relative, as the mind works within the scope of relativity. The source of spirituo-psychic knowledge is absolute, the only absolute. When humans start acquiring knowledge, they should not endeavour for physico-psychic knowledge, on the contrary they should endeavour for spirituo-psychic knowledge. In spirituo-psychic knowledge, in the first phase there is more of psychic than spiritual. But later on, when mental concentration is gained in and there is advancement in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, the spiritual increases and the psychic decreases. And when gradually the proximity to spirituality increases, the psychic is completely eliminated, and only the spiritual exists. The final, terminating, point of this spirituo-psychic knowledge is spiritual knowledge, and that alone is knowledge. That is the real knowledge which does not change.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->All physical, physico-psychic, psychic, and psycho-physical knowledge is not knowledge, but the confusion of knowledge. When humans realize that that so-called knowledge is of no value to them, then alone do they surrender to Parama Purus&#x301;a [Cosmic Cognition]. As long as people have the desire to acquire all relative knowledge, and try to do so, those people think themselves to be persons of letters, and refuse to surrender at the feet of Cosmic Cognition. When people&#146;s vanity becomes powdered down by different blows, they realize that their approach to knowledge was a defective one. Then they surrender, and their egos are dashed to pieces. The greatest knowledge in the realm of physicality and mentality is that all the knowledge acquired by one so far is false. This physical knowledge is like the leaf of a shala tree [a tall evergreen with large leaves] on which people take meals. As long as you have not eaten, there is a value in the leaf, but the moment you have finished your meal, the leaf goes into the dust bin to be licked by the street dogs. When you come to realize that this physical knowledge of yours is only worth licking by a dog, then devotion will arise in you. Then you will acquire true knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->What is the nature of the psycho-spiritual approach through which one acquires spirituo-psychic knowledge? When the physical mind reaches the zenith of subtlety, that is known as physico-psychic knowledge. There the value of physico-psychic knowledge starts. When one is established in psychic knowledge, then there is the expression of the psycho-physical in it. Likewise, when psychic knowledge reaches the zenith of subtlety, it comes in contact with spirituality, and the point where spiritual knowledge or spirituo-psychic knowledge functions in the mental scope, is alone said to be spirituo-psychic knowledge. As matter is made to be the end of life in acquiring physical knowledge (fit to be thrown into the dust bin), so for acquiring spiritual knowledge, Parama&#x301;tman should be made the end. Then alone will people get real knowledge.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.26.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#26.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->How is it possible to make Parama&#x301;tman the end of your life? Parama&#x301;tman is the subject for the whole of the Cosmos, and the latter is His object. He is the Supreme Subjectivity, you are His object. It is not possible to make Him your object, as you are His object. Then what to do? You have to take the ideation that He is always witnessing you. The wise do not take Parama&#x301;tman as their object exactly, but rather think that they are being witnessed by Him. &ldquo;Parama&#x301;tman is not my object; I am the object of Parama&#x301;tman.&rdquo; When this feeling is constantly there, always there, in a person, the name of this stage is dhruvasmrti. That you are the object of Parama&#x301;tman is known to you, but you do not remember this all the time. When through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; a person never forgets that Parama&#x301;tman is always witnessing him or her, this is named dhruvasmrti. This alone is spiritual knowledge. In this stage alone does a person get true knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->This spiritual knowledge can be translated into the mental sphere as well as into the physical sphere. If a person is willing to translate it, he or she should do so, for that will bring a lot of good to the world. This alone is real knowledge. With this alone, progress is possible. The most learned person is one who understands that he or she is not at all learned.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->You are spiritual aspirants. You must always remember that physico-psychic knowledge is needed only in the physical world. But when [spiritual knowledge] is acquired in the individual life, then it is no longer required.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->This very spiritual knowledge is alone devotion; that is, knowledge finally transforms itself into devotion after constant efforts; that is, when knowledge realizes that nothing is to be effected by it, then alone does it surrender to devotion. When knowledge surrenders to devotion, that is spiritual knowledge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="26..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Hence remember that once you have got devotion, you have got everything. If Parama&#x301;tman asked you your demand, you should demand nothing, and if at all God is pleased to give you something, you should ask for para&#x301;bhakti [absolute devotion].<!-- /block --></p>

<div class=book_chapter_info_top></div>

<a name="27..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Regarding the Sixteen Points, it was said that a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s or senior persons would see if you were observing them properly or not. Similarly, I gave a directive to all that they should keep watch on one another. No one will exempt anyone else regarding the Sixteen Points.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Here I have to say a special thing. If the conduct of senior persons, or ta&#x301;ttvikas  or a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s or avadhu&#x301;t/ika&#x301;s, goes against the Sixteen Points, then you should take silent action. What is silent  action? Suppose there is an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301; who delivers sermons about the dos and don&#146;ts, and issues different decrees. But suppose he or she does something which merits criticism by society &ndash; suppose, for example, that he or she secretly investigates the caste of the potential marriage partner for his/her son or daughter. If this happens, it will be  the duty of the Aca&#x301;rya or Avadhu&#x301;ta or Ta&#x301;ttvika Board to take suitable action. However, it will take time to initiate the action, because facts, evidence and many other things are needed. Until an action based on facts and evidence is taken, you can take silent action against the party.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->What is silent action? Suppose there is a complaint against an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301; and you know for sure that it is valid. The Aca&#x301;rya Board may take two months, four months, or a year to make a decision about this a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. But why should you wait that long for the decision? Under such circumstances you should take silent action &ndash; that is, do not accept the person&#146;s a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya-ship. It is a question of human rights, because Aca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t pa&#x301;t&#x301;hayati yah sah a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryah &ndash;  &ldquo;One who teaches through one&#146;s conduct is an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya.&rdquo; If you cannot learn anything from the conduct and behaviour of a certain person, why should you accept that person as an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Let the Boards do their duty. The Boards have their  functions, and the Aca&#x301;rya Board will certainly take the proper action at the proper time. Meanwhile, you take silent action against the offending a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. And what will be the nature of this silent action? You will disavow the person as an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;; you will not accept the person as an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. I [[vest]] this authority in you. I will never seek any explanation from you as to why you have disavowed the person. Human beings will win honour if they exhibit exemplary conduct.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Although this is not written down as part of any code of conduct, my considered opinion is that if a person fails to marry, or fails to arrange the marriages of his or her brothers, sisters, sons or daughters, according to the revolutionary-marriage system,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> we will not allow the person to become an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. In this way the door will be closed on their becoming, and enjoying the rights of, a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;s. In other words, those who have married according to the revolutionary-marriage system, and those who joined Ananda Marga after their marriages, should arrange the revolutionary marriages of their brothers and sisters. And if their brothers and sisters are already married, then at least they should arrange the revolutionary marriages of their sons and daughters. I think this is a really logical step. There is no place for hypocrites in our organization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Do not indulge in unnecessary criticism of offenders, but immediately take suitable steps, under a certain system, against them. This system should henceforth be called &ldquo;silent action&rdquo;,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.27.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#27.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> do you agree? Although it is silent action, it will force strict adherence to our principles, and it will put those against whom it is directed to shame. It will always take some time for the Board to pronounce its verdict in a case, because it is not easy to arrive at a verdict.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="27..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sincerity is reflected in actions, not in words only. One who displays sincerity in words but not in actions is a hypocrite. You should not tolerate hypocrites, not at all. But do not indulge in criticism. If you criticize too much, that will create internal weaknesses. So carefully abstain from criticism. Instead of criticizing, simply do not accept such persons in practical life. Why? That I have already explained in the definition of a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya, Aca&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;t pa&#x301;thayati yah sah a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryah &ndash; &ldquo;One who teaches through one&#146;s conduct is an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya.&rdquo; If one&#146;s conduct is not exemplary, he or she is not an a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya/a&#x301;. The verdict of the Board in this regard is not your concern.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="28..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->You know, wherever there is any manifestation within or without the scope of the microcosm, there must be mobility. Existence is recognized only by its mobility. Even in the case of inanimate objects, there is mobility. Though their mobility is not effected by individual enterprise, in the Collective Body, that is, in the Cosmic flow of the Macrocosm, there is mobility. On this level of quinquelementality, physical movement is carried out with the help of material projections of the Macrocosmic flow, and internal movement is carried out through individual efforts by the direct stamina of the microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now in our realm of physicality, progress which is brought about with the help of the vital energy, fighting against the inertia of the earth, we call physical progress. But if we are to think of it in terms of a march, for there to be a march there must be some starting point and there must be some culminating point. In this march in the arena of physicalities, we find no starting point and no culminating point. In the physical sphere we try to solve so many knotty problems, but again more knotty problems appear and disturb us. So in the physical sphere, there cannot be any progress. In this realm of physicality, progress is an absurdity. There is movement but there is no progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In the psychic sphere, we solve many mental problems, we march ahead with the help of our microcosmic stamina. But so many socio-economic problems are solved, and again so many socio-economic problems are newly created. That is why I have had no alternative but to accept, in the Fifth [Fundamental Principle] of Prout, changes due to change in time, space, and person. Changes should be according to the change in time, space, and person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="28..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the psychic sphere we are moving, no doubt, but from where to where? What is the goal?

Through this objective adjustment, that is, by making proper use and non-use of association [with physical objects], we are to march towards our subjective Desideratum. In the case of spiritual movement, the goal is there, and what is that goal? The suspension of all physical energies into the microcosmic stamina, and suspension of all microcosmic strength into the spiritual stance &ndash; that is the goal.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="29..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->All living beings in the universe &ndash; animals, birds and humans, all living entities &ndash; have different sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras [mental reactive momenta]. Therefore, no two things are of the same type. Neither will two [plants] be of the same category, nor two birds or animals, nor two humans. Both the physical body and the mental body will be different. No two persons have identical faces. Actions are not the same either. Even sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are not the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Humans are divided into groups on a psychological or an anthropological basis. We say, &ldquo;These people belong to this group&rdquo; or &ldquo;to that group.&rdquo; Among these people some are Austric, some Dravidian, some Negroid, and some Caucasian. But if we observe, there are sub-branches and offshoots of these groups of humans. There are so many branches and sub-branches, that finally we have to accept that each human being belongs to a special group. In each group there can only be one person. Thus there are so many groups. It is not possible to say that so many persons belong to this group or that. (This will be the conclusion from a position of subtler thinking. We can divide humans [into groups] only from a position of crude thinking.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Not only that, the a&#x301;jiiva, or occupation, of every person is different. These occupations are also of two types, crude and subtle &ndash; that is, physical and mental. For example, a person may be a doctor or a lawyer. This is the person&#146;s crude occupation. Like crude occupations, mental occupations are different. Mental occupations, mental a&#x301;jiivas, are known in the sha&#x301;stras [scriptures] as a&#x301;bhogas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Suppose fifty persons are travelling together. They are travelling together, but the a&#x301;bhoga of all of them is not the same. One person is thinking that he has to reach his shop as early as possible. Another person is thinking that she has to reach the court early. In her mind the thought is that of the court. Another person wants to reach a sweet shop to buy rasagolla&#x301;. In that person&#146;s mind the thought is that of rasagolla&#x301;. Thus everyone has a different a&#x301;bhoga and a different a&#x301;jiiva. No two persons can be found having the same a&#x301;jiiva. In other words, crude bodies are different, and similarly the mind and mental feelings. If there is a cowardly man in a village, you cannot say that all the people in the village are cowards. Or if there is a person who is brave, you cannot say that all the people in the village are brave. Everybody has his or her sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, is moving with these sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. With their sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras humans will reach the Para&#x301;gati [Supreme Desideratum, &ldquo;where the journey of finite entities ends&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->These different persons also have different structures. Each will get a structure suitable to his or her occupation. Therefore, no two persons have the same structure. Why? Because each needs a different structure for the expression of his or her sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. If some being has to fly, it will get wings. If some being has to run, it will get legs. Its structure will be like [its sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras]. One who has to do a lot of reading and writing will get a cranium suitable to his or her requirement. That is why it has been said, Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe [&ldquo;all unit entities, all unit structures&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->If somebody wants to bring all under one pattern on the basis of some arithmetic or some social rules, or if all are stamped in the same way, the result will not be good. If we say that the rules for Ram, Shyam, Sohan, and others are all the same, it will not be proper. Why? Because each has a different a&#x301;jiiva and a different structure. How can we bring them all into one class?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->What will then be our duty? We will have to make the kind of arrangement that they need or that should be provided to them. From the point of structure the living beings need a classification which will be given. But from the point of the special a&#x301;jiiva and the special characteristic of the structure, they will have to be given a special status. This is our social dharma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Every human being, every animal, every plant, moves on with its different a&#x301;jiiva and different structure. Moves towards what? Towards the ultimate aim, towards the central point, towards the Vishva Na&#x301;bhi, the Cakra Na&#x301;bhi, the Supreme Nucleus. So they are marching from electronic imperfection towards nuclear perfection. No one can avoid this movement. That is why it is called Para&#x301;gati. They are moving towards the centre, consciously or unconsciously. And who is in the centre? Parama Purus&#x301;a. You cannot live without Him. Some may be angry with Him, unhappy with Him, but no one can live without Him. Why? There is no one who is your own except Him. Parama Purus&#x301;a is more dear to you than you are to yourself. Parama Purus&#x301;a belongs to you more than your hands and legs belong to you. Why? Because you will leave your hands and legs one day, but you cannot leave Parama Purus&#x301;a and go anywhere. Why? Because in this universe there is nothing beyond Him. Where can you go? You will remain within His circle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Assume for a moment that a cow is tied to a stake with a thong or a strip. The thong may be short or long. If it is long, the cow will move relatively far away from the stake; whereas if it is short, she will not be able to go far away as she circles the stake. But in either case she has to go around the stake, considering it as a centre.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Similarly, a person (who is sometimes called ham&#x301;so<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.29.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#29.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->) is moving around [in] Brahma Cakra [the Cosmic Cycle]. The radius of Brahma Cakra is very big, though it is not infinite. People are moving around without knowing who is at the centre. They go around without knowing that they are tethered to a stake. They think that they are everything, that they know so much. They think so much. Each person thinks that he or she is not an ordinary person. This creates pride in a person. One does not know that he or she can be pulled towards the stake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Thus a person moves around the stake. While moving, a question suddenly comes into his or her mind. The person asks where he or she is going. When this sam&#x301;vid, this realization, comes into the mind, then the person realizes that he or she is moving around a stake. The person asks where he or she is going, from which point to which point. Is the line simple and straight, or is it [vrtta&#x301;, a circle]? What is this line? From where comes the inspiration to move around? When this question arises in the mind, the radius starts to be reduced. The person begins to realize that he or she has to go towards the centre, the nucleus, towards the pra&#x301;n&#x301;akendra. The day this realization comes, the person becomes a sa&#x301;dhaka, a spiritual aspirant. The person now knows that the more he or she moves, the more the radius will be reduced. When the radius becomes nil, when there is no vrtta&#x301;, then the person will merge in Parama Purus&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The person will continue moving around the stake as long as the person thinks that he or she, and Parama Purus&#x301;a at the centre, are two different entities. The person will have to go around as long as that person has the feeling that he or she, and the Entity which has sent him/her, are different. When the person realizes suddenly, upon nearly reaching the stake, that he or she, and the Entity which has sent him or her, are not different, the distance between the two will disappear and the two will become one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="29..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->But what must happen first before this union takes place? There His grace, His krpa&#x301;, is needed. When it is available, the oneness will be achieved. People may reduce the radius by constantly moving around, but they will not be able to achieve oneness if His krpa&#x301; is not available. When it is available, a person will merge in Amrta Purus&#x301;a. This is the ultimate aim of all animals, plants, or anything which has a life. Thus a person is unknowingly moving, and will have to move till he or she becomes one with Him. This is the truth. Therefore, the person who comes onto the path of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; early is a wise person and also lucky.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="30..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Every action that is performed produces an equal and opposite reaction, provided the three-fold factors of time, space, and person remain unassailed, unchanged. An incident may take place at 10:00 a.m., but its reaction may not come forthwith, it may come sometime after; and obviously the reaction to the action becomes slightly more than equal. Human beings perform various types of actions &ndash; big or small, good or bad &ndash; and consequently, they are to face the reactions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->As far as we know, human history covers about fifteen thousand years, though its earliest stage was very crude. Human beings have done so many things [during this period] and thereby taken on various sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. Lord Shiva, Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, or, we can say, Parama Purus&#x301;a, has come meanwhile, and helped and blessed suffering humanity. With such blessings, with such Cosmic grace, human beings can go beyond the periphery of karma and attain salvation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->One cannot, by dint of one&#146;s individual efforts, get rid of the heavy load of accumulated reactions to past sins which in Sanskrit is called pra&#x301;rabdha &ndash; for that one needs the grace of the Guru, the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The scriptures say, of course, that one has to do sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, because by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, one trains one&#146;s mind, one can discipline one&#146;s mind. The human mind is just like a lion of the circus. A lion is given adequate training before it is asked to put on its various skilful performances. The human mind can also produce excellent results when it is properly trained and disciplined.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Now I have already said that one must undergo the unsatisfied sa&#x301;mska&#x301;ras, the unquenched sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. In order to attain salvation, one must burn up one&#146;s past sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras. A seed when soaked in water germinates, but if it is burnt up it can never germinate. Every human being must be a dagdhabiija [burnt seed], that is, one whose sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras are totally burnt up. For this, one absolutely needs the grace of the Guru, the grace of Parama Purus&#x301;a. The scriptures say, &ldquo;Just an iota of the Cosmic grace is enough to ensure salvation for unit beings.&rdquo; The main purpose of Dharma Samiiks&#x301;a is to make the jiivas [unit beings] dagdhabiijas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->During the entire period of fifteen thousand years of human history, there has been no Dharma Samiiks&#x301;a&#x301; such as this. There is no mention of any such event in Sanskrit literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->We say that a child is invariably apa&#x301;paviddha, that is, &ldquo;unassailed by pa&#x301;pa, or sin&rdquo;. But however good people may be, they commit some omissional and/or commissional mistakes &ndash; some do it knowingly, some unknowingly, but once they commit pa&#x301;pa, or sin, they cannot retract those mistakes, they have to suffer, they cannot escape the consequences.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Those who have assembled here are surely good people. Some of you have come all the way from five thousand or [ten thousand] miles away. Some have come from the vicinity. There is certainly some subtle reason behind your assembling here. You are all good people &ndash; certainly better-than-average people. That is why you have come. Though there are many, many others who live nearby, they do not come. In my opinion, Parama Purus&#x301;a should do something for these good people. How long can unit beings bear the heavy load of unburnt sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras? So if Parama Purus&#x301;a should take away some of the sins from the unit beings, they will feel relieved of the heavy load and feel lightened. These people, free from the bondages of pa&#x301;pa and sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras, can do many big things. By dint of their collective efforts they will bring heaven down onto this terrestrial earth; they will perform many noble and heroic deeds with courage and valour. Hence Dharma Samiiks&#x301;a is the most epoch-making event of the last fifteen thousand years.<!-- /block --></p>
