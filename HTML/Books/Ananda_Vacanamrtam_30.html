<a name="1..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam (&ldquo;Blissful Discourses&rdquo;) series assembles all the known General Darshan discourses given by Ma&#x301;rga Guru Shrii Shrii A&#x301;nandamu&#x301;rti. General Darshan (GD) speeches, or discourses, were those given to Ananda Marga members, often as a part of the daily routine, in whatever locality Ma&#x301;rga Guru happened to be staying in at the time. Normally briefer and lighter in tone (though no less profound in their fundamental meanings) than the discourses given on the formal occasions of Dharma Maha&#x301;cakra (DMC), these talks were sometimes delivered in a very intimate way to relatively small groups of Margis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->The Ananda Vacana&#x301;mrtam series was begun in 1978 with the GD discourses given by the author at that time; it then kept pace with the GD discourses that the author gave over the subsequent six years. Starting with Part 23, the series has included GD speeches given before 1978. Most of the contents of this present volume is from that earlier period.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In this present volume, ten discourses (most of them quite short) have been assigned to the appendix &ldquo;From the Notebooks of Devotees&rdquo; in the last pages of the book. These are discourses that were recovered in the form of typed discourse notes; or in the form of typed transcripts of tapes where the original tape was no longer available to be checked. It was thought advisable to locate these discourses separately. Writers who wish to quote from these discourses should attribute the material to the &ldquo;Ananda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 30 appendix&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Normally within each Ananda Vacana&#x301;mrtam the discourses appear in chronological order. Although in this volume the appendix has been separated from the main text, within the main text and within the appendix, respectively, the chronological order has been maintained. Note that an interesting series of discourses given by the author in Patna on the 14th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 21st of December, 1971, has been included here &ndash; but since tape recordings are still available only for the first four of these discourses, the last two have been assigned to the appendix.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Under our normal procedures the discourse &ldquo;The Dialogues of Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii &ndash; 5&rdquo; would have been published together with the other 1967 &ldquo;Dialogues of Shiva and Pa&#x301;rvatii&rdquo; in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 23; but this dialogue had not been recovered at the time that that book was published. (Though this dialogue has been numbered &ldquo;5&rdquo;, since four had already been published and numbered, it was not actually the last of the series. It may have been third.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Similarly, &ldquo;Beware of Dogma&rdquo; would normally have been published together with the author&#146;s other 1979 Istanbul discourses in A&#x301;nanda Vacana&#x301;mrtam Part 14. It was not available at the time that book was published, however, so it has been included here.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->To assist researchers, it is our policy to indicate here &ndash; in addition to the original language of each speech, the date and place, by whom it was translated, and where, if other than in this book, it was originally published &ndash; whether or not a tape of the speech is in existence. At the time of this printing, however, not all the cataloguing of tapes has been finished. Further information as to tapes will be given in future printings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the cases of some of the discourses published here, no written record was found of the language in which the discourse was given; but if the language could be clearly inferred from the location and other circumstances of the discourse, we have cited that language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the editors have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Eds.&rdquo; Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Square brackets [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra can be read, &ldquo;the root tr prefixed by ava and suffixed by ghain&#x32D; becomes avata&#x301;ra.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

That the author toured the Philippines in April only is also corroborated by evidence regarding the author&#146;s tour from Indian magazines. So we have dated this discourse and the following one as April, not May, 1969.

No, bondage is bondage, be [the chains] made of gold or iron. The bondage of satkarma [good actions] is that of gold, and that of asatkarma [bad actions], iron. Either of them is to be broken off. One has to refrain from bad actions so that the chains of iron might not be forged; and good actions are to be effected, but what one has to do is to offer the chains made of gold at the feet of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;: &ldquo;I do not desire the fruits of my good actions, O Lord!

Now the question arises whether the reactions will be just [equal] to the actions, or less, or more. Equal and opposite reaction is [the rule], but then, whether the enjoyment of the reaction of actions is purely psychic or physico-psychic is to be seen. Where the action is purely mental, the reaction will be just [equal] to that. But if the action is physico-psychic, the question is, what will be the reaction? Still one thing is there, that if the mind is not affected by the physico-psychic action, nothing happens.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> But [usually] when the reaction is physico-psychic, it has more effect than the action performed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->If it is purely psychic, the reaction will be just equal to it. [But] the reaction of the physico-psychic action does not affect the mind cent per cent. A person enjoys [psychic] reactions just [equal] to the actions performed. If there be some quantity of the reaction of physico-psychic action [that affects the body], in that case, the reaction will be much more than the action performed. The mind will be affected just according to the psychic action &ndash; that is the case with psychic actions. [But] if the action is physico-psychic, some of the reactions [affect] the mind, some [do] not. That which affects the mind is  a psychic reaction, that which does not is physical. Among these reactions, the one that is in the pure physical sphere does not affect the mind. The pure psychic coupled with the [physical] of a physico-psychic reaction add up to produce a greater reaction. So the quantity of reaction in case of a physico-psychic action becomes much greater. Hence one should be careful.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->There are so many grades of sa&#x301;dhaka [spiritual practitioner]. Some say, &ldquo;O Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;, please get my sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras exhausted as soon as possible. Give to me whatever is there.&rdquo; [But] some say, &ldquo;I am ready to bear the fruits of my own [actions] and I am also ready to bear the sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras of others.&rdquo; There are varieties of feeling. Some want to carry the burdens of others so that others might not be in trouble. Sa&#x301;dhakas are at different stages, and their feelings are just according to their stages. While doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, a sa&#x301;dhaka reaches a stage where pu&#x301;rn&#x301;a bhakti [cent per cent devotion] is aroused for Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;. Then one remains unassailed even if a cyclone of misery attacks him or her. One feels maximum torture in the mind, but he or she little cares for it, taking it to be the benediction of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; Himself. Torture is there but he or she derives bliss from it. The sa&#x301;dhaka of that stage is called dagdhabiija [burnt seed]. A dagdhabiija comes within the range of psychic directly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Biija means &ldquo;seed&rdquo;. Wherever a seed is sown, it [sprouts into] a plant; but where the seed is burnt, a plant is not produced. A sa&#x301;dhaka becomes dagdhabiija when he or she has no more pain or pleasure of his or her own. One who has surrendered in toto and has not kept in hand even a single paisa of it, is alone dagdhabiija. All carry their own burdens, but if a dagdhabiija sa&#x301;dhaka so desires, he or she can carry the burdens of others also. And those who want to carry the burden of others do lessen the burden of Parama&#x301;tma&#x301; indirectly. You should remember this.<!-- /block --></p>

Spiritual practice is the means for the expansion of the soul, not for its annihilation; so sama&#x301;dhi does not mean suicide but self-transcendence. One who has known Brahma becomes Brahma Itself, for the unit entity takes on the very form of its object of ideation.

<a name="5..4"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;This human mind is a peculiar entity. It is the cause of all our sorrows and predicaments, and it is the cause of our supreme bliss. It is the cause of bondage, and it is the cause of liberation.&rdquo; Now this mind, working within human framework, requires some pabulum for its maintenance. In the human mind there are fifty such pabula. And these are the human propensities, vrttis.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The existence of these propensities or pabula is essential for maintaining the mind, the mental [stuff]. Because the mind&#146;s position is just between spirit and matter, and that&#146;s why it has been said that the mind is a tat&#x301;astha&#x301; shakti. Tat&#x301;a means, you know, the line where the water touches the land; that point is called tat&#x301;a. If you move towards the water, the next moment where will you be? Underwater. Or if you go upwards, you will reach the dry land. Similarly, if the mind moves upwards, it will be transmuted into spirit; and if it goes towards matter it will be metamorphosed into matter, it will become jad&#x301;a. So it has a connection both with matter and with spirit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The mind&#146;s connection, the mind&#146;s ties, with matter are represented by forty-nine propensities, and the mind&#146;s connection with the spirit is represented by one propensity. Those forty-nine propensities are mundane propensities, and they can function only with the help of interior or exterior organs. And the singular propensity that connects the mind with the spirit is para&#x301;shakti. It is beyond the campus of the organs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->If a person is always encouraging those forty-nine propensities, naturally from human being he or she will be converted into animal, and from animal into crude matter. What is the spiritual aspirant to do? He or she is to encourage that singular entity, that para&#x301;shakti; and that para&#x301;shakti will convert his or her mind into spirit. When that person becomes one with the Lord, then what happens? He or she becomes &ldquo;mindless&rdquo;, because his or her mental stamina is converted into intuitional stamina.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Now the question is whether such a thing is possible for a bad person or a depraved person. You know, the majority &ndash; I won&#146;t say the majority, but a good percentage amongst the general public &ndash; think, &ldquo;We are depraved persons, we are ordinary persons; is it possible for us to transmute our mind into spirit? No, no, that is for maha&#x301;tma&#x301;s [elevated souls], not for us.&rdquo; They think like this.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->But such a mode of thinking is defective, because all these fifty propensities are present in each and every human mind, in each and every microcosm. In a maha&#x301;tma&#x301; those fifty propensities are there; in a dura&#x301;tma&#x301; [wicked person] also those fifty propensities are there. So by regular practice, by implicit faith, and by zealous pursuit, an ordinary man, a depraved person, may also attain that supreme stance. It is not at all an impossibility. One is to withdraw one&#146;s mind from baser propensities and guide the mind towards that singular propensity, para&#x301;shakti. Psychologically, you know, mental repression and mental suppression both are defective.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->You shouldn&#146;t check the flow. You may check the flow to check the flood, but you are to divert that water through different canals. Here also you are to check the flow of your baser propensities and divert it unto that singular propensity, towards the Supreme Self. Sa no buddhya shubhaya&#x301; sam&#x301;yunaktu [&ldquo;Let Him connect our minds with righteousness&rdquo;]. The mind is moving towards so many ashubha [unrighteous] activities.

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The fundamental stuff is the Supreme Cognition. And within the scope of this Supreme Cognition there function three operative principles. [Now, the conation] is a resultant of the never-ending fight of three belligerent principles functioning within the triangle of forces. And you know, regarding these three operative principles, really speaking they are not three principles, they are the same principle, but according to their wavelengths we say that this one, or this particular flow, or this particular vibration, is the sentient principle; and that one is the mutative principle; and the crudest one is the static principle. In the realm of the unmanifest these three forces are fighting with one another, and when they form the triangle, the first triangle of the unmanifest universe, they try to influence the other; and as a result of this mutual fight, these belligerent forces, what do they do? The resultant of that fight comes out from one of the vertices, and we should say that that vertex is the fundamental point of fundamental positivity &ndash; that it is the fundamental positivity &ndash; because from this point starts the creation. And from this point starts His conation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->And this phase of creation, which is commonly known as the extroversial force in philosophy &ndash; there are three portions, three phases &ndash; and the first portion, when it is just coming out from the vertex, is the basic principle. Theoretically it [exists], but practically it cannot be established. In the next phase it moves like a straight line. This first point is called bindu in Tantra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->And then it moves like a straight line. Here something has been created. Spirit is slowly being transmuted, is being metamorphosed, into abstract. Cognition is being transmuted into abstract. A&#x301;tma&#x301; is being transmuted into ma&#x301;nasa. It is called na&#x301;da in Tantra. Bindu, then na&#x301;da. The basic principle and the primordial principle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->And after that, as a result of internal clash and cohesion, that na&#x301;da becomes, is converted into, kala&#x301;. Curvatures are created within its body. It is called kala&#x301;. Whatever we see, whatever we feel, whatever we realize, comes within the scope of this kala&#x301;. That is, this universe is a creation of vibrations of different curvatures. It is a mesh of waves of different lengths. And what are these waves? What is this vibrational principle? It is a conative expression of the Supreme Self. (The subject of discourse is &ldquo;macropsychic conation&rdquo;.) So as a result of this macropsychic conation we get this universe. We get this quinquelemental world. We get these microcosms.<!-- /block --></p>

There are certain propensities which are common both for human beings and animals, but the old idea of logicians that the human is a rational [animal] is not supported by us. We say the human is not a rational animal. If we say the human is a rational animal, then the human comes within the animal category. Yes, the human is a living being, but the human is not an animal.<!-- /block --></p>

The ideological flow is human, it is human life; and where there is no ideological flow it is an animal. But whatever a person is to do &ndash; What is a person to do? A person is to do only spiritual practice, only sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. But to maintain the body that person requires food, requires dress, requires medical treatment, requires education, requires so many things; and these so many things are worldly duties. But when engaged in worldly duties naturally one gets detached from one&#146;s spiritual duty. And that&#146;s why madhuvidya&#x301; [the practice of remembering that everything is Brahma] says that whenever one is to do any worldly work, one is to &ndash; what? Ascribe Brahma-hood, ascribe Na&#x301;ra&#x301;yan&#x301;a-hood, to that worldly duty. So while doing worldly duties, attending to worldly duties, one is not wasting one&#146;s time, one is doing spiritual practice. Because spirituality has been imposed on, has been ascribed to, that worldly work. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->In the beginning, there was sound, and the sound was with God, and the sound was God. You know, amongst different expressions, the expression of sound is the subtlest, subtler even than light, and that is why the karn&#x301;endriya, the ear, is treated as the subtlest organ. Now, these acoustic expressions are of two kinds: one is divine, or spiritual, acoustic expression, and the other is physical acoustic expression. The sound you hear is physical acoustic expression, and similarly there is spiritual acoustic expression in the divine realm, in the spiritual campus. But in the case of the Non-Attributional Entity, in the case of Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, there is no expression, because Nirgun&#x301;a means &ldquo;where there has been no expression&rdquo;. But in the case of Sagun&#x301;a [Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, the Attributional Entity] and even starting from Purus&#x301;ottama [the Nucleus Consciousness], there is expression. And that expression, till it reaches the physical sphere, is spiritual acoustic expression, spiritual sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You know, whenever you think something, you create mental sound. What is thinking? Thinking is mentally speaking. Is it not a fact? You are thinking, &ldquo;Oh, my visa will expire on such-and-such day.&rdquo; Actually you are speaking mentally. Mmmm. And when you speak physically, others can also hear; when you speak mentally, others may or may not hear. [Much laughter among the audience.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now, one may catch this physical sound according to the capacity of one&#146;s acoustic organs, one&#146;s ears. You cannot catch  very short or very long sounds. Similarly, in the inner sphere there are several stages, several strata, several phases; and when the inner senses develop by dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, one will hear that divine sound, that inner sound. It is known as the sound of silence. The what? The sound of silence. And it is what is known as on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra in Sanskrit &ndash; pran&#x301;ava or on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When those inner senses develop, then in the first phase sa&#x301;dhakas [spiritual aspirants] can hear the sound, that inner sound, that inner voice, that divine sound. In the first phase it is like the sound of crickets. [Imitates the sound.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->You know, the cricket is an insect that creates a pauseless sound [imitates] in the fog. You have seen [it in] open fields, particularly in the rainy season. Mmmm&#8230; one will hear a cricket sound.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Then in the next phase, as if somebody is dancing with ghun&#x32D;ghur [ankle bells]. (You know, ghun&#x32D;ghur &ndash; you use it during the ta&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;ava dance. In Sanskrit it is called nupur.) Next you will hear the sound of flutes &ndash; as if somebody is playing a flute. Then the sound of the ocean, you know? A particular sound is created by the sea. And then, in the fifth phase, tam&#x301;, tam&#x301;, just like bells, the sound of bells. And finally, the sound is just like oon&#x32D;n&#x32D;n&#x32D; &ndash; the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra in pure form. And after that there remains no sound, because after that there ends the realm, the scope, of Sagun&#x301;a. After that there is the scope of Nirgun&#x301;a. In the realm of Nirgun&#x301;a there cannot be any sound, because there cannot be any expression. Not even divine expression, not even supra-psychic expression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->By dint of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, in the last phase you will hear the sound, the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra &ndash; oon&#x32D;n&#x32D;n&#x32D;. You will hear that sound. It is known as the on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra or pran&#x301;ava. In the Vedas it has been said, Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma [&ldquo;Brahma is of the same nature as pran&#x301;ava&rdquo;]. When one can hear that pran&#x301;ava, in the next phase one will come in contact with Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma. That&#146;s why pran&#x301;ava is called Pran&#x301;ava&#x301;tmakam&#x301; Brahma. Pra&#x301; &ndash; nu + al = pran&#x301;ava. Pran&#x301;ava means that entity that helps the sa&#x301;dhaka to come in contact with Parama Purus&#x301;a. In Sanskrit another name for pran&#x301;ava is Shabda Brahma &ndash; Brahma expressed as shabda. Shabda means sound. So a day will come when this pran&#x301;ava will become a crude reality for you. Now, for some of you, pran&#x301;ava is in dreamland [much laughter], [but actually] it is a crude reality.<!-- /block --></p>

But due to constant reflection and [re]fraction (you know that each and every movement, even the movement of spirituality in the realm of the psychic and physical world, undergoes certain changes due to constant reflection and refraction), a time comes when those movements lose their speed, their acceleration, and get retarded. And under such circumstances that jagatguru is forced to [come] in a quinquelemental structure and forced to take the shape of prapain&#x32D;cadeha [quinquelemental structure]. And in our philosophy we call Him Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti, the Maha&#x301;sambhu&#x301;ti of Ta&#x301;raka Brahma [Liberating Brahma]. He comes, and again and again He plays the role of guru in the realm of physicality, and this has been happening again and again since time immemorial. We got Lord Shiva and we got Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. So The Supreme Entity, Ta&#x301;raka Brahma, is the only guru. There cannot be a second guru.<!-- /block --></p>

Just now I explained that one should move towards the spiritual desideratum without any hesitation, without any fear, without being goaded by any other of our propensities. That is the human way, that is the way of shreya [the path of supreme well-being]. Hence Lord Shiva says, &ldquo;The third requisite factor is gurupu&#x301;janam.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

If a poor man suffers from an inferiority complex before a rich man, he will use the term huzur a thousand times in a sentence. And before a poor man, a rich man will suffer from a superiority complex.

Is it not a fact? A spiritual aspirant must not suffer from any of these complexes. One should not have any inferiority complex or any superiority complex.

They come from the same origin [as all]; they are of the same Father. So why should a person suffer from any inferiority complex? Again, you should not suffer from a superiority complex, because all are your brothers and sisters. All are the glorious children of that Supreme Father.

A person should do work and while doing work should remember that whatever one is doing is meant for self-realization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->If a person is doing sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; just for self-realization, no matter that the world is going to hell, will we not call such a person utterly selfish? If one is not doing service to humanity  and has no concern for them and is engaged only in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; for self-realization, then he or she deserves to be called self-seeking despite his or her spiritual longing. So it has been said, A&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca. This is the purpose of life. You take much service from the world, by way of subsistence and maintenance, which you must return, or else you accrue a debt. If you are burdened with a big loan at the time of death, what will happen? You will have to be reborn in order to repay your debt with interest.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->You take service from the world, therefore you can ill afford not to give something to the world; and you will receive interest in case you give more than you take. It is, of course, your prerogative to accept or not to accept the interest. But you have no such prerogative regarding the repayment of the debt. You will have to repay it. Remember, you have come to this world to render service to it &ndash; to render service to the world, and to practise the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of self-realization. [But] those who do only the sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; of self-realization, and refrain from social service, cannot make any headway in their sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. The two are invariably dependent upon each other.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->What does it mean to be human? According to one old school of thought, a human being is a rational animal. But in our philosophy, human beings are not regarded as animals. Why call them rational animals? Mere possession of life does not mean one is an animal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->One with life [of a lower order] is called ja&#x301;nvar [animal] in Persian. There are many suffixes in Persian such as da&#x301;r, var, gar, and so on. For example, those bargaining (saoda&#x301;) are called saoda&#x301;gar; those possessing life (ja&#x301;n)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> are called ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r [living being]; one who invades (hamla&#x301;) is called hamla&#x301;bar [an invader]; a demonstrator of magic (ja&#x301;du) is called ja&#x301;dugar [magician]. So the existence of life makes one a ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r, but one does not become a ja&#x301;nvar [animal] simply due to being ja&#x301;nda&#x301;r [living]. Precisely for this reason I do not support the contention that humans are rational animals.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->We say that human life is an ideological flow. Life should have an ideal, and when the movement is towards that ideal, we call it human. Where there is no ideal, nor any movement towards an ideal, we cannot call a life human in spite of any human appearance it may have. So appearance is not the criterion for recognizing humans. In fact we find some persons having more bestiality than the beasts themselves. Beasts do not wage world war. They do not inflict injury on the innocent. So where there is no ideology one becomes worse than a beast. Hence human life is an ideological flow.<!-- /block --></p>

You have to move giving proper treatment to the objects of the external world. There must be subjective approach, but at the same time objective adjustment; that is, adjustment with the objective world is essential though one&#146;s movement is towards supreme subjectivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->When Prakrti is in a balanced state, She is called simply Prakrti. When this balance is lost, She is called Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. In Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, when tamogun&#x301;a [the static principle] is predominant, it is called Avidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, and when sattvagun&#x301;a [the sentient principle] is predominant, it is called Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="12..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->And the state of those with sole concern for Vidya&#x301;ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is still worse. They live in the world &ndash; take food, clothes and service from the world &ndash; and, like hypocrites, declare that there is no world. They say, &ldquo;All this is unreal. Give it up.&rdquo; They preach to give up this unreal world, but they themselves eat the food, drink the water and wear the clothes of this unreal world &ndash; yet still say that the world is unreal. What state are they in? You know that the owl rules the night. It is powerful only during the night. When the sun rises it cannot see anymore &ndash; so it gives no recognition to the sun, it denies the existence of the sun. Likewise, through sheer hypocrisy, some call the world unreal, though they are very much dependent on it to remain alive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->One is a hypocrite who escapes into vidya&#x301; alone and says, &ldquo;I shall do only sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;.&rdquo; If there is no world, from where does one derive the means of sustenance? Suppose a man has renounced the world and has gone to live in a Himalayan cave. There too he will have to eat. He is sitting and constantly thinking that there are fruits on a particular tree. &ldquo;I saw some the previous evening.&rdquo; He proceeds to the tree and finds the fruits still there. He thinks, &ldquo;I must pluck them, otherwise they may be plucked by another sa&#x301;dhu [spiritual aspirant].&rdquo; See, he is practising hypocrisy. Or else he is thinking, &ldquo;I have renounced my home and hearth, but maybe my cousins have let their buffaloes into my field and they are grazing the crops.&rdquo; Thinking all these things, what does he become? He becomes a hypocrite. That is why it is said that paying attention only to vidya&#x301; leads to greater darkness.<!-- /block --></p>

Sannya&#x301;sins<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> practise a&#x301;tmamoks&#x301;a&#x301;rtham&#x301; jagaddhita&#x301;ya ca. These sannya&#x301;sins are not the ones living for their bellies alone. They are serving the society. Those serving this world do not strive for vidya&#x301; alone; they also serve the world. This should, in fact, be done not only by sannya&#x301;sins, but by family people as well.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->What is the difference between the two?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->The life of a householder is a little troublesome. Why is it? A householder has two families &ndash; small as well as big. What is the small family? It includes one&#146;s parents, sisters, brothers, spouse, and other relatives such as aunts, uncles and so on. The Indian family is a [relatively] big one. In the Indian tradition, even the sisters of one&#146;s father and mother are included in the family. This is one&#146;s small family.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->And the big family is the whole universe and its suffering humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->What does a householder have to do? He or she has to maintain a balance between the two families. One invariably has to look after and expend for the small family, and, simultaneously, work for the big family. If one devotes all one&#146;s time and energy to the small family, totally ignoring the big family, one becomes a fallen and degenerated householder. Likewise, if one pays attention only to the big family and neglects the small family consisting of one&#146;s parents, brothers, sisters, etc., then again one falls.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Just see how difficult it is to keep adjustment between the two. A wife will be annoyed if a husband donates much money [to social service]. Therefore he donates twenty-five rupees with the wife&#146;s knowledge and another twenty rupees without her knowledge, and thus establishes adjustment. Sannya&#x301;sins need not establish adjustment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->You know our workers<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.12.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#12.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> have to collect [donations of] paddy, wheat, and so on for the children of our [children&#146;s] homes. The workers say that if they visit the farmyard, the farmer donates a bigger quantity, but if they are delayed and have to collect from the farmer&#146;s house, the farmer&#146;s wife donates a little less. Thus the householder has to maintain adjustment between the two. But the sannya&#x301;sin has only one family &ndash; the big family &ndash; so there is no question of adjustment there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Those who go by vidya&#x301; alone, that is, who endeavour only for self-realization, and deny the objective world (although in reality they cannot deny it since they have to eat, wear clothes and bathe) have been called hypocrites in the scriptures.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->And those who go by avidya&#x301; alone, guided by materialistic theories, like the materialists of the present age, what state are they in? Andham&#x301; tamah pravishanti ye&#146; vidya&#x301;mupa&#x301;sate &ndash; &ldquo;They gradually move from light into darkness.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->What is materialistic philosophy? It is the product of an undeveloped brain. And what are its consequences? Those who follow it gradually move towards darkness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->A person becomes like his or her is&#x301;t&#x301;a [goal] and talks only about that. For example, Shabda Brahma [Brahma expressed as sound; on&#x32D;m&#x301;ka&#x301;ra]. The first singer and dancer of India and of the world was Sada&#x301;shiva. He talked about Shabda Brahma. He named it na&#x301;da. His existence was indeed sonic. Likewise, one who thinks about matter will one day become matter. This is the natural law. The businessman who always thinks, &ldquo;money, money,&rdquo; will never again be born as a human. He will not be born as a dog, goat, or sheep, either. After death he will become money, and will remain confined in the box of a businessman. That was indeed his goal. So materialistic philosophy converts one into matter. After death, materialists will become shirts or wine according to the objects of their thinking.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->The greatest wealth of a human being is his or her intellect. One should not drink. Why? Because drinking destroys the intellect. In the natural state, one thinks many thoughts in his or her unconscious mind. Knowledge is stored in the unconscious mind. One thinks in the unconscious mind and controls one&#146;s actions through the conscious mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Suppose there is a beggar in Nagpur city. He imagines that he is the emperor of Delhi. But since his conscious mind says, &ldquo;No, you are not the emperor of Delhi, you are the beggar of Nagpur,&rdquo; he does not say it openly. But if he drinks wine, his conscious mind stops functioning. Due to lack of control over his conscious mind, walking along the road he will say aloud, &ldquo;I am the emperor of Delhi.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Intellect controls every action of a person, but drinking destroys it. That is why wine is a bad thing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Materialism is equally bad. It too destroys the intellect and converts it into bricks and stones. Therefore materialistic philosophy is more dangerous for the society even than a dacoit. You have to fight against materialistic philosophy tooth and nail, for it is the greatest enemy of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->[In one sense,] materialists are led into greater darkness [than the escapist sa&#x301;dhus]. Light obeys a rule: when scattered, it divides into seven colours &ndash; violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. Accordingly, there are seven lokas [levels of the Cosmic Mind]. The unmanifest universe above the seven lokas does not have kala [seed]. Brahma at this stage is called niskala [without seed]. And this, our world, is sakala [with seed]. This [world] is Sakala Brahma and that [state] Niskala Brahma. Now what exists beyond the seven worlds? Only white effulgence and no colour. White is not a colour. The combination of all colours is white.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="12..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Similarly there are [mythologically] seven worlds [netherworlds, hells] below bhu&#x301;rloka: tala, atala, vitala, tala&#x301;tala, pa&#x301;ta&#x301;la, atipa&#x301;ta&#x301;la and rasa&#x301;tala. Rasa&#x301;tala is the lowest of all. The colour of all these seven worlds is black. Black is no colour. Want of colour is black, so there we find blackness. (But there are degrees even in blackness; all blackness is not the same. For instance, even the [blackest-skinned] people belonging to the Austric race are not as black as Negroes.

<a name="13..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Human Expressions<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->First, human expressions. Each and every living entity expresses something from its central point. Human expressions are, in that respect, many in the physical stratum: you sing, you laugh, you work, you do so many things. But all these expressions come from a single entity and a single controlling point. There are several sub-stations, but the controlling station is the same.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->I said in Timmern [Germany] that the controlling one is called the noumenal entity and the expressed ones are the phenomenal entities. You are one boy, Liila&#x301;nanda &ndash; Liila&#x301;nanda speaks, he dances, he jumps, he swims, he rolls on the ground &ndash; all those expressions are his phenomenal expressions. But his entity, the controlling entity, the entity from which so many actional waves emanate, is what? In this respect, in the small world of Liila&#x301;nanda, Liila&#x301;nanda is the noumenal entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the sphere of criminology the noumenal entity is falsehood, and all other corrupt practices, all other criminal activities, are phenomenal expressions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the case of falsehood [as the noumenal entity], sin and crime coincide. In all other [cases] there are two different entities.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.13.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#13.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> That which is not supported by the law of the land is called crime, and that which is not supported by cardinal human principles is sin. But you know, the law of the land is a creation of certain persons of the land, that is, of those who are elected or selected, representative or king. There are so many people who create the law of the land. Their decision may or may not be correct, but the definition of crime varies from country to country, locality to locality. In America, in the USA, the definition of crime varies from state to state, even in the same country.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->You know in Japan, to commit suicide is neither a sin nor a crime. In India to commit suicide is a sin under certain circumstances, not always: when one commits suicide for the welfare of a large number of the populace, then it is not treated as sin; when it is a personal issue, it is treated as sin. And so far as crime is concerned in India, it is a crime to try to commit suicide, but it is not a crime to commit suicide. If one is trying to commit suicide, he or she [can be punished] by the government. In Britain [if one tries] to commit suicide, it is a crime, and if one commits suicide, even then it is a crime, and in that case also the person will be punished &ndash; his or her property will be forfeited. Do you follow?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The definition of crime varies from land to land, but the cardinal human values are the same, not only for this planet but everywhere in the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Just now I said that it is falsehood [a noumenal cause] where sin and crime coincide. Now in the case of human expressions, a single entity, a person, is the noumenal cause, and there are so many phenomenal expressions. All those phenomenal expressions depend on the single noumenal entity and on the standard of the noumenal entity. If a person is good, his or her expressions are also good. So what we require is that the standard of each and every human being be raised. If all the bricks of the room are strong, the room will also be strong; so if all the individuals are strong, if at least they are moralists, all humanity will be benefited by it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->(1) Now there are so many human expressions in the physical stratum. We do so many things, and for these human expressions in the physical stratum we have got a physical body. A human body is the most complicated biological structure. There are so many propensities in the human mind, and for expression of many propensities in the psychic stratum there are so many nerve cells, so many centres of activity, so many nuclei in the realm of the mind. And for outer expression and for reception of waves from outer worlds, human bodies have got so many nerve fibres &ndash; a human body is the most complicated biological structure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->(2) And humans have been blessed with certain excellent structures. There is a heaven-and-hell difference between an animal body and a human body. The most developed animal bodies &ndash; those of apes of certain groups &ndash; are very developed, but there is a heaven-and-hell difference between their bodies and a human body, and it is [not] very difficult to find the difference between the most developed animal and the most undeveloped human being. So the human body is not only physical but is an excellent medium of higher psychic expressions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->(3) And the third human expression which is lacking in other animals is the spiritual expression. A person who has high taste in the aesthetic sphere may forget eating and drinking, and a person who has developed deep love for the Supreme Being forgets all his psychic pursuits even. If you insult a dog, and the next moment call the dog to take food, it will accept that food from your hands. But if you insult a person and ask that person to take food, even a very delicious food, he or she, in order to maintain prestige, or save himself or herself from humiliation, will not accept. Human beings even commit suicide due to psychic pressure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Animals, low-grade animals, also sometimes commit suicide. Certain aquatic animals commit suicide. But that is not due to psychic pressure, it is due to inborn instinct. Whales of certain groups and mice of certain groups do commit suicide, collective suicide.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Now human expressions are trifarious &ndash; physical expression, psychic expression and spiritual expression. The spiritual expression is the highest and subtlest expression of human existence. And here lies the speciality of humans. In the physical stratum each and every human being is a species. Nobody is just like others. Even in a small family, brothers and sisters vary from one another. No two face-cuttings are the same. On the psychic level humans are divided into several kinds of ideologies, and they fight amongst themselves, just for ideology, and ideology remains in some sphere of abstraction, and they quarrel amongst themselves. They quarrel regarding religion, regarding different isms with different views, regarding sports. One person will say, &ldquo;My team will win,&rdquo; while another will say, &ldquo;But my team [can] fight&rdquo; &ndash; in football or any other sport. And there was one very important play in Spain, toros or something like that &ndash; &ldquo;bullfighting&rdquo;. People were very much interested in it, and they [the fans] used to fight amongst themselves, and it is not a physical fight, it is a psychic fight. But in the realm of spirituality there cannot be any fight, because the Supreme Goal is one, a singular entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So spiritualism, rather spirituality, is not only the highest and noblest human speciality, but is the only unifying point, the only unifying platform, for the entire human society. There may be so many human races   Negroid, Austric, Mongoloid, Caucasian. Amongst Mongolians there are so many Malays, Japano- and Sino- [blendings], Tibeto-Indians, so many of those. Amongst Caucasians there are Nordics, Scandinavians; Alpines in middle Europe; Mediterraneans in Italy, south France, Spain and Portugal. But human society is a singular entity &ndash; humans belong to the same society. So here the Supreme Noumenal Entity is the spiritual nave. Now humans of this last portion of the twentieth century should strengthen that nave, should strengthen that Supreme Noumenal Entity, and on the basis of this Supreme Noumenal Entity lies their universal fraternity &ndash; they are children of the same Supreme Father. The Supreme Progenitor is one; His children are many in number. If the children quarrel amongst themselves on petty affairs, this will certainly not satisfy the Supreme Father. He has given humans, that is, the human body, a developed cranium, a developed brain, developed nerve cells and nerve fibres. Humans should utilize them properly. There should be maximum utilization of all your assets, and by utilizing your assets, you, in your individual and collective capacities, will be assets to human society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Human Movement<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now, human movement. What is movement? Movement means change of place. This bolster is here; I bring it here. There is change of place. So I have done some work; some action has been done. Insofar as actions and expressions are concerned, that is, human approaches are concerned, they are four in number:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->(1) [Regarding human existence] in the physical stratum, whatever you do in the physical stratum is your physical activity. Whatever you do to maintain your body, to maintain your life, to maintain proper security of individual and collective life, is your physical action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->(2) Then again, you are not merely an animal: simply eating, drinking and sleeping is not everything for a human. A human has a subtler life, a more charming life, a more fascinating life, so your physical existence moves towards your psychic existence, and this movement is your [quest] for higher life, your [quest] for subtler life, that is, your physico-psychic movement, starting from the physical level and moving towards the psychic level. Your physico-psychic activities are architecture, literature, dance, music &ndash; they are all your physico-psychic movement. And this movement is from crude to subtle, starting from the cruder arena and moving towards the subtler arena. That&#146;s why in Ananda Marga I encourage this physico-psychic movement: because it will help you in moving towards the subtler world, in moving towards the supreme spiritual goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->(3) Then the third human [movement] is on the pure psychic level. Your thought-waves, your subtler thoughts, your aesthetic tastes, they are all your psychic movement. For physico-psychic movement, I encourage boys and girls to start work in the RAWA [Renaissance Artists&#146; and Writers&#146; Association] movement. You know, to work in RAWA, high-grade intellect is not necessary. But for pure psychic movement, pure psychic development, higher intellect is necessary. And in that realm also humans are to be encouraged, because it is even subtler than physico-psychic movement &ndash; it is pure psychic movement. And for that I encourage the intellectuals of Ananda Marga to form RU [Renaissance Universal] Clubs. Let there be psychic development, let there be clashes and cohesions in the realm of intellect. This will help a person to move from crude to subtle. This is the third expression of the human actional faculty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="13..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->(4) And the last one is psycho-spiritual movement. In psycho-spiritual movement, the action starts on the intellectual level and ends on the spiritual level. And when this movement, this psycho-spiritual development, crosses the last boundary of the sentient principle, that intellectual movement, that is, that intellectual-spiritual progress, is converted into intuitional progress &ndash; that is, you come within the arena of intuition. For intuition you do not require any brain, any nerve cell or any nerve fibre. Where intuition is developed, you become one with Parama Purus&#x301;a, you become omniscient, that is, all-knowing; you do not even require any physical body. You need not go through so many books; the universe is within you, you are all-knowing. You will know the history of Spain without going through books; you will know the geography of Italy without going through books. That is, when your existence comes in close proximity to the existence of Parama Purus&#x301;a, the two nuclei coincide, you get what you want, and that is called salvation.<!-- /block --></p>

We are all knowingly or unknowingly moving towards Him; so human society cannot have more than one creed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Can there be more than one creed? No. Those who say that there are so many creeds in society are actually &ndash; they do not resort to truth. I will not say they resort to falsehood, because they are also gentlemen and ladies.

<a name="14..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The second thing, you see, people may say there are so many religions. No, there is only one religion, not so many religions. And that religion is sana&#x301;tana dharma, ma&#x301;nava dharma, Bha&#x301;gavata dharma. That is, what is religion? The goal is attainment of Godhood, to be one with the Supreme Father, to come near the Supreme Father, to enjoy the supreme bliss. That is the goal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="14..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->So can there be more than one religion? No. Those who say like this are not religious people.

<a name="14..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Class. Is it a creation of the Supreme Entity? All classes, say in the sense of economic classes, rich, poor, etc. &ndash; are they God-given or man-made? What are they?<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="15..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->So many times I said that human existence is an ideological flow. You know, plants, animals and humans all are living beings, but there are certain differences amongst them. Plants cannot move, cannot walk, and certainly they are underdeveloped &ndash; they have underdeveloped intellect. They have got intellect, but less development. And in the case of animals, they can move, and they have got a bit developed intellect. In the case of animal life, life means physical pleasure &ndash; eating, sleeping, dying. But in the case of humans, it is an ideological flow. That is, a human can desert anything and everything for the sake of his or her ideology. A human can die for the sake of his or her ideology. But animals have got no such ideology, no goal of life; it is a goal-less movement. Animals&#146; movement is a goal-less movement, moving only to get food.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->You are all human beings. The old Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;avas said (vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava means &ldquo;universalist&rdquo; &ndash; Vis&#x301;n&#x301;u means &ldquo;Universal Lord&rdquo;, and vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava means &ldquo;universalist&rdquo;),<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..3"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a bhajiba&#x301;r tare sam&#x301;sa&#x301;re a&#x301;inu;<br>Miche Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;y baddha haye vrks&#x301;asama hainu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..4"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->[I came to the world to worship Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, but I have become bound by illusion and become like a tree.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a is the ideological goal for each and every human being. Human life is for &ndash; what? Moving towards that supreme nucleus personality. One boy told me that his name is Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a Da&#x301;sa, that is, &ldquo;serving Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a&rdquo;. A very good name. A person comes for what purpose? To do according to the desire of the Supreme Lord, to do according to the desire of God, the Supreme Desideratum of human beings. But due to [dis]tractions, due to deviations, [some people] live like ordinary animals. If a person does not move towards his or her ideological goal, he or she is just like an animal. But in my opinion that person is not just like an animal, that person is worse than an animal. Because animals are deficient in intellect, they do not know what to do, how to do, why to do &ndash; but humans know, so [if they do not serve God] they are worse than animals. So I say,<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..6"></a><p class="Para_Sloka"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Miche Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;y baddha haye vrks&#x301;a&#x301;dhama hainu.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..7"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->[I have become bound by illusion and become worse than a tree.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In Sanskrit vrks&#x301;a or vrks&#x301;a [giving Tantric and Vedic pronunciations] means &ldquo;plant&rdquo;, &ldquo;tree&rdquo;. Now, human life is an ideological flow, and ideological flow means moving towards the Nucleus of this Cosmological system, of this entire universe. (You know about &ldquo;nucleus&rdquo;: In the case of our ethereal system, the earth is the nucleus, and the moon moves around the earth. In the case of our solar system, the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets and satellites are moving around the sun, knowingly or unknowingly. Similarly, for the entire Cosmos Parama Purus&#x301;a is the nucleus, and everybody is moving around Him, knowingly or unknowingly. This is the ideological flow.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now while moving towards that Supreme Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Supreme Nucleus, of the Cosmos, one is to remember eight points. Lord Buddha said these eight points are as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The first important point is samyak darshana. Darshana means &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo;. A person should have &ndash; should be guided by &ndash; proper philosophy. The philosophy is the guideline, and a person is to move as per the philosophy. What to do, what not to do; what are the dos of a perfect human and what are the don&#146;ts. Samyak darshana. So a person must have a proper philosophy. Unless and until a person knows the proper philosophy, how is he or she to do [the right thing]? If you are to go to, say, Rangoon, you will move accordingly, but if you don&#146;t know where to go, how can you move? So a proper philosophy of life, a proper darshana, is a primordial necessity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->But can a philosophy guide a person if the person is sleeping? If his or her potentiality is in latent form or dormant form, it cannot. A human moves, a human can move, by what? By his or her propulsive propensity. There must be a propensity guiding us &ndash; a propulsive propensity in order to move. So for this a person requires a strong determination &ndash; &ldquo;I must move. I must move.&rdquo; And then do it. There must not be any negative thought in the mind. &ldquo;Will it be possible for me to do?&rdquo; &ndash; such a question must not arise in the mind, and whenever there is such a question, it means you will not be successful in your mission. Your thinking should always be positive: &ldquo;Yes, I must be successful.&rdquo; There must not be any question regarding your success. Lord Shiva said, Phalis&#x301;yatiiti vishva&#x301;sah siddherprathama laks&#x301;an&#x301;am &ndash; &ldquo;The first factor for attaining success is the firm determination that &lsquo;I must be successful.&rsquo;&rdquo; And Lord Buddha said the second factor is samyak sam&#x301;kalpa, that is, proper determination. (Here the word is samyak; in Sanskrit samyak means &ldquo;proper&rdquo;. Samyak sam&#x301;kalpa.) One may say, &ldquo;I will be the greatest thief.&rdquo; That is not proper sam&#x301;kalpa. [laughter] But sam&#x301;kalpa should be proper &ndash; proper determination, firm determination. &ldquo;I must be an asset to human society&rdquo; &ndash; this type of determination.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Then the third thing is samyak va&#x301;k. You know, human beings have got two types of organs, that is, five afferent and five  efferent &ndash; karmendriya and jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nendriya in sanskrit. Now the collection of karmendriyas is known as va&#x301;k &ndash; doing something, thinking something, saying something &ndash; that is, wherever there is external expression. That is called karmendriya. And wherever there is internal movement, taking something from the outside world, it is called jin&#x32D;a&#x301;nendriya. Samyak va&#x301;k &ndash; that is, whatever you are to do, whatever you are to speak, whatever you are to touch, it should be of proper order. It is the third direction for a person who moves along the ideological flow. Samyak va&#x301;k.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The fourth point is samyak a&#x301;jiiva. A&#x301;jiiva has two meanings. A&#x301;jiiva means &ndash; the actual meaning of the word is &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;. But occupation may be of two types &ndash; physical occupation, earning money, and psychic occupation, that is, the object of thinking.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So one must have a clean occupation, that is, one must not do anything antisocial, one must not encourage anything antisocial, anything that goes against collective interest. That is samyak a&#x301;jiiva in physical sphere. One may earn money by selling wine. One may earn money by stealing. These are not samyak a&#x301;jiiva. Your occupation should be neat and clean &ndash; not going against the interest of the society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->And the second a&#x301;jiiva is psychic a&#x301;jiiva, psychic occupation. For &ldquo;psychic occupation&rdquo; there is a special term in Sanskrit; it is a&#x301;bhoga. In English you may say &ldquo;psychic pabulum&rdquo;. (English or Latin? Latin.) That is, suppose one&#146;s object of thought is a thief, what will happen? What is the psychic process? When you think something, your mind is then and there divided into two parts. One is the subjective part, and the other is the objective counterpart. And when you are thinking of a bad man, or a thief, what will happen? The objective counterpart of your mind will take the form of that thief, will take the form of that bad man, and slowly what will happen? Your subjective counterpart of the mind, that is, seer portion of the mind (one portion is seer and the other portion is seeing) will be slowly converted into that bad man, and slowly you will become a bad man. So a bad man must not be your object of ideation, should not be your object of meditation. If you think of a bad man, you will become a bad man.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->You know, there is a particular insect in India, it is called peshaskrt. It kills cockroaches. You know the cockroach, that red insect? Yes. And cockroaches are very much afraid of that insect. So when a cockroach sees that insect, that insect becomes its object of ideation; that is, its objective counterpart of the mind becomes, takes the form of &ndash; what? [The peshaskrt.]And what happens? Slowly the body of the cockroach is converted into the body of that peshaskrt. That is, the cockroach itself is converted into the form of its killer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->So your psychic a&#x301;jiiva should also be very pure. And what is the best psychic a&#x301;jiiva? Parama Purus&#x301;a. Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a, Parama Purus&#x301;a, is the best a&#x301;jiiva. And if Parama Purus&#x301;a becomes the objective counterpart of your mind, then slowly what will happen? Your very existence will be converted into Parama Purus&#x301;a. So the fourth instruction was samyak a&#x301;jiiva. A&#x301;jiiva means occupation. (Jiivika&#x301; in modern Sanskrit.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Then the fifth instruction was samyak vya&#x301;ya&#x301;m. Vya&#x301;ya&#x301;m, you know? Vya&#x301;ya&#x301;m means &ldquo;exercise&rdquo;. Physical exercise, you know? And there are also instrumental exercises and so many exercises&#8230; But here, just as with physical exercises, you should undergo psychic exercises to strengthen your mind. So you must have, you must practise, what? Psychic exercise also. Physical exercise will make you strong, strong like a rhinoceros, strong like an elephant, but not strong in mind, strong in spirit. A human cannot be stronger than an elephant or rhinoceros in physical strength; it is not possible. So you must practise psychic exercise &ndash; in Sanskrit ma&#x301;nasik vya&#x301;ya&#x301;m. &ldquo;Psychic&rdquo; is ma&#x301;nasik in Sanskrit, ma&#x301;nasik vya&#x301;ya&#x301;m. And what is ma&#x301;nasik vya&#x301;ya&#x301;m? You have to learn it from your a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya. You have to learn the process of your ma&#x301;nasik vya&#x301;ya&#x301;m, that is, psychic exercise, from your a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya. How to do it? Samyak vya&#x301;ya&#x301;m.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Then samyak karma&#x301;nta. I will not say in many people, but in certain people, I find a particular defect, and that defect is, the person starts some work, but leaves the work unfinished. This is very bad. Whenever you start any work, then you should complete it in proper order. That is, the finishing touch should be of proper order. This is called karma&#x301;nta in Sanskrit. Buddha said, samyak karma&#x301;nta. Whatever you are to do or whatever you are doing, finish it in proper style. Samyak karma&#x301;nta.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->And the seventh instruction is samyak smrti. In Sanskrit smrti means &ldquo;memory&rdquo;. What is smrti? Anubhu&#x301;ta vis&#x301;aya&#x301; sampramos&#x301;ah smrtih [&ldquo;Memory is the re-creation of things already perceived&rdquo;]. Suppose you are seeing an elephant. What is the Sanskrit term for &ldquo;elephant&rdquo;, R&ndash;?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->[R&ndash; replies, Hastii.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Hastii. Gaja. Varan&#x301;a. Aera&#x301;vata. Karii. Ahh. So many names. Suppose you are seeing an elephant, what will happen? The objective counterpart of your mind will take the form of the elephant. The objective portion of your mind will be converted into the elephant when you are actually seeing it. But when the elephant is not present, but by dint of your psychic power you are again creating that elephant in your objective portion of mind, that second creation, rather re-creation (not &ldquo;recreation&rdquo;, &ldquo;re-creation&rdquo;) of the elephant, is called memory.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Now I think there are so many graduates amongst you, and doctors &ndash; if you are asked to appear for the examination, the medical final, will you be able to pass just now? No. You have forgotten everything. Your smrti, that is, your memory, will not help you. The smrti has become &ndash; what? Very dilute, very faint, due to constant waning. What should be the best smrti? I think your a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas told you that you should repeat and recite your Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra whenever possible; I think this was the instruction of your a&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas, was it not? Internally, Is&#x301;t&#x301;a mantra and guru mantra. But you forget it. Because your smrti is very dilute. So the best object of smrti is Parama Purus&#x301;a. Never forget Him. Always take His name, as per the advice of your a&#x301;ca&#x301;rya. This is samyak smrti, that is, proper memory. The person who is established, the spiritual aspirant who is established, in samyak smrti, that is, who never forgets the Lord, is called &ndash; that particular state of mind is called dharmamegha sama&#x301;dhi, that is, the person is established in proper smrti. That bliss enjoyed by the spiritual aspirant is called dharmamegha sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->And the last instruction, the eighth one, is samyak sama&#x301;dhi. Suppose one concentrates one&#146;s mind on a particular flower. In this phase or process of concentration, first of all, the figure of that flower will disappear. In the second phase the colour of the flower will disappear. And finally, the existence of the seer will merge into the existence, into the theoretical existence, of that flower. This suspension of mind into its object is known as sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="15..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Now when the object of mind is Sagun&#x301;a Brahma, that is, the Attributional Consciousness, the sama&#x301;dhi enjoyed by the aspirant is called savikalpa sama&#x301;dhi; and when the goal is Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma, the Non-Attributional Entity, the sama&#x301;dhi enjoyed by the aspirant is called nirvikalpa sama&#x301;dhi &ndash; it is the highest stage of sama&#x301;dhi.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="16..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Structures<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->So far as structural solidarity is concerned, the best shape is the oval shape. &ldquo;Oval&rdquo; means (in Latin ovum means egg) &ldquo;similar to an egg, not exactly like an egg but to some extent like an egg; not exactly elliptical but to some extent elliptical&rdquo;. All celestial bodies are of that shape. That&#146;s why in Sanskrit this universe is called Brahma&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a. (An&#x301;d&#x301;a means &ldquo;egg&rdquo;. And from the Sanskrit word an&#x301;d&#x301;a it became an&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301; in the Urdu language.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Now, this universe of ours is very big, but not infinite. It is an elliptical figure, an oval figure, which means it has a boundary line. Yes, it is very big, and actually so big that we cannot measure it; but in theory it can be measured.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Just now I said the most convenient figure is the oval, or elliptical, figure. Take the case of a small atom. Here what happens? In that structure there is the nucleus, the heaviest matter of the structure, and the electrons are moving round that nucleus. A similar structure is our ethereal structure: the earth is the nucleus, and the moon is moving round that nucleus. The next bigger structure is our solar system: the sun is the nucleus, and so many planets are moving round it. And the biggest structure is the Cosmological structure: Parama Purus&#x301;a (Purus&#x301;ottama, the Supreme Nucleus, the Supreme Hub) is in the middle, and so many animated and non-animated objects are moving round it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Now, this movement is affected by two forces. All students of science know that they are the centrifugal force and the centripetal force. The centripetal force tries to decrease the radius, and the centrifugal force tries to drift the moving object away from the nucleus. In Sanskrit this centripetal force is called Vidya&#x301; and the centrifugal force is called Avidya&#x301;. (In common parlance, for Avidya&#x301; we use the word Shayta&#x301;n &ndash; &ldquo;Satan&rdquo; in English.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Now knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously, each and every entity, either physical or psychic, is moving round that Parama Purus&#x301;a. In the case of finite objects or finite structures or systems, when one moving entity goes far away from its nucleus, it is attracted by another nucleus, and in the course of this there take place so many clashes among so many nuclei. But in the case of the Cosmological order, there is a single nucleus for the entire [expressed] universe. The question of going beyond the jurisdiction of that nucleus does not arise. That is, when human beings are highly influenced by Avidya&#x301;, their radius from the nucleus increases, but the radius is always there. A human being, an animal, a plant, an inanimate object &ndash; everybody will have to move; and that&#146;s why I said movement is life. Stirlessness means death.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..7"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->When Dogma Functions in a Structure<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->And when people are guided by &ndash; not guided by, controlled by &ndash; dogmas, their stir is lost, so they become lifeless. They are worse than dead bodies. So you boys and you girls, you should know that you must never allow any dogma to goad you, to drift you, away from your nucleus. Never allow your radius to increase. Always try to decrease your radius. Always try to come in closer and closer proximity to the nucleus of this universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..9"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Dogma Also a Structure<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->You may ask, &ldquo;Ba&#x301;ba&#x301;,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.16.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#16.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> what is dogma?&rdquo; You should remember, you are all educated boys and girls: dogma is a psychic structure. All ideas are psychic structures; but regarding their boundary lines there should be some flexibility.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->I think some of you have come in contact with our Prout theory. I think you have gone through it. There is the fifth item,  the fifth fundamental factor, where it is said that the style of utilization should vary in accordance with [changes in] time, space and person. Didn&#146;t I say like this? That is, there is, or there lies, scope for flexibility &ndash; no rigidity, flexibility. Because the human mind will not tolerate anything rigid. It wants movement. Not only movement, it wants accelerated movement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->But what is dogma? Dogma is also an idea, but there is rigidity of the boundary line. Dogma will not allow you to go beyond the periphery of that boundary line. That is, dogma goes against the fundamental spirit of the human mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->(Knowingly or unknowingly, each and every object will have to move round the Supreme Nucleus. There is no alternative. But in case of dogma, what happens? While moving near the Nucleus, the unit mind is highly influenced by the Cosmic Mind as it proceeds towards the Nucleus for the purpose of coincidence. And when it actually coincides, the unit mind becomes one with the Cosmic Mind, and the Cosmic Mind knows no dogma.)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->So from the very starting point you should be active, you should be vocal, in fighting against the influence of dogmas. It is due to these dogmas that human society could not progress properly. Otherwise human intellect has developed much during the last five thousand years; it has developed still more during the last two hundred years; and since the second world war &ndash; during the last few decades &ndash; it has developed still more.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Crisis of Civilization<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Now, although there has been intellectual progress, there is a crisis of civilization. What is the breeding ground of this crisis? Why the crisis? The crisis is that human existence, which is highly [developed], has been endangered by dogmas. Its very existence on the psychic level has been endangered by dogmas. On the physical level it may or may not be endangered, but on the psychic level there is danger. If you get guarantees on the physical level regarding eating and drinking, sleeping and getting shelter, that will not suffice. You want to be danger-free in the realm of your mind, in the realm of your intellect. You want unbarred, unobstacled psychic progress &ndash; intellectual progress. But certain dogmas with their devouring mouths are trying to eat you up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Take for example communism, Marxism. It is such a dogma. It will not allow you to think beyond its periphery. So it is the duty of all intellectuals to make people conscious of their present and future and cautious of the all-devouring influence of dogma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="16..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Yours is a path towards Supreme Bliss, and you will have to move forward towards the Universal Nucleus. Now, [so many plants and so many animals] have all got minds. I told you that in the case of undeveloped creatures, mind is inborn instinct, but in the case of human beings, mind remains an ever-expanding force. Everybody is moving, knowingly or unknowingly, with so many ideas, with so many feelings, with so many propensities, with so many desires. But each and every aspirant, each and every artist, each and every scientist and each and every philosopher must be ensconced in this supreme veracity &ndash; that they will have to be one with the Supreme, that each will have to coincide his or her microcosmic nucleus with the Macrocosmic one. And while moving towards this Macrocosmic Nucleus, no bar should be tolerated, no obstacle should be encouraged. Let there be an unbarred movement of humanity, let there be an unbarred progress of humanity. Humanity that knows no colour, no racial or [[blood]] barrier, no historical or traditional barrier. Human beings have got the same human legacy, and they must boldly stand upon that legacy and move forward with the banner of universal humanity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="17..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->I have spoken on many occasions and at various places about one thing &ndash; mental balance, or the state of mental equipoise. There is a saying by Lord Shiva that to attain complete success in life, the fourth principle is samata&#x301;bha&#x301;va, that is, mental equipoise, mental balance.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> There must not be any complex in the mind &ndash; neither superiority complex nor inferiority complex.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Now, to bring about mental balance you should behave with every created being, every human being, in such a way that neither a superiority complex nor an inferiority complex develops in you or in those with whom you interact.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->A complex of any sort is a psychic malady, a psychic disease. To consider oneself superior to others is a serious human mistake. Similarly, thinking oneself inferior to others is also a mistake. To suffer from an inferiority complex is also a psychic ailment. You must not encourage either a superiority complex or an inferiority complex. You must maintain a psychic balance, you must maintain a mental balance. That balanced mind will be able to move towards Parama Purus&#x301;a. That is why it has been said, Trn&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.17.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#17.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  &ndash; &ldquo;One should be humbler than the grass.&rdquo; Usually the superiority [complex] is found more in humans than the inferiority complex. Even those who possess the mere knowledge of an alphabet feel themselves quite superior to those who are totally illiterate. This is a very usual thing. Hence one must remember the principle trn&#x301;a&#x301;dapi suniicena.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Then, taroriva sahis&#x301;n&#x301;una [&ldquo;you must be as tolerant as the trees&rdquo;]. People should remember that a certain thing may hit another thing and may be hit back immediately by that second thing. But it is better to assimilate the opposing force. Suppose someone struck at you and you struck back. In this case you did not assimilate the striker&#146;s blow into yourself, rather you returned it. Now if you are clever, you will tolerate a blow; and later, after assimilating it, you will strike back at the striker with greater intensity. It is as if a certain person shoots an arrow at someone. Now if the arrow is redirected towards the first person with the same speed and force, it is bound to produce a [great] effect. Hence it is said, &ldquo;tolerate&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->To tolerate means to gauge your enemy&#146;s strength as applied against you. You assimilate it: not that you tolerate it for the sake of toleration. Rather you tolerate it to contain yourself and to [control] your enemy. At the same time, your enemy&#146;s strength is dwindling. Hence everyone needs to cultivate the power to tolerate [whatever] will be useful. That does not mean that you will continue to tolerate endlessly and ultimately invite death. So toleration for the sake of toleration is not an ideal habit, but toleration for assimilation and augmentation of strength is profitable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Next, ama&#x301;niina&#x301;m&#x301; ma&#x301;nadena [&ldquo;you must give respect to those whom no one respects&rdquo;]. There are millions of people in the world. Ninety-nine per cent of them do not enjoy social prestige. There are three main factors due to which they are denied social prestige: First, society did not recognize them; society did not want to give them recognition. Secondly, as they are economically crippled, economically destroyed, they are forced to remain in perpetual subservience. Thirdly, a want of education, a want of knowledge, in them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->If you want someone [to be respected], you will have to provide him or her with these three things [recognition, economic self-sufficiency, education] simultaneously.

<a name="17..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->If you want someone [to be respected], then arrange for their proper education, to increase their knowledge. Also see to it that they are socially elevated and economically self-sufficient and can hold their heads high in self-esteem.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="17..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->No one is high or low from a caste point of view. Differentiations such as between Hindus and Muslims on the basis of religion are also despicable. Humans belong to one species, they are all children of God.

<a name="17..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The third factor, as mentioned, is that you should look after their economic aspect, so that all get proper food and clothing, proper education and medical treatment &ndash; so that all can hold their heads high in honour and live like dignified human beings, without depending on the mercy of others.<!-- /block --></p>

The psychic existence of a human being is more important than and predominates over the physical structure.

Movement is not only the order of life, it is the order of the universe. Everything is moving. And in this created world, each and every being has something to do with the three fundamental relativities [time, place and person]. There cannot be any absolute cessation or absolute pause. Cessation is a relative phenomenon. Everything moves; this earth also moves. The sun with its planets, and all the stars, move. Nothing can be made stationary. Nothing is fixed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Human beings are also moving. But wherever there is movement, there must be some goal.

<a name="20..5"></a><p class="Para_Translation_Eds"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->[All unit entities, all unit structures, revolve around the Nucleus Consciousness in the Cosmic Cycle of creation. This rotation of theirs will continue as long as they think that they are separate from their Creator. When they become one with the Nucleus, they will attain immortality.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..6"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->&ldquo;The movement is towards the Universal Hub. So many units, so many microcosms, attached to so many quinquelemental structures, are moving towards that Universal Hub.&rdquo; They are moving knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously. And a very, very few are engaged by the Cosmic centripetal force, or vidya&#x301; shakti in Sanskrit. When a microcosm moves with the aid of this centripetal force, what happens? The internal structure is metamorphosed into the Cosmic Soul. First its cruder [elements] get powdered down, then its quinquelemental expressions are metamorphosed into ectoplasmic structures, and finally those ectoplasmic structures are converted into cognition. At that time the unit cognition, detached from bases and crude entities, becomes one with the Supreme Cognitive Faculty. That stage is the state of salvation, the state of supreme emancipation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Sarva&#x301;jiive sarvasam&#x301;sthe brhante [&ldquo;All unit entities, all unit structures&rdquo;]. These microcosms have different physical structures [and] different psycho-physical structures according to their reactive momenta. They are moving with so many thoughts, so many ideas, so many aspirations. Their movements come to an end when they come in closest contact with the Supreme Entity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->How does one come in closest contact with the Cosmological Mystery? The rs&#x301;i [sage] says, jus&#x301;t&#x301;astatastena&#x301;mrtatvameti &ndash; &ldquo;a microcosm does so when it feels that it is a blessed being, that it has been blessed &ndash; its existence has been blessed &ndash; by Parama Purus&#x301;a.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Now, this movement is a phased path and there are four main phases. They are known as yatama&#x301;na, vyatireka, ekendriya and vashiika&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><b>Yatama&#x301;na</b>: The microcosm wants to move forward. There are so many obstacles, so many mundane bondages, both external and internal. As you know, these internal bondages are known as ripus [enemies] and the external fetters are known as pa&#x301;shas [bondages]. One will have to look forward, [fighting] these internal and external bondages. [All those bondages on] the unit cognition are of baser nature. When a microcosm wants to move a step forward, so many inimical entities assemble and try to defeat that microcosm. So sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; requires a sort of fight, rather it is a fight, against all the [degenerating agencies]. In this first stage, the microcosm tries its best to fight against these internal and external enemies and tries to move forward. This stage is known as yatama&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->How does this fight take place? How can one fight against these enemies? Certainly one moves forward with the blessing of the Supreme. Without this blessing, one cannot move a step forward, because those inimical forces, those degrading forces, are very strong.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><b>Vyatireka</b>: The second phase is called vyatireka. The aspirant establishes his control [over] a particular internal or external enemy but [is] still defeated by certain desires. Suppose there is a man who never takes bribes. He has established his control over the propensity of lobha [greed]. But he may be addicted to drink, so there he is defeated. Or that man may be a miserly fellow. Again he is defeated. Or that man may have some special attraction to some house, land or other property. In this phase, one has established oneself [over] certain propensities or [over] certain degrading elements or enemies, but is defeated by some other elements or enemies. This second phase of human approach is called vyatireka. Here also one cannot move a step forward without the grace of the Supreme, because one&#146;s fighting stamina gets inspiration from the Supreme.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><b>Ekendriya</b>: The third phase is ekendriya. In this phase, one establishes control over certain degrading propensities or over certain fetters related to a particular sensory or motor [indriya, or organ,] of one&#146;s structure; but one is still defeated by other enemies related to other sensory or motor organs. For instance, a person may establish control over all the propensities related to the eyes or related to the tongue, but be defeated by other propensities related to the ears or the nose. He or she will not see anything bad because he or she has established control over his or her eyes, but will still be defeated by smell. The person is master over the taste or tactual organs, but is a slave to the smell organ or the ears. When that person gets the smell of, say, tea or coffee, he or she will ask for one cup. Here the person is defeated. Do you not feel like this [sometimes]? So this third phase is called ekendriya. One has established control over a particular indriya, or over a few indriyas, but not over all. This is called ekendriya.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><b>Vashiika&#x301;ra</b>: The fourth and final phase is vashiika&#x301;ra. When one establishes control over all the fifty controlling propensities of the human structure and also over all the motor and sensory organs, it is called vashiika&#x301;ra. When is this vashiika&#x301;ra stage [attained], and what does one do to [be established in it]? A person is established when that person establishes his or her proximity to the Universal Hub. He or she becomes one with the Supreme. This is the human approach towards the cognitive stance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Now one must remember that during this movement on the path of righteousness, one needs stamina, needs vitality, and [for this] one gets inspiration from the Supreme Father, from Parama Purus&#x301;a. By His mercy one can [do] anything and everything. Without His mercy even a blade of grass cannot move.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->In the history of our human society sometimes it so happens that a major portion of the people, [who used to get inspiration from their enviroment, cannot, due to the influence of antisocial elements,] get that inspiration. When such a situation is created, it is the duty of the nobler and better portion of the human race to guide others so that they may not feel any difficulty due to unfavourable environmental pressure. These people are the sama&#x301;ja gurus [gurus of the society]. They help people at times of such adverse environmental conditions. But sometimes it so happens that the socio-spiritual and the psycho-physical environment gets so polluted that even those sama&#x301;ja gurus can do nothing for the weak and suppressed mass. The mass becomes helpless. Then what to do? People must not feel afraid of such environments. Lord Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a said,<!-- /block --></p>

Here Arjuna was a king and was addressed as king. That is why he was called Bha&#x301;rata.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="20..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Whenever such an environmental degradation takes place, whenever the position of dharma is degraded, is degenerated, and goes below its normal standard, and the common people cannot get any help or any encouragement from the environment; when to become good is a crime, to become a moralist is foolishness; that is, when common people are not getting any encouragement from the environment and when hypocrisy is the biggest and highest qualification; then what is a common person to do? There the sama&#x301;ja gurus will fail to help the mass. They fail to guide the mass because they also get degenerated. When the leadership is degenerated, the mass becomes blind. The blind cannot lead the blind. But the common people must remember that Parama Purus&#x301;a is always with them and will take the necessary steps under such [circumstances].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="22..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->The subject matter of today&#146;s discourse is &ldquo;Principles and Practice of Philosophy and Cult&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Where principles emerge out of long practice, they can be materialized with little effort by anyone who has the sincerity of purpose and will to do so. Such principles are empirical and bound to succeed in practice. (The time factor may, however, depend upon the intensity of the effort.) The following four circumstances determine whether a set of principles will prove true and be materialized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->(1) Hypocritical psychology. Some principles are ab initio insincere and produced with hypocritical mental effort. They are never meant to be put into practice, they are only intended to exploit a situation, or a sentiment of the masses, and meant to befool the masses only. In the distant past, in the Middle Ages, and in modern times as well, we find many such theories in all the countries of the world. Coated in sweet and beguiling language, they are intended to confuse and befool the masses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The main reason for the depressed psychic condition of people&#146;s minds today is such hypocritical psychological intellectual extravaganza of the ages.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Such theories exist in the social, the economic and various other fields of human activity. This is the main reason for the crisis of civilization today.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Take a few examples of such theories:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->a. Mixed economy &ndash; This is a pure bluff. This will never achieve practical application. It is only intended to befool the ignorant masses.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->b. Peaceful coexistence &ndash; between opposing ideologists has never happened nor will it ever come about.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->c. Democratic socialism &ndash; is like saying a &ldquo;stone made of gold&rdquo;. Why call it gold when it is actually only stone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->There are many such theories circulating all over the world today. Human civilization is in danger because of them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->(2) The second situation is where hypocrisy is not at work, but what is at work is theoretical psychology. The people [involved], while making principles, are utterly oblivious of the realities of the world. They are wanderers in a vacuum, having no touch with the hard realities of the surface of the earth. Such theories shine like lighted moths for a moment and then are lost forever.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->In India, for instance, such a theory is Gaotamiiya Nya&#x301;ya Darshan. (This is not to be confused with the logic of Kanada.) The logic of Gaotamiiya Nya&#x301;ya is purely imaginary. Such a theory cannot result in a practical cult.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Great logicians were born in the world in the past. Many in India wasted [valuable time discussing] whether oil in a pot should really be called &ldquo;a pot with oil as its base&rdquo; or &ldquo;oil with a pot as its base&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->In Pathan India and the first portion of Mughal India there were big scholars versed in such logic. They were great intellectuals, but could not mould the life of the people with their theories. The intellectual life of the country [became] obsessed with these differing logics and there was no progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Pure logicians have another noticeable defect. They do not recognize that life is trifarious, that is, physical, intellectual and spiritual. They only emphasize the intellectual side and ignore the physical and spiritual aspects. As such they lack the [will] to put their theories into practice. They make no efforts in that direction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->(3) The third circumstance is inefficiency or lack of power to put a theory into practice. The theory may be sincere and true, but due to a lack of experience or other defects, it cannot be materialized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In India in the great logic age, there were great yogis, personally highly evolved and advanced, but they could not make a society full of such individuals. When these people were defeated by Shankaracharya in discussion, there was created in India a great intellectual vacuum, which was very dangerous. This position lasted until the arrival of the great Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who restored confidence and a practical cult and outlook once again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="22..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->(4) Environmental difficulty. This is another instance of theories which do not lack sincerity, but which were framed in a particular mental environment which does not exist in the practical world. Such theories are all right as far as they go on the psychic plane, but as the environment where they operate is different from the environment envisaged at the time of their making, they fail to materialize.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.22.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#22.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

They accept only that which they like and reject that which they do not like. Elevated beings &ndash; uttama purus&#x301;a &ndash; on the other hand, do not accept anything from anyone. But Parama Purus&#x301;a is entirely different from these two groups. He makes no discrimination whatever and accepts all that is offered to Him by any of His children.<!-- /block --></p>

A large number of people used always to [come and] accept the path shown by the Lord. But a particular individual and his group were very much opposed to Lord Buddha.

<a name="28..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->This news greatly agitated this man, and in anger he came to the orchard and started abusing Lord Buddha in all sorts of ways. Lord Buddha maintained his usual equipoise towards all this. One feels happy and encouraged in abusing someone only if he or she finds that person affected by the acts of abuse. This man found Lord Buddha undisturbed and was greatly disappointed, finding all his hard labour gone to waste. When he had done all the abusing [he could] for quite some time and his stock of bad words might have been coming to an end, the Lord urged the man to listen to him.<!-- /block --></p>

If a person is at a particular place and has to move to some other place, he or she will have to travel. But the Lord is everywhere, and He in reality does not have to move. In other words, He has so many feet that He is able to reach any place and be available at all places at all times. Elsewhere, scriptures say:<!-- /block --></p>

From a to ks&#x301;a, in the Nagari system of letters, there are fifty letters. These letters are the acoustic roots of the fifty propensities through which human beings function. The different sounds are only a mixture and combination in varying degrees of these acoustic vibrations. So in other words, aks&#x301;a represents the whole set of the vibrations; that is, the creation. Since we see this creation with our eyes, the eye in Sanskrit is called aks&#x301;i.

At the end of the day Swami Vivekananda returned along with the living pigeon and reported to Sri Ramakrishna that he could not find himself alone anywhere because wherever he went he found a pair of eyes &ndash; the Lord&#146;s &ndash; watching him.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.28.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#28.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>

Let us take an example. I cross the threshold, and as a result of it I enter the room. The utterance, internal or external, of the first syllable of a mantra is like crossing the threshold and entering a new world. The proper accomplishment of work after entering the new [world] culminates in a result which gives a feeling of bliss and perfection. This feeling is an embodiment of pleasure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In day-to-day life, we first inhale and then exhale. The mantra is repeated according to the syllabic rhythm of inhalation and exhalation. This act of breathing in the mundane sphere has no end in individual life. Breathing is an action, so a living being is always engaged in some sort of action. This constant effort is known as yatama&#x301;na. This is the first stage of progress. In the second stage, one wants to rise high with the firm determination to achieve one&#146;s goal. And while doing so one is in a position to have control over some or other of his or her mental propensities for some time, but has no control over the other propensities at all. This stage is known as vyatireka. In this stage one achieves concentration for some time and then again loses it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Then comes ekendriya, which is the third stage of progress in sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;. This is the stage when one has control over a particular mental propensity, and that control is more lasting. Due to constant repetition, the mantra is sounding in one&#146;s ear. While sitting in meditation, a sa&#x301;dhaka can see his or her Is&#x301;t&#x301;a moving around him or her, and the fragrance of sandalwood or rose comes from the body of the Is&#x301;t&#x301;a. Sometimes one gets it and sometimes one does not get it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="30..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The fourth stage is known as vashiika&#x301;ra. There one is established in the ideation of Parama Purus&#x301;a, to satisfy whom one is doing kiirtana.

Ba&#x301;ba&#x301; na&#x301;ma kevalam is a siddha mantra. When the first syllable ba&#x301; is uttered, the feeling should be, &ldquo;I am crossing the threshold and entering the new world;&rdquo; and when the last syllable ma is uttered, the feeling should be, &ldquo;I have accomplished my duty.&rdquo; If the kiirtana is done with these feelings, within two or three minutes the effect will come into play.<!-- /block --></p>
