<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->On the 8th of September, 1985, the author, and founder of Ananda Marga, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, began an extraordinary series of Sunday lectures in Bengali that would eventually fill a total of twenty-six volumes over the next five years. The title he gave to this series was <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I>, which translates into English as &ldquo;A Collection of Words&rdquo;. As the title suggests, each discourse consists of a discussion of a certain number of words from the Bengali language, beginning, in the first discourse, with the first letter of the Bengali alphabet, <I>a</I>, <I></I>and continuing on alphabetically. What results, then, is neither an encyclopaedia, nor a dictionary, but something unique in the fields of scholarship and literature.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Ostensibly, <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> is a series devoted to the linguistics and philology of the Bengali language, but in reality it is much more than that. The author uses the platform of the word as a point of departure to take the reader on a journey through all the varied landscapes of human knowledge &ndash; history, geography, medicine, science, art, religion, philosophy, etc. &ndash; and in the process adds the indelible stamp of his own unique wisdom, enriching our experience with new ideas and enabling us to see our human heritage in a way we have never been able to before.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Like most great authors, he is a consummate storyteller, using a seemingly inexhaustible supply of anecdotes, personal experiences and stories to capture the reader&#146;s interest and lead him or her effortlessly through the garden of human knowledge. Along the way the author refines and develops a language that is the world&#146;s fifth most widely spoken and the closest living language to its great classical ancestor, Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The English versions of <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> <I>Part 1</I> and <I>Part 2,</I> the first two books of this series, were published in 1996. The English <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> <I>Part 3</I> was published in 1999. Thereafter the publication of this important series could not immediately be continued for various reasons, but requests for further parts of the series kept pouring in from our readers. We have therefore decided to publish several of the remaining parts of <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> each year in order to complete the series within a reasonable period of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->As mentioned earlier, the author of this series has touched on a vast number of subjects of human knowledge. Therefore in this book we have provided an index of words and subjects at the end to help researchers and the general reader.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Weighing the feedback of our readers and all other considerations, we decided to print Parts 4 and 5 of <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> in one volume and to use a bigger and more conventional book size than had been used previously for the <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> series. Henceforward, the various parts of the series will all be published in this manner.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Footnotes by the translators have all been signed &ldquo;&ndash;Trans.&rdquo;  Unsigned footnotes are those of the author.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Many readers are concerned that the author&#146;s discourses, as published, should adhere as closely as possible to the precise wording the author used in speaking. For this reason, in the case of discourses given originally in English, the editors do not alter pronouns and other terms which the author in his life time considered &ldquo;common-gender&rdquo; words. As the author once said, &ldquo;You know, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is not only masculine gender, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is common gender also. &lsquo;Man is mortal&rsquo; &ndash; here &lsquo;man&rsquo; means both male and female.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The author was a natural advocate of women&#146;s rights and on at least one occasion indicated that &ldquo;lopsided justice&rdquo; in language should be eliminated at some future date. In keeping with his guideline and with present-day trends, it is our policy in the case of translated discourses (where the published wording will necessarily be that of the translators) to use gender-neutral language.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The author was of the strong opinion that the Bengali alphabet should provide for a distinction between two slightly-different sounds, which he called &ldquo;initial-<I>la</I>&rdquo; and &ldquo;end-<I>lra</I>&rdquo;. To make possible this distinction, he proposed that the initial-<I>la</I> should be represented by an existing alphabetical character (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B2;</span>), while for the end-<I>lra</I> there should be a new character (<span class=Bengali>&#x09B2;&#x09BC;</span>) formed by adding a dot below the initial-<I>la</I> character. In the roman system invented by the author, the two sounds are rendered by <I>la</I> and <I>lra</I> respectively. Though in the original Bengali <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> series the new character has been used wherever the <I>lra</I> sound occurs, in these English translations we have avoided using <I>lra</I> each time that the sound occurs (so that words familiar to speakers of Bengali should not be unrecognizable to them), and we provide instead, especially for the benefit of researchers, a list of all words in each book which should be read with the end-<I>lra</I> sound. For this book the words are as follows:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->The author used a certain shorthand for explaining the etymologies of words. Under this system, a minus sign (&ndash;) follows a prefix, and a plus sign (+) precedes a suffix. Thus <I>ava &ndash; tr + ghain&#x32D; = avata&#x301;ra</I> can be read, &ldquo;the root <I>tr</I> prefixed by <I>ava</I> and suffixed by <I>ghain&#x32D;</I> becomes <I>avata&#x301;ra</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->This book is the result of the assistance and the support lent by many persons in various ways. Their sincere efforts are helping us develop an ever more professional system of work, so that the immense contribution of Shrii P.R. Sarkar can be presented in the best possible manner. Some esteemed readers, or better to say, lovers, of Shrii P.R. Sarkar&#146;s books have come forward to make arrangement for the continuous publication of his books over the coming years; thanks to them, progress is being made in building up a committed and dependable sales network. Any interested person can come forward to participate in this effort.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Ideally every new book translation undergoes initially a draft by the main translator, then &ldquo;first editing&rdquo;, then &ldquo;second editing&rdquo;, then final verification. Other important functions include coordination of the different steps, and the development and management of a sales network. Some of those who have contributed to these efforts: Dr. Mohit Ray, retired professor of English, translated all seven discourses of <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> <I>Part 4</I>, and the first editing of those discourses was done by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Priyashiva&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta. Ga&#x301;yattrii Ghista and Ta&#x301;raka Ghista did the second editing of those discourses. Dr. Visvanath Chatterjee, retired professor of English, translated all seven discourses of <I>Shabda Cayanika&#x301;</I> <I>Part 5</I>, and the first editing of those discourses was done by A&#x301;ca&#x301;rya Priyashiva&#x301;nanda Avadhu&#x301;ta.

<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Just as a scintillation like that of an emerald occurs when glass comes in contact with gold, similarly even a fool becomes a wise man if in contact with a good soul. The verbal root of <I>kain&#x32D;c/kac (kaci)</I> means &ldquo;to shine&rdquo;, &ldquo;to tie up&rdquo;<I></I>. Both the words <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> and <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;ca</I> are derived by adding the suffix <I>ghain&#x32D;</I> to the verbal root <I>kac</I>. Both the words etymologically mean &ldquo;something that shines&rdquo; or &ldquo;something that ties up&rdquo;. Although etymologically both the words <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> and <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;ca</I> are correct, the word <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;ca</I> in Sanskrit <I></I>has a very limited use. The word that is actually in use, so to speak, is <I>ka&#x301;ca</I>. But the <I>tadbhava</I> derivative [word derived from Sanskrit in changed form] of <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;ca</I> is <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;c</I>. The word is quite prevalent in Bengali and many other Indian languages. So if we write <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> that will be a <I>tatsama</I> word [Sanskrit loanword] and if we write <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;c</I> that will be a derivative word. But both have the same meaning. In its common usage, the word <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> would mean: <ol> <li>Any shining alkaline entity.<!-- /block --></p>

It should be borne in mind that in Urdu, <I>siisa&#x301;</I> also means <I>ka&#x301;ca</I>, as a glass object is described as <I>siise kii ciij</I> [object made of glass]<I></I>. But in Bengali <I>siisa&#x301;</I> means &ldquo;lead&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> is <I>sphat&#x301;ika</I> [&ldquo;thick glass&rdquo;], or what is called &ldquo;crystal&rdquo; in English. What is &ldquo;clear as glass&rdquo; is called &ldquo;crystal-clear&rdquo;. Here we should bear in mind that India has been familiar with <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> for a long time, from the pre-<I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> age, in fact.<!-- /block --></p>

The courtyard of that crystal palace appeared to be filled with water. In order to avoid wetting his loincloth Duryodhana lifted it up above his knees. Many people present there could not help laughing on seeing Duryodhana&#146;s discomfiture. Duryodhana reacted sharply to the derisive laughter of the people; he felt anguished and insulted and vowed to himself to take revenge.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><p>India has been making crystal for a long time. In Sanskrit literature there are many references to crystal, but it was not invented in India. It is said that some Phoenician merchants were travelling to a far-off land in connection with their business. On the way they once prepared their food by building a fire on the sand with alkaline wood. After cooking they noticed that the mixture of alkali and sand had produced a shining material near the site of the fire. This is how crystal was invented.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><p>The English word &ldquo;glass&rdquo; is derived from the Sanskrit word <I>ka&#x301;in&#x32D;ca</I>. Since ancient times, crystal has been used in India for medicine bottles, wine glasses and chandeliers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of <I>ka&#x301;ca</I> is <I>man&#x301;ika&#x301;c</I>, or quartz. As a mineral metal it has been available in many parts of India since ancient times as evidenced by the fact that quartz has been used for decoration and ornaments since that time period. In Bengal, quartz is available in Bankura and Purulia in some quantity.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><li>If a flower or ribbon or any other attractive object swings at the end of a women&#146;s braid as a decoration, that is also called <I>ka&#x301;ca</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><li><I>Ga&#x301;la&#x301;</I>, or &ldquo;lac&rdquo;, is called <I>la&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301;</I> in chaste Bengali. The word <I>ga&#x301;la&#x301;</I> is derived from the Sanskrit word <I>galanam</I> which etymologically means &ldquo;that which can be easily melted&rdquo;. The word <I>la&#x301;ha&#x301;</I> has come from the Sanskrit word <I>la&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301;</I>. In ancient Bengal, particularly in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region, lac was produced in huge quantity. Production continues even now, and there is full potential for it to continue in future. The merchants of Bengal who used to export lac therefore acquired &ldquo;La&#x301;ha&#x301;&rdquo; <I></I>as their title, or surname. Although there is vast scope to increase the volume of production of lac in Bengal, particularly in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region, it is not effectively realized. The reason is that its production depends upon global demand. Like mica, global demand for lac is very limited. There is no specific large industry that uses lac or mica [as its raw material]. Both the industry and its products suffer whenever there is lack of global demand, and the same situation is prevalent even today. In any case, as in English we use the word &ldquo;tusk&rdquo; for the tooth of an elephant but use the word &ldquo;ivory&rdquo; while referring to an object made from the elephant tusk, similarly in Sanskrit, while &ldquo;lac&rdquo; is called <I>la&#x301;ks&#x301;a&#x301;</I>, a lac product is called <I>jatu.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I> Most of you are aware of the incident of the burning of <I>jatugrha</I> [house made of lac] in the <I>Maha&#x301;bha&#x301;rata</I> during the period when the Pandavas were living incognito. Similarly, if something is fixed or sealed with lac, then the lac used in the seal is called <I>ka&#x301;ca</I>. Remember that &ldquo;seal&rdquo; is not a Bengali word; it is an English loanword; the word <I>mohar</I> is also not Bengali, it is Persian; the word <I>cha&#x301;p</I> [<I>mohar</I> and <I>chap</I> both mean &ldquo;seal&rdquo;] is also not Bengali; it is Portuguese. The Sanskrit word corresponding to <I>siilmohar</I> is <I>mudra&#x301;un&#x32D;kan</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

But both forms have the same meaning. <I>Ka&#x301;cana</I> etymologically means &ldquo;ribbon or rope used for tying&rdquo; or &ldquo;to make something valuable&rdquo;. In its extended form, <I>ka&#x301;cana</I> means the following: <ol> <li>Any kind of ribbon, tag or lace (<I>ka&#x301;cana&#x301;m&#x301;shu</I>, that is<I></I>, &ldquo;a silken ribbon&rdquo;).<!-- /block --></p>

The <I>pat&#x301;ol</I> broth <I></I>[wax-gourd curry preparation] which is used as a diet for sick persons in some parts of Bengal is called <I>pat&#x301;ol-ka&#x301;in&#x32D;canii</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

According to Arabic grammar, the word <I>sa&#x301;heb</I> prefixed by <I>mu</I> becomes <I>musa&#x301;heb</I> or <I>mosa&#x301;heb</I>. In Arabic even today, many new words are formed by adding the prefix <I>mu</I> to other words &ndash; nouns or verbs. Examples would include, <I>mua&#x301;llin, mua&#x301;jjin</I> (one who gives <I>a&#x301;ja&#x301;n<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I>), <I>muja&#x301;hid</I> (one who has taken part in a <I>jeha&#x301;d</I> or crusade), <I>muha&#x301;jir (</I>one who has been <I>ha&#x301;jir</I> [present] from another country, that is, a refugee), <I>musa&#x301;fir</I> (one who does <I>safar</I> [journey] or keeps on travelling). This reminds me of a story.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..74"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph --><p>Once a king needed a flatterer. He duly published an advertisement in the newspaper announcing the available position. He also indicated in the advertisement that the application must be accom-panied by a non-refundable, crossed cheque for Rs. 500. Applications came in the thousands. After a written examination, <I>viva voce</I> began. The king was present [to interview the candidates]. Holding the left armrest of the king&#146;s throne stood his minister, slightly craning his neck toward the king. The candidates began appearing for the interview one by one.

<a name="4..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph --><p>Immediately the king rejected him. The second candidate entered &ndash; a smart and clever young man, prattling away and full of gestures and gesticulations. The king said to him: &ldquo;The responsibility of a sycophant is a very heavy responsibility. Can you do the job?&rdquo; The candidate replied, &ldquo;Give me a chance and see, my Lord.

<a name="4..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph --><p>Instantly radiant with inspiration, the candidate rattled on, &ldquo;Of course, yes! A hundred times yes! Sir, I give my word ... just give me a chance and see ... just a chance, please.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph --><p>This candidate met the question with a question: &ldquo;Really, O King, can I do the job of a sycophant?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph --><p>The king said: &ldquo;No, I think you cannot do it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph --><p>He agreed: &ldquo;Yes sir, I have a feeling that I cannot do it.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph --><p>The king then said: &ldquo;Yes, but you can have a try.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph --><p>He concurred: &ldquo;Yes, sir, I can have a try.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph --><p>The king cast a significant sidelong glance at the minister, upon which the minister said: &ldquo;O, great King, my Lord, this person is eminently qualified.

<a name="4..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph --><p>The king told the candidate: &ldquo;Do you understand, mister? You are appointed to the post with effect from today.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph --><p>So, you can understand that <I>ka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I> means this flattering. In Sanskrit, however, a <I>mosa&#x301;heb</I> is called a <I>vidus&#x301;aka</I>. In a limited sense of <I>mosa&#x301;heb</I>, the word <I>bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I> was also prevalent in Sanskrit. It is from this word that the Bengali word <I>bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;</I> has come (Gopal Bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;, for example). But <I>bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;</I> also means a clown. When we say, <I>a&#x301;r bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;mi&#146; karte habe na&#x301;</I>, [&ldquo;enough of buffoonery there!&rdquo;], the word <I>bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;</I> is not derived from <I>bha&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I> but <I></I>from <I>bhan&#x301;d&#x301;a</I>, meaning &ldquo;pretentious or deceptive&rdquo;. Thus in the present case, the word <I>bha&#x301;n&#x32D;r&#x301;a&#x301;mi</I> has been used in the sense of <I>bhan&#x301;d&#x301;a&#x301;mi</I> or pretension.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph --><li>For every kind of task, there is a most suitable or appropriate time [for its implementation]. If the field for <I>a&#x301;man</I> variety of paddy is prepared by tilling the land in the month of A&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;r&#x301;ha <I></I>[rainy season], <I></I>then the seedlings can be sown as soon as the field is filled with water that is halfway to knee-deep. If the time is lost in negligence and then if it does not rain for a few days, the water level will fall. At that low water level, the seedlings (<I>ca&#x301;ra&#x301;</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn6"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn6">6</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->) will survive but new seedlings cannot be sown. However, if the new seedlings are sown in time, then the saplings will not be affected even in heavy rainfall, because the saplings will grow along with the rising water level. The saplings will not be affected until the tops of the saplings are submerged. But if the seedlings are not sown at the proper time, they cannot be sown in high water, because it is not possible to sow the seedlings with their tops under water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph --><p>Again, look at the harvesting. The paddies once reaped cannot be left unused in the field or in a [roofless] granary for an extended period. It is essential to immediately thresh and flail the reaped paddies and store in a [roofed] granary, <I></I>because if the reaped paddy corns come in contact with too much rain water, they will begin to germinate. As a result, let alone <I>cin&#x32D;r&#x301;e-mur&#x301;i</I>, that is, paddy made into flattened rice, puffed rice or sunned rice, <I></I>it will not be good even for boiled rice. If husked in a seesaw-like husker, the quantity of huskings and particles will be too much and [because the final product will include many broken particles] the taste of the boiled rice will also suffer.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph --><p>So it is seen that there is an appropriate time for everything. Just before an examination the mnemonic faculty becomes stronger on account of the pressure placed on it. Even a little intensive study during this period yields good results. But what would be the use of wasting that time in playing tipcat<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and concentrating on studies only after the examination? That is why one should do everything at the proper time. This proper time for a particular kind of job is also called <I>ka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph --><li>If a person tries to get his work done, spending whatever time he may have available [to organize that work] in coarse behaviour to another person, he may perhaps get the work done, but it is more likely that he will not get it done. If, however, he tries to get the work done by spending even a fraction of the same time in sweet words and good behaviour, time will be saved and there will be a greater chance of success. So sweet words or good behaviour, which are certainly marks of higher culture, are also steps to success. The word <I>ka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I> is also used for such people who use sweet words in their social life. The word <I>ka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I> is also used as a noun for that particular work.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph --><li>There is a proper time and season for doing any task.

The soil for sowing wheat seeds is loamy soil, and the right season is <I>hemanta</I> [the season between autumn and winter] and the first seven days of Paus&#x301; <I></I>[from mid-December to mid-January] in winter. You cannot grow ginger in the month of Bha&#x301;dra <I></I>[from mid-August to mid-September]. If sown, the ginger will rot in a few days. The best time for sowing ginger is the month of <I></I>Pha&#x301;lgun [the period from mid-February to mid-March] and the first week of Caetra <I></I>[from mid-March to mid-April] particularly when the moon enters the <I>A&#x301;dra&#x301;</I> star [<I>Orionis Betelgeuse</I>]. So you realize that for every task there is a special season and a definite time. A boy who plays in the morning without studying cannot do well in the examination. A boy who studies in the afternoon, which is actually the time for playing, cannot have good health. So even during the day there are different hours for different kinds of activities. This particular season, or particular <I>prahara</I> [a measure of time equal to three hours], or particular time earmarked for a particular job, is also called <I>ka&#x301;n&#x301;d&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->The word <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> is obtained by adding the suffix <I>lyut&#x301;</I> to the verbal root <I>kr</I> in the causative. According to some scholars, when [the vowel <I>a</I> in] the word <I>karan&#x301;a</I> is elongated, it becomes <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> and assumes a special distinction. Then it is neither causative nor is it <I>an&#x301;</I>-suffixed. Thus etymologically <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> means &ldquo;the root entity transformed into a sequence of cause and effect that has now become an effect in the present moment&rdquo;. In common usage, it means many of the theories discussed below: <ol> <li><I>Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> means the causal matrix.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><p>In the ancient world, when human beings reached the first stage in forming a society, it was a matriarchal society. In addition to maternal lineage that was already in force, there were regulations regarding maternal heritage. In other words, the family line was determined by looking at the mothers of a family. When one asked a person&#146;s name, one asked the name of the mother, the name of the mother&#146;s mother, then her mother and so on. This custom was observed in the case of both men and women. After marriage the husband assumed the surname of his wife&#146;s family line. This means that a man marrying a woman living on the hills, that is, in a particular <I>gotra</I> [lineage] had to take on the title of that <I>gotra</I> in all respects. (The practice is prevalent in some communities even today.) The law of inheritance was also matrilineal; that is, the children used to inherit the property of the mother. This system was prevailing in the world for a long time. The only flaw was that in this system, though the mother was identified, the father was not, and unless the father is also identified, it is not possible to determine the qualitative excellence of a person.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><p>Both the patriarchal system and the matriarchal system have their merits and demerits. However, because man is physically stronger, ultimately the patriarchal system came to prevail. Though the patriarchal system had many defects, which I have referred to earlier, it had two advantages. First, in the matriarchal social system the woman had to shoulder all kinds of responsibilities, as a result of which her life became miserable. In the patriarchal system the man, that is, the father, was obliged to share a large part of the responsibility. Secondly, the institution of marriage came into force to help divide the responsibilities and identify the father. Even after the introduction of the patriarchal social system, many men did not easily accept the institution of marriage, because they wanted the rights of domination but without accepting their responsibilities. Lord Shiva was the first to shoulder this great responsibility, and compelled men to take part in the marriage system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><p>In India, which is otherwise a predominantly patriarchal society, among the Bengalees there are still remnants of the matriarchal social system. Here a nephew [sister&#146;s son] inherits the property of a childless maternal uncle. If the maternal uncle has no children, the nephew becomes entitled to perform the last rites of his maternal uncle after observing three days&#146;, impurity rites. On the death of her father, a daughter has to observe similar impurity rites and has to organize a <I>shra&#x301;ddha</I> ceremony [obsequies] on the fourth day of the death of the father.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><p>In Kerala the matriarchal social system is a little more dominant than in Bengal. There the nephew [sister&#146;s son], instead of using the surname of the father, uses the surname of his maternal uncle, that is, the maiden name of his mother. He inherits the property of his maternal uncle and assumes the name of his mother even if born of an inter-caste marriage. A hundred percent matrilineal social system is prevalent today only in a certain community in Meghalaya. When the mother-dominated social system prevailed, a man used to assume the same <I>gotra</I> [community name] of the mother, which was the same as that of the mother&#146;s mother, and so on; and the mother was considered as the leader of that community. And the chief of all chiefs, the original chief or the primal mother was considered as the causal matrix. <I>Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> means this primordial cause or causal matrix.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><li>In <I>Kan&#x301;a&#x301;diiya Nya&#x301;ya</I> it is said, <I>Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;va&#x301;t karya&#x301;bha&#x301;vah</I> &ndash; &ldquo;If there is no cause there is no effect.&rdquo; The movement and nature of everything in the world &ndash; big or small, great or insignificant &ndash; is governed by this cause-and-effect theory. When we look at a tree, we realize that there must have been a seed behind its growth. Again, when we look at a seed, we realize that it must have come from a tree. If we trace this backwards &ndash; from tree to seed, from seed to tree, and so on &ndash; then we will arrive at a stage where the Mind becomes the effect, but as its cause we find only the absence of Mind. In other words, what was the cause at one stage was the effect at the previous stage, and this effect had a cause at a still earlier stage. If we proceed backwards along the line of cause and effect &ndash; if we move on from the tree to the seed and so on &ndash; finally we will get the tree as the effect. While looking for the seed [i.e., its own seed], the mind that is looking for its effective cause arrives at a stage where the mind does not exist. How can the mind understand or experience something at a stage wherein the mind itself is not functioning? To attempt to think about something or argue about something at a stage wherein the mind does not exist is known as <I>anavastha&#x301; dos&#x301;a</I>, that is, the fallacy of infinite regression.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><p>While tracing back the cause-effect relationship, the stage immediately preceding the stage where the non-existential fallacy arises, that final stage, is called <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> or &ldquo;primal cause&rdquo; &#133; the causal factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><p>The name of the great sage Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da eventually featured in our discussion of the cause-effect theory. This Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da was the first inventor of the atomic theory. Many people knew about this cause-and-effect theory in a casual, perfunctory manner both before and after Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da, but he was the first person to establish it as a systematic and fundamental theory. He was the first to say, <I>Ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;bha&#x301;va&#x301;t karya&#x301;bha&#x301;vah</I>. These two parts of <I>Kan&#x301;a&#x301;diiya</I> <I>Nya&#x301;ya</I> (the atomic theory and the cause-effect theory) later helped greatly in unravelling many knotty problems of the world. It is worth mentioning in this connection that Indian theistic theory developed into three distinct, original branches of philosophy: two <I>sa&#x301;m&#x301;khyas</I>, two <I>miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301;s</I> and two <I>nya&#x301;yas</I>. The oldest of these is Kapila&#146;s <I>Niriishvara Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya</I>. The great sage Kapila, the proponent of this philosophy, hailed from a village named Patijhalda in the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h region. He attained divine grace on the hill of Kapila&#x301; near Jhalda and established his <I>mat&#x301;h</I> [monastery] at Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sa&#x301;gar &#133; an oceanic island. The second system of <I>Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya</I> is known as <I>Seshvar Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya</I>, introduced by the great sage, Patain&#x32D;jali. He was born in the village Patun situated near Burdwan of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h region. The third theory was known as Purva Miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301; Darshana. The great sage Jaimini, the exponent of this philosophy, was a man of southern India. There was a time when his Purva Miima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301; was widely accepted by the ordinary people of India. Kavikaun&#x32D;kana <I></I>Mukundara&#x301;ma writes:<!-- /block --></p>

He also belonged to southern India. The great sage Gaotama, who founded the Gaotamiiya Nya&#x301;ya darshana, belonged to a place near Kamtaul of Mithila ... and the exponent of the second <I>nya&#x301;ya darshana</I> or <I>vaeshes&#x301;ika darshana</I> was the great sage Kan&#x301;a&#x301;da (Kan&#x301;a&#x301;diiya Nya&#x301;ya). He was born in Purus&#x301;pur (Peshavar) of the then Gandha&#x301;ra [the border region of Afghanistan and northwest India]. Although Gaotamiiya Nya&#x301;ya had originated and developed in the beginning in Mithila, it was <I>navyanya&#x301;ya</I> [new logic theory] based on it that brought glory to Navadvip [Nadia District, West Bengal]. Raghunath Bhattacharya (Raghunath Shiroman&#x301;i), one of its interpreters, was born in the district of Burdwan near Navadvip.

<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><p>The first Jaena Darshana is Digambar Jaena Darshana. Although Jain philosophy believed in spirituality, it is called atheistic philosophy because it does not state clearly its views regarding <I>a&#x301;tman</I> and <I>Parama&#x301;tman</I> due to its opposition to the Vedas. According to the old school of thought, a philosophy that does not believe in any of the three &ndash; Vedas, the <I>a&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> [soul, spirit] or <I>Parama&#x301;tma&#x301;</I> [Supreme Subjectivity]&ndash;is called atheistic.

The relation between the material force and the cognitive force is the same at the end as it was at the beginning of the cyclic creative order. That means, in the embryonic stage of <I>sain&#x32D;cara</I>, the sentient principle dominates, but then gradually it begins to diminish and, due to the increasing force of other <I>gun&#x301;as</I> and the growing dominance of the material cause, it becomes reduced to crudeness in the final stage of <I>sain&#x32D;cara</I>. And then, when <I>pratisain&#x32D;cara</I> begins, the dominance of the material force gradually begins to diminish. At that stage, the dominance of other <I>gun&#x301;as</I> [mutative and static] begin to wane and the dominance of <I>Sattva-gun&#x301;a</I>[sentient] begins to grow. In the final stage of <I>pratisain&#x32D;cara</I>, the supremacy of <I>sattvagun&#x301;a</I> is established, other <I>gun&#x301;as</I> lose their influence, and the dominance of the material cause becomes nearly non-existent. The embryonic stage of <I>sain&#x32D;cara</I> may be called the causal state of the cycle of creation&#133; thereafter it gradually takes the shape of its effect, step by step.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph --><p>The relation between the cognitive force and the material force that exists in the embryonic stage continues to exist even in the final stage of <I>pratisain&#x32D;cara</I>. The only difference is that at the embryonic stage of <I>sain&#x32D;cara</I>, <I>sattvagun&#x301;a</I> gradually begins to reduce, and at the final stage of <I>pratisain&#x32D;cara</I>, <I>sattvagun&#x301;a</I> regains its original nature, that is, goes back to its original stance. We can, of course, call the embryonic stage of <I>sain&#x32D;cara</I> the causal state, although the cognitive force and material force do not strictly exist at that stage. The final stage of <I>pratisain&#x32D;cara</I> cannot be called <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I>, because that is actually the culmination of its effect. So we call it <I>sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nya&#x301;vastha&#x301;</I>. If the first one is described as <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;adeha</I> [causal body], the second one should be described as <I>sa&#x301;ma&#x301;nyadeha</I> [body beyond the subtle layer of mind].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph --><li>The string that is used for counting beads is called <I>japama&#x301;la&#x301;</I> in Sanskrit, <I>tasbi</I> in Arabic and &ldquo;rosary&rdquo; in English. The string contains sometimes 108 beads, sometimes 100, and sometimes a different number of beads according to the instructions of a particular preceptor. A round of beads will indicate how many times the beads have been counted. It is necessary to keep some tangible mark at the point where one round is complete. The bead that immediately follows that mark is called <I>&ldquo;ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a&#x301;vastha&#x301;</I> of <I>japakriya&#x301;&rdquo;</I> and <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;agut&#x301;i</I> [causal bead].<!-- /block --></p>

This <I>pres&#x301;an&#x301;ii-tattva</I>, which is original, is the creator of the next action. It is called &ldquo;noumenal&rdquo;. Some people think that, like many other words, this is also a Latin word. No, this is not true. It is a very old German word &ndash; so old that the modern German language had not yet evolved. On the other side of this noumenal entity lie various forces manifested in diverse actions. If we call the <I>pres&#x301;an&#x301;ii-shakti</I> the noumenal cause, we will call its opposite the phenomenal effect. If we say that falsehood is the noumenal cause of all phenomenal crimes, then it will mean that falsehood is the <I>pres&#x301;an&#x301;ii-tattva</I> of all crimes. This noumenal cause is called <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I>. If there is no falsehood, most sins will not manifest. If there is no noumenal cause, then there is no phenomenal effect. So this connotation of <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> is particularly valuable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph --><li>In most animals, and particularly in human beings, there are various kinds of nerve cells and nerve fibres. In common parlance the word <I>na&#x301;d&#x301;ii</I> [channels] is used to mean these nerves, but they are not the same. The nerves are of two kinds: sensory nerves and motor nerves. The sensory nerves transmit the inferences through the gateway of organs to the nerve cells. The organs through which the inferences are received are called sensory organs. The motor nerves transmit the messages of the nerve cells to the [motor] organs which then express them. In that case the gateways of organs are called motor organs. In the bodies of many animals, and particularly in the bodies of human beings, there are five sensory organs: eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Their function is extro-internal, to bring something within. So, another name for these is <I>antahkaran&#x301;a</I>. The motor organs are five fold: mouth, hands, legs, genitals and anus. Their function is intro-external. So they are called <I>bahihkaran&#x301;a</I>. Five means of internalization, five means of externalization and the mind constitute eleven organs. The word <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> also means <I>antahkaran&#x301;a</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

So, curdled milk and sugar will be called the <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> or cause of rasagolla. The potter needs clay to make a pitcher with the help of the potter&#146;s wheel. So the clay will be called the <I>ka&#x301;ran&#x301;a</I> of the pitcher. In order to cut bamboo with a cutting instrument made of iron, the weapon must have a handle for holding it.

Sometimes we get an idea of the whole after hearing or reading just a little, sometimes we realize it only in the final stage, and sometimes again only after the completion of the reading. The farther on in the story we get this idea, the greater is the suspense in that drama or novel, whatever may be the case.

The time that the moon takes to go once around the earth, that is, the time taken by the moon to go around all the houses of the zodiac, is called a lunar month. The lunar month is thus one unit. The time taken by the moon to cover one particular star in its orbit is called a lunar day or <I>tithi</I> [a day of the moon]. The lunar day is part of the previously-mentioned unit. Twelve lunar months make one lunar year. This lunar year is twelve times the lunar month. The extra month that is added [to the lunar calendar] approximately once in three years is meant to bring about parity with the unit of the solar year. The time taken by the earth to go around the sun along the zodiac in 360 degrees makes one solar year. This solar year is also a unit. The earth takes twenty-four hours to revolve on its axis and bring every part of its surface to face the sun. This period of twenty-four hours is also a unit in the measurement of time.

But that is not true. It is a Sanskrit word used in Bengali in its original form.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><p>You are possibly aware of the fact that there was a time when people used to bother too much about castes. And in this regard, they displayed terrible intolerance. Caste-discrimination was about to strangle humanism. In many cases this happened. People belonging to the so-called lower strata of society were not really considered human beings. In certain spheres they were treated worse than animals. It was not thought that a food item must be discarded &ndash; it is not considered so even now &ndash; when a mouse, a mole, a fly or mosquito touched it. But what to speak of it being touched by certain so called lower-caste people &#133; or their entering the kitchen &#133; or their sitting in the kitchen veranda &ndash; in certain cases, they were even barred from entering the courtyard of the house. Although it was loudly claimed that everything is the manifestation of Brahma, <I>Sarvam&#x301; khalvidam&#x301; Brahma</I>, in reality all kinds of casteism were concealed within the boundaries of religion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><p>In those days the boomerang of this religious bigotry did not spare even the heads of society. On the contrary, it was Brahmans who did the greatest injury to other Brahmans. The descendents of Krttivas Thakur (his nephew&#146;s line) had to carry a social stigma because Krttivas Thakur had committed the offence of translating the <I>Ra&#x301;ma&#x301;yan&#x301;a<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.6.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#6.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I> into Bengali. A high-caste Brahman was downgraded due to leaving his village to settle in another. Thus surnames like Banerjees became Kusha&#x301;riis, Batabyals, Ma&#x301;scar&#x301;aks; similarly, Chatterjees were downgraded to Ka&#x301;in&#x32D;jiilals, Pa&#x301;kr&#x301;a&#x301;shiis; Bhattacharyas became Chakravartis. For a petty offence a person was expelled from his or her caste or expelled from his or her religion. People were forced to renounce their religion or undergo various kinds of persecution under pressure of circumstances.

In order to save people from this precarious situation, he formulated a system of communities comprising people who had similar kinds of faults or qualities. As a result, no one could henceforth be summarily expelled from his or her caste. Moreover, since people of similar offences or qualities belonged to the same community, there was no question of vilification of one person by another. Amongst the Brahmans of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region (Banerjee, Mukherjee, Chatterjee, Gaunguly, Ghosal), this community system was called <I>melbandhan</I> (Phuliya&#x301; Mel, <I></I>Sarva&#x301;nandii Mel, Khardaha Mel, etc.). The same <I>melbandhan</I> was called <I>pat&#x301;iibandhan</I> by the Brahmans of the Barendra class (such as Sanyal, Bhadurii, Lahirii, Bagcii, Maetra). Those who had lost their original aristocratic Brahman status but had not yet been fully incorporated into a lower Brahman caste, that is, those who were in an intermediary stage, were called <I>bhaun&#x32D;gakuliin</I> [a fallen aristocrat].

So in its etymological sense, <I>ka&#x301;la</I> means &ldquo;what has been measured&rdquo; or &ldquo;what has been sounded&rdquo;. In common usage, by <I>ka&#x301;la</I> we understand the following: <ol> <li>A measurement of time. The moon moves around the earth. In its orbit, it crosses the twelve houses of the zodiac. The mind&#146;s measurement of this single revolution is called <I>ka&#x301;la</I> [which sometimes means &ldquo;time&rdquo; in general], and this particular time taken by the moon is called a lunar month. For nearly half of this lunar month the moon remains in a diminishing or waning process due to the narrowing of the reflection of the sun. The rest of the time it remains in a gradually waxing condition due to the broadening of the reflection of the sun. So we have divided the lunar month into two fortnights &ndash; the bright fortnight (<I>shukla paks&#x301;a)</I> and the dark fortnight <I>(krs&#x301;n&#x301;a paks&#x301;a)</I>, starting with the new moon and the full moon respectively.

During this solar year, because of the angular difference in the axis, sometimes the northern part of the earth tilts towards the sun, and at other times the southern part. Accordingly we sometimes say &ldquo;northern tilt&rdquo; [summer solstice], and at other times &ldquo;southern tilt&rdquo; [winter solstice]. In order to present it symbolically, we say that the sun is in the Tropic of Cancer or in the Tropic of Capricorn. All these are also measurements of time. Every house of the zodiac subtends an angle of 30 degrees at the centre. Although in every case it makes a 30 degree angle, the segments of the orbit are not equal. So the earth takes different times to cross the various segments. We call the time taken to cross one segment a solar month. A solar month generally consists of 30 or 31 days, but in rare cases it may also be 29 or even 32 days. All these are <I>ka&#x301;las</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

You must have also heard about <I>ka&#x301;lasarpa</I>. The black cobra is a subspecies of <I>goks&#x301;ura</I> [<I>Cobra de capello</I>]. A g<I>oks&#x301;ura</I> is called <I>gokhro</I> in the Kolkata region. In the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region, both the names &ndash; <I>gokhro</I> and <I>kharis</I> &ndash; are prevalent. <I>Goks&#x301;ura</I> has many species and subspecies &ndash; <I>ka&#x301;ligokhro, padmagokhro, shaun&#x32D;kha gokhro</I>, etc., are examples. The <I>Gokhro</I> variety of snake generally lives in an old house in a residential area. When the tail of a very old <I>goks&#x301;ura</I> falls off, quite often the people, instead of killing it, allow it to live in the house, and then they call it <I>va&#x301;stusa&#x301;pa</I> [a residential snake]. The <I>keut&#x301;e</I> or cobra has several species and subspecies, such as <I>ka&#x301;lakeut&#x301;e, a&#x301;lkeut&#x301;e</I>, etc. A cobra generally lives outdoors in fields away from human habitation. <I></I>The <I>ka&#x301;lakeut&#x301;e</I> generally lives away from human habitation in forests, bushes and shrubs.<!-- /block --></p>

When it feels very hot, it keeps its body submerged in water, keeping only its head above the water. Although <I>a&#x301;lkeut&#x301;e</I> is short, thin and as poisonous as any snake of the cobra family, its temper is always very hot ... If any person walking on the ridge inadvertently disturbs its peace, it at once rushes out and bites that person. But other snakes do not rush out to bite; they bite only in self-defence. <I>A&#x301;lkeut&#x301;e, ka&#x301;lakeut&#x301;e</I> and common <I>keut&#x301;e &ndash;</I> all three &ndash; cannot stand heat. Many times they lie entwined along the rail lines at night when the rails are somewhat cold. On hearing the sound of a coming train, other snakes flee the rail lines, but the ill-tempered <I>keut&#x301;e</I> does not. Possibly it thinks, &ldquo;Whom do I fear enough to run away from?&rdquo; Accordingly it remains on the line. So most of the snakes that are run over by trains in the summertime are <I>keut&#x301;es</I>. The Sanskrit name of this <I>keut&#x301;e</I> is <I>krs&#x301;n&#x301;agoks&#x301;ura</I> or <I>ka&#x301;lasarpa</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

The nature of the snake&#146;s blood makes it difficult for it to survive in a cold country. Even in hot countries, snakes go into hibernation for several months during winter. Generally it can be said that the few snakes we find in cold countries are nonpoisonous. Snakes live primarily in tropical countries, particularly where there are adequate wet lands. In Bengal, India and Southeast Asia, particularly in the land of <I>Shya&#x301;mdesh</I> [Thailand], the number of snakes and reptiles is exorbitantly high.

Snake venom is used in various medicines prepared in allopathy, unani, ayurveda and homeopathy, (<I>nyaja&#x301;-</I>cobra).

The etymological meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> is &ldquo;related to <I>ka&#x301;la</I> [time]&rdquo;. In common usage it means the following:- <ol> <li><I>Ka&#x301;lashakti:</I> The sensorial measurement of the motivity of action is called <I>ka&#x301;la</I>. If the motivity of this <I>ucchu&#x301;nya&#x301;</I> [unexpressed state of] <I>Prakrti</I> were not there, time would have been flawed by non-existence. Again, in the absence of a measuring mind, the existential entity remains unrecognized. When there is movement, it must be understood that there are at least two entities, and there must be a change of place in at least one of them. Alternately, all existing multiple entities are continuously undergoing change of place. This displacement of one or many is effected by action. Change of place is relative. In an eternal state of equipoise, change of place is impossible. Similarly impossible is absolute pause or absolute speed. This movement, which is essentially relative, and on which the mind acts through sense perceptions, is certainly a dynamic force (<I>calacchakti</I>)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->.

<a name="7..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><li>Whether inanimate or animate, creature or plant, human or non-human, everything has certain generic features and certain specific features. Each of these features can be called a quality. It should be remembered that even defects are qualities (a defect means a negative quality). In a so-called inanimate object, such as gold<I></I>, for example, there are positive qualities [properties] and negative qualities (defects). The identity of gold and its attributes is characterized by the combination of these positive and negative qualities. A gold particle contains, carries and sustains these qualities. It is also the nature of these characteristics that decides with what it can be combined at the atomic stage, and the kinds of changes that would take place in its atomic structure. All these together constitute the goldenness of gold.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><p>Take yoghurt, for example. The introduction of a particular agent [acidic coagulator] like <I>dadhyamla (dambal)</I> brings about chemical changes in lukewarm milk and converts it to yoghurt. The atomic composition of lukewarm milk is not exactly like the atomic composition of ordinary milk. The change occasioned by the introduction of the coagulator (<I>dambal</I>) also involves a further transformation in its atomic composition. So the qualities of milk in these three different stages are not the same. Those who cannot digest ordinary milk may possibly digest lukewarm milk. Again, those who cannot digest lukewarm milk may perhaps digest yoghurt. Furthermore, those who cannot digest yoghurt may be able to digest buttermilk (<I>ghol</I>). This means that there are differences in quality in the same inanimate object, in different places and times or when it passes through a chemical process. The <I>sa&#x301;marasya</I> [balance] is disturbed at this stage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><p>Animate horses have particular qualities. Again, there are qualitative differences amongst different species of horses. The all-round development of the world is based on the states, structures, changes and modifications of all these qualitative differences. So no all-round progress is possible while ignoring any entity, irrespective of its molecular, atomic or electronic base. That is why any thought along sectarian lines is fundamentally incorrect. And this is the reason why I am compelled to say that the path of Neo Humanism<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.7.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#7.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is the only path of welfare &#133; the only path of progress.

<a name="7..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><p>Human beings also have different branches and sub-branches. They also certainly have special structural characteristics. Human beings of the same subspecies have differences in their existential composition as well as in their existential awareness. So in the creation of the new world, everyone may have a role to play<I></I>, but the roles are not, and cannot, be the same. It is not possible to lead human beings towards progress by putting them into one single mould and pulverizing their distinctive features with a steamroller. Putting all human beings in the cage of one single &ldquo;commune&rdquo; and forcing them to sing the glory of one single theory in one single tune can never liberate humanity.<!-- /block --></p>

But in today&#146;s world, melons grow in sand-mixed earth, wherever there is water under the sand, provided the climate is sufficiently warm. Generally, in the northern hemisphere melon seeds are sown towards the end of December, and the fruits are available until the start of rainy season. The plant begins to yield fruit from the time it is just one month old. The fruits take two and half months to ripen. The outer skin of the melon is generally of three kinds: black, green and white. Melons of varied, striped colours have been produced in China since ancient times. Again, melons are of three different types, depending on the colour of its kernel: rosy, dark blue and yellow. In China, melons with yellow kernel are readily available. This melon with yellow kernel may not be very large in size, but it is very sweet. In India, the melons of Bhagalpur were most famous for their size. The melons of Goyalanda (the original name was <I>Goya&#x301;la&#x301;-nanda)</I>, Burdwan <I></I>and Tarakeswar were also famous at one time. At present there is fairly good cultivation of the original Japanese melon in the regions of south Bengal close to the sea. Since this kind of melon grows well in the region near <I>Gaun&#x32D;ga&#x301;sa&#x301;gar</I> [confluence of the Bay of Bengal] it has been named <I>sa&#x301;garashree</I>. Thanks to this <I>sa&#x301;garashree</I>, Bengal is now quite advanced in the melon cultivation. Melons with black or blackish skins are called <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph --><p>In prehistoric times, the melon had a sister fruit. But in the course of time, it branched out in a different direction. As cauliflowers, cabbage, modern broccoli and lettuce are born out of the very ancient broccoli, similarly one branch of the original melon is known as <I>tarmuj</I> [melon] and the other branch is known as <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I>. In <I></I>many respects <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> is <I></I>like a melon. It needs sandy soil and warmth. But while a melon is round shaped, a <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> is oblong. A melon can be eaten only when it is ripe; moreover, it is not cooked. A <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> can be eaten when it is green, but it must be cooked for eating, and it cannot be eaten when it is ripe. The central part of a melon is extremely rich in sugar, while in a <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> the sugar content is almost nil. In taste it is more like <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;kur&#x301;</I> (what is called <I>kan&#x32D;kur&#x301;</I> when green is called <I>phut&#x301;i</I> when ripe) than like cucumber.<!-- /block --></p>

In chaste Bengali, a <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> is called <I>khan&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301;</I>. From the white of a ripe melon and from <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I> one can make flour. This flour may not have much nutritional value, but it can help to some extent in filling the stomach of poor people. In areas like Bengal as well as India and other countries where there is an acute shortage of food, one should cultivate on a large scale plants such as melons, <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;os</I>, ground cucumber (<I>ks&#x301;iirika&#x301;s</I> or <I>ks&#x301;iira&#x301;s</I>) and plants of the <I>ka&#x301;n&#x32D;kur&#x301;</I> family (<I>phut&#x301;i</I> or <I>ba&#x301;un&#x32D;gi</I>) in fallow, riparian lands. This will help immensely in solving the food problems of the world. It is also possible to extract large amounts of cooking oil from the seeds of melon and <I>khen&#x32D;r&#x301;o</I>.

In common usage <I>ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga</I> means the following: <ol> <li>A middle-sized elephant of the Indian variety. Indian elephants are generally of two kinds &ndash; very large and medium-sized. The large elephants are rather tall in height, though not as tall as the African elephant, but they are quite intelligent. The African elephant cannot be easily domesticated, but an Indian elephant is amenable to domestication. Once upon a time there were plenty of medium-sized Indian elephants, but now they are almost extinct. In the southern part of Assam and in Tripura there were ample medium-sized elephants even during the Mughal period. It is said that during the Mughal and Pathan periods, whenever there were battles between the king of Tripura and the <I>nawabs</I> and emperors, the king of Tripura used to present a few such medium-sized elephants to the <I>nawabs</I> and emperors as terms of the truce. At present we seldom come across these medium-sized elephants in other parts of India. The complexion of these elephants is paler than the complexion of large elephants &ndash; somewhat ashen coloured, in fact. One name of this medium-sized Indian elephant is <I>ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga</I>. Any elephant cub can also be called <I>ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga</I>.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph --><li>India invented and began to use steel a long time ago. At that time, steel was not manufactured by the process followed today. There were neither huge steel plants like those of today nor were there big smithies. The steel was made through an indigenous process. Many of the Ashoka pillars are made from this steel, and they have remained intact for as long as two thousand years. The pillar of Prthviraj near Kutubminar (Delhi) is also made of the steel from that period. There was a time when it was not even possible to move this pillar. People say that in later times, a foreign invader was able to move it. As a result, the pillar became slightly loose. As the pillar became loose, people of the time changed the name of Indraprastha to <I>D&#x301;heilii</I> [leaning or slanting or loose] from which is derived the word &ldquo;Delhi&rdquo;. Whatever may be the formula for producing this Indian steel, it is also called <I>ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga</I>. You can also freely use the word <I>ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga</I> in this sense in Bengali.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="7..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph --><li>You have noticed that from the end of winter until summer, a variety of bottle gourd that is longish in shape grows in the fields. The gourmets claim that delicious <I>ra&#x301;ita&#x301;</I> can be made with this gourd when mixed with yoghurt. One can make delicious fried chops also by smearing it with powdered rice or powdered pulse. You must have seen such small, pitcher-shaped gourds. These are very good for making a dish of minced and spiced vegetables, cooked almost dry, and a sweet dish prepared by boiling bottle gourd pieces in milk with sugar and other ingredients. You also must have seen round gourds. This round gourd is very good for a dish of vegetables cooked in a little oil, and also a type of preparation having several vegetables including bitter gourd. Many of you must have eaten such dishes made of round gourd. You must have seen club gourd also. If this club gourd is turned into paste after boiling, made into balls and then put into broth, the balls become very tasty.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="7..83"></a><p class="plain"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph --><li><I>Ka&#x301;liun&#x32D;ga</I> means any kind of melon. Botanists say that the melon had its origin in Arabia and the Middle East, but its production and use in India can be traced back to very ancient times. Right from the Rgvedic <I></I>era, Aryans and Dravidians were familiar with melons. Moreover in the Vedic language, there are many references to melon. In contrast, the use of <I>sphot&#x301;ana</I> or <I>sphot&#x301;aka</I> (<I>kharmuj</I> or <I>kharbuja&#x301;</I>) and <I>sphut&#x301;ika&#x301;</I> (<I>phut&#x301;i</I> or <I>ba&#x301;un&#x32D;gi</I>) is far less.

<a name="7..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->Well, although a bit irrelevant, let me tell you that many scholars used to say by mistake that the word <I>ra&#x301;jagira</I> [in Magadh, Bihar] has come from the word <I>ra&#x301;jagrha</I>. I have said earlier and say now that in the Ma&#x301;gadhii language, the word derived from <I>grha</I> is <I>ghar</I>. Had the original word been <I>ra&#x301;jagrha</I>, then today in the Ma&#x301;gadhii language its form would have been <I>ra&#x301;jaghara</I> (<I>ra&#x301;jagrha &gt; ra&#x301;jagarha &gt; ra&#x301;jaghara-a &gt; ra&#x301;jaghara</I>). However, that is not the case; in the present Magahii <I></I>language, the word is <I>ra&#x301;jagira</I>, and this means that the original word must have indisputably been <I>ra&#x301;jagiri</I>, that is, royal mountain. This place [<I>ra&#x301;jagira</I>] was at one time the capital of Magadh. Perhaps this accounts for the name <I>ra&#x301;jagiri</I>, and not because <I></I>it is a high mountain, for there are many higher mountains in the realm of Magadh. Similarly we get <I>mudgagiri&gt;muun&#x32D;gagiri&gt; muun&#x32D;gira&gt;muun&#x32D;ger</I> [another place in Bihar]<I></I>. Furthermore, <I>ra&#x301;jagira</I> cannot be spelt with <I>gii</I> but with <I>gi</I>, because <I></I>in the spelling of <I>giri</I> we have only <I>i</I>.

<a name="8..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Last Sunday I told you a few words about <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I>. You must have understood that although the two words, <I>ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> and <I>ka&#x301;lii</I>, are closely related, they are not exactly identical <I>(hubahu)<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I>. The word <I>ka&#x301;lii</I> is formed <I></I>by adding the suffix <I>un&#x32D;giic</I> to the stem <I>ka&#x301;la;</I> we get the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> by using the suffixes <I>i</I> and <I>in</I>. In most cases both the spellings, <I>ka&#x301;li</I> and <I>ka&#x301;lii</I> are correct. But the spelling with <I>ii</I> is not acceptable if the word forms the first part of a compound word. The rule applies to the adding of <I>i</I> or <I>ii</I> when a word ends with the phoneme <I>la</I>: <I>a&#x301;balii-a&#x301;bali, ta&#x301;lii-ta&#x301;li, kara&#x301;lii-kara&#x301;li, kalii-kali, tama&#x301;lii-tama&#x301;li, stha&#x301;lii-stha&#x301;li, sha&#x301;lmalii-sha&#x301;lmali, na&#x301;lii- na&#x301;li-n&#x301;a&#x301;lii-n&#x301;a&#x301;li</I>, etc<I></I>. So while <I>Ka&#x301;liida&#x301;sa</I> is incorrect, <I>Can&#x301;d&#x301;iida&#x301;sa</I> is correct. The rule is applicable only to the end <I>lra</I>. <I>Can&#x301;d&#x301;iida&#x301;sa, Deviida&#x301;sa</I> do not have the end <I>lra</I>. You must have heard that the verbal root <I>kala</I> means to sound, to measure, to count, etc. That is the etymological meaning of <I>ka&#x301;la</I>. The feminine of the word is <I>ka&#x301;lii</I>. Although feminine, the meaning is the same. In common usage, by <I>ka&#x301;lii/ka&#x301;li</I> we understand the following: <ol><!-- /block --></p>

But <I>ka&#x301;li</I> means the entity that measures <I>ka&#x301;la</I>. It was in this sense that the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> was used in Buddhist Tantra, and the ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;nii <I></I>and <I></I>Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii <I></I>schools used to worship <I>Ka&#x301;li</I> in the <I>Bhaeravii Cakra</I>.

<a name="8..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of the word <I>ka&#x301;li</I> is the negative form of <I>Can&#x301;d&#x301;ika&#x301;shakti</I>. According to Puranic legend when Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii was asked to disclose her identity, even before she could answer, an ink-black entity emanated from her body and said, &ldquo;I am not Can&#x301;d&#x301;ii&rdquo;.

But <I>Ka&#x301;lika&#x301;</I> Tantra originated during the period when the ancient Shaeva <I></I>school was predominant, as was the case during the rise of Jainism. For this reason, the Jains recognized Jaina-Shiva (Jyotirliun&#x32D;ga) <I></I>and <I></I>accepted <I></I>Pa&#x301;rvatii as <I>a&#x301;dya&#x301;shakti</I> or <I>ambika&#x301;shakti</I> or the collective form of sixty-four <I>yoginiis</I>; similarly, in Buddhism also Shiva has been accepted as Maha&#x301; Buddha. In the same way, Shiva&#146;s <I></I>earthly wife Ka&#x301;lii <I></I>was considered an acoustic form of Naera&#x301;tmadevii. As a result, Ka&#x301;lii not only acquired status in Buddhist religion, in Puranic Tantra also she was somewhat more firmly established than Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;. Darjjelim&#x301;, the traditional Buddhist name of Darjeeling, became Durjaya Liun&#x32D;ga <I></I>in the Puranic language.<!-- /block --></p>

The <I>Vipras</I> [intellectuals] and the <I>Vaishyas</I> [business class] used wooden clogs with wooden balls attached. The <I>Shu&#x301;dras</I> were not allowed to use shoes. The <I>Ks&#x301;atriyas</I> wore leather sandals. In those days there was no arrangement for tanning. They used to rub the leather with the resin of <I>ga&#x301;b</I> [<I>kendu</I>, mangosteen variety] and dry it in the sun. Then it was seasoned in lukewarm water for a lengthy period. When this process was repeated several times, the leather no longer remained a raw hide, and the stench was also removed to some extent. It is with this leather that <I>na&#x301;gra&#x301;s</I> [a kind of loose shoe or slipper] used by <I>Ks&#x301;atriyas</I> were made.

In the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region there are many villages with similar names, like A&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;radihi, A&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;raha&#x301;t&#x301;i, A&#x301;un&#x32D;ga&#x301;rasole, because the inhabitants of the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region have been familiar with coal since ancient times. The people in those days did not know an effective method for digging up coal from a coal mine where deposits lay far below the earth&#146;s surface. They used to dig up the earth, scoop out the coal and use it for burning, cooking and metallic crafts. At one time there were a number of open pits in Burdwan, Manbhum (Purulia and Dhanbad) and Hazaribag regions. In an open pit, the layers of coal sometimes rise and move towards the uppermost layer of the earth. So it was from open pits that coal used to be collected since very ancient times.<!-- /block --></p>

They had a general idea regarding the location of available coal mines. They knew that there was a huge deposit of coal in the Damodar River bed.

Perhaps after some time there will be no coal in the upper layers of the coal mines. In order to collect coal, one will have to go deep down. Perhaps the venture may not be cost-effective then. Once a substitute for coal as fuel is invented, the mines will be abandoned. Instead we will have a huge lake stretching from Bhurkunda to Mejia. From the western side, the Damodar will flow into that lake, and then, leaving the lake, the river will run towards Durgapur. As the used mines are not properly filled with sand, the mines will collapse and these kinds of lakes will be created.

So the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth are divided according to the predominance of heat or cold. In this manner we have four parts of the earth: i) the northern part of the eastern hemisphere, ii) the southern part of the eastern hemisphere, iii) the northern part of the western hemisphere, and iv) the southern part of the western hemisphere.

So <I>ka&#x301;sara</I> etymologically means &ldquo;to move towards water&rdquo; or &ldquo;one who goes towards water&rdquo;. In common usage, <I>ka&#x301;sara</I> means: <ol> <li>&ldquo;A Buffalo&rdquo;. Whether it is alone or in a herd, yoked to a bullock cart or yoked to the plough, a buffalo always runs towards water whenever it sees water.

<a name="8..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph --><li>In common usage <I>ka&#x301;sara</I> means an otter. If you chase an otter, or if it feels endangered for some reason, it at once runs away and jumps into the water. That is why in Sanskrit one name of the otter is <I>udbir&#x301;a&#x301;l</I>, which literally means water-cat, and in English sea-lion or water-lion. The face of an otter has some similarity to the face of a lion. Perhaps that is the reason why the word &ldquo;lion&rdquo; has been used in connection with the otter: </ol><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph --><I>Ka</I> + <I>a&#x301;sa&#x301;ra</I>. Etymologically it means &ldquo;the water that attracts others&rdquo;. In common usage <I>ka&#x301;sa&#x301;ra</I> means a large water reservoir. In a large water reservoir there are no banks. The shore level slopes gently down to the water line. That is why a sea, lake, old wetland or fen &ndash; all can be called <I>ka&#x301;sa&#x301;ra</I>. It may be seen that when a very old pond keeps on breaking its banks and comes to a stage where it has virtually no bank, the adjacent ground also keeps on eroding to meet the water line. This kind of pond with broken banks or dams is also called <I>ka&#x301;sa&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..50"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph --><i>Kikhi</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Ku + d&#x301;ikhin = kikhi</I>. The verbal root <I>ku</I> is used in many senses. One meaning is grinning and grimacing. So, the etymological meaning of the word <I>kikhi</I> is &ldquo;one who grimaces&rdquo;. One speciality about the suffixes <I>d&#x301;ikhin</I> and <I>kvan</I> is that the last phoneme of the verbal root can alternately be <I>i</I>. For example, if you add the suffix <I>kvan/kvas</I> to the verbal root <I>kan</I>, the resulting word will of course be <I>kan&#x301;va</I>, but it can also be <I>kin&#x301;va</I>. Similarly, if you add the suffix <I>d&#x301;ikhin</I>, it can be both <I>kukhi</I> and <I>kikhi</I>. But the <I>kukhi</I> form is not prevalent. In common usage, the word <I>kikhi</I> means: <ol> <li>&ldquo;Monkey&rdquo;. On the slightest occasion, either due to fear or excitement, a monkey grimaces with clenched fist. So it is called <I>kikhi</I>. This habit of the monkey is prehistoric. Although the ancestors of human beings and monkeys are the same, they were separated at least one million years ago. So a human being also, when frightened or excited, clenches the fist and grimaces. A small child keeps its fist clenched most of the time, and the habit of grimacing also remains predominant in childhood.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph --><li>Another meaning of <I>kikhi</I> in common use is fox. A fox has glinting teeth and face. So one synonym of fox in Sanskrit is <I>ulka&#x301;mukhii</I> [meteor-faced]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph --><p>While talking about <I>kikhi</I>, I am reminded of an incident after a long time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph --><p>That day I had come to the coal depot quite early in the morning and, standing in the queue, I had been most indifferently counting the leaves of a banyan tree. (In the morning you cannot see the stars; if it were possible, I would have been counting the stars only.) All of a sudden I met Ujbuk Singh. Ujbuk Singh is the chief orderly of Akalmand Singh. He was familiar with many private and public matters of his boss. I learnt from Ujbuk Singh that about fifteen days previously his boss had become an additional minister (deputy minister). On seeing me, he gave a broad, beaming smile and said, &ldquo;Sarkar sahib, since my boss has become the deputy minister, everyday he tells me about his desire to see you. Only this morning he told me, &#x301;I must see Sarkar sahib today by any means. You go to his house and immediately make a &rdquo;pontmont&ldquo; (&rdquo;appointment&ldquo;) with him.&#146; But I could never imagine that I would run into you like this.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;But why deputy minister? At one time he was a full minister!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph --><p>Ujbuk Singh said: &ldquo;The time he was a full minister there were many complaints against him regarding nepotism, bribery, casteism, and so on. An enquiry commission was also instituted. But the commission was secretly asked not to give its report before the election. Although the report of the commission has not yet been published, there has certainly been some scandal about my boss. So it is slightly risky to include my boss in the cabinet of ministers. But if he is completely left out, then there may be a rift in the party. So as a compromise formula, he has been made a deputy minister&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Well, exactly at five. If he comes after that I cannot meet him.

<a name="8..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph --><p>He explained, &ldquo;Look, everything that is supposed to be progressive in modern science is actually bad for human beings.

<a name="8..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;After becoming non-violent, are you planning to put a total prohibition on the use of arms?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph --><p>He answered, &ldquo;I have completely prohibited the use of any weapon. So I asked the nurse to cut the umbilical cord with the help of a bamboo slip.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph --><p>I pursued, &ldquo;Last time when your grandfather died, how did you cut the bamboo for making the hearse?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph --><p>He replied, &ldquo;There was no need to cut the bamboo. We put fire at the places where it was to be cut and then twisted it several times, and it broke on its own.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..92"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Well I, understand. But did you not chop the logs into small pieces for burning?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph --><p>I then realized that Akalmand Singh was adamant.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph --><p>I resumed, &ldquo;You are engaged in agriculture and farming. Then many insects must die at the tip of the plough or a power-tiller or tractor when you use these to till the soil. Is that not an act of violence?

<a name="8..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph --><p>Akalmand retorted, &ldquo;I no longer tread a path of sin like that. I no longer cultivate. That is a great sin&#133; great sin&#133;great sin. I have given up farming altogether.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="8..134"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=134 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;What are you trying to suggest?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..135"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=135 type=paragraph --><p>Akalmand retorted, &ldquo;What does your linguistics say, or philology or phonetics?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..136"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=136 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;The word <I>carka&#x301;</I> has come from the word <I>cakra</I>, and not the other way round,&rdquo; I answered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..137"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=137 type=paragraph --><p>Akalmand said, &ldquo;So, there you are!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..138"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=138 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..139"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=139 type=paragraph --><p>He explained, &ldquo;The rules in the divine society are just the opposite of the rules of human society. I mean, according to the language of the divinities, the word <I>cakra</I> has come from the word <I>carka&#x301;</I>. The divinities had spinning wheels in their hands, and the violent humans have made it into <I>cakra</I>.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..140"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=140 type=paragraph --><p>I now understood that Akalmand Singh is an out and out non-violent person. I thought I would go one time to his house and see the changes that have taken place since he became a votary of non-violence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..141"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=141 type=paragraph --><p>The next day, very early in the morning &ndash; even before the crows had started cawing &ndash; I started for the house of Akalmand Singh. As I knocked on the door, a servant said from inside, &ldquo;The master is not at home.&rdquo; The residents forthwith began whispering something amongst themselves. Then I overheard a lady telling the servant, &ldquo;Tell him that he&#146;s at home, but it will take some time to see him.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..142"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=142 type=paragraph --><p>Then the servant said, &ldquo;Sir, the master&#146;s at home but you will have to wait for some time&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..143"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=143 type=paragraph --><p>Whereupon I told the servant, &ldquo;Tell him, that I am Mr. Sarkar; I will not wait even one second, I&#146;m leaving.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..144"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=144 type=paragraph --><p>I had hardly gone two steps when Akalmand Singh, busy putting a guernsey on rushed up to me exclaiming, &ldquo;Where are you going! The servant told you all rubbish without knowing you.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..145"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=145 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;Did you instruct him like that?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..146"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=146 type=paragraph --><p>He affirmed, &ldquo;Yes, I only instructed him like that. You see, people visit me with all kinds of motives. In order to escape them, I&#146;ve given this instruction.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..147"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=147 type=paragraph --><p>Holding me [respectfully], Akalmand led me into his drawing room.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..148"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=148 type=paragraph --><p>I told him, &ldquo;Now I won&#146;t sit inside. Better let&#146;s go to the rooftop; we&#146;ll get some fresh air there.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..149"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=149 type=paragraph --><p>As I was about to climb the stairs leading to the roof with his storeroom on our right, I noticed a recently killed, huge rat lying against the outer wall of the storeroom.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..150"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=150 type=paragraph --><p>I blurted out, &ldquo;Shame, shame, shame, shame! What&#146;s this! Fie, fie! What&#146;s this? Such an act of violence in the house of a non-violent person! What an act of cruelty &ndash; an anathema! The sacred vow of non-violence thrown to the winds! This is virtually a slaughtering of nonviolence! Alas! Alas! How has it come to such a pass?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..151"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=151 type=paragraph --><p>The dark face of Akalmand Singh turned violet (had his face been white, it would have turned crimson in shame) as he replied. &ldquo;This is exactly what I was going to tell you. Just look at these corporation people; just see what they have done.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..152"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=152 type=paragraph --><p>I rejoined, &ldquo;How strange! The corporation people stormed into your storeroom and killed the rat, and then themselves disappeared without even caring to remove the dead rat as they saw me entering! Just see what an awkward situation they have actually put you in!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..153"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=153 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;When exactly did the corporation people come?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..154"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=154 type=paragraph --><p>He said. &ldquo;No one came from the corporation&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..155"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=155 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;Then why do you blame them?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..156"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=156 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;Yesterday afternoon the corporation people were watering the streets with a hose. There was a monkey sitting on a tin roof by the wayside. A flippant young boy directed the mouth of the hose towards the monkey for fun. Annoyed and irritated as well as frightened by it, with gritting teeth and grimaces he jumped out of sight. Just nearby there was a huge grazing area &#133; a grazing ground for buffaloes. A huge buffalo, you understand, a <I>ka&#x301;sara&rdquo;</I><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..157"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=157 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Oh yes, yes, of course I know, for sure I know.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..158"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=158 type=paragraph --><p>He resumed, &ldquo;Annoyed by the grimaces of the monkey, a huge Gujarati buffalo weighing some sixty <I>maunds</I><!-- fn --><a name="Ref.8.fn5"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#8.fn5">5</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> rushed at the monkey. There was a hurdle on the way: a wall made of earth. The wall collapsed as the buffalo dashed against it. On the other side of the wall an elephant was standing. As soon as the wall collapsed on its body, the flabbergasted elephant started running at a speed of two hundred miles per minute. In the course of running, this elephant violently collided against the roadside wall of my storeroom. There were a number of dishes kept against the wall, and the rat, sitting in the chinks between the plates, was happily chewing the bones of a fish.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..159"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=159 type=paragraph --><p>I wondered, &ldquo;Fish bones in the house of nonviolence! Strange&#133;totally topsy-turvy! Alas, alas, see how nonviolence is ruthlessly butchered! It is like seeing a stone floating on water! Whatever fish it may be &ndash; be it <I>shol</I> [large tubular fish] or <I>moha&#x301;shol</I> [a larger variety of <I>shol</I>] &ndash; eating fish is a serious act of violence, surely a serious act of violence indeed!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..160"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=160 type=paragraph --><p>He said apologetically, &ldquo;It is only the servants who eat fish, the residents don&#146;t. Anyway, with the push of the elephant, the utensils fell down noisily, and look; it had to fall on the rat! How can such a small creature of God stand the weight of so many dishes! Consequently it died of suffocation. I have now planned to perform its funeral rites. Then I shall organize a <I>kiirtana</I> of nonviolence. All the big ministers, half-ministers, ministers without portfolio &ndash; all, all will come. I am planning to put up a multi-coloured canopy, and I am trying to see that this particular day is declared a holiday.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..161"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=161 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Holiday? Just for such a petty thing!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..162"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=162 type=paragraph --><p>He said defensively, &ldquo;These days &ndash; reason or no reason &ndash; holidays are very frequent. And when such a heart-rending accident has occurred in the house of someone who is no less than a deputy minister, how can there be no holiday? The day must be declared a holiday, must, must, must.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..163"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=163 type=paragraph --><p>I again asked, &ldquo;Who then has actually killed the rat?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..164"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=164 type=paragraph --><p>He promptly replied, &ldquo;Of course the corporation people. It is their fault that such a mishap took place.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..165"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=165 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Do you know, there is a word, &lsquo;hypocrisy&rsquo; in English. Look it up in the dictionary and see how it is rendered in Bengali.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..166"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=166 type=paragraph --><p>He apologized, &ldquo;I don&#146;t know much English.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..167"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=167 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;How are you doing the job of a minister then?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..168"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=168 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;Oh, for running a ministry you don&#146;t need to know English. I understand things because the secretaries explain it. Then I just put my signature on the place they point to with their forefinger.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..169"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=169 type=paragraph --><p>I wondered, &ldquo;So you can sign then!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..170"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=170 type=paragraph --><p>He admitted, &ldquo;Formerly I was not able to. Then somebody wrote my name. And then, by repeatedly tracing it with ink, I have attained quite some mastery in signing my name.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..171"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=171 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;Before this you used to manage with the fingerprint then?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..172"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=172 type=paragraph --><p>He confessed, &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..173"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=173 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;Do you remember which finger you used for the purpose?&rdquo; I asked.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..174"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=174 type=paragraph --><p>He boasted, &ldquo;There is no chance of making any mistake about that.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="8..175"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=175 type=paragraph --><p>I asked, &ldquo;Which finger, just tell me.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="9..1"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph --><i>Kit&#x301;i</i><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->We have been discussing <I>ka</I> for a long time &ndash; today also we will continue. Last Sunday we discussed <I>kikhi</I> &ndash; isn&#146;t it? Today let us first take up the word <I>kit&#x301;i</I>. The verbal root <I>kit&#x301;</I> + suffix <I>i = kit&#x301;i</I>. The <I></I>verbal root <I>kit&#x301;</I> means to move evoking fear, to frighten, or to walk in such a manner that others feel frightened. So etymologically the word <I>kit&#x301;i</I> means &ndash; one who provokes fear in others while walking on the path. <ol> <li>The sight of a prowling wild boar evokes a feeling of fear in a person. It is just possible that the wild boar in that case did not have any intention to attack or even to frighten the person concerned. It was just roaming about as per its own sweet will. In common usage, a wild boar is therefore called a <I>kit&#x301;i</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph --><li>Suppose a rhinoceros is simply enjoying itself by wallowing in mud and slime &ndash; in eating mud and chewing grass. Even then a person can feel frightened, and in fact people do get frightened.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><p>Both kinds of rhinoceros &ndash; one with one horn and the other with two horns &ndash; are called <I>kit&#x301;i</I>. You surely know that a rhino is one of those prehistoric animals, which, although on the verge of extinction, somehow still survives. It is believed that the prehistoric rhino was one and half sizes larger than the present ones. Although there is no definite proof, it can be said on the basis of certain strong inferences that the ancestors of the present rhinos had several horns on the upper part of the body. Those horns were also stronger than the horns of today&#146;s rhinos. The present day rhinos have very weak vision. It is not easy to know the quality of vision of ancient rhinos. Prehistoric rhinos have evolved into the one-horned rhino, two-horned rhino, wild boar, and common hog of our time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph --><p>There are [[four]] major differences between the rhino and a member of the hog family. <ol> <li>The skin of a rhino is harder, thicker and more invincible than that of any other animal. The skin of the hog family, on the other hand, is very thin. It is quite unimaginable that a ferocious animal like the wild boar could have such soft skin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph --><p>I have seen communities in the Ranchi region boiling a wild boar along with its skin. They told me, &ldquo;Sir, after boiling you can simply rub off the skin.&rdquo; It is due to this meagre hide that the hog does not serve any commercial purpose. In ancient times items like brushes were made from the hair of particular parts of the hog&#146;s body. With the invention of plastic in modern times, that need no longer exists.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><p>The invincible skin of a rhino was used as a shield in olden times. Now the use of a shield for fighting is on the wane. Rhinos have also become scarce.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph --><li>Another difference between a rhino and members of the hog family is that the latter avoid water and are dirty by nature. But a rhino loves water and is much cleaner than a hog. Apart from this, there are certain minor differences as well. A rhino has weak vision, while the vision of a hog is by and large quite good. A domesticated hog is a pusillanimous animal, while a wild boar is very brave and obstinate. A rhino is brave but not obstinate; it is rather jolly in temperament. So much so that even in its wild state, it is not a natural enemy of anyone.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph --><p>Domesticated hogs are generally vegetarian, but they have no objection to eating very hideous and dirty items. Wild boars are sometimes vegetarian, sometimes carnivorous, according to the situation. However, the wild boar is a very favourite food of tigers, and tigers frequent the Sunderbans where antelopes and wild boars abound. Even then, there remains some kind of long and distant familiarity between the tiger and the wild boar. An adult wild boar avoids the adult tiger. An adult wild boar kills the tiger cub and eats its flesh. And an adult tiger kills the wild boar that is yet to come of age and eats its flesh. The flesh of the wild boar is a very favourite food of the tiger.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph --><p>Once upon a time there was a dense population of wild boars in every part of Bengal. Names like Barabanii (<I>Bara&#x301;habanii</I>, that is, the forest inhabited by many boars), Barabhum (<I>Bara&#x301;habhu&#x301;m</I>: the capital was Bara&#x301;haba&#x301;za&#x301;r &ndash; Barabazar), bear evidence of this. The name of Baranagar near Kolkata, however, is of recent origin. It is said that the Portuguese used to export pork from that town. That is why the place was named Bara&#x301;hanagar [<I>Bara&#x301;ha</I> or <I>Bara&#x301;</I> means a &ldquo;boar&rdquo;].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph --><p>A rhino is vegetarian by nature. It is not the enemy of any particular animal. Daunted by its hard, thick and adamantine skin, no one dares to attack it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph --><p>At one time there were rhino populations in various parts of India. What to speak of the prehistoric age, even just one hundred and fifty years ago, herds of rhinos used to roam the Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region. Many rhinos lived at the foot of the Rajmahal hills, in the Birbhum district and along the southwest bank of the Padma and Bhagirathii rivers. The smaller sized rhinos thrived in the Sundarbans even one hundred and fifty years ago. The flesh of the rhino was a very favourite food, [a delicacy] for the Bengalis of that period. One feels quite astounded to learn or to think that human beings have killed the rhinos not only for their horns or skin but also for the flesh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph --><p>In India some rhinos still exist; they are found in the Duars region of North Bengal and upper Assam, the temperate plains of Bhutan and central Nepal. Everywhere they are counting the days until their final extinction. Human beings of ancient times believed that the medicine made from the rhino&#146;s horn could rejuvenate them. So the cruel practice of poaching rhinos prevailed in every age and continues to prevail even today. The situation has come to such a pass that the few one-horned or two-horned rhinos that still remain may disappear any time from the face of the earth. Although there is a slight increase in their population in the Kaziranga Sanctuary of Assam, one rarely comes across them in ordinary forests. The medicinal properties of the rhino horn are neither a verified truth nor has it any scientific basis. Is it not extremely abominable to exterminate an innocent creature due to some wrong notion?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph --><p>Let me mention in this connection that fossil records provide evidence that at one time rhinos thrived in coastal Orissa, Caromandal, at the foot of the Sivalic range [Himalaya], in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Hariyana. Quite large-sized rhinos inhabited Bankura of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h <I></I>region and Manbhum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph --><p>According to some, one branch of ancestors of the hog family, of the rhinos and boars, when attacked by more ferocious animals, escaped into the water, and these are now known as porpoises. Like the boars, the porpoises are also mammals. Since, strictly speaking, the porpoises were originally terrestrial animals, they cannot breathe properly under water. That is why even today they surface from time to time above the water and then again dive under.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph --><p>There are various reasons by which it can be proved and established that the porpoise is a descendant of certain prehistoric terrestrial animals. But it cannot be emphatically claimed that a porpoise is the descendant of a member of a hog family, because the members of the hog family are strongly allergic to water. The population growth rate of domesticated hogs is exceptionally high. In this regard, it exceeds any other terrestrial creature. In the insect family it is comparable only to a <I>kit&#x301;ibha</I> [locust].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="9..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><li>The population growth rate of wild boars is much lower than that of domesticated hogs. The population growth of rhinos is miserably low. On the one hand a minimal increase in population and on the other the slaughtering ceremony of the human beings &ndash; the combination of the two has brought rhinos to the brink of extinction.

Although they appeared to be like the wild boars of Bengal in every respect, I noticed a difference in complexion. The wild boars may not be declining in number as fast as the rhinos, but they are also fast heading towards extinction.

The mulberry silk is called <I>garad</I> in Bengali. Although many <I></I>types of <I>garad</I> exist, there are primarily two kinds; one is <I>ghiya&#x301;</I> (ghee-coloured) and the other is <I>dudhiya&#x301;</I> (shining white).

When the chrysalis of a <I>tasar</I> breaks out of its cocoon, the coarse thread produced is called <I>ket&#x301;e</I> instead of <I>tasar</I>.

<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="9.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.9.fn1">1</a></b>)  The name of the district is Rajsahi; the name of the district head quarters is Rampur. Rampur is part of Boyalia. That is why it used to be called Rampur-Boyalia. Nowadays many people refer to Rampur- Boyalia as Rajsahi.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="9.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.9.fn2">2</a></b>)   Similarly the name of the district is Maldaha &ndash; the name of the district headquarters is English Bazar. Many people wrongly refer to English Bazar as Maldaha town. There is already a separate town named Maldaha which is now called Old Malda by many.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="9.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.9.fn3">3</a></b>)   The name of the district is Murshidabad &ndash; the name of the district headquarters is Berhampur.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="9.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.9.fn4">4</a></b>)   The name of the district is Birbhum &ndash; the name of the district headquarters is Suri. Formerly Rajnagar was the district head quarters.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="9.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.9.fn5">5</a></b>)  The word <I>ja&#x301;du</I> is Persian; the word <I>gar</I> is also Persian. So <I>ja&#x301;dugar</I> is a Persian word. To distort into <I>ja&#x301;dukar</I> is meaningless. We can say that the word <I>ja&#x301;dukar</I> is incorrect.</p>

In Bengali most of the words with the prefix <I>ku</I> are with the short vowel; the use of long <I>u&#x301;</I> is very rare. In semantic terms the <I></I>word <I>ku</I> has a very wide range of meanings; in contrast, the arena of meaning of the verbal root <I>ku&#x301;</I> is very limited. <ol> <li>One meaning of <I>ku</I> is grimacing, which the monkeys and vixens do, for example.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph --><li>The verbal root <I>ku</I> can also be used to express a feeling without saying a word. For example, suppose someone brings a glass of sherbet in winter. Instead of telling him &ldquo;No, don&#146;t give me the sherbet&rdquo;, you simply say, <I>un&#x32D;-un&#x32D;-un&#x32D;-un&#x32D;</I>. This nonverbal sound will clearly indicate that you do not want the sherbet. Thus, the verbal root <I>ku</I> can be used for the articulation of such sounds.<!-- /block --></p>

But more in use is the form <I>kavate</I> [[(the verbal root <I>ku + lat&#x301;</i> [present tense] <i>te</I>.)]]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph --><li>The verbal root <I>ku</I> is also used, more or less, in the sense of moving or making something move in the quinquelemental [physical] or mental level through a systaltic path, and also in the sense of diminution or belittling. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph --><li>In common usage, it means different modes of physical action.

<a name="10..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph --><p>So <I>la</I> (here in the sense of the holder) will continue to occupy the position of the intial <I>la</I>.

That is, it will be <I>kula</I> and not <I>kula</I> [<I>Kulra</I> with end-<I>la</I>]<I></I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph --><p>The same initial <I>la</I> will also be used in the spelling of our familiar fruit, <I>kula</I> (<I>bar&#x301;ai &ndash;</I> the jujube). The end-<I>la</I> can only be used in those Bengali words that retain the form of Sanskrit words or Sanskrit derived words but not in the case of indigenous words or foreign words. The word <I>kula</I> that we use for a special kind of fruit [jujube] is an indigenous Bengali word. So in its spelling, the initial <I>la</I> is used. But the word <I>bar&#x301;ai</I> is not indigenous. It is derived from Sanskrit, <I>badarii</I> (<I>badarii&gt;baarii&gt;baiira</I>)<I>. Baiira/ bera/ bor&#x301;ai /bor /bogr&#x301;ii &ndash;</I> all derived from one single source &ndash; <I>badarii</I>. So you understand that the spelling of the word <I>kula</I> is the same, whether it means genealogy or jujube. And you also realize that the word <I>kula</I>, which means genealogy, is derived from the word <I>ku.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph --><p>Kula</I> or jujube [<I>Zizyphus mauritiana</I>] grows equally well both in the equatorial zone and the tropics. In fact, it grows everywhere except in extremely cold places. So much so that the jujube tree grows even in the snow-covered regions of the Himalayas and bears fruit after the disappearance of snow. There are different kinds of jujube in different countries. The largest jujubes are available in places where the climate is warm, rainfall is little, and the soil is mixed with sand. That is why in India the large-sized jujubes of high quality are available in Gujarat, Rajasthan, and in the vicinity of Agra in Uttar Pradesh. The jujubes of Allahabad and Kashii are not bad. In Bengal there is good rainfall. So in Bengal, although there is a good jujube crop, its size or quality is not of high standard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph --><p>The same condition is also applicable in the case of prickly trees. The place that is congenial for the good growth of jujubes is also congenial for the good growth of date palms. And like the jujube, in Bengal there is substantial date palm production but not of high quality. Even if high quality seeds of date palm are sown in Bengal, the tree growth will be good, the juice will also be very sweet, but the quality will not be good. The date palms grown in Bengal are all seed and skin, and practically without any kernel. So you understand that, like the jujube tree, the date palm tree is also a prickly plant. That is why there is similarity in the nature and behaviour of the jujube<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and the date palm.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph --><p>Generally trees with thorns send their roots deep into the subterranean soil, and from deep down they draw their sustenance. That is why most plants that grow in the desert are thorny. The screw pine trees <I>(Pandanus)</I> are also thorny. So their growth in the desert area is not that bad. Even in countries with heavy rainfall, they prefer sandy riparian soil. Even in the desert region of Gujarat I have observed the luscious growth of cacti. There are different varieties of jujube &ndash; some are very sweet and some very sour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph --><p>The spring season is the natural time for the ripening of the jujube. As in Southeast Asia, no other fruit is easily available at that time, the jujubes enjoy a seasonal demand during this period. Probably that demand is also likely to continue. Jujube helps in digestion (dried jujube is more effective than a fresh one). Pickle made from jujube causes the secretion of saliva and therefore acts as an appetizer. Jujubes in small quantity are good for the pancreas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph --><p>Jujube leaves are medicine for severe kinds of pox and measles (when a patient suffers from smallpox, the suppressed pox under the skin causes severe pain on the body, and the patient dies in excruciating agony). The wood of the jujube tree is very good for sports equipment. Jujube wood is also used in making fire works. In different countries jujube grows in different seasons (some in summer and others in autumn). Moreover, there are twenty seven different subspecies of jujube with radically different characteristics and shapes. In eastern India we are generally familiar with three main varieties of jujube: 1) large, longish and tasty jujube of Kashii or the coconut-jujubes; 2) round; very sour when green and sweet-sour when ripe &#133; <I>t&#x301;opa&#x301;kul</I>; and 3) wild jujube or <I>shiya&#x301;kul</I> [<I>Zigyplus oenoplia</I>, the berry grown on a wild thorny plant] carelessly grown in the wilderness. As a jackal is very fond of <I>jambu</I> [rose apple], so the word <I>jambu</I> or <I>jambuka</I> refers to both a jackal and a <I>jambu</I>. Similarly, since jujube is a favourite fruit of jackals, it is also called by another name of jackal, that is, <I>ba&#x301;dara</I> (<I>not ba&#x301;n&#x32D;dara or bandara</I>). A type of non-mulberry insect is reared in the jujube tree. That is why such a plant has specific commercial value. I have personally seen lac insects reared in the jujube trees in Manbhum or Murshidabad district of Bengal. I have seen this in Thailand also.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph --><p>The <I>kula</I> in the compound word <I>kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii</I> (coiled serpentine) comes from the word <I>ku</I>. According to <I>Ka&#x301;lacakraya&#x301;natantra</I>, the last bone at the bottom of the spine carries the weight of the entire upper portion of the spine. This bottom piece of bone is therefore called <I>kula</I>, that is, the <I>la</I> that holds <I>ku</I> or the solid factor. According to Tantra, the sleeping divinity is lying in this <I>kula</I> in the shape of a coiled serpentine. This seed that holds the solid factor is called <I>la</I>; in other words, <I>la</I> is the acoustic root of the solid factor. This coiled serpentine moves upward through <I>mantrabodha</I>, <I>mantra&#x301;gha&#x301;ta</I>, <I>mantracaetanya</I> [ideation of mantra, <I>ma&#x301;ntrika</I> striking or stirring of the <I>kun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii</I>, <I>ma&#x301;ntrika</I> consciousness], with the help of the acoustic sound <I>hum&#x301;</I>, and unite with <I>Parama Shiva</I> seated on the thousand petalled lotus in <I>Sahasra&#x301;ra cakra</I>. This is the highest form of meditation. This elevation of the coiled serpentine is called <I>kulasa&#x301;dhana&#x301;</I>. One who performs this spiritual practice becomes famous as <I>kulasa&#x301;dhaka</I> or <I>kaola</I> (<I>kula + an&#x301;)</I>. This process or path of Tantra sadhana is known as <I>kula&#x301;ca&#x301;ra</I>. Lord Shiva, the founder of this Tantra, is therefore called <I>maha&#x301;kaola</I> or <I>a&#x301;di kaola</I> [the pioneer <I>kaola</I>]. And the guru who teaches this sadhana is known as <I>kulaguru</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph --><p>Nowadays many people understand the term <I>kulaguru</I> to mean &ldquo;family preceptor&rdquo;. No, <I>kuluguru</I> is one who is well experienced in <I>kulasa&#x301;dhana&#x301;</I> &ndash; who is <I>siddha</I>, that is, an expert in this discipline, and who is competent to teach the process of this <I>kulasa&#x301;dhana&#x301;</I>. <I>Svastyayan</I> or benedictory ceremony is a part of <I>sha&#x301;ntikarma</I> of Vidya&#x301; Tantra. The part of this benedictory ceremony that is known as <I>purascaran&#x301;a</I> is also the process of raising the coiled serpentine. According to Tantra, <I>purascaran&#x301;a</I> is a necessary part of this [process]. There is no difference in the rituals of Shaeva, Sha&#x301;kta, Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava, Saora, and Ga&#x301;n&#x301;apatya <I></I>Tantras. What is <I>kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii</I> in Shaeva Tantra, whose goal is <I>Parama Shiva</I>, is called Maha&#x301;ka&#x301;lii in Sha&#x301;kta Tantra, and its final aim is termed as <I>Maha&#x301;ka&#x301;la</I> or <I>Maha&#x301;kaola</I> or <I>Naira&#x301;tmashakti</I>. And in Vaes&#x301;n&#x301;ava philosophy, the two are termed as Ra&#x301;dha&#x301; and Purus&#x301;ottama Krs&#x301;n&#x301;a. However, in whatever way the raising of coiled serpentine or <I>purascaran&#x301;a</I> is done, <I>kulashakti</I> will always remain at the bottom in the solid factor (holder of <I>kula</I> whose acoustic root is <I>lam&#x301;</I> and which is the base of physical existence). This is the base or <I>a&#x301;dha&#x301;rshila&#x301;&ndash;</I>that is why it is also called <I>mula&#x301;dha&#x301;ra</I>. Its goal is also that Supreme Consciousness.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph --><p>This raising of the <I>kulakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii</I> is the struggle of consciousness against crudity.

The acoustic root of struggle is <I>hum&#x301;</I> (we say <I>ran&#x301;ahum&#x301;ka&#x301;r</I>, i.e., war cry).

The word <I>pa&#x301;pa</I> is used both in the general sense and the specific sense. In the general sense, <I>pa&#x301;pa</I> means <I>pa&#x301;taka</I>. <I>Pa&#x301;taka</I> means offence against Dharma. <I></I>This <I>pa&#x301;taka</I> has two branches &ndash; one branch is known as <I>pa&#x301;pa</I>. To do what one should not do is <I>pa&#x301;pa</I>, and not to do what one should do is called <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I>. Both <I>pa&#x301;pa</I> and <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I> are undesirable.

<a name="10..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph --><p><I>Atipa&#x301;taka</I> means that kind of sin, the expiation of which calls for severe austerities and physical suffering. If, for example, your mistake causes someone a great loss or ruins his future then that will also be a great sin. Normally there is no expiation for such a sin. But, if you devote yourself completely in your life-long efforts to help them by making amends, and the person forgives you from the core of their heart, then one may consider that expiation has been effected. But it does not really happen, because, can a person to whom you have caused permanent damage really forgive you from the core of their heart? In history we come across many such acts of great sin. The manner in which Ajatashatru killed his father, Bimbisara, was an act of great sin. Shashanka killed Rajyavardhana, who was his invited guest. That was also an act of great sin. The way in which Harsavardhana killed Jayashankarii, wife of Shashanka, and their minor son was also an act of great sin.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph --><p>The worst kind of sin is called <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I>. The fundamental difference between <I>atipa&#x301;taka</I> and <I>maha&#x301;pa&#x301;taka</I> is that the sight of an act of great sin like <I>atipa&#x301;taka</I> does not tempt others to commit such sins. It is also possible that the people will not remember the event. However, the worst sins are those that leave a permanent scar on society and human history with recurring consequences ... <I></I>Had Ravana simply abducted Sita, that would have been a great sin. But, masquerading as an ascetic, Ravana first gained the confidence of Sita and then treacherously abducted her. Ravana came in the guise of an ascetic and then became a thief. This has a recurring consequence. Even today, on seeing an ascetic, a housewife may be afraid that, who knows, like Ravana, that man may be actually thief in the guise of an ascetic!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph --><p>The other branch of <I>pa&#x301;taka</I> is <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I>, which means not to do what should be done: for example, properly educating the child; taking measures so that they can be independent and self-sufficient. One should give a daughter in marriage when she comes of age (but if an educated or self-sufficient daughter does not agree to marry, that is a different matter). One should gratefully remember the good one has received from any benefactor. One should follow the path of Dharma. If one refuses to abide by these &ldquo;shoulds&rdquo; &ndash; if one indulges in the opposite of these in action, thought or words &ndash; then one has committed <I>pratyava&#x301;ya</I>. It does not matter whether it is <I>pa&#x301;pa</I> or <I>pratyva&#x301;ya</I>, the fact is that whenever something assumes a condemnable dimension, one uses the word <I>ku</I> for it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph --><li>Any violation of the accepted code of conduct is generally called a crime. A community or a state stands on certain codes. When these codes are related to the administration of the state, then it is called a constitution. When it is related to governance or justice, then it is called law. An unconstitutional or anti-constitutional act is regarded as a crime in every state. That is why an act of violation of the constitution or law is called a crime. But apart from certain cardinal human principles, there are always different views regarding various matters in different communities. This is the reason why in different communities or states there are differences in the structure of the constitution, the legislative, administrative and judicial systems. So, one has to conform to the constitutional, social, legal and administrative systems of the country in which one lives at a particular point in time; otherwise one is liable for punitive action.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph --><p>If we continue to expand the few fundamental human principles that we have, and accordingly revise the constitutional, administrative and legal systems of different countries, then it will lead to better prospects for human unity. Then humanism and Neo-humanism will receive an impetus to accelerate the speed of their progress, which is a major requirement of its journey [towards unity]. If we gradually increase the fundamental unity of human beings and simultaneously reduce the apparent points of difference, the universal humanity will certainly become one and indivisible some day. This is not a visionary dream &ndash; it will be the first indication of human wisdom in reality. In any case, the word <I>ku</I> can be used for whatever is considered a crime or culpability in any particular place.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph --><li>There are activities that provoke, as a reaction, a filthy sensation in the body or mind of a person. This induces in them a desire to stay away from such activities, and creates in them a mentality of over-reaction against such activities. This reactionary mentality is called <I>ghrn&#x301;a&#x301;</I> or hatred. Hatred is an imposed psychic bondage. So it is a kind of <I>pa&#x301;sha</I> [eight types of external fetters]. What originates in the mind and expands to the external world is called <I>ripu</I> [six inherent bondages]. That which originates outside and influences the mind is called <I>pa&#x301;sha</I>, as told earlier. An intelligent person keeps his or her <I>ripu</I> in control and fights the <I>pa&#x301;shas</I>.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph --><p>The sages and ascetics do not recommend any mechanism for opposing the <I>ripu</I>s<I></I>, because if a particular <I>ripu</I> is repressed, it tries to find an outlet through another <I>ripu</I>. The same is true about the remaining of <I>ripus</I> (lust, anger, greed, attachment, pride and jealousy). If the propensity of greed is strong in a person and they are compelled to control it under the pressure of poverty &ndash; for example, if a person who used to take bribes is compelled to refrain from taking bribes due to pressure from law enforcement authorities&ndash;their greed will find expression through anger or some other <I>ripu;</I> that is, they will burst into a rage.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph --><p>So the recommended psychological stance is that <I></I>a <I>ripu</I> must be kept under control, and under no circumstances should it be allowed to run counter to the society or to societal norms. Suppose someone has a strong weakness for eating. Overeating or eating prohibited food can naturally lead to sickness or premature death. So that person restrains their greed in such a manner that their greed is satisfied and at the same time potential disease is prevented. Suppose someone addicted to drink has become a slave of liquor under its strong influence. If they can sublimate their alcohol addiction into a passion for music or painting or any other finer art, then their passion will be satisfied without any injury to themselves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph --><p>Regarding the <I>pashas</I>, the wise people of ancient times expressed their strong conviction that the <I>pa&#x301;shas</I> [imposed bondages of the mind &ndash; fear shame, doubt etc.] must be opposed. To fight fear, for example, one must move quickly towards the very source of that fear, equipped with necessary physical and psychological weapons. If you remain confined in your cloister, fearfully barring the door, the fear will make its way into your mind and there take root. Then the bondage of fear can never be thrown off. So always remember that <I>ripus</I> [inborn enemies &ndash; lust, angers, greed attachment, vanity and jealousy] must be controlled and <I>pa&#x301;shas</I> [bondages] must be opposed. The endeavour to be liberated from the <I>pa&#x301;shas</I> is a step forward in human expansiveness &ndash; an ascent towards human glory and excellence. <I>Pa&#x301;shobaddho bhavejjibo pa&#x301;shamukto bhavecchivah</I> [Bound by <I>pa&#x301;sha</I> is the <I>jiiva</I>, liberated from bondage is Shiva].<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph --><p>According to some zoologists, a dog is not an original species [<I>sui generis</I>]; it is a hybrid creature. As the Royal Bengal Tiger of the Sunderbans and the domestic cat are respectively the biggest and the smallest members of the cat family, similarly the African lion and the vixen (meteor-faced, <I>kikhi</I>), according to some, are respectively the biggest and the smallest members of the dog family.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph --><p>According to some scholars, a dog is a hybrid of the wolf and the vixen. In ancient times wild dogs were rather scarce, precisely for the same reason. There is hardly any dog fossil amongst the available fossils of ancient animals. Nowadays, however, wild dogs are also prevalent. These wild dogs live gregariously in jungles, and even a gigantic tiger has been seen to be flabbergasted and killed by a concerted attack of these dogs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph --><p>Although a dog is a hybrid of the wolf and the vixen, it must be said that there are many radical, extreme differences between a wolf and a dog. A wolf is voracious, but a dog feels satisfied with a small meal. It is difficult to tame a wolf, but a dog loves to be domesticated. A dog is extremely faithful and loyal to its master. A wolf is neither faithful nor loyal to its master. A dog is not ferocious by nature. It attacks or frightens someone as part of its duty. A wolf is ferocious by nature. It has no sense of duty. A dog would not normally kill a creature if its stomach were full. But a wolf, even when its belly is full, kills a creature. If it has no capacity to eat it, it carries the carcass to its den and eats it according to its convenience. Dogs do not generally fight with other members of the dog family. They fight with members of the feline family. But a wolf does not observe any such principle. A wolf avoids the strong and unnecessarily attacks the weak. Although there is a family resemblance between the wolf and the dog, whenever a dog is sighted the wolf attacks and kills it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph --><p>There are many differences between a jackal and a dog. A dog generally moves about during the daytime. But jackals are night prowlers by nature. A jackal moves in the daytime only when it is in danger, it has to change locations or is excessively hungry. A jackal lives in a hole, but a dog never likes to live in a hole. It prefers to live in the open. A jackal cannot be tamed; but a dog can. By virtue of being night prowlers, the jackals periodically howl in chorus to preserve their solidarity and register their presence. However, dogs do not have this habit. They bark collectively only when they have to fight an enemy as a body. Although both jackals and dogs belong to the canine family, a dog chases a jackal whenever it sees one. A jackal runs away at the sight of a dog. By nature a dog is brave and a jackal is cowardly.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph --><p>Although a fox belongs to the dog family, its relation with the dog is very remote.

<a name="10..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph --><p>The dog has been a companion of human beings since ancient times. History tells us that dogs have been of use and continue to be of use to people in different ways in their prosperity as well as in their adversity. In the scriptures, a dog has sometimes been shown respect by presenting it as a symbol of <I>dharma</I>. Of course, there is no dearth of people who are opposed to dogs. In northern India some people say: &ldquo;Only one who is a dog himself maintains a dog.&rdquo; In Hindi and Urdu <I>kukura</I> [a dog] is called <I>kutta&#x301;. </ol><!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph --><p>While talking about <I>kukkut&#x301;ii</I>, I am reminded of an incident. I have preserved the memory of that incident under the heading &ldquo;Kamal Means Guernsey&rdquo;. It happened a long time ago. Since then much water has flown down the Ganges into the Bay of Bengal. I have completely forgotten the exact date and time. But I vaguely remember that it was a Paus&#x301; [winter time] evening, and I had gone to attend a function held by an aristocratic family. It was the day when the newlywed bride was to ritualistically have lunch at her in-law&#146;s place for the first time. The marriage was held in the month of Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a <I></I>[eighth month of the Bengali calendar] but the bride&#146;s rice-eating ceremony was held in the month of Paus&#x301;. Do you know why? At the time, when the marriage was held in the month of Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a, it was near the end of an English month. The Kolkata babus&#146; pockets were absolutely empty; no money in the purse, no money in the bank! So the master of the house, that is, the father of the bridegroom thought, if invited at that time, the guests would not come in shame, due to not having money to buy suitable presents or any present at all for that matter. Moreover, the guests who would come would bring cheap gifts. So, keeping the salary aspect in mind, the master of the house invited his guests in the month of Paus&#x301;. I reached the wedding house in the Paus&#x301; evening. I also had to buy a present by borrowing money from different sources. The invitation card carried the inscription: &ldquo;Food will be served strictly in accordance with Government Guest Control Regulations.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph --><p>I thought that even though people write like this, in practice they would serve <I>ra&#x301;dha&#x301;ballabhii<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --></I> instead of <I>luci<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> </I> to one&#146;s bellyful, because a <I>ra&#x301;dha&#x301;ballabhi</I> does not come under the purview of the relevant regulations!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph --><p>Anyway, what could I do? I was just sitting idle and biding my time ... There was no leaf of any tree in sight so that I could count the leaves. So I was just listening with rapt attention to the colourful talk going on around me. The ladies had come to show off their saris and ornaments. Their discussions were confined mainly to saris and ornaments. The gentlemen were discussing diverse topics. We were all seated, however, the handsome young man who was shining amidst us like the full moon kept on standing. Many people asked him to sit down, but he said, &ldquo;Don&#146;t worry, I&#146;m fine.&rdquo; He kept on standing, possibly because in the standing position the glamour of his suit would be more prominent. If he sat down he would not be able to highlight the glamour of his dress. Many people were admiringly staring either at his coat or his trousers, and some had their eyes glued unashamedly to his clothes. One callow youth could not resist his indecent curiosity, and asked, &ldquo;Sir, from where did you buy such a beautiful coat?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph --><p>The handsome young man said, &ldquo;So you have noticed it! Then listen. It is about twelve years now.

In that locality the price of everything was twice the normal price, sometimes two and a half times, sometimes even more. It seemed as if the locality was telling everybody, &#x301;Come, squander your money here.&#146; The shopkeepers of that place were always in the pink, because the customers there won&#146;t ever haggle. They would pay whatever they were asked. Many would not ask for the receipt and others would refuse to take it, even if given. The question of returning the change just did not arise. I also lived in this high style. Many Lords were confounded by my behaviour, which also turned the heads of many Barons. Once I went to a shop and asked for the best trousers that they had. They showed me one; it was really good. I asked, &lsquo;What&#146;s the price?&rsquo;&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;They said, &#x301;Twenty thousand rupees, sir&#146;. (Twenty thousand rupees at that time would mean eight hundred fifty thousand now.)&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="10..100"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph --><p>The young stripling stared confusedly. He was dumbfounded; only his lips were shaking slightly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph --><p>The handsome young man resumed, &ldquo;Then I told them to show me a good cut of coat. They showed me one. I asked, &#x301;What&#146;s the price?&#146; They said, &#x301;Thirty thousand&#146;. Of course they quoted the price in US dollars.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;I wondered, Thirty thousand!&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph --><p>&ldquo;They had already become familiar with my generous temperament. At the time of my buying the trousers, they got an idea of how open-handed a spendthrift I was.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

I&#146;ll pay you two thousand in gratitude, and I&#146;ll make out a cheque for thirty-two thousand and buy it right now.&#146; I gave just as I said. This is that coat.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..106"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=106 type=paragraph --><p>The greedy, hobbledehoy young man kept on gazing in wonder. After some time, when his eyes became dazed by the glamour of the coat, he closed them. I was also marveling while listening to their conversation and looked at his suit feeling like a veritable peasant. There is no harm in telling the truth. I was wondering who this handsome young man could be. Once I thought he was possibly the son of some nawab. Then it dawned on me that the age of nawabs has long since passed. Their sun has set forever. Then who is this person? Who is he? My mind said, &ldquo;Haven&#146;t you recognized him yet? He must be some deputy minister.&rdquo; I said to my mind, &ldquo;Oh mind, you are right. The day that automobiles replaced elephants and horses was the day that deputy ministers replaced nawabs and emperors. Just a revised and enlarged edition of the same thing.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..107"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=107 type=paragraph --><p>It was now time for dinner. We all took our seats as usual. The additional minister also had no choice but to sit. Taking a great risk of spoiling the ironing of the trousers, he sat very carefully. As some people drink water from a small pitcher without any direct physical contact, similarly the deputy minister sat in a delicate manner.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.10.fn7"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#10.fn7">7</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> No, the master of the house strictly followed the printed inscription on the invitation card. The dinner plate was very light. Possibly that is the reason why it is called light refreshment in English (light refreshment &ndash; to restore the mood in a light manner). As I looked around, I felt that the amount of interest that could be accrued on the price of the gifts was enough to recover the cost of the light refreshment. The value of the gifts would be an additional gain. Thank God, while leaving my house I had told my cook to prepare for me boiled rice and a broth of wax gourd. I now realized I had done the right thing. I must eat on my return; otherwise the whole night I will feel the sharp pangs of hunger. What I ate settled silently in a solitary corner of my stomach. No belching, no feeling of surfeit. While returning, the additional minister came to my mind several times. However, after coming back home I had my rice and wax gourd broth and went to sleep happily.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..108"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=108 type=paragraph --><p>These warm trousers I have been using for the last twelve years. Just below the right hand pocket, it has become torn. I thought of giving it to the laundry today itself and asking the owner of the cleaning shop if they could get it darned by an expert. I have noticed for the last few days that a new dyeing-cleaning shop has opened near my house. Its name is <I>shuciishubhra dhaotanilaya</I> [the house of cleaning pure white]. I thought, let me go there. My clothes will be safe in the local laundry. I reached the shop. The owner was quite a gentleman &ndash; simple, and amiable in conversation. On enquiry I learnt that the name of the gentleman was Sri Elebele Albam. <I></I>I shared our joys and sorrows with Mr Album for some time. Like me, he was also from a middle-class family. He was talking about the business of dyeing and cleaning. He said one could get fabulously rich in Europe if one ran this business properly, because although the wage of the washerman is high there, the ingredients for washing are cheap and of high quality. Things are not like that here. Washing is not good, and on top of it clothes are often spoilt. The gentleman was saying that here most of the laundry owners serve their customers after getting the washing done by washermen for a lump sum payment. Most dyeing-cleaning shops cannot afford to get the clothes washed with their own labour. After making payment to the washermen, very little [profit] margin is left in their hands. He was saying that in those European countries, the dyeing cleaners also make a substantial earning by lending high quality clothes. In this country the scope for this is also very limited.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..109"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=109 type=paragraph --><p>I said, &ldquo;Your words are absolutely true, literally.&rdquo; The gentleman said, &ldquo;In this country people send clothes to the laundry under two circumstances. First, those who must have their clothes washed quickly within a specified period of time. Second, those who cannot trust unknown washermen with their clothes. They consider the laundry much safer. So they give their clothes to the laundry.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..110"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=110 type=paragraph --><p>The gentleman was saying that everything has a good side and a bad side. In other countries there are washing machines for washing the clothes. In India there is practically no use of this. So most people in other countries wash clothes themselves instead of sending them to the laundry. This puts the laundry owners at a disadvantage. But in India one has to wash clothes by hand. So busy people don&#146;t find sufficient time or leisure to wash their clothes. Consequently they have to depend on the laundry. Moreover for ultra modern scientific cleaning, people of India as well as other countries have to come to the laundry. But as I said, all things considered, it is not a profitable business.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..111"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=111 type=paragraph --><p>Our talk was rolling along smoothly. Then suddenly I saw the deputy minister from the previous evening arriving at the laundry all by himself. Possibly he had parked his car at a distance. In his hands were the costly coat and trousers we had seen the previous day. He handed in the coat and the trousers to Mr. Album and gave him a fresh currency note of ten rupees. I glanced for a moment at the deputy minister, but could not find any glamour in his figure. Possibly because he was not in those trousers and coat, his glamour had diminished to some extent. I could not see yesterday&#146;s lustre in his face or flicker in his eyes. I imagine he had perhaps overeaten yesterday, and as a result of indigestion had fifty bilious belches. That might have made him a bit weak and lack-lustre. But how could he eat so much? He could eat that much only if he were served a lot. Anyway, after the deputy minister left I asked Mr. Album, &ldquo; Did you take an advance for washing his clothes?&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="10..112"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=112 type=paragraph --><p>He said, &ldquo;By no means. I take payment towards washing charges only after I hand over the washed clothes.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

In ancient times, when the earth was a ball of fire or when the surface was either fluid or very soft, part of the earth was ejected and thrown at a distance; then, instead of revolving around the earth as a satellite, it started revolving around the sun. Since this planet was born from the earth it was named <I>kujagraha</I>. At present this planet <I>kuja</I> is known as Mars. Mars has two satellites of its own &ndash; Deimos (demon) and Phobos (fear). According to many, another celestial body was born out of the mass ejected from the earth. The remaining depression left [in the earth&#146;s surface] resulted in the present Pacific Ocean. This celestial body, however, has been moving around the earth and is known at present as the moon. So the Sanskrit word for the Pacific Ocean is <I>ks&#x301;iirasamudra</I> or <I>ks&#x301;iira&#x301;rn&#x301;ava</I> [ocean of thickened milk]<I></I>.

This system of the Government taking charge was called the Court of Wards. For this the Government used to appoint one or more magistrates as the director of the Court of Wards. They used to run the estate until the minor son of the zamindar came of age or the incapable zamindar was considered fit to get back the estate. This Court of Wards used to pay a monthly allowance to the zamindar or his minor heir.</p>
