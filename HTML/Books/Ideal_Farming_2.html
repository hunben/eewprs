<a name="2..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Self-reliance is the main objective of our farming projects, hence they should be oriented towards production. They should not be dependent on outside resources. An integrated approach to farming should include such areas as agriculture, horticulture, floriculture, sericulture, lac culture, apiculture, dairy farming, animal husbandry, irrigation, pisciculture, pest control, the proper use of fertilizers, cottage industries, energy production, research centres and water conservation. This approach will help make farming projects self-reliant, and should be adopted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..2"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Agriculture<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Agriculture is the science of cultivating the soil and rearing animals. It includes the production of staple crops. Staple crops which are important in Bengal include pulses of many kinds, cereals, coarse grains, oil-seeds, sugar crops and vegetables.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Pulses provide protein and supplement manure as they fix nitrogen in the soil from the air, but calcium, phosphates, potash and so on still have to be added to pulse crops.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Cereals are rich in carbohydrates and include rice, wheat, maize, oats, barley and rye. Coarse grains include all types of millet, sorghum, barley, rye and buckwheat. Oil-seeds include mustard, soya, sesame, linseed, safflower and sunflower. It is most important to exchange seeds between India and the rest of the world. Sugar crops include sugar cane, sugar beet, date palm and palmyra. Spices include cloves, cumin, coriander, etc. Many types of medicinal plants can be grown in Bengal. At A&#x301;nanda Nagar many herbaria should be established.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->In India many seasonal vegetables such as summer vegetables, winter vegetables and all-season vegetables are grown. The variety of vegetables that are produced should be increased. Onions and garlic are grown for sale to the public and for processing into medicines, but of course they are not beneficial for those doing spiritual practices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Some other items include coffee, cocoa, tea and rubber. Tea gardens and rubber plantations can be grown for use by the local people and as cash crops. Cash crops will help to transform the local economy. If cash crops are grown by cooperatives, they can help raise the economic standard of poor local people in a short time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->In the case of yellow mustard, big lentils and wheat, there is a choice of early, medium and late varieties, but in the case of paddy there is no such choice. If the early, medium and late varieties of any crop are available for plantation, and sufficient time is at hand to choose any of them, then the early variety should be chosen first for plantation. Proper planning should be done so that the production of this crop is increased. In case the early variety fails, then the medium variety should be tried. If everything is done properly, the production of this variety will be almost equal to the early variety. If the medium variety also fails for some reason, then lastly the late variety should be tried. If the late variety is planted in the beginning of the season and fails for some reason, then there is no scope for cultivation and the season will be lost. Liquid manure should be applied along with the second irrigation after proper weeding.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Paddy is the staple food in northeastern India. In the boro variety of paddy, weeding should be done one month after transplantation, and then liquid manure should be applied. Care should be taken that the liquid manure is not poisonous, otherwise it will harm the pisciculture. Even rocky land can be made fit for cultivation after filling it up with good soil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->We should try our best to grow napier grass for cattle fodder on hillocks wherever possible. It is more difficult to grow napier grass on hills than on flat land because it takes a lot of water. Nevertheless we should try, in order to save the best crop land for other crops. Where there are railway lines which belong to the railway department going through agricultural land, cow pea, late a&#x301;us paddy or black gram should be cultivated on both sides of the railway lines.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Whenever plants from frigid and temperate zones are transplanted into a warm or hot climate, they should be planted on high land, near stones and rocks if possible, so that at night they will be kept cool.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The fencing of all farm compounds except beauty spots may be utilized as a platform for spinach in spring and summer, and for beans in summer, the rainy season, autumn and winter. In the case of beauty spots, the fencing may be utilized as a platform for flower creepers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Farming projects should also cultivate some selected items for special emergency survival. These include vegetables, pulses, potato and fodder for dairy cows to ensure milk production. All farming projects must start the production of these items immediately. They are the minimum items necessary for physical survival. These items will ensure your survival in any difficult times that may come in the future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Horticulture<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Fruit and vegetable gardens should be established on all farming projects. There are many varieties of fruit. Fruits can be utilized to make jams, marmalade, jellies, dried fruits, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Floriculture<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Floriculture is the cultivation of flowers. Jasmine, magnolia, roses and so on can be used to make essences which in turn can be used to produce many other products. Tube roses can be grown and sold throughout the world just as roses are today. Roses grow very well in red soil. Floral nectar can be collected from lotus and is very good for all kinds of eye diseases, including retinal detachment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Honey can be prepared from the flowers of the lotus, lily, cornel and cotton tree. A huge amount of honey is available in the flowers of the lotus, lily and cotton tree. The lotus and lily also give floral nectar &ndash; nectar which is prepared by the flowers, not by the bees. This is a part of floriculture. Floral nectar should be produced from floriculture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->How can floral nectar be collected? It has to be collected with the help of a dropper or syringe. When I was young I used to eat the seeds of the lotus. In those days they were generally available throughout Burdwan. I also used to take floral nectar by licking the flower. From the honey and floral nectar of lotus and lily, many types of medicines can be made. If this honey and floral nectar is sold in the market, it will command a very high price. To extract floral nectar one has to employ the same method as doctors use to extract blood. This is because many ants and insects feed on floral nectar. A syringe can extract it without getting clogged up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The stems of okra can be used for a special purpose. Suppose you have a pineapple field which is not producing both fruits and flowers. If the stems are burnt and scattered throughout the field, the fumes and smoke will help the pineapple to develop fruit and flowers at the same time. But one should be careful that the pineapple plant is not burnt. This process will produce both fruit and flowers very quickly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The field of floriculture has been neglected very much. It should be developed. We can easily make rose scent and rose water from the rose garden at A&#x301;nanda Nagar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..22"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Useful Products From Insects<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->In Bengal production based on insects has three main branches &ndash; sericulture, lac culture and apiculture.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->The first is sericulture. There are two main varieties of silk in Bengal &ndash; mulberry and non-mulberry. Mulberry silkworms feed on mulberry leaves, and can produce two qualities of silk &ndash; fine quality (garad) and rough quality (matka). Non-mulberry silk includes muun&#x32D;ga&#x301;, tasar and endy. In the muun&#x32D;ga&#x301; variety the silkworms feed on drumsticks. In the tasar variety the worms feed on many plants such as sal [Shorea robusta Gaertn. f.], arjuna [Terminalia arjuna Bedd.], Indian plum [Zizyphus jujube Linn.], asan [Terminalia tomentosa Bedd.], Assamese swalu [Kadsura hetroclita], a bush which is mostly confined to Assam, and Indian rosewood (svet sal) [Dalbergia latifolia Roxb.]. In the endy variety the silkworms feed on castor leaves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->The mulberry silkworm is a domesticated variety of silkworm. Tasar is a naturally grown variety of silkworm. In this variety the cocoons are put on trees in order for the larvae to feed. Once the larvae have hatched the cocoons are collected from the trees. In tasar production the trees are kept to the manageable height of six feet, otherwise it would be impractical to collect the cocoons.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->In domesticated silk production moths lay eggs, and then larvae hatch from the eggs, eat leaves, grow to their full size and finally spin a cocoon made of silk. The cocoons are usually dried in the sun or boiled to kill the larvae. As the larvae are in a state of natural hibernation, when they are killed in this way they do not feel pain. The silk cocoons are collected and spun into silk thread. Silk production is a profitable industry, and silk is an excellent clothing fibre. Some silk plants such as mulberry and Indian plum also produce fruit. Different crops can be grown around silk plants so that there is maximum utilization of agricultural land.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Non-grafted seedlings of mulberry give more foliage for silk production than grafted seedlings. Malda is a good source of mulberry. Mulberry seedlings should be planted in such a way that their shade does not fall on agricultural land.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The following should be grown between two mulberry plants:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->1) Where the land is extremely rocky and there is no soil, soil should be brought from outside so that palm, Indian plum and custard-apple saplings, not seedlings, can be planted between two mulberry plants. Research should be done on the custard-apple and the Indian plum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->2) Where the land is extremely rocky but there are accumulations of soil between the rocks, thorny puneala plum (thorny paniala) [Flacourtia jangomas (Lour) Raeusch.] and custard-apple can be planted between two mulberry plants. Research should be done on the thorny puneala plum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->3) Where the land is less rocky, non-thorny puneala plum (non-thorny paniala) and custard-apple can be planted between two mulberry plants. Research should be done on the non-thorny puneala plum.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->4) Where the land is a bit better than in number three above, date palm (khejur) and custard-apple saplings can be planted between two mulberry plants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Custard-apple varieties from abroad should be brought to India as far as possible, especially the variety from the Philippines, which is a large variety. Sporting goods can be made from mulberry wood. Mulberry can be grown successfully in A&#x301;nanda Nagar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Next is lac culture. Lacquer is produced by insects grown on trees such as palash [Butea frondosa Koenig-ex Roxb.], Indian plum and kusum [Schleichera trijuga Willd.]. Lac should not be grown on all Indian plum trees, otherwise fruit production will be affected. Lacquer may be used as protective varnish for furniture, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->In apiculture bees produce rectified honey and pure beeswax from a variety of flowers. The types of bees include wild bees like rock bees which cannot be tamed, and bush bees which can be tamed. Specially bred bees should be encouraged, but wild bees should not be prevented from entering our gardens. All bees, including wild bees, should be allowed in our gardens.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Bee boxes can be located near oil-seeds, flower gardens, neem trees, Indian olives and grapes. The honey in the bee boxes should be collected regularly. In Bengal the period of maximum flowering for these plants is March, April, May and June.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Floral nectar can be collected directly from some special flowers which naturally produce honey. More research on all kinds of floral honey should be done.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..38"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->Dairy Farming<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Dairy farming includes milk production from dairy cows, goats, sheep and buffaloes. Milk powder and dehydrated curd should also be produced. Animals are not to be sold for slaughter.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..40"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Irrigation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Irrigation is also an important aspect of farming. As a principle, subterranean water should not be used for irrigation purposes. Subterranean water should not be disturbed, otherwise the level of the water-table will drop, leading to an acute shortage of water. The best system is to collect surface water. The rainwater, even from light showers, should be collected where it falls. If the huge reserves of water under some deserts are harnessed, it may do more harm than good. It is always better to conserve surface water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Water conservation, irrigation and afforestation are essential for desert reclamation. In the Thar Desert of India, a canal has been constructed to bring water from the Ganges to irrigate the land. The Ganga Nagar area has been reclaimed and is now producing large quantities of wheat. The canal can be extended even further into the desert. Conserving surface water is the best method of irrigation and is preferable to exploiting underground water reserves.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Ecologists claim that some deserts are essential for keeping the global ecology in a balanced state. The high day temperatures and the cold night temperatures that occur in desert regions create a useful effect. Because the air in the desert is dry, the hot air rises and creates a vacuum which sucks in other air, generating a chain reaction. Moist air comes in from the sea and causes rainfall. If deserts vanish entirely, the overall rainfall will be reduced.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Certain plants such as sirisha [Albizzia lebbeck benth.], shisu [Dalbergia sissoo Roxb.], Himalayan white oak [Quercus incana Roxb.] and ferns have the capacity to attract rain clouds. They also create a congenial environment for other plants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..45"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Pisciculture<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Fish should be cultivated in lakes, dams and ponds because they help conserve and purify the water. Small fish can also be cultivated in the paddy fields during the rainy season. Fish are the natural food of birds, so they are an essential part of a balanced ecology.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..47"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->Pest Control<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->In the rainy season in the last week of Shra&#x301;van&#x301;a there is water in the paddy fields of Bengal. In these fields we should cultivate fish, but fishermen should not be allowed to catch these fish while the paddy is still growing. Harmful insecticides or pesticides should not be used in these fields because they will kill the fish and pollute the water system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Alternative pesticides like neem paste pesticide should be used. If copper sulphate spray is used, care should be taken to use the minimum amount because it is harmful. Neem paste can be prepared from neem leaves. Before planting the paddy, during the last ploughing, neem oil cakes should be ploughed into the fields. In addition, neem paste pesticide with urea should be used whenever there is an attack of insects. Copper sulphate solution can also be mixed with urea.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Fish should not be the food of human beings, but the food of jackals, birds, foxes and other fish and crabs. If the paddy water drains into ponds, lakes or rivers, small fish will flourish and become the food of larger fish, birds and animals. In this way the farmers will be helping maintain ecological balance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Some special medicines can be prepared for particular crops. For example, to kill the worms which attack cauliflower crops, soapy water mixed with a small amount of kerosene may be sprayed on the cauliflowers. Because the water is soapy the kerosene will easily wash off the cauliflowers and not be harmful to human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Snakes will most likely be found wherever wax gourd is cultivated. To avoid this, iishanmula [Aristolochia indica Linn.] is used because snakes are afraid of its smell. Snakes are also afraid of any copper salt. Wherever there is copper salt snakes will not be found, as in Ghatshila and Maobhandar, near Tatanagar. Water kept in a bronze pot becomes antiseptic due to the copper in the bronze. Copper sulphate is poisonous for human beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..53"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Fertilizers<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->In the distant past, large animals used to go to predetermined places to die. Wild elephants still have this habit. At such places, with the passage of time the bones of the animals became deposits of calcium sulphate and calcium carbonate. Wherever cretaceous animals lived in groups, limestone will be found. In Assam, for example, limestone and petroleum can be found. The fat of these huge animals became petroleum and the bones became limestone. In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, in Jalda and Jaipur, limestone can also be found. Limestone can be used to manufacture good quality cement, and it helps make oranges sweet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->There are two types of fertilizers &ndash; organic and inorganic. When fertilizers are used, bacteria are also being used indirectly. These bacteria function in two ways &ndash; one positive and the other negative. When you utilize bio-fertilizer bacteria, that is, organic fertilizers, the function of the bacteria will only be positive. You should start practical research into positive microvita from the study of bio-fertilizers and their positive functions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->Among the organic fertilizers from animals, the urine and dung from sheep are the best manures. Sheep to be raised in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h can be acquired from Bengal, Jammu, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Varieties from Australia can also be used. Materials for bio-gas include cow, buffalo and sheep dung, the dung of mammals kept in protected compounds, and the organic material from beauty spots. Water hyacinths are also a good raw material for producing bio-gas, but cow dung is best. The dung of hybrid animals is not as good as that of pure or natural breeds because hybrids are more prone to disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..57"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->The best manure for green vegetables is rotten vegetables. Cow dung may also serve the same purpose. In the case of gourd, oil cakes and mustard cakes mixed equally with soil will increase production.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->Once before I said that farmers need fertilizers for the maximum utilization of agricultural land. Animal fertilizers are insufficient &ndash; farmers need chemical fertilizers. However, it is noticeable that whenever chemical fertilizers are used intensively, the land becomes infertile and useless after some time. This is because chemical fertilizers destroy the vital energy of the land so that it becomes lifeless, just like cement. Intensive research should be conducted on how to use chemical fertilizers in agriculture without producing any ill effects on the land. In the system of individual farming it is not possible to escape the ill effects of chemical fertilizers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The solution to this problem lies in the cooperative system. In the cooperative system there is great scope for agricultural research and development to discover new ways to better utilize and prolong the vitality of the land. The benefit of cooperatives is that they combine the wealth and resources of many individuals and harness them in a united way.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->There was a time when farmers used to leave their land fallow for a year after several years of continuous cultivation, but this is not possible today. It is now necessary to adopt a system in which either chemical fertilizers that do not decrease soil fertility are used, or high yields are produced without using chemical fertilizers at all. I am optomistic that this will be achieved in the near future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..61"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->Cottage Industries<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->Various types of cottage industries should be established on master units,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.2.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#2.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> subject to the availability of raw materials. Some types of cottage industries include the following:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->1) The first stage of processing farm products of animal and insect origin, such as milk, wool, silk thread, lacquer, honey and wax.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->2) Producing all types of farm products derived from plants, such as papad from pulse, beaten rice from rice, cereal flakes from different types of cereals, jams from fruits, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->3) Industrial products and herbal medicines of plant origin, such as essences, ayurvedic medicines and naturopathic remedies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->4) Medicines of non-plant origin, such as allopathic and biochemic medicines, as well as medical equipment such as pressure gauges.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->5) Different fibres produced from plants, such as jute, cotton, linen, hemp, banana, pineapple, sisal, okra and basil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->6)  Fibre products of non-plant origin, such as nylon, rayon, plastic and artificial silk.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->7) Articles of mineral but non-metallic origin, such as calcium carbonate, calcium sulphate, calcium phosphate, conch shells, rubber and oyster shells.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->8) Non-metallic products, such as soap, shampoo, liquid soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, detergent and nectar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->9) Metallic products from gold, aluminum, bronze, brass, zinc, etc., as well as tin articles, thermometers, crockery and utensils.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->10) Iron materials and articles, such as steel, stainless steel, grinding machines, cement and fertilizers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->These are just a few examples of some of the items which can be produced. There are in fact many items which can be produced under each category. In poor areas, two or three simple industries can be started first, such as manufacturing briefcases, medicines or making flour with grinding machines. If cottage industries are properly established, poor local people will enjoy immediate economic benefits.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..74"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=74 type=paragraph -->Energy Production<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->Energy which can be produced on a small scale includes solar energy, thermal power, bio-gas, hydroelectricity and pneumatic power. Solar energy for lights and water pumps can be produced from solar panels. Thermal power can be produced from coal and other fossil fuels. Bio-gas for generators, cooking, lighting and small generators can be produced from bio-mass waste. The bio-gas plant harnesses the gas generated by the decomposition of the bio-mass, which can then be collected and used for various purposes. Cow, buffalo and human excreta can be used in bio-gas plants.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->The slurry is an excellent manure because it breaks down in about one week, whereas fresh manure takes up to six months. Slurry takes only three days to reach the roots of a plant compared to three months for normal manure. Slurry can nourish a plant within ten days, whereas normal cow dung takes up to nine months.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->Small-scale hydroelectric plants can also be constructed in the right environment. For example, on the Daksina River at A&#x301;nanda Nagar a plant which can generate hydroelectricity can be constructed. It will be able to give power for up to nine months of the year.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..78"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=78 type=paragraph -->Pneumatic power is one of the cheapest sources of energy for pumps and generators. It is very cheap because the costs include only the initial capital investment to construct the mill and the maintenance costs. It is ideal in windy locations.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..79"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->Research Centres<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->Research centres should be developed on all large farming projects and master units. Although all types of research should be encouraged, first preference should be given to agriculture, second preference to biology (first preference to zoology and second preference to botany) and third preference to chemistry.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..81"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=81 type=paragraph -->Agricultural research should be done on a wide range of subjects including seeds, fruits, flowers, silk, herbs, medicinal plants, summer vegetables, winter vegetables, all-season vegetables, spices, pulses and paddy. Some nuts and fruits such as walnut, chestnut, almond, persimmon, cherry, apricot, grape, fig, pistachio and Paraguay coconut should also be subjects of research.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..82"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=82 type=paragraph -->Research centres can also be established for fibre plants such as jute, agave, hemp, okra, permanent and winter cotton, linseed, remi and pineapple. Oil-seeds such as melon, cucumber, linseed, sesame, safflower and mustard should also be thoroughly studied. New techniques for extracting more oil from oil-seeds and deodorizing the oil should be developed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..83"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=83 type=paragraph -->Take the example of okra. Edible oil can be extracted from okra seeds. This oil does not have a high fat content. The stem is low in calories.  The fibre of the plant can be used to make cloth. The remaining part of the plant can be used for fodder and fertilizer. Okra is grown above the soil, so it can be grown with a tuber crop to get two crops at a time &ndash; one above and one below the ground.  The stick of the okra, that is, the stem, can be used in the plastic industry, and can also be used in the paper industry to produce ordinary quality paper. It can also be used as a fuel. Match sticks cannot be made from the wood of okra because the wood is too weak. Okra takes only forty days to grow and it consumes little irrigation water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..84"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=84 type=paragraph -->Better techniques to increase production should also be developed. For example, in the case of pulses, the leaves and stems of the plants may be plucked often and used as vegetables. This induces more shoots to grow and increases production, but it should be stopped one month before flowering is to occur. Orange tomato, apple tomato and grape tomato were developed in India by Satya Banerjee.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..85"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=85 type=paragraph -->Crops requiring shade include such plants as ginger, turmeric, betel leaf, sweet potato, sweet juice potato and elephantum potato. Plants useful in making scents include the rai bel, matia bel and mogra bel varieties of bel phul [Jasminum sambac Ait.], jui phul [Jasminum sambae], chameli [Jasminum grandiflorum Linn.], bukul [Minisapes elangi], kamini [Murraya paniculata Linn. Jack.], lavender and oleander fragrances.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..86"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=86 type=paragraph -->Paper can be made from bamboo, bamboo leaves, safia grass, soft wood, sugar cane waste and maize waste. Good paper can be manufactured from hoop pine [Araucaria cunninghamii D. Don.].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..87"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=87 type=paragraph -->All sweet seeds should be sown after proper sprouting, otherwise ants will eat them up. Radish seeds should always be brought from at least three miles away from the field where they are to be grown, otherwise they will be prone to disease. To produce seeds for sunflowers, varieties which produce more seeds should be used; for ginger, varieties which have sprouts; for peanuts, the Gujarat variety, the Andhra Pradesh variety or the Tamil Nadu variety; and for paddy, the late boro variety.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..88"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=88 type=paragraph -->There should be a seed production centre at A&#x301;nanda Nagar or A&#x301;nanda Shiila where the climate is very cold. In the plains of India, good seeds cannot be produced. The best places for producing sugar beet seeds are the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and the Kashmir Valley. We should try to produce seeds at A&#x301;nanda Nagar or at Calcutta in a green house. A&#x301;nanda Nagar ja&#x301;grti is the highest point in central A&#x301;nanda Nagar, so the seeds of broccoli, sugar beet and cabbage should be grown there.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..89"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=89 type=paragraph -->Herbs and medicinal plants should be given special importance. Some plants are very useful in helping cure mental disorders. For example, brahmi sag [Herpestis monniera H. B. & K.] increases memory power and is good for the brain. Bottle gourd (lau) [Lagenaria vulgaris Seringe] is good for the mentally disturbed. Bhringaraj [Wedelia calendulacea Less.] oil can be used to treat the insane. Tulsi nishanda or oil extracted from basil seeds can be used to treat madness. Other plants are useful in treating physical disorders. For example, kalmegh [Andrographis paniculata Nees.] or cirota, which is dried kalmegh, prevents malaria. Cinchona is a source of quinine. Phaniphal [Trapa bispinosa Roxb.] is good for stomach and intestinal disorders.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..90"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=90 type=paragraph -->There are six categories of hills &ndash; small mounds, demi-hillocks, small hillocks, hillocks, hills and mountains. The land near sources of water such as wells and barrages should be utilized by growing varieties of sag or green leafy vegetables, mint (pudina) and Indian pennywort (thankuni) [Hydrocotyle asiatica Linn.].<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..91"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=91 type=paragraph -->Creepers to be grown in protected areas include the gach pa&#x301;n variety of betel leaf and long pepper (pepul) [Piper longum Linn.] climbing on alternate red oaks; black pepper (golmarich) [Piper nigrum Linn.] climbing on silver oaks and green oaks; choi [Piper chaba Hunter.] climbing on coconut plants; and other creeping or climbing medicinal plants such as harjura [Cissus quadrangularis Linn.] and iishanmula [Aristolochia indica Linn.] growing on different palms. Such climbers should not be grown on roadside palms. They should be grown only in protected areas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..92"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=92 type=paragraph -->The Solar Calendar<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..93"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=93 type=paragraph -->The Bengali months are solar months, and they take into account the seasons. The Hindi months are lunar months so cultivation cannot be done according to the Hindi calendar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..94"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=94 type=paragraph -->The Gregorian calendar is also a solar calendar, but it is not adjusted. For example, when the arc is starting it is the fourteenth of April, which is the middle of the month, but if it were properly adjusted it would be in the beginning of the month.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..95"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=95 type=paragraph -->Generally the solar year is 365 days and the lunar year is 355 days. Therefore, every three years the lunar year advances by one month.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..96"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=96 type=paragraph -->The Bengali calendar is followed in West Bengal, Bangladesh, Tripura, Assam, Orissa, the Bengali speaking areas of Bihar, and Chotanagpur. It is also followed for cultivation in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jammu, Kashmir, the Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Tibet, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..97"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=97 type=paragraph -->When both the sun and the moon are in Pisces, and clouds form in the sky and it rains, this is called hathiya in Bihar. This combination is considered excellent for agriculture because the yield of the crops will increase tremendously.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..98"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=98 type=paragraph -->Some plants are sun affected and others are moon affected. Basil is moon affected. In moon affected herbs the effect increases on the full moon. Sun affected and moon affected plants should be grown in separate areas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..99"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=99 type=paragraph -->Detailed research needs to be done to make all calendars more accurate. This will make farming more scientific and increase productivity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..100"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=100 type=paragraph -->Special Features of Farming Projects<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..101"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=101 type=paragraph -->All integrated farming projects and master units should endeavour to include some special features such as a wheat grinding machine to produce flour, a bakery to produce bread, a cheap seed distribution centre (sulabha biija vitaran&#x301;a kendra), a free plant distribution centre, sericulture, a bio-gas plant to utilize the waste of dairy cows, solar energy, apiculture and a school and children&#146;s home.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..102"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=102 type=paragraph -->A cheap seed distribution centre should collect good quality seeds and sell them at cheap rates. Seeds may be purchased from local farmers at the end of each harvest, or purchased at cheap rates in the market, or cultivated, but the centre should provide good quality seeds at cheap rates to the local people.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..103"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=103 type=paragraph -->A free plant distribution centre should grow plants from seeds and seedlings for free distribution to local people. The following system should be used to prepare plants for distribution.  The seedlings should be grown until they are one and a half feet tall. The plants should then be uprooted and their roots soaked in water for half an hour. Next, the main root of each plant should be cut off one inch below the base of the plant, and the remaining roots should again be soaked in water for ten minutes. The plants should then be planted in a field or packed for distribution. Plants which are prepared in this way will produce large, sweet fruits. The fruits will be better than those produced from seedlings, but not as good as those produced from grafted plants.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Agriculture is one of the oldest sciences known to civilization, and directly affects every human being. The knowledge of different crops, their utilization, growing requirements, etc. have been passed down and improved upon from generation to generation. Without this knowledge, human beings would have been dependent on the irregular food supply of nature, just like animals. So learning how to grow certain crops has been an essential requirement for human development, and a significant feature of social progress.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Human beings have acquired some knowledge of a variety of crops, but many plants still have unknown and so far unutilized potential. So human beings should expand their knowledge of all kinds of plants, and develop new and better methods of increasing crop yields.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Some important crops which are grown in Bengal are discussed below, and include: oil seeds, pulses, fibre crops, cereals, vegetables, sugar crops, fruits, nuts, tea, coffee, cocoa, coarse grains, spices, medicinal plants, flowers, trees, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->OIL SEEDS<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Many plants have seeds which can be used to produce oil. The oil extracted from the seeds of some of these plants is used to produce thickened oil, margarine and other products for human consumption. The oil can also be burnt as a fuel; used to make cosmetics, shoe polish, furniture wax, medicines, hair oil, etc.; or refined for industrial purposes and used as machine oil, etc. The skin of some oil seeds, like groundnut, can also be removed to make flour to produce bread. Many products can be made from oil seeds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->It must be remembered that some oil seeds, particularly groundnut, soybean and linseed, consume a lot of fatty substances from the soil, so oil cakes must be applied as manure when planting oil seeds. The method for this is as follows. First, the cake should be made into powder and mixed with soil, then it should be mixed with water and formed into mounds in the field. If it is to be used at a later date, at that time water should be added to the mixture of powder and soil and then it should be applied to the field. Sunflower and sesame consume an ordinary amount of fatty substances.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Some of the better known oil seeds are: <ul><ol> <li>peanut (cina&#x301; ba&#x301;da&#x301;m) <li>sesame (til).

<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Peanut (Cina&#x301; Ba&#x301;da&#x301;m)<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The peanut grows under the ground and is one of the oldest food crops known. The word peanut is used in Queen&#146;s English, but in common English, groundnut is used. In recent history, other uses have been found for the humble peanut and its oil, most notably by the scientist George Washington Carver. Peanut is able to grow in less fertile soil throughout the year, and not much water is required for its cultivation. It is a three and a half month crop, contains a lot of protein and has much food value. It is an important food in the diets of many poor people because it is fairly easy to grow and highly nutritious. And it is a regular item in the diets of many not so poor people as well because it is tasty.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->From the peanut we get peanut milk, peanut oil, peanut butter, peanut cheese, peanut casein (cha&#x301;na&#x301;) and rasagolla. The oil is often used in deep frying, and because it is quite heavy, it can be easily thickened. The thickened oil can be made into margarine. Peanut oil cake may be used both as manure and as animal fodder. If the red skin of the peanut is removed before pressing to extract the oil, then it can be used as a substitute for flour to make bread.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The method for sowing peanut is as follows. The shell is removed, but the red skin is left intact, then the peanut is soaked in water. When it has sprouted, it should be planted on the hills or mounds of the field.<!-- /block --></p>

However, it takes a lot of fatty substances out of the soil, and whenever it is planted, oil cakes must be applied as manure. After linseed is harvested, dhain&#x32D;ca (Sesbania bispinosa) must be planted as a green manure. The dhain&#x32D;ca should be grown for two months and then ploughed into the field to restore the soil and make it ready for the next crop.

In the Occident, however, the soybean has been used mainly as animal fodder until recently. Now its versatility is being recognized and it is becoming more popular. The oil can be used for cooking, thickened into margarine or used in other ways. Soybean can be sown with peanut in the irrigation furrows of a field, and sesame or sarguja&#x301; on the mounds.

<a name="3..151"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=151 type=paragraph -->The system of growing four rice crops in a year requires that the rice seedlings are kept in a nursery for the first month to six weeks of their growth, because each rice crop takes four months to mature. Traditionally, the seeds are sown in a small plot at random, then transplanted in a more systematic manner. With the new system, the seeds should be grown in a nursery for the first month, and then transplanted in the field. The seedlings should always be transplanted after one month, or one and a half months at the most in some rare cases. If the seedlings are kept in the nursery for a longer period, the production will decline. Thus, in the two and a half to three months of their main growth period, the transplanted rice seedlings will remain in the field, and the best paddy land will be utilized for the main period of rice production. The four rice crops which can best be grown with this system are a&#x301;us, a&#x301;man, early boro and late boro. The production of these crops varies &ndash; a&#x301;man produces the maximum amount of rice, boro a medium amount and a&#x301;us the minimum.<!-- /block --></p>

A&#x301;us should be used as a transplanted crop, not as a sown crop. Plant early a&#x301;us seedlings in the month of Caetra, and late a&#x301;us seedlings in the month of As&#x301;a&#x301;dha. A&#x301;us paddy does not require waterlogging the field. Along with the a&#x301;us paddy seedlings, radish seedlings can also be planted. The radish seedlings should be 15 days old when they are planted.<!-- /block --></p>

A&#x301;man paddy requires waterlogging. As the water level rises, the plant grows taller, but the tip should always remain above the water or the plant will die. If the water is higher than four inches, the plant will be healthy but the crop will be poor. A&#x301;man paddy requires profuse watering and water accumulation. No mixed crop can be planted with a&#x301;man. At this time the big onion seeds are not ready and small onion cannot be planted as it is too small and will go under water. Thus, no mixed crops should be sown along with a&#x301;man paddy, but pisciculture can be practised.<!-- /block --></p>

In the early boro field, big onions can be transplanted (sprouted chachi piau&#x301; of the preceding period). Big onion is planted with early boro and small sweet onion (sachi piaz) is planted with late boro. Special care should be taken to obtain a big onion type which is a winter crop, as it requires less water. The big onion variety can be planted in the early boro field, but care should be taken that the top of the big onion plant always remains above the water. 60 day green gram (s&#x301;a&#x301;t&#x301;ha&#x301; moog) can also be grown with late boro, as gram does not need much water. The green gram may be grown as a &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo; in the second two months of the transplanted a&#x301;us, field, the second two months of the transplanted early boro field, and the second two months of the transplanted late boro field. If irrigation water is not available after the a&#x301;man crop, instead of the boro crop, a &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo; can be grown.<!-- /block --></p>

If there is a sufficient supply of irrigation water available, only boro and no pigeon crop should be cultivated after the a&#x301;man paddy. Otherwise, the field should be engaged for pulse cultivation. Along with late boro, onion may be transplanted in the same field for three months. Small sweet onion (sachi piaz) takes four to five months to grow and should be cultivated in the nursery for the first one or two months before being transplanted. Onions need water (and are 67% water themselves), so they may also be harvested in the month of Vaesha&#x301;kha along with the late boro. The Sam&#x301;skrta word for onion is &ldquo;sukarkanda,&rdquo; in Hindi it is &ldquo;piaz,&rdquo; and in Bengali, &ldquo;pianz.&rdquo;<!-- /block --></p>

If big onions are to be harvested for marketing, then the stalk should be twisted down while it is green and about to flower. If this is done, the onion will attain its maximum size. In mid-Vaesha&#x301;kha, when the boro paddy and onion are to be harvested, harvest the rice. If the stalk of the onion is also cut down at this time it is better.

The prescribed period for sowing wheat is Ka&#x301;rttika, Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a, or up to the 7th of Paos&#x301;, that is, not beyond the 21st of December.

In England, wheat and poppy are commonly sown together. If, in the month of Pha&#x301;lguna, easterly winds blow, the ripening will be delayed. Wheat cannot be transplanted and is a winter crop, a sown crop. For mixed cropping grow lentil, pea, khesa&#x301;ri and poppy (both ordinary and opium) along with it. If these mixed crops occupy 10% of the field, they will not hamper wheat production. Rather, the production may increase because the mixed crops fix nitrogen in the soil. Wheat requires at least three watering periods during the sowing season.<!-- /block --></p>

Betel leaf requires half light and half shade. Wax gourd may be grown in sandy soil like melons, but the sandy alluvial soil is recommended.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..213"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=213 type=paragraph -->When planting wax gourd cuttings, follow the same procedure as watermelons and musk melons. A pit one and a half feet deep should be dug in sandy alluvial soil and filled with a mixture of compost and soil in equal proportions, then the cutting should be planted. The cuttings should be prepared so that each cutting has two intact nodes, one at the base and the other at the top. Each cutting should be planted so that it is slanting with respect to the ground, and the lower node should not be covered by soil. After the wax gourd cutting is planted, it requires shade and proper watering in all seasons for the first five to six days while the new leaves appear. Within 7-15 days, a green sprout will appear on the upper node. After that it does not need much care. The plant starts flowering after one month. In the evenings the flowers bloom all at once at 11:30 p.m. sharp. When the size of the fruit starts becoming small, the old plants should be removed and replaced by new cuttings. Good cuttings are available in Burdwan, Ranaghat, Beldanga, Monghyr, Farakka, Rajmahal and Saheb Ganj. Wax gourd grows well if subterranean water is available, otherwise the fields will have to be irrigated.<!-- /block --></p>

Snakes congregate wherever wax gourd is cultivated extensively. To avoid this iishanmula should be grown because snakes are afraid of its smell. Serpents are also afraid of any copper salt, so they will not be found wherever there are deposits of this salt, as in Ghatshila and Mohabhandur (near Tata Nagar).

<a name="3..289"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=289 type=paragraph -->There are other sources of sugar which are not very commonly used because they are not commercially viable. For example, fructose or fruit sugar, obtained from fruits such as grapes, and sugar obtained from the red sweet variety of African yam, are good sources of sugar. The sweet root of the African red yam is a staple food for many people in Africa, especially during famine. It has been introduced into India and has many interesting qualities. Research should be done on these and other sugar crops to make them commercially viable. Research should also be done on commercially viable sources of sugar to increase their yield.

<a name="3..291"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=291 type=paragraph -->Sugar cane is a member of the grass group. The long canes are simply peeled and chewed to extract the sweet juice. Mechanical methods of extracting the juice are also used. Previously, sugar cane was sown in Ka&#x301;rttika, but now early varieties can be grown in the month of Pha&#x301;lguna. It is preferable if sugar cane is planted in the month of Pha&#x301;lguna. The cuttings must be brought from at least 20 kilometres away or the crop will be prone to pests and disease. Solid molasses or gur may be prepared from sugar cane. Country sugar can also be made, as well as sugar candy. Research should be done on the early varieties of sugar cane, which take five to six months to grow, to see if the cane can be grown in a shorter period of time.

The planting method should be as follows. First plant one big tree, one medium tree, one big tree, one medium tree, etc. After the medium trees have been planted, start planting small trees in between the big trees &ndash; one big tree, two small trees, one big tree, two small trees, etc. The small trees can also be planted in association with medium trees. Before the trees are planted, deep pits should be dug in the ground and a good amount of compost and some calcium should be put into them.

The Tripura, Siliguri and Baruipur varieties all grow well in India. At A&#x301;nanda Nagar, however, pineapples will not bear fruit, due to the low amount of rainfall, which is below 60 inches per annum. However, if the plants are showered with water, they will be fooled into believing that it is raining and induced to bear fruit.

Garlic has all of the tastes except acidic.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..414"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=414 type=paragraph -->Garlic is indigestible, so it comes out in the perspiration. Thus, it helps in the expulsion of hidden diseases. Yet, it has negative effects also, so it is not to be eaten by persons following a sentient diet. Those who eat garlic emit a very foul odour. Garlic can be used as a medicine, but it is not necessary to eat it as a food.<!-- /block --></p>

Each bulb should be planted so that three quarters is below the ground and one quarter is above the ground. The quarter above the soil must not be buried under any circumstances, and it must also remain above water during irrigation.

<a name="3..421"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=421 type=paragraph -->The Sam&#x301;skrta word for onion is &ldquo;sukarkanda&rdquo;. In Hindi it is called &ldquo;piaz&rdquo; and in Bengali &ldquo;pianz&rdquo;. Like garlic, onion has some medicinal value. It helps to bring out hidden diseases, although it also has negative effects. The medicinal value of onion minus its negative effects can be utilized if onion is used in ways other than eating it, such as in the form of onion oil. Onion is also a good blended crop with rice in certain seasons. Onions can be sold at good prices in Bangladesh and Arab countries.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..422"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=422 type=paragraph -->The method for rotating onion crops is as follows. In the month of Paos&#x301;, onion seeds are sown. The seedlings should be transplanted along with late boro paddy in the month of Ma&#x301;gha. In the middle of Vaesha&#x301;kha, the late boro should be harvested. After that, the onions should be dug up. These small onions (chota piau&#x301; or kali piaz) are very pungent. The soil requirements for small onions are the same as for a&#x301;man paddy, that is, clay soil. These small onions should then be sown with early boro paddy. Small onion is a winter crop. The top can be used as a green leafy vegetable. After harvesting early boro, the large onion bulb (boro piau&#x301; kanda) can be dug up. The stalk of the boro onion (boro piaz) should be twisted down fifteen days before the bulb is dug up, and the bulb should be dug up only after the stalk has dried. Big onion (bara piaz) is tasteless, but it may be considered pungent if it brings tears to the eyes. Some of the small onions which are sown on the border of the paddy fields should be left for flowering. Seeds will grow from these plants, but once the seeds have formed, the bulb will disappear. These seeds can again be sown in the month of Paos&#x301; for small onion (chota piaz).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..423"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=423 type=paragraph -->The onion stalks should be twisted down so that within a short time the plants die and the tubers become ready for harvesting. If the stalks are allowed to grow, they will bear flowers and seeds, but the tubers may disappear. From these seeds, small sweet onions (chachi or sachi piaz) can be grown which can also be used as seeds. If big onions are going to be harvested for marketing, then the stalk should be twisted down while it is green and about to flower. This process will ensure that the onion attains its maximum size.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..424"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=424 type=paragraph -->Onions are 67% water and need a sufficient supply of water to grow properly. The seeds from big onions are used for producing small sweet onions (chachi piaz), and the onion tubers (kalik) from the small sweet onions are used for producing big onions. Small sweet onion takes four to five months to grow and should be developed in a nursery for the first one or two months before being transplanted.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..429"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=429 type=paragraph -->Chilli is very common in India. There are many varieties which vary in size, spiciness and growing conditions. For example, the kacha lanka variety is a three year crop. In the first year it will produce a good yield, in the second year a medium yield, and in the third year a very low yield. Thus, the plants should be removed after the second year and new ones grown. Dhani lanka is not suitable as a blended crop because it grows very large and affects the nearby plants. The indigenous and suryamukhi varieties have similar yields, but the dhani lanka variety produces more than either of these two. The indigenous, suryamukhi and dhani lanka varieties are all summer varieties of green chilli. There is also a red winter variety which is often dried and made into powder.

Its food value is less than that of potato, although it is rich in mineral salts and is good for the blood. It is a general purifier. It is not easily digestible, but it helps digestion because it stimulates saliva secretion. It can be eaten raw, cooked, pickled, etc. The leaves of mustard and radish are similar, but all varieties of mustard have yellow flowers while radish has white flowers. The green leaves of radish (mula sha&#x301;k) are a good food, but the green leaves of mustard (sars&#x301;e sha&#x301;k) are not. Where there is a dense growth of radish plants, they should be thinned out. The leafy off-cuts can be eaten as a vegetable (mula sha&#x301;k).<!-- /block --></p>

Radish oil is pungent, like mustard oil. Radish oil cake makes a good manure. If radish tops are planted, they will produce seeds and flowers. The summer variety of radish can also be grown with a&#x301;us paddy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..436"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=436 type=paragraph -->Radish can be grown as a blended crop with potato and other crops. The root is not wide, so it can be grown with a tuber such as potato without disturbing it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..437"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=437 type=paragraph -->The soil for growing radish should have a very light texture.

<a name="3..438"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=438 type=paragraph -->Two techniques can be used to grow radish seeds. If soil is available, cut off the top one to one and a half inches of the radish and plant the top in wet soil. Use the remainder of the radish as a vegetable. After some time plenty of flowers and seeds will grow. If soil is not available, cut off the top of the radish as above, but hang the top upside down in a sheltered place. Gouge a cup-shaped cavity in the pulp and pour water into it. When the water dries up, wash the pulp and refill it with water. After some time, flowers and seeds will grow profusely downwards. Radish seeds should not be sown within a radius of three miles from where they were produced. Seeds should always be brought from outside the locality, otherwise the radish crop will be prone to disease.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Our system of integrated farming is designed to utilize every inch of land. Not only should the surface land be fully utilized, but the space under the surface, and even the space above the surface, should be used to the maximum. The surface, the sub- surface and the space above the surface is to be used 100%.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->There are three main systems of cropping which will ensure the maximum utilization of land &ndash; mixed cropping, supplementary cropping and crop rotation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->In mixed cropping two or more crops are grown in a field at the same time. For example, potato, spices, brinjal, pumpkin and cauliflower are suitable for mixed cropping. Mixed cropping reduces soil erosion and the wastage of agricultural land, and makes better use of water. It also helps retain the fertility of the soil. For instance, legumes add nitrogen to the soil whereas maize consumes nitrogen, so these crops should be planted together. Well selected plant combinations maintain the fertility and structure of the soil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In supplementary cropping there is one main crop and a minor crop to support it. This system is different from mixed cropping where all crops are major.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In crop rotation the soil is under cultivation for most of the year. In the Purulia district of West Bengal, many farmers grow only one crop of paddy a year. Through crop rotation four crops can be harvested in a year. In the rainy season no mixed crop can be grown with paddy, only small fish. Autumn paddy can be combined with big onions, summer paddy with radish, and spring paddy with small onions grown from seeds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Cultivation should be done on the cooperative basis. Only cooperatives can support the expanding economic requirements of agriculture, like creating ponds, purchasing machinery, uniting local people to pressurise the government for irrigation facilities, etc. Through the cooperative system four crops of rice in a year can easily be grown from any plot of land.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->Mango can be grown as a roadside tree. Between two mangoes one palm should be planted &ndash; one mango, one palm, one mango, etc. Agave (sisal) can then be grown as a fill up plant between them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..21"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Oranges<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Orange trees must be planted 15-20 feet apart. Between two orange trees there should be one coffee tree. Then between the orange and coffee trees there should be two tea plants approximately three feet apart from each other. Between these there should be ginger as a fill up. Each ginger plant should be two feet apart from each other. All the rows should be parallel in a grid formation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->There are no soil or rainfall considerations for oranges, but calcium must be present in the soil in sufficient quantity because it makes the fruit sweet. There are no soil considerations for tea either, but there should be a lot of rainfall which does not accumulate around the plant. Coffee can grow with less rainfall than tea, and it can grow in poor soil.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..26"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Wheat<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Wheat, poppy (ordinary poppy or opium poppy) and mustard can be grown as blended crops. Peas, lentils, khesa&#x301;ri, etc. may be planted with wheat as well as poppy. If any of these plants occupy 10% of a wheat field, the yield of the wheat will be increased so that the production of wheat will be the same as when wheat occupied the whole field. Also, if wheat, peas and khesa&#x301;ri are planted together, the production of wheat will be as much as when wheat was grown alone. Yellow mustard, red mustard and the ra&#x301;i variety of mustard may all be sown as mixed crops with wheat. The larger variety of lentil may be cultivated along with wheat as a winter crop after the land has been tilled.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..28"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Radish<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->When growing rainy season radish, mis&#x301;t&#x301;i danta sha&#x301;k (a sweet green leafy vegetable) should be planted in between the radish plants. The seedlings of the radish should be planted with a&#x301;us paddy. For this the soil should be wet, but not waterlogged.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..30"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->CROP ROTATION<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The two main principles of crop rotation are: 1) maximum crops should be planted in the minimum period of time, and 2) maximum crops should be planted in the minimum space. These two principles are to be implemented without affecting the fertility of the soil.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->An example of the first principle is reaping four crops of rice in a year where there was only one, two or three before. For instance:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->1) In Vaesha&#x301;kha transplanted a&#x301;us or summer paddy can be planted and in Shra&#x301;van&#x301;a it can be harvested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->2) In Shra&#x301;van&#x301;a transplanted a&#x301;man or rainy season paddy can be planted and in Ka&#x301;rttika it can be harvested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->3) In Ka&#x301;rttika early boro or autumn paddy can be planted and in Ma&#x301;gha it can be harvested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->4) In Ma&#x301;gha late boro or spring paddy can be planted and in Vaesha&#x301;kha it can be harvested.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->In central Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h there are only four months of rain. For the rest of the year there is little or no rain, yet it is still possible to get four crops a year. For example, with a&#x301;us paddy, radish should be planted between the rows of rice. With a&#x301;man paddy, small fish but no crops should be cultivated. The fish maintain the water level in the field and can be caught by carnivorous humans or animals, or left in the field to fertilize the soil after the water has dried up. With early boro paddy, big onion and safflower as a boundary plant should be cultivated. With late boro paddy, onion seeds which produce onion bulbs should be planted as a subsidiary crop.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->A special system is used to grow rice in two and a half or three months instead of four. Early in the year transplanted a&#x301;us seedlings should be grown. A&#x301;us takes four months before it is ready for harvesting, so for the first four weeks the a&#x301;us seedlings should be kept in a nursery, and for the remaining two and a half to three months they should be grown in the field. The period for a&#x301;us is Vaesha&#x301;kha, Jyes&#x301;tha&#x301; As&#x301;a&#x301;dha and Shra&#x301;vana.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->In between the a&#x301;us seedlings radish can be grown. A good variety of oil which is a substitute for mustard oil can be produced  from the seeds of radish. The radish should be of the summer variety. The leaves of radish are very good for the liver.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->After a&#x301;us, a&#x301;man variety of paddy can be grown according to the same system used for a&#x301;us &ndash; that is, one month in the nursery and two and a half to three months in the field. The a&#x301;man paddy should be in the nursery while the a&#x301;us crop is in the fields. The period for a&#x301;man is Shra&#x301;van&#x301;a&#x301;, Bha&#x301;dra, A&#x301;shvina and Ka&#x301;rttika. There cannot be any blended crop with a&#x301;man, but instead pisciculture can be practised. During a&#x301;man cultivation some fertilizer may be necessary, but whatever fertilizer is used should be non-poisonous, otherwise it will kill the fish.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->In Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h the soil is of a sticky nature so it does not allow water to seep underground. This type of soil is very good for a&#x301;man cultivation. Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h has the best soil for a&#x301;man cultivation in the entire world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->After a&#x301;man we have to cultivate the early variety of boro according to the same system. With boro, onion and garlic can be grown as blended crops between the seedlings. Around the boundary of the field, one line of safflower seeds can be grown.  Oil which has medicinal value can be produced from the seeds of onion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->After early boro, late boro paddy should be cultivated following the same system. As a blended crop in between the seedings, transplanted onion can be grown. Onion is static so A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rgiis should not take it. However, onion leaves are mutative in the daytime, not at night, so householders can eat them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->So according to this crop rotation system, fields will be occupied for two and a half to three months each by four crops a year, totalling ten or eleven months. For the remaining period, the fields should be prepared for the next rotation. This is an example of how to get maximum crops in minimum period of time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->This type of paddy rotation system is best for sticky or clay soil. If the soil is half sandy half sticky alluvial soil, barely two paddy crops &ndash; a&#x301;us and amam &ndash; can be grown. Wheat and mustard can be cultivated the rest of the year. Planting 20% mustard with wheat will increase the production of wheat by 150%. Peas or lentils can also be grown with the wheat.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Two potato crops &ndash; one of 60 days or early potato and the second of 90 days or late potato &ndash; can be grown in a season. 60 day potato is produced for immediate consumption. It cannot be stored because it is not fully matured, but the 90 day crop can be stored. Both varieties can be dried, powdered and then stored.  60 day potato grows in the months of A&#x301;shvina and Ka&#x301;rttika, while 90 day potato or mature potato grows in the months of Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a, Paus&#x301;a and Ma&#x301;gha. With 90 day potato different types of spices can be grown, such as coriander, cumin and chandani. Cauliflower and pumpkin can also be grown. If potato is grown in the mounds of a ploughed field, brinjal can be grown in the furrows from cuttings, as it needs more water. The winter variety of chilli can also be grown.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->The second principle of crop rotation is growing maximum crops in the minimum space. An example of this is as follows. Grow potato in mounds in rows with a cauliflower between each potato as a surface crop. The potatoes are root crops, so no competing root crop, such as peanut, should be grown at the same time. On the slopes of the mounds small spices like cumin can be planted. After one month when the potatoes have partly grown, canals for irrigation should be dug between the rows of potatoes. In the canals brinjal, cucumber and chilli can be planted. Cauliflower matures before potato. When it matures it can be cut, but the roots should be left in the soil so as not to disturb the potato crop.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Another example is wheat. 20% mustard can be planted with 80% wheat. Mustard grows leaves which can be used as a vegetable and seeds which can be pressed to produce oil. If mustard oil cake is put in water until it starts giving off a bad smell, and is then mixed with more water and spread on the fields, it makes a good fertilizer. Bees can also utilize the flowers to make excellent honey. In addition, on the border of the field two rows of garlic should be grown so that their spacing is in the configuration of equilateral triangles. In the middle of each triangle, one  safflower seed should be sown to make another row of safflower flowers. So, four crops can be grown: wheat, mustard, garlic and safflower. Other crops also can be grown as blended crops.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->For very infertile soil, barley rotation can be grown with a supplementary crop. For example, 20% of the area reserved for the barley crop can be planted with red mustard.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->If one is going to cultivate sugar cane, banana or radish, the seeds, cuttings or roots should be brought from at least twelve miles away. However, they may come from the opposite bank of a river which is less than twelve miles away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->The brinjal plant should have thorns, as the thorny brinjal produces tasty brinjal. White brinjal should not be cultivated because it is static and makes the soil infertile.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->When cultivating lentils, high quality manure should be used, and the best manure for this purpose is the oil cake of castor. Lentils crops should not be discontinued simply because they need good fertilizer, because they can be used to produce refined vegetable oil and lubricants. Linseed can also be used to manufacture refined vegetable oil and lubricants, as well as scented hair oil, linen cloth, etc. Linseed can be cultivated after lentils.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->When there is a scant supply of water, a &ldquo;pigeon crop&rdquo;<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> of the ra&#x301;i variety of mustard can be grown. The mustard seeds should be spread out over the whole field while it is still wet after the rainy season, then the crop will grow through the dry season.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->It is not economical to cultivate sugar cane in Bengal because it occupies the land for a whole year. Sugar beet should be grown instead, because three crops can be grown in a year. However, sugar beet cannot supply molasses, which is a very famous food in rural Bengal. Also, seeds cannot be produced from sugar beet due to the hot climate, so they have to be imported from outside the region. Research should be done to develop varieties of sugar beet which produce seeds in warm climates.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->Some examples of crop rotation include the following:<!-- /block --></p>

Also, at this time the big onion seeds are not ready and the small onions cannot be planted under so much water. Care must be taken to ensure that the variety of onion used in the early boro field is the type that always remains above water.

Small onion takes four to five months to grow and should be developed in the nursery for the first one or two months before being transplanted. Seeds from the big onions are used to produce small onions, and the onion tubers (kalik) from small onions are used to produce big onions. Big onions are used both as a vegetable and for seed production. If the big onions are to be harvested for marketing, then the stalk should be twisted down while it is green and about to flower.

Dry and big winter chilli should also be grown in the canal. Big seedlings should be grown so that the plants flower within fifteen days after planting. For one week after planting, the seedlings should be covered with shade to avoid direct sunlight, but in the night they should not be covered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..167"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=167 type=paragraph -->Sugar Crops<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..168"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=168 type=paragraph -->Sugar crops include the following:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..169"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=169 type=paragraph -->1)Sugar cane &ndash; Sugar cane is of Indian origin and comes within the grass group. It is a medium-sized grass. The percentage of sugar produced differs from one variety to another. Traditionally, sugar cane is planted just before winter, but this system is a bit defective. The best season for planting is the early spring in the month of Pha&#x301;lguna. The cuttings must be brought from at least twenty kilometres away, otherwise they will be prone to pests and disease.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..170"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=170 type=paragraph -->If sugar cane is grown, it should be planted along with late boro paddy. In the month of Jyaes&#x301;t&#x301;ha, after harvesting boro paddy, the plants should be bundled up with the leaves of the sugar cane. The place between two sugar cane plants may be utilized either for green gram, which grows in sixty days, peanuts, or maize of the taller variety. In the month of As&#x301;a&#x301;dha, after removing the grass, the vacancy between two sugar cane plants may be utilized for growing turmeric. Turmeric requires half sunlight and half shade. It will grow well in sugar cane fields. In the month of Ka&#x301;rttika, after harvesting the turmeric, if a place remains between two sugar canes, it may be utilized for producing sweet potato or sweet juice potato.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..171"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=171 type=paragraph -->2) Sugar beet &ndash; Sugar beet is an all-season crop, but in India it is grown only in the winter season between A&#x301;shvina and Pha&#x301;lguna. It may be grown along with potato between two potato plants on the upper portion of the valley, that is, on the mound. The lower portion of the mound may be utilized for growing winter spices. Sugar beet may be produced both with early potato (A&#x301;shvina to Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a) or late potato (Paus&#x301;a to Pha&#x301;lguna).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..172"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=172 type=paragraph -->3) Sweet potatoes &ndash; The space between sweet potatoes can be used to cultivate soybeans, cabbage and winter brinjal. The early variety of sweet potato can be grown from A&#x301;shvina to Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a, and the late variety from Paus&#x301;a to Pha&#x301;lguna. Green chilli may also be grown, but green chilli is three year crop. In the first year there is a good crop, in the second year there is a medium crop, and in the third year there is a very low crop. For example, if in the first year the production is taken as 100%, in the second year it will be reduced to 40% and in the third year to only 10% to 15%. So it is best that after the second year the old plants are replaced. Cauliflower should not be planted along with the creeping crops. It requires direct sunlight and the creepers will cover it. Cabbage, because it needs less direct sunlight, can be grown along with the creeping tuber vegetables.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..173"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=173 type=paragraph -->After harvesting late sweet potato, select varieties of arum, along with summer creepers like pumpkin, gourd, bitter gourd, water gourd, cucumber, musk melon, watermelon, spinach, etc. should be planted. From As&#x301;a&#x301;r&#x301;ha to Bha&#x301;dra, the land may be utilized for a&#x301;us paddy, maize, jute, rainy season brinjal or spinach, rainy season chilli, rainy season beans and rainy season creeping vegetables like pumpkin, gourd, etc. A platform must be used in case of such vegetables. In the winter or summer, a platform may or may not be used.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..174"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=174 type=paragraph -->The crop rotation for sugar crops should be as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..175"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=175 type=paragraph -->1) A&#x301;shvina to Agraha&#x301;yan&#x301;a &ndash; The early variety of sweet potato or sweet juice potato.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..180"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=180 type=paragraph -->The crop rotation for jute should be as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..181"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=181 type=paragraph -->1) Vaesha&#x301;kha &ndash; The jute seeds are sown in a seed bed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..182"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=182 type=paragraph -->2) A&#x301;s&#x301;a&#x301;r&#x301;ha &ndash; The seedlings of jute and the seedlings of a&#x301;us paddy are transplanted. They will both be harvested in Shra&#x301;van&#x301;a.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..183"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=183 type=paragraph -->3) After this autumn maize can be planted (a two-month crop) along with soybean or radish. Maize and soybean are both harvested in the end of A&#x301;shvina. Radish would be left in the field a little longer before harvesting.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..184"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=184 type=paragraph -->4) Winter crops are planted later, and include wheat, winter vegetables and linseed. Linseed is harvested at the end of winter, in Pha&#x301;lguna. After growing linseed, dhain&#x32D;ca must be sown for two months and then plowed into the soil as green manure because linseed takes so much out of the soil. In Vaesha&#x301;kha, jute and a&#x301;us paddy can start again.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..185"></a><p class="Para_Major_Heading"><!-- block a=185 type=paragraph -->BOUNDARY PLANTS<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..186"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=186 type=paragraph -->To ensure the maximum utilization of every inch of land, there is also a system of planting in the boundary areas of all schools, farms, orchards, homes, etc., as well as beside all roads. For example, trees with spreading branches, like most fruit trees and even some timber trees, should be planted all around the perimeter of such places at fixed distances. Palm trees, which grow straight up, should be planted in between the fruit trees, as they do not block the sun light from the fruit trees. Between the fruit trees and the palm trees, filler plants should be planted. Three examples of small filler plants are edible anthurium, a root crop; permanent cotton, a shrub; and arrowroot, a root crop. If the soil is deep and good, plant anthurium. If the soil is stony and poor, plant permanent cotton. If the soil is of medium quality, then plant arrowroot. In between all these there is still space for associate plants to the filler plants. With anthurium plant Chinese mini-grape; with permanent cotton plant ghee kavla, a vegetable; and with arrowroot plant wild mini bitter gourd. The boundary wall should also be topped with wire, then it is also quite possible to plant wire plants, in series, as in the lakeside plantations. Where trees are planted around the boundary of agricultural land, care should be taken so that they do not shade the crops from the sun.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..187"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=187 type=paragraph -->Some examples of boundary plants grown in A&#x301;nanda Nagar include: <ol> <li>Red oak with a fill-gap of cotton (ga&#x301;ch ka&#x301;pa&#x301;s). 2) Night jasmine and Paraguay coconut with a fill-gap of large cardamon (bar&#x301;a ela&#x301;chi). <li>Silver oak with a fill-gap of cotton. <li>Shiriish. <li>Green oak, cotton. <li>Bakphul (Sesbania grandiflora) and African oil palm. <li>Redwood, shveta karabi, na&#x301;gdona&#x301;, and intermittently, red sandalwood (rakta chandan) with a fill-gap of Agave americana. <li>American ash with a fill-gap of Agave americana. <li>Kael pine with a fill gap of Agave americana. <li>Arjuna. <li>Sita asoke (Sarika indica) planted with intermittent sa&#x301;bu da&#x301;na&#x301;. <li>Two mulberry plants with one oil palm in between, the oil palm should not be an African variety. <li>African palm with a fill-gap of pineapple. <li>Beda&#x301;na&#x301;. <li>Phalsa. <li>Paraguay coconut. <li>Indian rosewood with intermittent ta&#x301;l, alternating with Indian rosewood and Indian olive, and pineapple as a fill-gap.  <li>Occidental olive (jalpa&#x301;i, Olea europaea, L.) and chalpa, the fill-gap will be Agave americana. <li>Green oak with a fill-gap of cotton. <li>Sisoo (Dalbergia sisoo) and teak (segun), planted between banyan and night jasmine. <li>Cloves and Indian cassia bark (tejpata) with scholar&#146;s leaves between them. <li>Red sandal and kababcini with sotti between. <li>Japanese cherry tree. <li>Kain&#x32D;can. <li>Sondal tree (Indian laburnum, Cassia fistula). <li>Indian rosewood, pineapple, palmyra, pineapple, Indian rosewood etc. (I+P+Pa+P+I&#8230;) <li>Himalayan devdaru, pineapple, date palm, pineapple, Himalayan devdaru, etc. <li>Ta&#x301;l and Nimnapatra devdaru with a fill-gap of Chinese chaste tree. <li>Nutmeg, ta&#x301;l ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;l, kauphal, ta&#x301;l ka&#x301;t&#x301;a&#x301;l, with a fill- gap of asparagus. <li>Banyan alternately with palmyra, the gaps filled with asparagus and aloe. <li>Indian rosewood, piya&#x301; sha&#x301;l (Pterocarpus marsupium), garjan (Dipterocarpus alatus), shishu (Dalbergia sisoo) and mangostein, with a fill-gap of date palm, asparagus and aloe. <li>Sesame (til) and ginger (adarak) alternately on the boundary of late boro paddy. <li>Boundary plants for oil seeds include night jasmine and Paraguay coconut alternating, with bar&#x301;a ellachi as a fill-up plant. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..188"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=188 type=paragraph -->There is no fixed rule for fill-up plants on boundaries in compounds. Sisal makes a good boundary, roadside and riverside plant, and it is the usual fill-gap on roadsides and many boundaries. It also helps to prevent erosion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..189"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=189 type=paragraph -->So a well integrated system of the blending of crops has many benefits. There is the maximum utilization of land because the space below the surface, on the surface and above the surface is fully used. Properly selected crop combinations also increase productivity, and regions which produce only one or two paddy crops in a year can harvest four paddy crops as well as other associated crops in a year. Through scientific crop rotation which does not adversely affect the productivity of the soil, maximum crops can be planted in the minimum period of time, and maximum crops can be planted in the minimum space. The space around buildings and fields can be used to grow boundary plants, and any convenient space can also be used to grow fill-up and fill-gap plants. Poor farmers will be benefited if they adopt such a system, and so will society.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->A few hundred years ago, many of the desert regions that we see in different parts of the world today were full of trees and wildlife. Due to tree felling by local people and commercial interests, and the depletion of the subterranean water, the deserts have spread.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Many problems occur with the disappearance of trees.  First, the carbon dioxide content in the air rises as there are fewer plants to absorb the carbon dioxide which is constantly being expired into the atmosphere. This results in changes in the atmosphere and the environment, causing climatic warming. If there is a rise of only a few feet in the level of the oceans, many major cities in the world, including Calcutta, could be flooded. In addition,  as the catchment areas are destroyed, rivers reduce their flow of water or dry up. Also, the area around the rivers is transformed into a desert, as in the case of the Nile and the Ganges. Finally, the organic processes in the soil are halted. The micro-organisms die, and so do the worms, while the organic matter breaks down and ceases to retain water. Hence, the soil making process is stopped.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Central Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h was full of lush flora, wildlife and large rivers three thousand years ago. Even thirty years ago there were many trees and dense forests in the region. Now there are hardly any trees, few wild animals, and the rivers have almost dried up. For eight months of the year, the region is dry. The soil is hard and barren, contains few worms or micro-organisms and little organic material, which acts like a sponge to retain the rainwater. The annual rains wash away much of the topsoil that still exists, hence the remaining soil has become coarse and sandy. As a result, the whole region is subjected to flash floods and severe soil erosion.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->To transform this depleted and undernourished environment, a massive, scientific afforestation programme has to be launched. Such a programme should have a two-phased approach:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->1) In the first phase, fast growing trees which grow to their full height in six months to two years and provide valuable green cover should be planted.  Ten types of trees can be used: 1. cassuarina 2. sisir (Albezzia lebbeck) 3. sisoo (Dalbergia) 4. bakphul (Sesbania grandiflora) 5. large screwpine (Pandanus andamanensium) 6. drumstick (Moringa oleifera) 7. red sandalwood (Santalum album) 8. agave (sisal, Agave americana) 9. Diospyros discolor, and 10. cha&#x301;mal (Eterocarpus chaplasa, Roxb.), a wild variety of jackfruit found in north east India.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->2) In the second phase, slow growing trees like teak, which also provides green cover and can be harvested after 30 years or so, should be planted. The fast growing trees can be cut after three years, providing an additional source of income for local people. If this approach is followed, the ecological balance in the area will be restored very quickly.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In addition to this approach, some selected plants need to be grown in desert regions to check the process of desertification. For example, in dry, sandy areas we can grow jojoba which produces seeds that yield oil which can be substituted for diesel oil. Different cactii, Acacia catechu or Acacia arabica can also be grown. Afforestation is the only solution to desertification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Artificial Ponds and Lakes<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->For afforestation programmes to be successful, surface water must be conserved. This can best be accomplished by increasing the water capacity of existing storage systems and building new systems. The cheapest and easiest method of creating new water storage systems is to construct small-scale ponds and lakes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Where should artificial ponds and lakes be located? In the rainy season observe where the surface water flows &ndash; its currents and directions &ndash; and where the rivulets created from the rain water converge together.  The point of convergence is the ideal location for a lake. The bigger the catchment area, the bigger the number of rivulets, so the bigger the pond or lake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->How should an artificial lake be constructed? If there is no modern machinery, a rectangular area should be selected in the middle of the proposed site and line after line of earth dug out. The soil should be deposited around the periphery to form the slopes and ridges of the banks. The lake should be only five feet deep to avoid accidents and drowning. A boundary wall topped with angled irons which are connected with wire should be constructed to keep animals out. Along the wall, wire plants may be grown, and inside the wall palm trees can be planted. On the flat areas, surface plants may be cultivated. The lake can be any shape. Underground culverts or channels may also be constructed so that water from the surrounding countryside can flow through the culverts into the lake. There should also be name plates beside each lake which specify the opening hours, the depth of the lake and any other prescribed details. People should only be permitted to swim and fish in some specified lakes, while boating should be allowed on larger lakes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->To prevent water seeping out immediately after the lake has been constructed, earth from the beds of other lakes can be spread across the lake floor. Alternatively, the earth on the bottom of the lake can be mixed with calcium, although this may harm the  aquatic plants and fish. If sealing the lake is not urgent, nature will perform this task. After the lake has contained water for some time, a fine layer of clay will naturally form on the bed of the lake, sealing the bottom and preventing the water from seeping away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->In central Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h most of the rain water is lost as there is very little organic material in the soil to retain it. To conserve the water, many small ponds and lakes should be conctructed.  If this is done, the surface water can be stored and used for drinking and irrigation. Within a short time the environment will be totally transformed and the ecological balance will be restored.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->There are five categories of small-scale lakes: <ol> <li>A category lakes, which contain over 31,000 gallons of water, <li>B category lakes, which contain 25,000 to 31,000 gallons of water, <li>C category lakes, which contain 20,000 to 25,000 gallons of water, <li>D category lakes, which contain 10,000 to 20,000 gallons of water, <li>E category lakes, which contain under 10,000 gallons of water. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Lakeside Plantations<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Five types of plants should be used around lakes: slope plants, boundary plants, wire plants, aquatic plants and surface plants. These types can be summarised as follows:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->1) Slope plants &ndash; includes  pineapple, asparagus, aloe vera, brinjal and chilli. All of these plants conserve water and check soil erosion, and can also provide an income for local people. Slope plants should always be planted in symmetrical horizontal lines and never in vertical lines, as this allows the water to flow away and encourages soil erosion. Along with pineapple, asparagus and aloe vera, brinjal and chilli should be planted as per the seasonal order. For example, in the summer season, green leafy summer vegetables, small bitter gourd and summer round brinjal of the makada variety can be planted. In the rainy season, caladium, chilli and rainy season brinjal which is not exactly round can be planted. In the winter season winter red chilli should be planted. This variety of chilli can be dried, packed in bags and sold when the market price is high. It is utilized as a cooking spice. Large, white autumn brinjal can also be planted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Should the slopes beside lakes be terraced? Terraces prevent the run off of surface water and soil erosion. As a general rule, all sloping land should be terraced as far as possible. While it may not always be possible to terrace small slopes, large hills and sloping agricultural land should always be terraced. The mounds and furrows on sloping land must be dug perpendicular, not parallel, to the slope. Where a gentle slope ends and a steep slope commences, both slopes should be terraced, but the terracing on the steep slope should be constructed high up the slope so that soil erosion and the rapid flow of water is checked. Roads which go through sloping terrain should be constructed so that the water runs off in a regulated way without damaging the land.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Where the boundary line of a slope touches a river, just above the extreme lowest portion of the slope, a row of banyan and palmyra trees should be planted alternately. Where the slope starts, custard apples, guavas etc. should be planted. Between two custard apples and guavas, agave should be planted in the same row, not in separate rows. This system will help to check the soil erosion around the base of a steep slope and also protect the banks of the river.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->One row of either East Indies or West Indies pineapple can also be planted on the boundary line of any slope between sha&#x301;l and Indian olive, between shaid and cinnamon, or between sha&#x301;l and himalayana devadaru.  Also, one row of pineapple can be planted on the boundary line of a slope where it touches a field. The pineapples may or may not bear fruit if there is scanty rainfall, but they will definately check soil erosion. The West Indies variety requires less rainfall than the East Indies variety.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->2) Boundary plants &ndash; includes  palm trees and the creepers of flowers, vegetables and fruits. Palm trees should be planted around lakes according to their water capacity. For example, coconut trees should be planted around A category lakes, palmyra around B category lakes, betel nut palms  around C category lakes, date palms around D category lakes, and tall banana trees around E category lakes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Creepers should also be grown along with the trees. Coconut trees should be combined with black pepper creepers; palmyra with jasmine creepers; betel nut with lavender; and date with the following medicinal creepers: 1. malehmal &ndash; diirgha lata, 2. harjora, 3. ananta mula, 4. ishanmula, 5. shveta makal, 6. gulain&#x32D;ca lata, 7. jayanti lata, 8. shveta kuce, 9. rakta kuce, 10. rakta kambel, 11. choi, and 12. black pepper. Only one type of creeper should be planted by each lake.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->3) Wire plants &ndash; a brick  wall should be built around each lake and topped by angle irons and wire. The fence will keep out large animals and prevent people from having accidents. Along the wire the following plants should be grown &ndash; creeping vegetables such as beans, bottle gourd, squash and pumpkin; flowers such as aparajita, morning glory and moonflowers; and fruits such as melon, passion fruit, grape, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->4) Aquatic plants &ndash; are of two types: thorny and non-thorny. The thorny aquatic plants include the lotus, makhana and Victoria regina. The lotus produces vegetables and provides organic matter to the water. Makhana seeds are very nutritious and can be sold at a good price. Victoria regina can be grown in beauty spots. All these plants are known for their beauty. Non-thorny aquatic plants include the water lily and the water chestnut. The water lily has edible seeds as well as floral nectar, and the water chestnut provides edible roots which can be used as a vegetable or a fruit which is good for the stomach. Aquatic plants can generate income for local people. Thorny and non-thorny aquatic plants should not be grown together.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->5) Surface plants &ndash; should be  grown on the flat  land surrounding the lake. Anything can be here according to the local preference and the condition of the soil. Banyan (Ficus benghalenses), bo tree (Ficus religiosa), Acacia catechu, Acacia arabica as well as thorny and dry climate trees can be grown in rocky areas. Lotus, makhana, water lily, water chestnuts, pineapple and bitter date palm grow very well in or beside ponds and lakes. If these plants are cultivated properly, they will be very productive.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->All lakes should be treated as beauty spots. Pineapple, asparagus and aloe vera should be planted on the slopes, along with different types of brinjal and chilli. Different varieties of slope and aquatic plants should also be planted in and around the lakes so that each lake has its own particular charm and beauty according to its size and location.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Pisciculture should also be developed in ponds and lakes. The fish help to keep the water clean and the level constant because their breathing creates water and carbon dioxide. The fish inhale oxygen along with water vapour from the atmosphere as well as dissolved oxygen from the water. They synthesize water which is exhaled into the lake. This helps to keep the water in the lake at a constant level. If many fish live in a lake, hundreds and even thousands of gallons of water will be added to the size of the lake in the course of time. Each lake should also have an attached bird sanctuary, because the fish provide food for the birds.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The recommended depth of small-scale artificial lakes is five feet. If the lake is located in a hot dry climate with high levels of evaporation, the depth should be increased to ten feet.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Fish without gills, like prawns, chingry and tortoises can survive with thorny aquatic plants, but some other fish cannot, so thorny and non-thorny aquatic plants should be grown seperately. Fish that are good for pisiculture include small fish, crabs and prawns, like charamach, koira, guri and rai mach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..30"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->Riverside Plantations<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Riverside plantations are important for preventing floods, conserving water, regulating the flow of water in rivers, and keeping soil moist and fertile. Some examples of plants which are useful riverside trees include banyan, date palm, neem or margosa, tamarind, simul, imli and fruit trees. If horticulture is developed along the banks of rivers, the rivers will never dry up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Most trees with tap root systems do not alleviate riverside erosion, but eucalyptus is an exception. Trees with tap roots  draw water from deep under the ground. Many tap root trees growing in an area can lower the water table and deprive other plants of water, and this can be an additional factor in the creation of desert conditions. For example, eucalyptus trees have contributed to the sparse, arid conditions in Australia. Eucalyptus trees are suitable for planting in marshy areas to help dry them out and are useful for preventing grass fires, but they are not recommended as part of a reforestation programme. As eucalyptus helps check riverside erosion, it can also be a useful riverside tree, but it should always be planted in association with other trees. An example of a riverside plantation is neem, tamarind, simul and eucalyptus. Between each of these trees, palmyra and date palm should be planted alternately. A second example is imli, neem and simul in either of two configurations &ndash; imli, neem, imli, etc. or imli, simul, imli, etc. Imli is a good riverside plant because it retains water and checks soil erosion. It has an extremely fibrous root system.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->Fibrous roots gather water near the surface and benefit neighbouring plants and trees. Many banyan trees have been planted along the seven rivers in A&#x301;nanda Nagar for this reason. Previously, only one river ran throughout the year at A&#x301;nanda Nagar, but now all seven rivers flow almost all year round, right up to mid-March. The dry season starts in October and extends to June. Riverside plantations have shown tremendous positive effects within only one year at A&#x301;nanda Nagar.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->The rivers in A&#x301;nanda Nagar are: 1) Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a (southern); 2) Uttara (northern); 3) Kunti (mother of the Pandava brothers), previously called Kopia, meaning angry, because of flash floods; 4) Alka&#x301;nanda, meaning the river coming from heaven, and previously called Alkusi (which often gave lots of trouble due to flash floods and the subsequent damage this caused); 5) Guaki, which is loop-shaped, and is actually the confluence of the Daks&#x301;in&#x301;a and Uttara; 6) Para&#x301;gati; and 7) Manda&#x301;kinii. India used to be called the land of the seven rivers, and now A&#x301;nanda Nagar is the land of the seven rivers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Trees which should be planted along the rivers at A&#x301;nanda Nagar are the indigenous neem, bakayan neem or gudra neem, eucalyptus, tamarind and simul. Tea gardens can also be planted along the river banks. Patal may be grown on the banks of the streams in Purulia district.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Land and water hyacinths originated in Brazil. Mr. Lee, the Divisional Commissioner of Dhaka, and his wife visited Brazil. Mrs. Lee liked the water hyacinths and brought them to the Divisional Commissioners house in Dhaka. From there they spread into the Durhi Ganga. Within ten years they spread to Bengal, and within fifty years to Uttar Pradesh. Now they have spread throughout the whole of India. In Bengali they are called &ldquo;kachuri patra&rdquo; and in Hindi &ldquo;jalakumbhi&rdquo;. Water hyacinths are good for producing bio-gas. Lily ponds should be located far from rivers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->So, lakeside and riverside plantations stop soil erosion, nourish the top soil and assist in providing a steady supply of water throughout the year. This method of plantation should be adopted everywhere.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="6..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->At the beginning of this earth, there was absolute silence &ndash; there were no living beings or even plants. This condition continued for hundreds of millions of years, until the earth was properly formed. Then a phase came when rain and storms started, and by a gradual process, life emerged. As a result of the rain, carbon atoms got infused with vital energy (pra&#x301;n&#x301;a shakti). Carbon atoms along with protoplasmic clash and cohesion formed this vital energy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Water was an essential factor in the evolution of the planet, and now it is most essential for the survival of human beings, animals, plants and the planet as a whole. If it does not rain anywhere on earth for only one year, all life on the planet will be destroyed. This is because all creatures &ndash; from the smallest organisms to the largest animals &ndash; need water. If there is no water, first the small creatures will die, then the ecological balance of the planet will be lost. Next, human beings will also die, and soon the earth will become a barren wasteland.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..3"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Global Water Crisis<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->In the near future there will be a severe crisis in many parts of the world. Many large rivers like the Ganga, the Jamuna and the Thames are already very polluted. People cannot drink this water, and if they even wash their hands in it they can become infected. The only solution is to rely on rainwater. We must collect the rainwater, develop the science of making artificial rain through helium or any other process, and bring the clouds which rain over the ocean onto the land. Constructing more deep tube wells is not the answer. Rather, we must catch the rainwater where it falls. Many ponds, canals, dams, lakes and reservoirs should be immediately constructed to catch the rainwater and store it for drinking water. This is the only way out of the water crisis that will confront humanity in the very near future.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->In the physical sphere there are two types of calamities &ndash; natural calamities and those caused by human beings. Today most calamities are caused by human beings, but sometimes natural calamities like typhoons, floods, droughts, earthquakes, etc., also occur. Although different types of calamities may confront humanity, doomsday will never happen. The very idea of doomsday is based on dogma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->The calamities caused by human beings are mainly of two types. First, many calamities are caused by the bifurcation and trifurcation of society. The bifurcation of society is exemplified by the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the recent war between North and South Vietnam. The division of India into India, Pakistan and Bangladesh is an example of the trifurcation of society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Calamities are also caused by the destruction of the environment and the indiscriminate exploitation of subterranean resources such as coal, oil and water. One of the greatest causes of environmental destruction is deforestation. Due to deforestation, the rain clouds coming from the Bay of Bengal travel all the way across India and rain on the Arabian Sea. That is, clouds which once rained on Magadh now rain on the Arabian Sea. Consequently, the water level in the Arabian Sea is gradually rising and the Bay of Bengal is becoming more salty. The result is that the water level around the coast of India is rising, the land area of the Indian subcontinent is decreasing and soil erosion is increasing. Approximately two-thirds of the surface of the globe is water and one-third is land, but due to deforestation the water portion is increasing and the land portion is decreasing.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Another cause of environmental destruction is the exploitation of subterranean resources. Deep cavities have been formed in the earth after extracting subterranean resources, and these cavities should be properly filled. In some countries it is the practice to use sand to fill the cavities created by mining underground coal. If these cavities are left unfilled, the surrounding regions are more likely to experience earthquakes than other areas. Moreover, the unfilled cavities can severely weaken the surface structure of the earth, causing whole regions to collapse.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->In some Arab countries, huge amounts of money have been made by extracting oil from under the ground. Several years ago the leaders of these countries realized that the supply of oil would not last forever, so they started to think about the future of their countries after the supply of oil was exhausted. They became concerned that the level of the water-table was falling and the sizes of the deserts were increasing. To solve this problem, they decided to import soil and sweet water to create dense forests. Now the trees that they planted are eight to ten years old, and last year it was reported that they experienced floods for the first time. Many of the local people had never seen floods before, and young children even cried in alarm at the sight of the rain!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->The exploitation of subterranean water reserves is contributing to desertification in many parts of the world, and as the subterranean water level recedes, the soil near the surface dries out and plants wither and die. This has already happened in many parts of Rajasthan. Afforestation is the only solution to desertification. Human beings have suffered from water scarcity and drought in the past, and this problem will continue unless proper care is taken in the future. If deforestation and the indiscriminate exploitation of subterranean water reserves continue, it is likely that many parts of the world will face severe water shortages from 1993 to at least the year 2000. The only way to avoid such a catastrophe is to immediately implement a decentralized approach to water conservation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..11"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->The Causes of Drought<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->Why do droughts occur? What are the most important causes of drought? There are three main causes. The first is the wanton destruction of plants or indiscriminate deforestation, the second is low pressure systems over oceans and big seas, and the third is sudden changes in the angular movement of the sun and other celestial bodies like comets, nebulae and galaxies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Deforestation causes drought because it prevents the plants from nourishing the earth. The fibrous roots of plants absorb and hold considerable amounts of water which is slowly released into the soil. In the paddy fields of Bengal, for example, during the dry season water will trickle down the channels beside the fields. Where does the water come from? It is released from the roots of the standing crops. But when the paddy and the associate crops are harvested, the supply of water dries up. Deforestation is caused by human beings, and it is within their power to solve this problem through their own efforts.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The second and third causes are presently beyond human control. In the future, with the development of the meteorological and marine sciences, human beings will be able to partially influence and overcome the second cause, but not fully. The third cause can only be controlled by Supreme Consciousness. However, if human beings follow the path of positive microvita and have the grace of Supreme Consciousness, they can also control the third cause.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->How do the sudden changes in the angular movement of celestial bodies cause drought? The paths of some comets are predetermined and astronomers can ascertain their arrival dates and possible effects on the earth, but there are other comets that appear suddenly without warning. When there is the sudden appearance of powerful celestial bodies or a sudden change in their angle of rotation, their gravitational pull may disturb the seasons and the natural order of creation. For example, as a result of the strong gravitational pull of a powerful comet or meteor, clouds may not be formed. This phenomenon is called bakudasha&#x301; in Sanskrit.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Certain deviations of celestial bodies like meteors, comets and satellites take place due to the concentration of a huge number of positive and negative microvita. Movement in universal space is subject to the movement of positive and negative microvita, and this also affects life on earth.<!-- /block --></p>

Suppose you are outside enjoying a cool breeze on a calm full moon night. A soothing, painless feeling will arise in your mind. But if the feeling continues, the nerve cells in your body may become dull, and if the experience of dullness goes beyond a certain limit, your thinking power may be impaired, even causing some psychic ailment. This occurs because the ecological balance within the human structure is lost.<!-- /block --></p>

Now we know that there is nothing identical in this universe, only similarities. If similar circumstances reoccur after a gap of say eight years, a similar incident could take place when you are sixteen. You have to ensure that people are not put into an environment which is similar to one that caused them pain and suffering in the past, as this may adversely affect their progress in the spiritual sphere. This also applies to the physical and psychic spheres.<!-- /block --></p>

In the inner world, balance must be maintained as this leads to spiritual progress. Ecological order is not only for the earth but for the entire universe, and it must be maintained both within and without. The angular displacement of any celestial body may affect the human mind as well as the physical universe, so balance must be maintained between the internal and external spheres. In all aspects of human life this subtle balance must be maintained. This is ecological balance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..20"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The Defects of Well Irrigation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->I have already said that constructing more deep tube wells is not the solution to the water crisis. What are the drawbacks of well irrigation? Well irrigation causes the level of the water-table to drop, while the continuous use of well irrigation dries up the subterranean flow of water. Initially the effects of continuous well irrigation may not be easy to perceive, but eventually a fertile region will be transformed into a desert. In fact, if the subterranean water level stays at above twenty to twenty-five feet, the surface vegetation will not be affected, but if it drops below fifty feet, the surface of the earth will become a barren wasteland.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The negative effects of well irrigation include the following:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->1) Neighbouring shallow wells dry up creating the problem of lack of drinking water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..24"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->2) Trees, orchards and large plants do not get sufficient subterranean water so they wither and die. Green countryside will become a desert after thirty to forty-five years of intensive well irrigation.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->3) In some deep tube wells enemy elements &ndash; that is, elements which are harmful to the soil such as heavy minerals and mineral salts &ndash; get mixed with the water, causing problems such as salinity. As a result, the land eventually becomes infertile and unfit for cultivation. When the flow of well water stops, irrigation tanks supplied by these wells also dry up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..26"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Well irrigation should be used only as a temporary measure because of the devastating effects it can have on the surrounding environment. Alternative methods of irrigation include river irrigation, irrigation from reservoirs, dams and small ponds, shift irrigation and lift irrigation. Irrigation water is like the apex of a spinning top. Without it, agriculture is not possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..27"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->The Best Methods of Irrigation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->The best method of irrigation is the conservation of surface water through a system of ponds, canals, dams, lakes and reservoirs.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Take the example of Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h and Orissa. The potentialities of this region have not yet been fully developed and utilized. The major portion of the wealth is subterranean, and these treasures should be properly harnessed, but practically nothing has been done in this respect. The surface potentialities should also be properly developed, but these too have been neglected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->How should the surface water potentiality in this region be utilized? The rainfall in this area is very meagre &ndash; rain only falls part of the year, and the rest of the year it is dry. Well irrigation is underdeveloped, and there is hardly any lift or shift irrigation. Sixty-five percent of the land is rocky and sandy, and traditionally only coarse grain is grown there. So in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h we have to do two things &ndash; construct many new small-scale ponds, dams and lakes, and undertake large-scale afforestation on the banks of all water systems.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h has undulating land, so large-scale reservoirs cannot be easily constructed, but many small lakes and ponds can be built. Large, deep reservoirs will not be as beneficial as small-scale ponds and should not be encouraged. Moreover, large reservoirs rely on lift and shift irrigation to supply water to a system of canals. In such a system the water pressure will fall because as the water travels along the canals leading from the reservoirs to the fields, the canals will be obstructed by the hilly terrain. So, if there is a big investment in reservoirs, the money will be wasted. Instead, many small ponds and dams can be constructed with the same investment. If many small-scale dams are constructed at a cost of about one hundred thousand rupees each, this investment will give a return of hundreds of millions of rupees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->In a system of small-scale ponds and dams, any surplus water in the canals leading to the fields can be rechannelled back to a main water source to avoid wastage. Water will only be carried a little distance in a small-scale canal system, so most of the time the surrounding fields will be properly irrigated. Sometimes however, as in the rainy season, surplus water will be created which should be rechannelled back to the water source or used further downstream. Such a system will also help check flooding in the rainy season and avoid damage to the small-scale dams constructed along the rivers. Farmers should take care that they do not use excessive non-organic fertilizers, because the chemicals will pollute the water system and have a harmful effect on humans, animals, fish, plants and the environment. Organic fertilizers are preferable to non-organic fertilizers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->What is the method to irrigate a rain-shadow region? When the rain clouds move from the sea and strike high mountains on the land there is rain. The part of the mountain range which faces the sea gets ample rain, whereas the region on the other side of the range facing inland gets little rain. The region which gets ample rain is the rain-front area, while the region which gets little rain is the rain-shadow area. The entire Telengana region is a rain-shadow area, and so is the Pune region of Maharashtra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->How can the Pune region be irrigated? There are two main methods. One is to pump water up the coastal side of the mountain range so that it can run down the inland rivers, and the other is to dig a tunnel through the mountains from the rain-front area to the rain-shadow area. The second method of irrigation is far cheaper. A well constructed tunnel should last about 150 years.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..35"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Rivers<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->There are three types of rivers &ndash; ice fed, rain fed and subterranean fed. Ice fed rivers cause flooding when there is an increase in the temperature, whereas rain fed and subterranean fed rivers only cause seasonal flooding when there is heavy rain. However, an increase in the temperature can dry them up.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Are the rivers in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h perennial or seasonal? Are they ice fed or rain fed, or do they get water from subterranean sources due to the high level of the artesian water? Many rain fed rivers are only supplied with water in the rainy season and not in other seasons. The rivers in central Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h are rain fed but they are also supplied with artesian water. We should not depend only on rain fed rivers, because while they may accumulate water in the rainy season, in other seasons they may dry up. And even if rain fed rivers are also fed by subterranean sources which supply water throughout the year, there should still be every effort to conserve the surface water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..38"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->There are four categories of rivers &ndash; small rivulets, rivulets, rivers and big rivers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->Rivers also have three stages &ndash; the hill, plain and delta stages. Some rivers, however, do not have their delta stage in the ocean because they expire before reaching the sea. Take the example of the topography of Mithila and Magadh. In Mithila in the rainy season, sufficient water passes through rivers such as the Bagmati, Gandak and Koshi. The hill stage of these rivers is in Nepal, the plain stage is in Mithila, and the delta stage is in Bengal. The plains of Mithila contain very soft soil, which is why these rivers always change their course. No rivers have their delta stage in Mithila. To tame these rivers, the cooperation of Nepal and Bengal is required.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->In Magadh, unlike Mithila, the hill and delta stages of the rivers are in Magadh, except for the Suvarnareka, which flows just on the border line between southern Magadh and northern Chattisgarh. The Koel River should be tamed through cooperation between Magadh and Kaoshal. In fact, Magadh and Kaoshal share many common problems.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->In controlling or taming rivers, powerful boards of experts should be established which contain representatives of all three stages. This will ensure the successful implementation of river projects. Under international law no country should be allowed to use water according to its own wish. The hill stage must consult with the plain stage and the plain stage must consult with the delta stage. Nepal, for example, must consult with the plain and delta stages of its rivers which flow through India. If there is want of cooperation among the three, the river water coming from the hills or blocked at the delta may submerge a large area of plain land. Magadh is in a relatively convenient position as both the hill and plain stages of its rivers are in Magadh.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..42"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Afforestation<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->The banks of all water systems should be covered by dense forests. The science behind this is that the roots of the trees retain water. When the water-table subsides, the roots of the trees slowly release water. Hence, a pond surrounded by trees will never run dry. The foliage of the trees also minimizes evaporation. Besides this, the leaves of the trees have very small pores which attract clouds, so the trees help to increase the rainfall. Only one hundred years ago there were large rain forests in Ra&#x301;r&#x301;h, and at that time in the Manbhum district the rainfall was seventy to eighty inches per year. Now it is hardly forty to forty-five inches.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->A scientific programme of afforestation should include two aspects. In the first phase fast growing trees should be planted. Trees which grow to their full height in six months to two years and provide dense green cover should be selected. In the second phase, trees which take longer to grow but also provide dense green cover should be planted. This approach will quickly restore the ecological balance of a region.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->Afforestation must be carried out both intensively and extensively. The best approach is to plant both fast growing and slow growing trees together. Planting only slow growing trees is uneconomic because we will have to wait thirty, fifty, seventy or one hundred years to get the desired result. And planting only fast growing trees will not provide any long term benefits. So both intensive and extensive afforestation should be done immediately. After reaching maturity, the trees can be selectively cut and sold.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..46"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->Afforestation should be carried out on the banks of ponds, canals, dams, lakes, rivers and reservoirs. For example, babula [Acasia arabica Willd.] or kheyer [Acasia catechu Willd.] should be planted. In between these trees we can plant bukphul [Sesbania grandiflora Pers.], and in between these, Indian rosewood. The reason for this is that bukphul grows very fast and within five years it will be a tall tree, but babula takes a little longer to grow. Indian rosewood grows very slowly but it lives a long time. Thus, first bukphul will grow fast and attract rain which will help the other trees to grow. When it has fully matured after five or seven years it can be cut, and by this stage we will have a dense forest of Indian rosewood trees.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->These trees are very useful in other respects also. For example, bukphul leaves increase the milk supply in cows, while thread can be produced from the leaves and stem. Indian rosewood trees increase the rainfall and hold water in their roots. The flowers provide a plentiful supply of honey, the leaves can be used to make plates, the sap is used to produce gum for the incense industry, and the tree may be used in sericulture to produce tasar silk. The seeds are also edible and are taken by poor people, while the honey has medicinal use and economic value, so it can earn foreign exchange as an export commodity. Piyasal [Pterocarpus marsupium Roxb.] can also be planted in between Indian rosewood trees if need be. In this way, step by step, we have to proceed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Scientific crop management is also an essential aspect of water conservation. For example, a field of barley requires less water to grow than a field of vegetables. If there are two fields side by side, one of barley and the other of vegetables, the vegetable crop will consume only seventy-five percent of the water normally used to irrigate it. If the other twenty-five percent is allowed to run off to the barley crop, that water will be sufficient to irrigate the barley. The barley crop will not require any special irrigation facilities.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Fruit trees can store a large amount of water in their roots, so they should be planted along river banks and near paddy fields to help conserve water. After the paddy harvest at A&#x301;nanda Nagar, for example, the water flows into the two rivulets &ndash; the Alkananda and the Paragati &ndash; leaving the fields dry. After a short time the rivulets also dry up as their supply of seepage water from the fields stops. To solve this problem, fruit trees should be planted beside the rivulets. The water stored in the roots of the fruit trees will keep the soil moist and fertile. Care should be taken so that the branches of the fruit trees do not block the sunlight from the crops. If this system is followed, when the paddy is cut and the fields are drained of water, the rivulets will remain flowing. If fruit trees are planted along the banks of a river, it will always retain water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->Foolish human beings, however, have cut down all the trees along the river banks, so now many rivers have dried up. Who would believe that 150 years ago large boats used to travel along the Mayuraksi Rriver in Bengal? Today it is a small river, and in the rainy season small boats only ply along it. The forests around the river have all gone. The forest trees contain water in their root systems and release it in a controlled way which enables the rivers to flow regularly. Now you understand the utility of the forests. Adjacent to the Mayuraksi River is the Katasu village where I once saw a fossilized mast of a ship. This proves that at one time large ships used to travel along the river. I have also seen the same thing along the Damodar River. Due to deforestation, these rivers are now drying up, and consequently there is less rainfall.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->The inner spirit of our water conservation programme is that the amount of existing surface water should be immediately doubled. But it is preferable if it is increased tenfold. This can best be done by a decentralized approach to water management which increases the depth, the area, or both, of water storage systems. The first step is to increase the depth of those ponds, tanks, dams, lakes, rivers and reservoirs which are already being used for storing water. The second step is to increase the area of these storage facilities, while the third step is to increase the plantations around them. How can these plantations be increased by a factor of ten? By increasing the number of rows of plants around each water storage system five times, and by reducing the distance between each plant by half. In addition to this, many new small-scale ponds, tanks, dams, lakes and reservoirs should also be constructed. As a general rule, surface water should always be utilized in preference to subterranean water.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="6..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->You must prepare yourselves. The sphere of knowledge, the span of knowledge and the expansion of knowledge starts with the self. Humanity is waiting for you. You know what you are and what the world expects from you. You have to solve all the problems in the world today. You should prepare detailed plans and programmes and act accordingly. You must be the vanguard.<!-- /block --></p>
