<a name="1..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Parama Purus&#x301;a [Supreme Consciousness] is my Father, Parama&#x301; Prakrti [Supreme Operative Principle] is my Mother, and the universe is my homeland. We are all citizens of this universe. The universe is the thought projection of the Macrocosmic Mind, and it is in the extroversial and introversial phases of the Cosmic imaginative flow that the creation, preservation and destruction of all entities continues.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->When an individual imagines an object, then that person alone, and no one else, is the owner of the object. For example, when an imaginary human being roams about in an imaginary green field, the imaginer, and not the imaginary person, is the owner of the field. The universe is the thought projection of Brahma [the Supreme Entity], so the ownership of the universe lies with the Supreme Entity, and not with His<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> imagined beings.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->None of the movable or immovable property of this universe belongs to any particular individual; everything is the common patrimony of all, and the Father of all is Brahma. All living beings can enjoy their rightful share of this property, like members of a joint family in the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> system. As members of a joint family, human beings should safeguard this common property in a befitting manner and utilize it properly. They should also make proper arrangements so that everyone can enjoy it with equal rights, ensuring that all have the minimum requirements of life to enable them to live in a healthy body with a sound mind.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->We must not forget, even for a single moment, that the entire animate world is a vast joint family. Nature has not assigned any portion of this property to any particular individual. Private ownership has been created by selfish opportunists, as the loopholes in this system provide them with ample scope for self-aggrandizement through exploitation. When the entire wealth of the universe is the common patrimony of all living beings, can the system in which some roll in luxury, while others, deprived of a morsel of food, shrivel up and starve to death bit by bit, be said to have the support of dharma?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->In a joint family every member is provided with adequate food, clothing, education and medical treatment, and amenities, as per their individual needs, according to the financial capacity of the entire family. If, however, any member of the family appropriates more grains, clothes, books or medicines than he or she requires, will that person not be the cause of distress to other members of the family? In such circumstances his or her actions will be certainly against dharma &ndash; certainly antisocial.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Similarly, the capitalists of this modern world are anti-dharma, or antisocial, creatures. To accumulate massive wealth, they reduce others to skin and bones gnawed by hunger and force them to die of starvation; to dazzle people with the glamour of their garments, they compel others to wear rags; and to increase their own vital strength, they suck dry the vital juice of others.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->A member of a joint family cannot be called a social being if he or she does not possess the sentiment of oneness with the other members, or if he or she does not want to accept the lofty ideal of joint rights and the principle of rationality. According to true spiritual ideology the system of private ownership cannot be accepted as absolute and final, and hence capitalism cannot be supported either.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->2<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Considering the collective interests of all living beings, it is essential that capitalism be eradicated. But, what should be the proper method to achieve this end?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->It cannot be denied that violence gives rise to violence. Then again, nothing can ensure that the application of force without violence, with the intention of rectification, will necessarily bring good results. So what should be done under such circumstances?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Nothing would be better, if it were possible, than the eradication of capitalism by friendly persuasion and humanistic appeals. In that case the peace of the greater human family would not be much disturbed. But can it be guaranteed that everyone will respond to this approach? Some people may say that a day will come when, as a result of repeatedly listening to such appeals and gradually imbibing them over a long time, as well as through proper mental and spiritual education, good sense will prevail among the exploiters. This argument is very pleasant to hear. Such attempts are not reprehensible. But is it practicable to wait indefinitely for good sense to prevail among the exploiters? By then the exploited mass will have given up the ghost!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Though the humanistic approach works in some cases, in most instances it does not produce any result; and even where it does work, it takes a very long time. So, wherever necessary, capitalism must be forced to abandon its ferocious hunger by taking strong measures. But it cannot be assumed that even these measures will be completely successful, because those who appear to be under control due to fear of the law will adopt other ways to fulfil their desires. Black marketing, adulteration, etc., cannot be totally eradicated by threats or by arousing fear of the law.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->Thus, stronger measures will have to be taken; that is, tremendous circumstantial pressure will have to be created. To create this sort of circumstantial pressure, the application of force is absolutely necessary. Those who believe that the non-application of force alone is ahim&#x301;sa&#x301; [not to hurt anyone] are bound to fail. No problem in this world can be solved by adopting this kind of ahim&#x301;sa&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..16"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->3<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->I cannot support the attitude of those who denounce capitalism at every opportunity, because this allows capitalists to become alert and invent more scientific and devious ways to exploit the people. Those who lack a constructive ideology will never be capable of destroying capitalism, even if they speak sweet words, use threats, or create circumstantial pressure.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..18"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->4<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->The ambition to become rich by exploiting others is a type of psychic disease. In fact, if the infinite longing of the human mind does not find the proper path leading to psychic and spiritual fulfilment, it becomes engaged in accumulating excessive physical wealth by depriving others. If any member of a joint family appropriates food from the family food store by using physical or intellectual force, he or she becomes the cause of misery to others. Similarly, when capitalists declare, &ldquo;We have amassed wealth by our talent and labour. If others have the capacity and diligence, let them also do the same; nobody prevents them&rdquo;, they do not care to realize that the volume of commodities on the earth is limited, whereas the requirement is common to all. Excessive individual affluence, in most cases, deprives others of the minimum requirements of life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The incapability to recognize the requirements of others because of insensitiveness is a psychic disease. Those afflicted with this disease are also members of the vast human family; they are also our brothers and sisters. So, either by making humanitarian appeals or by creating circumstantial pressure, arrangements will have to be made to cure them of their ailment. It would be a great sin even to think of their destruction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..21"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->5<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->Even if extreme steps, such as threats and circumstantial pressure, are taken, can it be said that the nature of those with vested interests is going to be reformed? Rather, they will always search for suitable opportunities to launch a counter-revolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->To protect the common people from the clutches of exploitation, as an initial measure we will have to create circumstantial pressure, but to reform the character of these ailing people, long-term arrangements will also have to be made for their psychic and spiritual education. Human society is ready to wait indefinitely to reform their character by psychic and spiritual methods, because by then their fangs will have been broken, and by creating circumstantial pressure, their capacity for exploitation will have been snatched away.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..24"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=24 type=paragraph -->6<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Another excellent example of vested interest is the caste system! Once a section of people established its supremacy over others through the power of superior knowledge and intellect. Even today the descendants of that section of people want their social supremacy and opportunities for exploitation to continue unchallenged.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..26"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->7<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->We cannot neglect even a single living being in this creation, nor can we ignore the smallest part of the universe. So, as far as possible, the industrial system should be organized according to the principle of decentralization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..28"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=28 type=paragraph -->Industrial development in one part of the world cannot satisfactorily eradicate poverty or unemployment in another part. Therefore, in the industrial system, it is necessary to build up numerous self-sufficient units, at least for those industrial and agricultural commodities which are considered to be essential for maintaining life. Otherwise people will have to suffer tremendous hardships during war and other abnormal circumstances. With the development of transportation and communication, the size of these units can be expanded.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..29"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->8<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..30"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=30 type=paragraph -->In the field of industry, the necessity of both small-scale and large-scale industries will have to be accepted. For example, the requisite amount of yarn needed to meet the demand for cloth in a self-sufficient unit may be produced by many big yarn mills. Here the production of yarn can be treated as a large-scale industry, and with the help of this industry, numerous small-scale industries will prosper. Viable weavers&#146; cooperatives can be established, centred on each yarn mill. Weavers will then get the opportunity to weave cloth while remaining in their own homes. They will no longer be required to leave their homes at the call of a distant large-scale industry. At the same time the weaving industry will not suffer even during times of war, because everything will be within easy reach.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->The acceptance of both small-scale and large-scale industries does not mean that old machinery is to be encouraged. With the development of science, advanced machinery will have to be utilized. The attempt to stop the use of sugar by advertising the benefits of molasses, or to campaign against mill-made cloth by extolling the virtues of khadi [hand-spun cloth], is senseless. As long as advanced mechanization and scientific decentralization have not been adopted, molasses, hand-spun cloth and similar enterprises should be encouraged, and their importance to the rural economy must be accepted.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..32"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Where industrialization is intended to plunder profits, obviously the policy of decentralization is not likely to be supported. But where industrialization is intended to meet the requirements of society, there can be no objection to the policy of decentralization.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..33"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->9<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->In fact, the use of advanced scientific technology means rapid mechanization. Conservative people vociferously criticize this mechanization. Actually, such mechanization within a capitalistic structure inevitably brings more misery, in the form of unemployment, to the common people. That is why conservative people oppose it.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Those who want to promote public welfare without antagonizing capitalism will have to oppose mechanization. This is because when the productive capacity of machinery is doubled, the required human labour is decreased by half, so the capitalists retrench large numbers of workers from their factories. A few optimists may say, &ldquo;Under circumstantial pressure other ways will be found to employ these surplus labourers in different jobs, and the very effort to find these alternatives will accelerate scientific advancement, so the ultimate result of mechanization under capitalism is, in fact, good.&rdquo; This view, though not useless, has no practical value, because it is not possible to arrange new jobs for retrenched workers as quickly as they become surplus labourers due to rapid mechanization. Surplus labourers are ruined, bit by bit, due to poverty and hunger. A few among them try to keep body and soul together by resorting to petty theft, armed robbery, profligacy and other sorts of antisocial activities, but this situation is certainly not desirable.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->In a collective economic system there is no scope for such an unhealthy situation; in this system mechanization will lead to less labour and more prosperity. With the double increase in the productivity of machines, the working hours of labourers will be reduced by half. Of course, the reduction in working hours will have to be determined keeping in view the demand for commodities and the availability of labour.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->In a collective economic system the benevolent use of science will bring about human welfare. It is possible that as a result of mechanization no one will be required to work for more than five minutes a week. Not always being preoccupied with the problems of acquiring food, clothing, etc., people&#146;s psychic and spiritual potentialities will no longer be wasted. They will be able to devote ample time to such activities as sports, literary pursuits and spiritual practices.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..38"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=38 type=paragraph -->10<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->The necessity of the trade union movement, to safeguard the interests of workers, cannot be denied. To guide this movement along the proper path, appropriate steps must be taken.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Generally it is observed that trade union leaders do nothing to make workers conscious of their responsibilities in comparison to the extent to which they try to create in workers an awareness of their rights and demands. The best way to rectify this situation is to clearly accept the right of workers to participate in the management of industrial, trade and commercial enterprises. In this regard idealistic sermons or moral preaching will not bring positive results.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Another great defect in the trade union movement is that its leadership does not always remain in the hands of true manual labourers or other workers. Political leaders with party interests tend to dominate trade unions. Their primary objective is to promote the selfish interests of the party, not the welfare of the workers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..42"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->11<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..43"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=43 type=paragraph -->Industry, agriculture, trade and commerce &ndash; almost everything &ndash; needs to be managed, as far as possible, through cooperative organizations. For this, special facilities will have to be provided to cooperative organizations whenever necessary. Adequate safeguards will have to be arranged, and slowly private ownership, or the system of individual management, will have to be eradicated from specific areas of agriculture, industry, trade and commerce.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->Only those enterprises which are difficult to manage on a cooperative basis because they are either too small, or simultaneously small and complex, can be left to individual management. Similarly, the responsibility for those enterprises which cannot be conveniently managed on a cooperative basis because they are either too large, or simultaneously large and complex, can be undertaken by the immediate state government (in the case of a federation), or by the local body (in the absence of a federation).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..45"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=45 type=paragraph -->It is desirable that the management of industrial, agricultural, trade and commercial enterprises not be in the hands of the central government or the world government (after the establishment of the world government). If it is, the common people will not get the direct or even the indirect opportunity to participate in the management of these enterprises. In such cases capitalists, opportunists or self-seeking politicians can easily take control of them and misappropriate public wealth.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..46"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=46 type=paragraph -->12<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..47"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=47 type=paragraph -->In all human actions the tender touch of humanity should be present. Those with the tendency to not deprive others cannot, on the grounds of justice and equity, accept the principle of private ownership. The economic structures in the world today, however, are not based on human rights. In order to recognize human rights, one will have to be ready for revolutionary changes, and one will also have to welcome them. The socialization of landed property, industry, trade and commerce &ndash; almost everything &ndash; is the major objective of this revolution.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..48"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=48 type=paragraph -->Here, in this context, I deliberately have not used the term &ldquo;nationalization&rdquo;. Just as the slogans, &ldquo;Landlords are not the owners of the land&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Industrialists are not the owners of the factories&rdquo; are incorrect, similarly the slogans, &ldquo;Land belongs to those who push the plough&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Factories belong to those who wield the hammer&rdquo; are also incorrect. The people in general are the real owners of all the wealth in this world, and that is why I have used the term &ldquo;socialization&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..49"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=49 type=paragraph -->Among those who support the elimination of private ownership, some consider that adequate compensation should be paid before taking over landed properties, factories and commercial enterprises. Others consider that, until now, the capitalist owners of such enterprises have perpetuated immense exploitation, so the question of compensation cannot arise. If the payment of compensation continues for a long time, it is very true that the rapid welfare of the people will not be possible. Hence, the proposal to purchase the properties of capitalists cannot be supported.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..50"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=50 type=paragraph -->It is also true that the owners of such properties are not always physically fit or financially well off. The owner of a property may be a helpless widow or an extremely old invalid. In such cases, certainly, a pension should be arranged for them. Of course, if the owner of a property happens to be a minor, then, definitely, a stipend has to be arranged for his or her upbringing and education! Even in the case where the owner is a strong and healthy man, if there is no other means of livelihood, suitable opportunities will have to be made for his income, according to his qualifications and capacities. This is the proper humanistic arrangement.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..51"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->13<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..52"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=52 type=paragraph -->Those who shudder at the sight of various social vices and lament, &ldquo;Everything is lost; righteousness is gone; morality has vanished&#8230;&rdquo; should realize that among all the causes behind this so-called all-round degeneration, social injustice is the principal one.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..53"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=53 type=paragraph -->Because of injustices against women with respect to their social rights and because women are economically crippled, a section of women is compelled to take to prostitution. Although there are many causes of this profession, these are the main two.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Ananda Marga recognizes that women are as dignified human beings as men. Ananda Marga, in addition, wants to encourage women to be economically independent of men. The system in which characterless men swagger about in society while fallen women are denied proper opportunities despite their sincere desire to lead an honest life, can never be supported by justice. Women who desire to lead an honest life must be given a respectable place in society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..55"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->14<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->The dowry system is yet another glaring example of social injustice. In my book Human Society [Part 1], I have already mentioned that the dowry system has two major causes: the first is economic, and the second is the numerical disparity between women and men. With the decreasing economic dependence of women on men, the inequity of the dowry system will cease to exist. But to expedite this process, it is essential to propagate high ideals among young men and women. Our sons and daughters are not commodities like rice, pulse, salt, oil or cattle that they can be haggled over in the marketplace.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..57"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=57 type=paragraph -->15<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..58"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=58 type=paragraph -->The cry, &ldquo;Peace! Peace!&rdquo; has become a craze in the world today. Can anything be achieved by such cries? There is no way to establish peace except to fight against the very factors which disturb peace. Even in the personal life of every human being, there is a constant fight between the benevolent and the malevolent intellect, or between vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301;. At times vidya&#x301; triumphs, while at other times avidya&#x301; wins. In social life, too, this fight between vidya&#x301; and avidya&#x301; continues.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->Vidya&#x301; has to fight avidya&#x301;, and in this fight wherever and as long as vidya&#x301; remains triumphant, there is a special type of peace which may be called sa&#x301;ttvikii sha&#x301;nti [sentient peace]. Similarly, wherever and as long as avidya&#x301; remains victorious in this fight, there, also, a special type of peace prevails which may be called ta&#x301;masikii sha&#x301;nti [static peace]. Thus we find that peace is actually a relative factor.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->Absolute or permanent peace cannot occur in collective life because the created universe, which is embedded in the process of sain&#x32D;cara [extroversion] and pratisain&#x32D;cara [introversion] is, in fact, dominated first by Avidya&#x301; [extroversial force], and then by Vidya&#x301; [introversial force], respectively.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn3"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn3">3</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> When the existence of the universe is rooted in the existence of these two, then permanent  peace (ta&#x301;masikii or sa&#x301;ttvikii as the case may be) in the universe would mean the cessation of the activities of either Vidya&#x301; or Avidya&#x301;, or both. This is why it has to be said that collective peace in the universe cannot occur except in the case of pralaya,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn4"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn4">4</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and the concept of pralaya is illogical. However in individual life human beings can certainly achieve absolute peace through sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; [spiritual practices]. From the worldly viewpoint I consider this state to be the pralaya of individual life.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->Where government servants are strong, static, antisocial individuals maintain a low profile.

No, that is not the dictum of human dharma.

But if the oppressors torture a human group, in that case no single individual, as the representative of the group, can pardon them, and actually that person has no right to do so. If the representative acts beyond his or her jurisdiction, that person will be denounced by the group he or she represents.

In some places it is more worthwhile than tribalism, communalism or provincialism, while in other places it is less worthwhile.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->Let us consider, for example, the case of a Portuguese nationalist. The mental object of a Muslim communalist is certainly larger than that of a Portuguese nationalist, because the former desires the welfare of a greater number of people than the latter. This is because the number of Muslims in the world is greater than the number of Portuguese. Judged from this perspective, I cannot denounce the sentiments of a Muslim communalist in comparison to a Portuguese nationalist. Similarly, it has to be accepted that the sentiments of a Rajput casteist are broader than those of a Portuguese nationalist, because the former desires the welfare of more people than the latter. Likewise, the feelings of an Andhrite provincialist will have to be considered broader than those of a Portuguese nationalist. If one supports provincialism with seventy-five million Bengalees, it must be accepted that these feelings are more expanded than the nationalism of most of the nations of the world.

Obstacles will have to be negotiated with an open mind, and the world government will have to be strengthened gradually, not suddenly. For example, to run the world government, two houses may be maintained for an indefinite period. The lower house will be composed of representatives from various parts [countries] of the world, elected on the basis of population. The members of the upper house will be elected country-wise. This will provide opportunities to those countries which cannot send even a single representative to the lower house due to their small population, because they will be able to express their opinions before the people of the world by sending their representatives to the upper house. The upper house will not adopt any bill unless it has been passed by the lower house, but the upper house will reserve the right to reject the decisions of the lower house.<!-- /block --></p>

In reply I will say, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The greatest social welfare for the human race will be accomplished if those who aspire to establish the world government or A&#x301;nanda Pariva&#x301;ra engage themselves only in constructive activities and selfless service, instead of wasting their vital energy in the vortex of politics, or in political conflicts.

<a name="1..141"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=141 type=paragraph -->As a system of government, democracy cannot be accepted as the highest and best. Among all the systems human beings have been able to devise so far, democracy can be considered to be the best of a bad lot. If human beings can devise a better system in future, it will be proper to accept it wholeheartedly. Many defects in democracy have been discovered by human beings who have already started rectifying them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..142"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=142 type=paragraph -->In a democratic system securing the highest number of votes is proof of a person&#146;s eligibility. However this eligibility is not adequately examined in all cases. In my opinion the popularity of a candidate securing the highest number of votes needs to be tested again if he or she polls less than half the total number of votes cast. In this test arrangements will have to be made so that people can vote either for or against the candidate. If the candidate polls more favourable votes, only then will he or she be declared elected.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..143"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=143 type=paragraph -->No candidate should be declared elected without a contest. Rich and influential people can compel other candidates, by financial inducements or intimidation, to withdraw their nomination papers. So in cases where it is found that there is only one candidate, the popularity of the candidate will have to be tested. If the candidate fails in this test, the candidate and all those who withdrew their nomination papers will forfeit the right to contest the subsequent by-election for that constituency. This means that they will have to wait until the next election.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..144"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=144 type=paragraph -->Although the system of seat reservation<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn11"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn11">11</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> is against democratic principles, temporary arrangements for seat reservation, if desired, may be permitted for backward communities.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn12"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn12">12</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  But generally it is found that among the representatives of backward communities, the number of competent persons is very few. Hence the right to contest reserved seats should not be limited to those belonging to a particular community. At the time of the primary election of the candidates for the reserved seat, however, only those belonging to the community for which the seat has been reserved will enjoy the right to vote. That is, two people will be nominated for the one seat in the primary election. Later, either of the two will be finally elected by the vote of the general public. If, in the primary election, only one candidate is nominated &ndash; that is, there is no other contestant &ndash; in that case his or her popularity must be tested before the general public. Only if a backward or minority community clearly demands seat reservation will it be adopted, otherwise not.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..145"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=145 type=paragraph -->A candidate must declare his or her policies in black and white. After an election, if it is found that a candidate is acting against his or her declared policies and this is proved to be the case in court, his or her election will be cancelled.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..146"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=146 type=paragraph -->The slogan &ldquo;adult franchise&rdquo; is, of course, very pleasant to hear, but the fact that voters without political consciousness weaken the governmental machinery cannot be denied. In the interests of the general public, it is desirable that uneducated and less-educated people do not have the right to vote.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..147"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=147 type=paragraph -->Democracy is a mockery in a country of uneducated people. In such a country cunning, fraudulent persons very easily secure or purchase the votes of illiterate people. Moreover, the general public in such a country is easily misled by the propagation of casteism or communalism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..148"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=148 type=paragraph -->The success of democracy depends upon educated, sensible voters. Hence, in a democratic country, the spread of education is of the highest priority. For the convenience of the general public, the educational system must be free of cost. No overbearing govern- ment pressure should be exerted on the educational system, otherwise the party in power will continue to propagate its ideas through the medium of education. Frequent changes in the government will also result in frequent changes in the educational system, consequently the entire system of education will be jeopardized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..149"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=149 type=paragraph -->No ism except universalism can be allowed in the educational system. The thirst for knowledge will have to be awakened among students, and reverence, devotion, orderliness and discipline will have to be taught as well. Along with this, a scientific outlook will have to be inculcated. If veneration for science is awakened, superstition will not find any room in the minds of students, nor will high-sounding isms bewilder them. Students will easily acquire the qualities to become sadvipras later in life.<!-- /block --></p>

In every age a particular varn&#x301;a<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn14"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn14">14</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn -->  [social class] emerges, both as ruler and as exploiter.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn15"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn15">15</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..153"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=153 type=paragraph -->The universe and the society belong to all. Every dust particle of the universe is the common patrimony of each and every one of us, so it is not at all proper to allow a particular social class to perpetuate its rule.

<a name="1..154"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=154 type=paragraph -->Society belongs to all, but its leadership will be in the hands of sadvipras. The responsibility for leading society cannot be left in the hands of the ks&#x301;atriyas, because they will try to enforce ks&#x301;atriya rule. They will exploit the non-ks&#x301;atriyas and chew the bones and marrow of the weak. Nor can the responsibility for leading society be left in the hands of the vipras, because they will try to establish vipra rule. They will exploit the non-vipras and chew the bones and marrow of the non-intellectuals. Likewise, the responsibility for leading society cannot be left in the hands of the vaeshyas, because they will try to impose vaeshya rule. They will exploit the non-vaeshyas and chew the bones and marrow of the toiling mass. Shu&#x301;dras cannot undertake the leadership of society. Hence the victory mark<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.1.fn16"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#1.fn16">16</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> of the successful shu&#x301;dra revolution indeed embellishes the forehead of the ks&#x301;atriyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..155"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=155 type=paragraph -->The responsibility for leading society can only be entrusted to the sadvipras because they are well established in Yama and Niyama &ndash; they are imbued with Cosmic ideation.

But if sadvipras control the nucleus of society, these social classes may attain some degree of prominence in social life, but they will never be able to become the absolute rulers.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="1..156"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=156 type=paragraph -->Sadvipras will never have any rest. They will have to continue fighting tirelessly. This fight is the life of living beings. In the absence of this fight, the creation will cease to exist.

If the phase of contraction is made more stringent by the application of force, a forward galloping jump occurs in the following phase of expansion. Evolution which takes place as a result of this forward galloping jump is properly called viplava [revolution].

<p class=footnotes_title>Footnotes</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn1"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn1">1</a></b>)  Brahma is the composite of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti, and is, therefore, usually spoken of philosophically in neuter gender. Here the author uses &ldquo;His&rdquo; (and in the following paragraph, &ldquo;Father&rdquo;) for Brahma to emphasize the paternal relationship that exists between Supreme Consciousness and living beings. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn2"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn2">2</a></b>)  In the Da&#x301;yabha&#x301;ga system the heirs&#146; right of inheritance is subject to the discretion of the father. For a more detailed discussion of the author&#146;s views on inheritance, see the chapter &ldquo;Ideal System of Inheritance&rdquo;, Carya&#x301;carya Part 1, 1956. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn3"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn3">3</a></b>)  For a more detailed discussion of the author&#146;s cosmological system, see Idea and Ideology, 1959. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn4"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn4">4</a></b>)  Philosophically, pralaya means annihilation. In individual life pralaya  refers to spiritual emancipation, not physical death. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn5"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn5">5</a></b>)  Dhrupada is the earliest and purest form of classical music in northern India. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn6"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn6">6</a></b>)   Kheyal is a later blended form of classical northern Indian music. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn7"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn7">7</a></b>)   These are various styles of Indian music from Bengal. Kiirtana (which originated in Bengal) is devotional chanting; ba&#x301;ul is folk music sung in a particular devotional style; bha&#x301;t&#x301;iya&#x301;lii is folk music sung by boatmen, usually while rowing on rivers; and ja&#x301;rii and darbeshi are localized styles of folk music. &ndash;Trans</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn8"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn8">8</a></b>)  In some countries, such as India, party tickets, authorizing approved candidates to contest from particular constituencies, are issued by political parties prior to elections. The &ldquo;lamppost&rdquo; refers to an undeserving candidate favoured by the party. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn9"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn9">9</a></b>)  Here the author is criticizing the aspirations of a section of communists. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn10"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn10">10</a></b>)  Yama and Niyama are the cardinal principles of human morality. See A Guide to Human Conduct, 1957, by the author. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn11"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn11">11</a></b>)  Seat reservation is the practice whereby parliamentary seats (and also administrative posts) are reserved for particular sections of society, usually less-advanced communities or minorities. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn12"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn12">12</a></b>)   &ldquo;Backward communities&rdquo; refers to those communities which have not had access to social services and education. Generally only the members of such communities have the right to contest reserved seats. (Backward communities should receive preferential treatment from the government until poverty has been eliminated.) &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn13"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn13">13</a></b>)  Shu&#x301;dra revolution occurs when the warriors and intellectuals are reduced to the level of manual labourers as a result of exploitation during the Vaeshya Age. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn14"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn14">14</a></b>)   The Sanskrit word varn&#x301;a means &ldquo;colour&rdquo;. Here it refers to the predominant psychic colour, or psychic characteristics, of each of the four social classes in the social cycle. (The psychic colour of the shu&#x301;dras is said to be black; the ks&#x301;atriyas, red; the vipras, white; and the vaeshyas, yellow.) &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn15"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn15">15</a></b>)   This applies to the ks&#x301;atriyas, vipras and vaeshyas. The shu&#x301;dra varn&#x301;a neither rules nor exploits the other social classes. &ndash;Trans.</p>
<p class="Para_Footnote"><a name="1.fn16"></a>(<b><a href="#Ref.1.fn16">16</a></b>)  &ldquo;Victory mark&rdquo; refers to the Indian custom of smearing a special mark, usually made with the right thumb after it has been dipped in sandal paste, on the forehead of those celebrating victory. &ndash;Trans.</p>

<a name="2..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->All A&#x301;stika or theistic Indian philosophies unanimously believe that A&#x301;tman or unit consciousness is a continuous flow of Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na or knowledge. This is called Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;na in Pa&#x301;li. There is a continuous flow of Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na, or in other words Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na itself is a flow (Prava&#x301;ha). Every object in the universe has its own flow and wave or dynamic force. According to Yoga philosophy Parama&#x301;tman or Supreme Consciousness is an infinite flow of Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->Lord Buddha did not use the word A&#x301;tman, hence there was a difference of opinion among the Bhikksus or Buddhist monks after his death. Three conferences were held to compile the Tripitaka or Buddhist scriptures and as a result the Tripita&#x301;ka was compiled in three parts in Pa&#x301;li &ndash; Vinaya Pita&#x301;ka or the practical side, Suttapitaka or the theoretical side and Abhidhamma Pitaka or the philosophical side.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->All of these parts combined together were known as the Tripitaka and were called the Buddhist scriptures. The Bhikhus who patronized or supported the Sannya&#x301;sa Ma&#x301;rga or the path of renunciation were not prepared to accept anything more than what was laid down in the Tripitaka, and hence they were called Sthavira&#x301;va&#x301;dii or Therava&#x301;dii, the southern school of Buddhism. Those who were influenced by the Nya&#x301;ya school of philosophy were called Maha&#x301;sa&#x301;m&#x301;ghika or the northern school of Buddhism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->The word Pa&#x301;li originated from Pallii which means &ldquo;rural&rdquo;, rustic or unsophisticated. As Bhagava&#x301;n Buddha preached in the language of common people, Hindu scholars called his language Bha&#x301;kha&#x301;. Pa&#x301;li was also known as Pa&#x301;li Bha&#x301;s&#x301;a. The common people could not follow Sam&#x301;skrta which was the language of scholars only.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Later on the Maha&#x301;sa&#x301;m&#x301;ghikas called themselves Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii and they called the Sthavirava&#x301;diis Hiinaya&#x301;nii. But the Hiinaya&#x301;niis called themselves Therava&#x301;dii. In India there was no state backing for Hiinaya&#x301;niis except at the time of the rulers Kaniska, and Vasiska, and hence the Hiinaya&#x301;na did not flourish. The Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;na had state backing so it naturally had a larger number of followers. The philosophy of the Hiinaya&#x301;niis was preached in Ceylon, Burma, Siam, Java and Borneo, etc., whereas the philosophy of the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;niis was propagated in India, Siberia, Japan Tibet, etc.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->There are four kinds of philosophical doctrines among the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;niis. The reason for this difference of opinion is A&#x301;tman and its object. Bhagava&#x301;n Buddha used the word &ldquo;Atta&#x301;&rdquo; in Pa&#x301;li for A&#x301;tman. The word Atta&#x301; is also used in place of &ldquo;Self&rdquo;. The Bhikkhus could not understand the sense in which Bhagava&#x301;n Buddha used the word Atta&#x301;.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->At the time of Buddha, Na&#x301;stika Va&#x301;da or non-belief in God was dominant. Mahars&#x301;i Ajita Keshakamballi was the scholar of the Na&#x301;stika&#x301; Va&#x301;da. Most of the books on Na&#x301;stikyava&#x301;da were written in incomprehensible language and so its propagation was not very widespread. Ajita Keshakambalii followed Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka who had a materialistic philosophy. The Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka school of philosophy believes in Caturbhu&#x301;ta or the four fundamental factors. This is also known as Deha&#x301;tmava&#x301;da, that is, the belief that the body is everything and that the soul is identified with the body. This philosophy accepts Caturbhu&#x301;ta, namely earth, water, fire and air or Ks&#x301;iti, ap, tejas and marut respectively. According to Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka, Caetanya or Conscious came into existence by the combination of the four bhu&#x301;tas in the same way as the mixing of lime and catechu produces a red colour. According to Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka, Pain&#x32D;cabhu&#x301;ta or the fifth factor is formed in this way and does not actually exist. Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka philosophy does not believe in A&#x301;tman, Parama&#x301;tman and the Vedas and hence Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka was termed Na&#x301;stika, since those who do not believe in A&#x301;tman, Parama&#x301;tman or the Vedas are called Na&#x301;stika ([[a]]theist).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Pu&#x301;rva Mima&#x301;m&#x301;sa&#x301; school of philosophy also does not admit the existence of Parama&#x301;tman. Kapila, the propounder of the Sa&#x301;mkhya philosophy, accepted A&#x301;tman and the Vedas, but he did not believe in Parama&#x301;tman. The S&#x301;ad&#x301;adarshana or the six major school of theistic Indian Philosophy believe in the Vedas. The following are the six schools of philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->(1) Kapila Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya which accepts the existence of Prakrti and the Vedas but does not accept Parama&#x301;tman.<!-- /block --></p>

This philosophy is commonly known as Vedanta philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->The Buddhist philosophy believes in all the five bhu&#x301;tas or fundamental factors while Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka believes in Caturbhu&#x301;ta or four fundamental factors. Baoddha Darshana and Ca&#x301;rva&#x301;ka philosophy do come under the purview of S&#x301;ad&#x301;adarshana, and neither of them believe in the Vedas. They are atheistic philosophies.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->Why did India accept Buddhism? There are various reasons for this and the main ones are as follows. First, the scholars of that time never preached philosophy to the common people. They hated the language of the common people and called it Bha&#x301;kha&#x301;. Secondly, at that time there was no Tattvadarshii or eminent philosopher. Thirdly, the people in general were not ready to accept the pandits or scholars. Fourthly, the A&#x301;ca&#x301;ryas of that age, Shrii Sain&#x32D;jaya and Shrii Gaya&#x301; Kashyapa, could not convince Buddha. All these factors led to the wide propagation and acceptance of Buddhism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->Buddhism believes in rebirth and transmigration of souls, so the question arises: Who is reborn if there is no A&#x301;tman? This question became a point of controversy among the Bhikkus (monks) and later among the Maha&#x301;ya&#x301;nii scholars.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->Buddhism believes in Karmaphala or the reaction of actions. If karmaphala is accepted, the question arises: who performs karma or action and who gets the karmaphala? Therefore, the existence of A&#x301;tman has got to be recognized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->Towards the end of Buddha&#146;s life some of his disciples asked Buddha about the existence of God. They asked two questions: &ldquo;Does God exist?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is it a fact that God does not exist?&rdquo; In reply to both questions Buddha remained silent. As Buddha remained silent to both the questions some of his disciples interpreted this to mean that there is no God. Another section of disciples understood that God exists. Yet a third section came forward with the interpretation that there is God, but God is beyond the expression of &ldquo;Asti&rdquo; and &ldquo;na&#x301;sti&rdquo; or &ldquo;is&rdquo; and &ldquo;is not&rdquo;; that is, God&#146;s existence is inexplicable. Actually God is supramental.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..39"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=39 type=paragraph -->There are four sections in Buddhist philosophy &ndash; Pratyaks&#x301;a Va&#x301;hya Vastuva&#x301;da or Soutan&#x301;trika Darshana, Anumeya Va&#x301;hya-vastuva&#x301;da or Vaebha&#x301;s&#x301;ika Darshana, Sarvashu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da or Ma&#x301;dhyamika Darshana and Ks&#x301;an&#x301;ika Vijin&#x32D;a&#x301;nava&#x301;da or Baoddha Yoga&#x301;ca&#x301;ra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..40"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=40 type=paragraph -->Pratyaks&#x301;a Va&#x301;hyavastuva&#x301;da accepts the universe as infinite, that is, ana&#x301;dii and ananta or beginningless and infinite when Caetanya or Consciousness becomes a&#x301;layiibhu&#x301;ta or objectivated then it becomes jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na. The outer world is transitory but due to rapid movement (Sain&#x32D;cara or Prati-sain&#x32D;cara: extroversion or introversion) it appears to exist constantly. (According to Hindu philosophy Sain&#x32D;cara means &ldquo;to go away from Brahma&rdquo; and Pratisain&#x32D;cara means &ldquo;to come near to Brahma,&rdquo; that is Sain&#x32D;cara means the Vikars&#x301;anii Shakti of Brahma and Prati-sain&#x32D;cara means the A&#x301;kars&#x301;anii Shakti of Brahma).<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..41"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=41 type=paragraph -->Anumeyava&#x301;hya Vastuva&#x301;da accepts the waves of Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na as a permanent entity (satta&#x301;). There is the external world but the world will never be realized. When the waves of consciousness (Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na) come, the mind takes a form according to the Sam&#x301;ska&#x301;ras or potential reactions of past actions of the Citta or mental plate. Formations created in the mind are taken to be Satya or veracity. When Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na comes in contact with A&#x301;lambana or desideratum, Citta takes a form: it takes the outward a&#x301;lambana as the object realized.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..42"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=42 type=paragraph -->Sarvashu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da is also called Ma&#x301;dhyamika Darshana and was propounded by Shriina&#x301;ga&#x301;rjuna. He did not accept the pa&#x301;in&#x32D;cabhaotika world or the world of the five fundamental factors. The external world which we see is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; or illusion. This philosophy is similar to Sham&#x301;kara&#146;s philosophy, Brahma Satyam jagatmithya&#x301;. According to Sham&#x301;kara the universe has been created out of nothing and is like a dream, nothing more. Bha&#x301;va&#x301; i.e. something has been created out of Abha&#x301;va&#x301; i.e. nothing. This school of philosophy accepts only the present and ignores the past and the future. It also says that the universe will merge into nothing.<!-- /block --></p>

Even a&#x301;lambana is internal. Whatever is seen in this physical world is pratikriya&#x301; or the outer projection of internal a&#x301;lambana. A&#x301;tman is the collection of the &ldquo;I&rdquo; feelings. It is not a continuous flow but appears to be so on account of the quick succession of its creation and destruction.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..44"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=44 type=paragraph -->During the age of Bhagava&#x301;n Sham&#x301;kara&#x301;ca&#x301;rya there was no outstanding philosopher (tattvadras&#x301;t&#x301;a) among the Buddhists. Among different sections of the Buddhist schools of philosophy a serious dispute was going on. At that time Shrii Manadana Mishra was the only scholar who believed in Sarva Shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;da or complete nihilism and he was also a Kriya&#x301; Ka&#x301;n&#x301;dii or follower of the path of action.

He believed in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma or the non-qualified Supreme Entity only. His theories to some extent fall in line with the theories of the Baoddha Shun&#x301;yava&#x301;da or the Buddhist nihilists. He did not believe in the existence of jagat or the physical world. He accepted Gun&#x301;a&#x301;nvita Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;va&#x301;da or the doctrine of qualified illusion. Due to his influence Buddhist Tantra disappeared. In Hindu Tantra, gods and goddesses still remained. Even today the common people worship the goddesses of Buddhist Tantra like Ta&#x301;ra&#x301;, Manasa&#x301; (the goddess of snakes) Shiitala&#x301;, Ba&#x301;rahii etc. out of devotion.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..51"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=51 type=paragraph -->Shrii Sham&#x301;kara&#x301;ca&#x301;rya discussed the following subjects with Buddhist philosophers. The Shu&#x301;n&#x301;yava&#x301;diis said that the universe came out of nothing and will go into nothing, that everything is a dream. This was questioned by Sham&#x301;kara who said that even if the universe is nothing or a dreamland, there should be someone who witnessed the dream. The Shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;diis replied that there was no dreamer. The universe is an illusion just as a rope mistaken for a snake is an illusion. Sham&#x301;kara said, that could not be possible. The Shu&#x301;nyava&#x301;diis replied that this could only be understood by Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; while Sham&#x301;kara said that it was not possible to have a dream without a dreamer. If the universe is an illusion like mistaking a rope for a snake, there had to be something like a rope which could be mistaken for the universe. Without a rope it would be impossible to mistake it for a snake. Besides this there must be a person to make the mistake. Similarly, there must be someone to experience the illusion of the universe. This means that there must be some other entity to experience it. Ma&#x301;dhyamika said that nothing does not mean actually nothing (Shu&#x301;nya). What you call Brahma we call nothing. So the illusion of the universe is Brahma. That is,<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..54"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=54 type=paragraph -->Sham&#x301;kara replied that this means that the one who sees and the object which is seen are both illusion. Where there is no one to see, who will mistake the rope for snake? The Shunyavadiis could not give any explanation for this. The Kshanikavadiis &ndash; those who believed in the doctrine of transience &ndash; explanation of Sham&#x301;kara&#146;s questions was that the illusion is always Ks&#x301;anika or transient. Sham&#x301;kara&#146;s point was that he believed that Brahma was ana&#x301;di and ananta but that Ks&#x301;an&#x301;a comes in a moment and disappears the very next moment. Thus where does the Ks&#x301;anika entity come from? Something must exist between the span of creation and the span destruction. The Ks&#x301;anikava&#x301;diis replied that it is destroyed with the creation, but Sham&#x301;kara replied that this shows that there is no existence. The Ks&#x301;an&#x301;ikava&#x301;diis felt defeated but they still replied that existence was negligible. This was not a satisfactory explanation. The scholars of the Pratyaks&#x301;a Va&#x301;hyavastuva&#x301;da and Anumeya Va&#x301;hyavastuva&#x301;da argued for their philosophies but no one could withstand that questioning of Shamkaracarya, hence all the four sections of Buddhism were defeated by Shrii Sham&#x301;kara. On defeat they made friends with Shrii Sham&#x301;kara and accepted Ku&#x301;lakun&#x301;d&#x301;alinii Tattva or the practice of raising the serpentine power in human beings, and as a result Baoddha Yoga&#x301;ca&#x301;ra came into existence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..55"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=55 type=paragraph -->There are several defects in Sham&#x301;kara&#146;s philosophy. According to Sham&#x301;kara the universe is based on a fixed object by the illusion of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, which is called Brahma. There is an illusion of a snake for a rope. Now the question arises, who has the illusion of a snake? One who already knows about snakes. If there is an illusion of the universe for Brahma it means that the real universe is somewhere else. Thus the theory Brahma satyam jagatmithya is defective. This is a wrong interpretation given by Sham&#x301;kara. The Buddhists did not question it and hence it was accepted at the time.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..56"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=56 type=paragraph -->Sham&#x301;kara does not believe in jiiva and jagat. Thus the question arises, for what reason does the illusion exist?<!-- /block --></p>

Why should you lament for something non-existent?]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..59"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=59 type=paragraph -->The universe has not been created and hence there is no Sagun&#x301;a Brahma or Qualified Supreme Entity. Sham&#x301;kara believed only in Nirgun&#x301;a Brahma or the non-qualified Supreme entity. Sham&#x301;kara said that the universe is like a dream and the dreamer is also Brahma, as he did not believe in jiiva. When Brahma is Nirgun&#x301;a how could Sham&#x301;kara see, as seeing is a quality? But this was also forgotten by Shamkara.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..60"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=60 type=paragraph -->Again, according to Sham&#x301;kara&#146;s philosophy what is seen and experienced is all due to the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. This means Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is also an entity which Advaetavada or monism cannot accept.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..61"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=61 type=paragraph -->Sham&#x301;kara&#146;s philosophy believes in the necessity of sa&#x301;dhana&#x301;, but who will perform the Sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; when the existence of jiiva is not accepted?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..62"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=62 type=paragraph -->When Brahma is ana&#x301;di and ananta, why should Brahma be influenced by Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;? Secondly, when the universe is created by the influence of Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, how is it that Brahma remains Nirguna? Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; is a greater force than Brahma as it influences Brahma!<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..63"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=63 type=paragraph -->In addition, Sham&#x301;kara says that there is nothing exactly like Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; as it is an illusion. A person in the desert sees water, houses, and trees etc. from a distance but there is actually nothing. In the absence of Jin&#x32D;a&#x301;na the person experiences an illusion. When there is Vika&#x301;ra or distortion in Brahma, how can the universe be an illusion?<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..64"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=64 type=paragraph -->Sham&#x301;kara says where there is Brahma there is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;. Then the question arises, is Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; nothing? If there is no Ma&#x301;ya&#x301;, how can it influence Brahma? To overcome this Sham&#x301;kara says that it is not even nothing. It is inexplicable (anirvacaniiya). Again the question arises as to who created Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; if Brahma did not create it. Then Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; becomes Saguna Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..65"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=65 type=paragraph -->Sham&#x301;kara was able to defeat Buddhist philosophers only by a display of words. The Ma&#x301;ya&#x301; of Sham&#x301;kara is not the Prakrti of Ananda Marga.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..66"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=66 type=paragraph -->One of the great critics of Sham&#x301;kara philosophy was Jayanta Bhatta, the propounder Nya&#x301;ya Manjari philosophy.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..67"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=67 type=paragraph -->Ka&#x301;pil Sam&#x301;khya and Pa&#x301;ta&#x301;in&#x32D;jala Yoga<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..68"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=68 type=paragraph -->The common features of these two philosophies include the following:<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..69"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=69 type=paragraph -->(1) Both believe in the existence of many Purus&#x301;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..70"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=70 type=paragraph -->(2) Both believe that the universe is created by Prakrti for the satisfaction of these Purus&#x301;as. This is not logical as no bhoga or satisfaction is possible without the existence of mind. Purus&#x301;as do not have mind and they cannot be satisfied by the creation of the universe by Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..71"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=71 type=paragraph -->(3) Both believe that Prakrti is not within Purus&#x301;a but is a separate Entity. This is also illogical since Prakrti is only energy or the shakti of Purus&#x301;a, and like the dahika shakti or burning facility of agni or fire, it cannot be a separate entity. These philosophies are called Dvaetava&#x301;dii or dualistic because they believe in two separate entities of Purus&#x301;a and Prakrti.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..72"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=72 type=paragraph -->(4) In Sa&#x301;m&#x301;khya there is no god and thus it is called Niriishwarava&#x301;da or atheism, while Pa&#x301;tain&#x32D;jala philosophy believes in God but does not believe in Brahma. This is therefore called Seshvarava&#x301;da or theism.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..73"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=73 type=paragraph -->(5) Idol worship is supported by both these philosophies.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..75"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=75 type=paragraph -->(1) It believes that jiiva, jagat and Brahma are all ana&#x301;di. This only shows that jiiva and jagat do not need any further entity like Brahma and all the three alike are ana&#x301;di. This is unacceptable as this leaves no necessity for sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practice which is the Dharma or essential duty of every jiiva or human being. This also does not explain the reason for action and progress in the universe.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..76"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=76 type=paragraph -->(2) It believes in yajin&#x32D;as or sacrifices not as karma or action but as a for of worship. Yajin&#x32D;a means karma but in A&#x301;rya Sama&#x301;ja it means offering to agni or fire in a particular form. There is no rational meaning in performing such Yajin&#x32D;as.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..77"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=77 type=paragraph -->(3) They also believe in pralaya or dissolution which is also irrational, since jiiva and jagat are ana&#x301;di and as such there is no place for pralaya.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="2..79"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=79 type=paragraph -->(1) It believes in equality between human beings which is only theoretical and not possible in practice because no two individuals are alike, hence they cannot be equal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="2..80"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=80 type=paragraph -->(2) This faith finds its field in the exploitation of poverty and hence it can only thrive in poverty-stricken areas.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->For the existence of human beings in society the following fundamental factors are necessary &ndash; unity, social security and peace. What is actually required under each of these fundamental factors is discussed below.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->Unity among the members of any society or social structure is absolutely necessary, otherwise the structure will start disintegrating. Lack of unity among the members of society because of too much self-interest in the individual members, the formation of groups for economic or social advantage, and the lack of understanding of others&#146; acts not only bring about the downfall of society but also completely eradicate it from the face of the earth. Instances of so many groups and empires disappearing altogether are not rare in the little-known history of this world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->The problem, therefore, is the preservation of unity in society. If it is possible to enthuse the members of society with the following they will ensure unity in society &ndash; a common ideal, a caste-less society, collective social functions and no capital punishment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->It is so often heard that a particular country was never so united as during the war. This is entirely due to love of one&#146;s motherland, since all of the individuals had a common ideal and goal &ndash; to face the perils of wars. This common ideal is, however, a temporary phase that disappears when the dangers of war decrease. In our Ananda Marga the seed for a common ideal is sown from the very beginning of a child&#146;s life. At the age of five when children have acquired only a preliminary understanding of their surroundings, they are given the idea of Brahma or the Supreme Entity. The entire society of Ananda Marga is thus founded on a common ideal, the goal of becoming one with Brahma.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->Such an ideal will never disappear like the common ideal of facing the dangers of war, so the unity in a society founded on the ideal of Brahma will be everlasting. In our Ananda Marga, even in the economic field, there is a common ideal, as the whole property of the earth is the common property of all and is to be shared by all members of society. This is instilled in every member by the shloka (verse) recited at the commencement of every function held by the members of Ananda Marga:<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Love for all, the ideal that the whole of humanity is one family, and the utilization of all the property of the world as that of one unit, combined with the idea, given to those participating in the Na&#x301;makaran&#x301;a or naming ceremony of a child, that the social, psychic and spiritual upbringing of the child is the common responsibility of all &ndash; all these provide an undying common ideal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..9"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Caste-less Society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Caste is another important factor which brings disruption in society. The evils of the caste are nowhere better known than in India. For unity in society there should be no small groupings within society claiming unjustifiable economic and social privileges.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->In our Ananda Marga where &ldquo;love for all&rdquo; and &ldquo;humanity is one family&rdquo; are the guiding principles, and where individuals identify themselves as only jiivas or living beings, a caste-less society is the only society which can exist. In all the social functions in our Ananda Marga the prominent guides and workers are gurubhra&#x301;ta&#x301; or disciples of the same guru and not jatabha&#x301;i or children of the same caste, as is the prevalent custom. From the very beginning of a child&#146;s life, when their worldly identity is established at the time of na&#x301;makaran&#x301;a ceremony up to the shra&#x301;ddha kriya&#x301; or funeral ceremony [when] their worldly identity is lost, the persons participating in all the functions as guides and workers are only gurubha&#x301;i and may be from any number of castes.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->This along with the common goal of Brahma inspires the formation of a society where individuals identify themselves as living beings only, and not as belonging to any particular caste, creed or sect. Also, no family is prevented from taking part in our social functions because of the fault of a member of that family. With this the chance of the formation of a society of outcaste families is eliminated. In such a society where belonging to a particular group or section is not necessary for marriage, for learning the Vedas (scriptures) or for achieving anything, the formation of castes is not possible. In our Ananda Marga where the upbringing of every child is a combined responsibility, where the whole property of the universe is to be collectively utilized, and where there is no caste restriction for spiritual practises, the formation of castes for social, economic or spiritual reasons is not possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..13"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Collective Social Functions<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Many of the ills of society develop because people do not care to know other members of society. This ignorance of the condition and difficulties of others leads to intolerance and a lack of interest in the affairs of the other members of society. Common social functions bring different members of society together and are, therefore, a great unifying force. By performing certain functions collectively all the participants are engaged for some time in doing the same thing and brings about a feeling of unity and interest in others. In Ananda Marga such common social functions are specially encouraged. Milita Sna&#x301;na or collective bathing and dharmacakra or collective meditation are the basis for common social functions in the physical, psychic and spiritual fields. Common participation in such functions is a very unifying force and the participants of such functions will have no intolerance for each other; instead they will become more united. Such functions are therefore a great unifying force.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..15"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->No Capital Punishment<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Capital punishment brings about the deterioration in society and stops the further progress of the individuals on whom capital punishment is inflicted. Such individuals form sects or groups which become the lower or discarded groups of society and this gives rise to social disruption and discord. In our A&#x301;nanda Ma&#x301;rga capital punishment, whether social or physical, is not permitted anywhere. The only punishment in our Ma&#x301;rga is disallowing offenders from taking part in social functions for a fixed period. After the period is over the person starts taking in all social functions as usual. No dependents are to suffer the punishment inflicted on such individuals. This punishment leaves no mark on the offenders after the period of punishment as casting out of a family or even imprisonment does. The other punishment provided is to bring to the Ma&#x301;rga, that is, to bring to the right spiritual path, ten persons before they are allowed to attend the social functions. Punishments of this type are corrective and instead of retarding individual progress they give more chance to the individuals to correct their conduct and to engage in constructive pursuits during the period of their punishment. As these punishments do not leave a permanent mark on the individual or the family, they do not bring about discord and disunity among the members of the society. On the contrary, those undergoing such punishments are employing themselves in better pursuits than they would in their normal life by making efforts to show the right path to ten people. Thus they are not only improving themselves, but they are also making efforts to improve society by bringing about more social unity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..17"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Social Security<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->[The following section was also printed separately as part of &ldquo;Building a Healthy Society&rdquo; in The Awakening of  Women. This is the The Awakening of  Women, 1st edition, version.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Lack of security in society leads to the disintegration of society itself. Any society where security against injustice is not provided to people cannot exist long. Lack of security also increases because of indiscipline. If the laws of society are not obeyed social security will not be possible.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->The most important requisites for social security therefore, are that there should be no injustice and there should be strict discipline.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..21"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->No Injustice<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->If security in society is to be maintained there must be no economic, sexual or racial injustice. Economic injustice is usually the result of lack of appreciation of the dignity of labour. Occupational distinctions in society lead to economic injustice. In Ananda Marga it is laid down that it is better to serve as a sweeper and earn one&#146;s own living rather than be dependent on others for one&#146;s livelihood. If such importance is given to one&#146;s own earning and living many economic injustices will cease to exist. Economic injustice also comes about because of the hording instincts of human beings. People want property only for themselves. If only they felt that property should be shared by others also many economic injustices will not be committed. In our Marga all the property of the universe is considered to be the common property and has to be utilized jointly. This idea leaves hardly any scope for economic injustice.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Another form of injustice in society is discrimination based on sex. Instances of one sex being considered inferior to the other are very common. Women in a sizable area of the world are considered as the private property of men and are meant for their pleasure only. In many so-called advanced countries of the world of the world women do not have the right to vote in the general elections for the government of the country. In other countries women are considered unfit to take part in spiritual practices. In our Ananda Marga both men and women have equal responsibilities. In the manner prescribed for marriage in our Marga both men and women have equal responsibility. In our Ananda Marga there is no bar on women&#146;s entitlement to spiritual practices. Women and men are considered on the same footing and there is no question of men considering themselves superior to women.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..25"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=25 type=paragraph -->Members of a particular race who consider themselves superior to others also very frequently inflict injustices on other sections of society. The expulsion of the Jews from Germany by Hitler&#146;s so called superior Aryan race is a glaring example of racial injustice in society. In this country also, injustices on Harijans (outcastes) by so-called superior races have caused a tremendous disruption in society. To remove this type of social injustice the first step should be to do away with racial distinctions in society. In our Ananda Marga the first step that a person takes is to forget their race or sect and to no longer identify with their race, caste, or sect, regardless of whether their race was superior or inferior. Racial prejudices are very predominant in social functions. In collective functions members of all races, castes, or creeds should take part as equals. Community, caste, race and nation are often the main considerations in arranging marriages, etc. In our Ma&#x301;rga there are no such considerations: these petty differences among human beings are not given any importance. In our Ma&#x301;rga the seeds of an ideal humanity are sown from the very beginning of life and humanity as a whole is considered as one family belonging to the race of living beings. In such a society injustice due to economic, sexual or racial considerations will be unknown.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..26"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=26 type=paragraph -->Discipline<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..27"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=27 type=paragraph -->Throughout history the lack of discipline in a society has often been the main reason for the extinction of that society. The indiscipline of some members of society may make the peaceful existence of other members impossible. Discipline is therefore absolutely necessary for the preservation of society. Indiscipline in a society arises when some members think that the laws of society are wrong. If such thinking is confined to analysing and arguing only and does not lead to breaking the laws of society, there will be no indiscipline. In order to maintain discipline, the laws of society should be rational and capable of change from time to time according to society&#146;s development and then alone can discipline be preserved. In our Ma&#x301;rga anything which is irrational has no place. When reason is given so much importance and reasonable changes are accepted, all possibilities of dissatisfaction resulting in indiscipline are eliminated. At the same time in our Ma&#x301;rga reasoning and arguing can occur only after obedience: this ensures discipline in society. If after obeying the laws of society one feels they are wrong, one has every right to argue and have the laws changed, but argument before obedience leads to indiscipline. In a society such as our Ma&#x301;rga which is based on rationality alone and not on prejudices, there is no chance of indiscipline arising and undermining the social security of people.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..29"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=29 type=paragraph -->Psychic equilibrium is peace. We must consider what brings about psychic equilibrium and what disturbs it. Spiritual practices will lead to psychic equilibrium and belief in superstitions will disturb it. Hence for the preservation of peace spiritual practices and struggle against superstitions are necessary.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="3..31"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=31 type=paragraph -->Relief from duhkha or sorrow is the main desire of human beings, and without the fulfilment of this desire peace is not possible. Relief from sorrow is called nivrtti and is of two types: nivrtti and atyanatikii nivrtti. That which helps in attaining relief or nivrtti is called artha. But artha is only physical and psychic and gives only temporary relief. For everlasting freedom from duhkha, parama&#x301;rtha is the only remedy. Parama&#x301;rtha does not bring temporary relief, but everlasting freedom from duhkha. A&#x301;tyanatikii nivrtti can only be obtained by parama&#x301;rtha which relieves all duhkha &ndash; physical, mental and spiritual. This parama&#x301;rtha can only be attained by sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practices. Thus for maintaining peace psychic equilibrium is necessary, and for maintaining this equilibrium permanent freedom from all duhkha is necessary. Freedom from duhkha or a&#x301;tyantikii nivrtti can be attained only by parama&#x301;rtha, and parama&#x301;rtha can be achieved only by sa&#x301;dhana&#x301; or spiritual practices. In our Ma&#x301;rga spiritual practices begin when the child reaches the age of five. From the very beginning of a child&#146;s life he or she is initiated into spiritual practices. With the development of the child&#146;s life the spiritual practices also advance, bringing within their scope not only mental development but also bodily development. The spiritual practices of our Ma&#x301;rga do not teach one to forsake the world: they teach the proper use of all crude and subtle wealth. Our spiritual practices are a systematic and scientific method for physical, mental and spiritual progress by which permanent psychic equilibrium and thus everlasting peace is established.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..32"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=32 type=paragraph -->Fight against Superstitions<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..33"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=33 type=paragraph -->The svabha&#x301;va (nature) of the mind is to become like its object. Superstition of any kind &ndash; social, psychic, or spiritual &ndash; influences the mind to such an extent that the mind, due to its worries, leads a person into difficulty. The mental equilibrium of those believing in superstition is disturbed; and the result is not only do people lose their peace of mind, but they may also be led to perform some action which is detrimental to themselves. This only further strengthens their belief in superstitions: for any ordinary incident is magnified and attributed to some durlaks&#x301;ana or bad omen. It is the characteristic of the mind to become like its object. People who believe in this superstition see ghosts which are purely their own mental creation. If only these persons had the courage and mental strength to catch the ghost, they would very soon realize that their error was believing nothing to be something. Such superstitions have contaminated every field of existence. In the social sphere there is no dearth of superstitions. Witchcraft, the persecution of widows, etc., are curses in society only due to such superstitions. In the psychic sphere also there are deep-rooted superstitions like the belief in ghosts, bhu&#x301;ta, etc. Not only this, but superstitions of funeral ceremonies, etc., have also burdened even the progeny of a person. In the spiritual field, too, ignorant people have been forced to do so many things only because of their deep-rooted superstition of heaven and hell. All of these only disturb people&#146;s psychic equilibrium and bring discord and anxiety in society. For the preservation of peace, the fight against superstitions is of prime importance.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..34"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=34 type=paragraph -->In our Ananda Marga none of these superstitions have been given any place. In the social field, witchcraft has been discredited as only a psychic creation of some wicked person. Widows have been given the same status as unmarried girls with no restrictions on their dress, behaviour, lifestyle, etc. It is strictly prohibited to exercise any restraint on widows to make them adopt a particular pattern of life based on superstitions, or to prohibit their presence in social functions. The psychic superstitions of ghosts, funerals, etc. also do not find any place in our Ma&#x301;rga. Belief in ghosts is only imaginary, and the performance of a funeral ceremony by giving dana to Brahmins to take the departed soul across the Vaetarnii River is only a psychic delusion inculcated in people from their childhood. These ideas are not rational and therefore it is erroneous to believe in them.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..35"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=35 type=paragraph -->The spiritual superstition of heaven and hell and fear of God suppress people and destroy their psychic peace. Not infrequently, fear of such superstitions has had very undesirable reactions on people, totally disturbing their equanimity. In Ananda Marga, spiritual practices are based on rationality: our systematic and scientific method of spiritual practices leaves no place for fear and superstitions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..36"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=36 type=paragraph -->[The following section was also printed separately as part of &ldquo;Building a Healthy Society&rdquo; in The Awakening of  Women. This is the The Awakening of  Women, 1st edition, version.]<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="3..37"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=37 type=paragraph -->It can thus be seen that an ideal society will come into being only when there is unity, social security and peace. To provide for such a society our Marga has the Supreme Entity as a foundation and common ideal. Unity in our Marga is secured by evolving a caste-less society where capital punishment is prohibited and all people unitedly take part in social functions irrespective of caste, creed, or race. In such a society social injustices due to occupational distinctions, sex or race are not possible. Our Marga further strengthens society by refuting and discouraging all superstitions, whether social, psychic or spiritual, and by providing a systematic and scientific method of spiritual practices and codes for physical, mental and spiritual progress and advancement in an ideal society.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="4..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Primitive human beings had no society and the whole set-up was individualistic. Even the concept of family was absent. Life was brute and non-intellectual. Nature was the direct abode and physical strength ruled the day. The strong enjoyed at the cost of the weak, who had to surrender before the voracity of the physical giants. However, the sense of acquisition had not developed in them, and they worked manually, and there was no intellectual exploitation in that age. Though life was brute, it was not brutal.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->If shu&#x301;dras be defined as those who live by manual work or service, this primary stage of nature&#146;s brute laws could be named the Shu&#x301;dra Age, because all were manual workers. The reliance on physical power gradually led a chosen few to lead the rest by the strength of their muscles. They were the leaders of the shu&#x301;dras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->Simultaneously, the family developed. And the above-mentioned leadership, once based upon the superiority of muscles, passed on from the father to the son or from the mother to the daughter, partly due to the momentum of fear and power commanded, and partly because of superiority of animalic breed.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->Superior strength requires the assistance of other superior strengths in the neighbourhood for all to maintain their status. Generally such superior neighbours belonged to the same parenthood or were related through matrimonial ties. Gradually the leaders by physical might started a well-knit group, and ultimately formed a class known as the ks&#x301;atriyas. The age when the power to rule, or supremacy in arms, was the only material factor that mattered, was the Ks&#x301;atriya Age. The leaders of the Ks&#x301;atriya Age were Herculean, huge giants who depended on the supremacy of personal valour and might, making little or no use of intellect.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->With the development of intellect and skill as a result of physical and psychic clash, physical strength had to lose its dignified position according to the growing intensity of intellectual demand in the ks&#x301;atriya-dominated society. One had also to develop skill in the use of arms, and even for this the physical giant had to sit at the feet of some physically-common men to learn the use of arms and strategy. A reference to the mythology of any ancient culture reveals numberless instances where the hero of the day had to acquire specific knowledge from teachers. Subsequently this learning was not confined to the use of arms only but extended to other spheres, such as battle-craft, medicine and forms of organization and administration, so essential for ruling any society. Thus the dependence on superior intellect increased day by day, and in the course of time real power passed into the hands of such intellectuals. These intellectuals, as the word implies, justified their existence on intellect only, performed no labour themselves, and were parasites in the sense that they exploited the energy put in by others in society. This age of domination by intellectual parasites can be called the Vipra Age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..6"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Even though the vipras came into the forefront by the use of their marked intellect, it is more difficult than in the case of the ks&#x301;atriyas to maintain a hereditary superiority of intellect. In an effort to maintain power amongst the limited few, they actively tried and prevented others from acquiring the use of the intellect by imposing superstitions and rituals, faiths and beliefs, and even introducing irrational ideas (the caste system of Hindu society is an example) through an appeal to the sentiments of the mass (who collectively cannot be called intellectual). This was the phase of human society in the Middle Ages in the greater part of the world.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->The continued exploitation by one section of society resulted in the necessity for the collection and transfer of consumable goods. Even otherwise, need was felt very badly for the transport of food and other necessities of life from surplus parts to deficit parts. Also, in the case of clan conflicts, the result of the resources of one community or class versus another gained importance. This aspect was confined not only to the producers but also to those handling the goods at various stages up to the point of consumption. These people became known as vaeshyas, and ingenuity and summed-up production began to enjoy supremacy and importance, till an age was reached when this aspect of life became the most important factor. These vaeshyas, therefore, began to enjoy a position of supremacy, and the age dominated by this class is said to be the Age of Vaeshyas.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Individualistic or laissez-faire sense develops [into] capitalism when the means of production pass into the hands of a few who are more interested in personal exploitation. At this stage it can be said that the instinct of acquisition has developed tremendously. The thirst for acquisition instigated them to [develop] the psychology of complete exploitation of the human race also, and this resulted in a class by itself. In the race for greed and acquisition not all could survive, and only a few remained to dominate the society in general and the economic set-up in particular by their capital. The great majority were either duped into believing that they would be allowed to share such resources, or were neglected and left uncared-for for want of strength and did not survive the race. Such people in society ultimately occupy the place of exploited slaves of the capitalists. They are slaves because they have no option other than to serve the capitalists as labourers to earn the means of subsistence.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->We may recall the definition of shu&#x301;dras as persons who live by manual work or labour hard for their livelihood. This age of capitalism is the age when the large majority of society turn into such shu&#x301;dras. This develops into dejection and dissatisfaction on a large scale because of an internal clash in the mind, because the psychology of society is essentially dynamic in nature and the mind itself exists as a result of constant clash. These conditions are necessary and sufficient for labourers, whether manual or mental, to organize and stand up against the unnatural impositions in life. This may be termed &ldquo;shu&#x301;dra revolution&rdquo;. The leaders of this revolution, also, are people physically and mentally better-equipped and more capable essentially of overthrowing the capitalistic structure by force. In other words, they are also ks&#x301;atriyas. So, after a period of chaos and catastrophe, once more the same cycle &ndash; Shu&#x301;dra Age to Ks&#x301;atriya to Vipra, and so on &ndash; recommences.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..10"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->In this cycle of civilization one age changes into another. This gradual change should be called &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; or kra&#x301;nti. The period of transition from one age to another can be said to be yuga sam&#x301;kra&#x301;nti &ndash; &ldquo;transitional age&rdquo;. One complete cycle from the Shu&#x301;dra Age evolving through the other [three] ages is called parikra&#x301;nti.<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.4.fn2"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#4.fn2">2</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> <!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Sometimes the social cycle (sama&#x301;ja cakra) is reversed by the application of physical or psychic force by a group of people inspired by a negative theory. Such a change is, therefore, counter-evolution &ndash; that is, against the cycle of civilization. This may be termed vikra&#x301;nti. But if this reversal of the social cycle takes place, due to political pressure or any other brute force, within a short span of time, the change thus brought about is prativiplava, or &ldquo;counter-revolution&rdquo;. It is just like the negative pratisain&#x32D;cara of Brahma Cakra. Thus the progress and march of civilization can be represented as points of position and as the speed of approaching Purus&#x301;ottama, respectively, by a collective body in Brahma Cakra.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The world is a transitory phase or changing phenomenon within the scope of the Cosmic Mind. It is going in eternal motion, and such a motion is the law of nature and the law of life. Stagnancy means death. Hence no power can check the social cycle of evolution. Any force, external or internal, can only retard or accelerate the speed of transition, but cannot prevent it from moving. Therefore progressive humanity should cast off all skeletons of the past. Human beings should go on accelerating the speed of progress for the good of humanity in general.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->Those spiritual revolutionaries who work to achieve such progressive changes for human elevation on a well-thought, pre-planned basis, whether in the physical, metaphysical or spiritual sphere, by adhering to the principles of Yama and Niyama, are sadvipras.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..14"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->The principles of Yama are ahim&#x301;sa&#x301;, satya, asteya, aparigraha and Brahmacarya. Ahim&#x301;sa&#x301; means not causing suffering to any harmless creature through thought, word or deed. Satya denotes action of mind or use of words with the object of helping others in the real sense. It has no relative application. Asteya means non-stealing, and this should not be confined to physical action but [extended] to the action of the mind as well. All actions have their origin in the mind, hence the correct sense of asteya is &ldquo;to give up the desire of acquiring what is not rightly one&#146;s own&rdquo;. Aparigraha involves the non-acceptance of such amenities and comforts of life as are superfluous for the preservation of the physical existence. And the spirit of Brahmacarya is to experience His presence and authority in each and every physical and psychic objectivity. This occurs when the unit mind resonates with Cosmic will.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->The five rules of Niyama are shaoca, santos&#x301;a, tapah, sva&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya and Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na. Shaoca means purity of both physical and mental bodies. Mental purity is attained by benevolent deeds, charity, or other dutiful acts. Santos&#x301;a means &ldquo;contentment&rdquo;. It implies accepting ungrudgingly and without a complaint the out-turn of the services rendered by one&#146;s own physical or mental labour. Tapah means efforts to reach the goal despite such efforts being associated with physical discomforts. Sva&#x301;dhya&#x301;ya means study of the scriptures or other books of learning and assimilating their spirit. The whole universe is guided by the Supreme Entity, and nothing that one does or can do is without His specific command. Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na is an auto-suggestion of the idea that each and every unit is an instrument in the hands of the Almighty and is a mere spark of that supreme fire. Iishvara pran&#x301;idha&#x301;na also implies implicit faith in Him irrespective of whether one lives in momentary happiness or sorrow, prosperity or adversity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Only those who by their nature adhere to the above ten commands in their normal and spiritual conduct are sadvipras. Such a morally- and spiritually-equipped sadvipra has to perform a fundamental and vital duty to society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..17"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->In the cycle of social evolution, during each age before it is succeeded by another age, one particular class enjoys the position of domination and superiority. Such a class, while in political power, has every chance of exploiting the society. History has shown that this is not mere chance, but has been repeating itself. Now the duty of the sadvipra is to see that the dominating class does not take recourse to exploitation. The four classes &ndash; shu&#x301;dra, the toiling class; ks&#x301;atriya, the warrior class; vipra, the intellectual class; and vaeshya, the capitalist class &ndash; have remained well defined in the cycle of human civilization, and the gradual domination and decline of each class shall continue to occur in this cycle.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->Life is a dynamic principle, and the movement of the sama&#x301;ja cakra continues without any break or pause. The cycle cannot be checked, as stagnation implies death. The function of a sadvipra shall, therefore, be to see that the dominating or the ruling classes do not have any scope for exploitation. The moment one class turn into exploiters, the life of the majority becomes miserable; a few enjoy at the cost of many whose lot is only to suffer. More than that, in such a state of society both the few and the many get degenerated. The few (exploiters) degenerate themselves due to [an] excess of physical enjoyments and the many (exploited) cannot elevate themselves, because all their energy is taken up in mundane problems and all their mental waves are always tending to attain psycho-physical parallelism, thus getting day by day cruder. Hence, for the physical, mental and spiritual welfare of the administrator and the administered of the society as a whole, it is essential that no one be given any scope to exploit the rest of the society.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="4..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->Sadvipras are not inactive witnesses. They are active participants to see that no person or class exploits the rest. For this they may have to resort even to physical violence, because the sadvipras will have to strike at the source of the power [of the class] which is tending to become the exploiter. In case the ks&#x301;atriya class are becoming exploiters, the sadvipras may have to resort to physical force, and in an age where the intellectual or vipra class are dominating, they will have to bring about a revolution in the intellectual field. In case the vaeshyas are dominating, the sadvipras may have to contest and win elections, because the vaeshya class rules by democracy, and the democratic set-up enables them to accumulate undue gains.<!-- /block --></p>

<a name="5..1"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=1 type=paragraph -->Spirituality is not a utopian ideal but a practical philosophy which can be practised and realized in day-to-day life, however mundane it be. Spirituality stands for evolution and elevation, and not for superstition in action or pessimism. All fissiparous tendencies and group or clan philosophies which tend to create the shackles of narrow-mindedness are in no way connected with spirituality and should be discouraged. That which leads to broadness of unison alone should be accepted. Spiritual philosophy does not recognize any distinctions and differentiations unnaturally made between one human being and another, and stands for universal fraternity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..2"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=2 type=paragraph -->In the present environment many fissiparous tendencies are working to divide humanity into mutually-belligerent groups. Spirituality must inculcate sense in human psychology, and develop a natural affinity amongst this species of the creation. The approach of spirituality should be psychological and rational, and should offer a touching appeal to the deepest psychic sentiments of human beings. Human beings should appreciate by a rational analysis their relationship with the Cosmic Entity and recognize the most benevolent kindness of the most beloved Entity. Spirituality should lead human beings to the one Cosmic truth from which they have derived their selves,<!-- fn --><a name="Ref.5.fn1"></a><sup>(<b><a href="#5.fn1">1</a></b>)</sup><!-- /fn --> and which is the ultimate destiny. That ultimate and absolute ideal is the Cosmic ideal &ndash; an ideal beyond the scope of time, place and person. It is the Absolute, without and beyond relativity. It stands with its own lustre for all times and for every factor of the Cosmos, may it be a human being or a less-evolved animal. The Cosmic ideal alone can be the unifying force which shall strengthen humanity to smash the bondages and abolish all narrow domestic walls of fissiparous tendencies.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..3"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=3 type=paragraph -->All the sentiment-provoking ideas should be firmly opposed. This does not mean an attack on those sentiments, traditions and habits which are innate in human beings and which do not hamper their Cosmic development. For example, the movement for uniformity in dress for all people will be but a ridiculous and irrational approach. Different selections of dress are the result of climatic factors and corporal necessities. Moreover, dissimilarity in dress is not detrimental to world fraternity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..4"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=4 type=paragraph -->There will also be many zonal or regional differences as regards other traditions and customs. These should be appreciated and encouraged for the indigenous development of society. But under no circumstances should there be a compromise in principle or yielding to tendencies detrimental to the inculcation of Cosmic sentiment.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..5"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=5 type=paragraph -->The inspiration of Cosmic sentiment will depend upon certain objective physical problems which must be solved on a collective humanitarian basis. In the relative objective sphere the following few fundamental problems must be attempted at [tackled] and solved. These are: <ol> <li>Common philosophy of life <li>Same constitutional structure <li>Common penal code <li>Availability (production, supply, purchasing capacity) of the minimum essentialities of life </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..6"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=6 type=paragraph -->Common Philosophy of Life<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..7"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=7 type=paragraph -->A common philosophy of life demands a clear conception in the human mind that the development of the human personality means an evolution in all the three spheres &ndash; physical, metaphysical or mental, and spiritual. Some objective materialist thinkers have held the opinion that spirituality is a utopian philosophy, bereft of practicalities pertaining to actual problems of life. Other thinkers conceived it as a wise and intelligent device to befool the toiling mass. But the logical analysis given above must have clarified to thoughtful readers that spirituality is the summum bonum of life in all its aspects.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..8"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=8 type=paragraph -->Those who think dharma to be an individual&#146;s concern conceive it in a very narrow sense. Dharma leads to Cosmic unity, inculcating in the individual mind Cosmic idealism. Religion, in the sense of dharma, is the unifying force in humanity. Moreover, spirituality provides a human being and humanity at large with that subtle and tremendous power with which no other power can be compared. Therefore, with spirituality as the base, a rational philosophy should be evolved to deal with the physical, psychological and socio-philosophical problems of the day. The complete rational theory dealing with all three phases &ndash; spiritual, mental and physical &ndash; of human development shall be a philosophy common to humanity in general. This will be evolutionary and ever-progressing. Of course, small details may vary according to the relative environment of the age.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..9"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=9 type=paragraph -->Nationalism is fast getting out of date. Not only has national sentiment given humanity rude shocks in the world wars of the present century, but the social and cultural blending of the present age also shows the domination of cosmopolitanism in world affairs. Vested interests, however, continue to cause certain fissiparous tendencies. There are some who fear loss of their economic or political domination and are directly responsible for these detrimental or retrograde reactions.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..10"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=10 type=paragraph -->Same Constitutional Structure<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..11"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=11 type=paragraph -->Despite these obstacles, a social blending of humanity is in progress and needs a common constitutional structure to be evolved to cement the solidarity of the world. A world government is also very essential for exercising full control in certain spheres; for example, there should be only one world militia.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..12"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=12 type=paragraph -->The world government should form certain autonomous units, not necessarily national (based on problems of education, food supply, flood control, public sentiment), which should look after mundane and supramundane problems. The boundaries of these units may be readjusted to suit any change in the environment &ndash; for instance, development in the techniques of communication. Development in the means of communication brings the different remote parts of the world nearer, and the world, therefore, grows smaller. With this well-developed swifter means of communication, units with bigger areas can work smoothly and efficiently.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..13"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=13 type=paragraph -->A language must also be evolved as the lingua franca of the world. (At present English is most suitable for the purpose and no national sentiment should be encouraged to go against it.) But the local languages must be encouraged to help the indigenous literatures develop and contribute towards world progress, and thereby contribute to the common brotherhood of humanity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..14"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=14 type=paragraph -->Common Penal Code<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..15"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=15 type=paragraph -->A common penal code must be evolved. Legislation must be progressive and capable of gradual adjustment with the prevalent conditions. Any theory which does not hold a parallelism with the ever-changing conditions of time, place and person, is sure to decay and be lost in oblivion. Hence, there must be a never-ending effort for amendment with a view to rectification.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..16"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=16 type=paragraph -->Crimes are acts forbidden by the law of the government concerned, and virtue and vice (pun&#x301;ya and pa&#x301;pa) are the outcome of traditional customs. The sentiments of the lawmakers are very much influenced by the prevalent traditions and customs regarding the concept of virtue and vice of the locality or of the people concerned. The sense of crime, therefore, has a parallelism with the concept of virtue and vice. The idea of virtue and vice is different in different countries. The aspirants of world fraternity should try to lessen the difference and reduce the gap amongst cardinal, moral and human laws. All those actions which help in the growth of the spiritual, mental and physical aspects of human beings in general should come under the category of virtuous deeds, and those actions which go against humanity in its spiritual, mental and physical development must come under &ldquo;vice&rdquo;. This conception of virtue and vice applies commonly to humanity in general.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..17"></a><p class="Para_Minor_Heading"><!-- block a=17 type=paragraph -->Minimum Essentialities of Life<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..18"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=18 type=paragraph -->The availability of the minimum essentialities of life plays a vital part not only in achieving world brotherhood, but also in the development of human personality. This should be tackled on a world footing, and should be based on certain fundamental presumptions. Every human being has certain minimum requirements which he or she must be guaranteed. Guaranteed availability of foodstuff, clothing, medical assistance and housing accommodation should be arranged so that human beings may be able to utilize their surplus energy (energy up till now engaged in procuring the essentialities of life) in subtler pursuits. Side by side, there should be sufficient scope for providing other amenities of the progressive age. To fulfil the above responsibilities, enough purchasing capacity should be created.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..19"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=19 type=paragraph -->If the supply of requirements be guaranteed without any conditions of personal skill and labour, the individual may develop the psychology of idleness. The minimum requirements of every person are the same, but diversity is also the nature of creation. Special amenities should, therefore, be provided so that the diversity in skill and intelligence is fully utilized, and talent is encouraged to contribute its best towards human development. It will, therefore, be necessary to make provision for special emoluments which can cater for special amenities of life according to the age and time. But at the same time, there should be a constant effort to reduce the gap between the amount of special emoluments and the bare minimum requirements of the average individual. The guaranteed supply of minimum requirements must be liberalized by increasing the provision of special amenities pertaining to the age and also, simultaneously, by bringing about a decrease in the provision of special emoluments given to the few. This never-ending effort of proper economic adjustment must ceaselessly continue at all times with a view to assisting the spiritual, mental and physical evolution of human beings, and to let humanity develop a Cosmic sentiment for a Cosmic ideal and world fraternity.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..20"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=20 type=paragraph -->In this socio-economic set-up people are at full liberty in the spiritual and mental spheres. This is possible because the spiritual and psychic entities for which people can aspire are themselves unlimited, and the extent of possession in this sphere does not hamper the progress of others in their quests. But the supply in the physical sphere is limited, and hence any effort for disproportionate or unrestricted acquisition of physical objects has every possibility of creating a vast majority of have-not&#146;s, and thus hampering the spiritual, mental and physical growth of the larger majority. So, while dealing with the problem of individual liberty, it must be kept in view that individual liberty in the physical sphere must not be allowed to cross a limit whereat it is instrumental in hampering the development of the complete personality of human beings; and, at the same time, must not be so drastically curtailed that the spiritual, mental and physical growths of human beings are hampered.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..21"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=21 type=paragraph -->Thus, the social philosophy of Ananda Marga advocates the development of the integrated personality of the individual, and also the establishment of world fraternity, inculcating in human psychology a Cosmic sentiment. The Marga advocates progressive utilization of mundane and supramundane factors of the Cosmos. The society needs a stir for life, vigour and progress, and for this Ananda Marga advocates the Progressive Utilization Theory (Prout), meaning thereby progressive utilization of all factors. Those who support this principle may be termed &ldquo;Proutists&rdquo;.<!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..22"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=22 type=paragraph -->The principles of Prout depend upon the following fundamental factors: <ol> <li>No individual should be allowed to accumulate any physical wealth without the clear permission or approval of the collective body. <li>There should be maximum utilization and rational distribution of all mundane, supramundane and spiritual potentialities of the universe. <li>There should be maximum utilization of physical, metaphysical and spiritual potentialities of unit and collective bodies of human society. <li>There should be a proper adjustment amongst these physical, metaphysical, mundane, supramundane and spiritual utilizations. <li>The method of utilization should vary in accordance with changes in time, space and person, and the utilization should be of progressive nature. </ol><!-- /block --></p>
<a name="5..23"></a><p class="Para_Indent"><!-- block a=23 type=paragraph -->Hence, ours is a Progressive Utilization Theory (Prout).<!-- /block --></p>
